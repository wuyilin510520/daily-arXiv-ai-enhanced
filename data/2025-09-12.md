*Davide Caffagni,Sara Sarto,Marcella Cornia,Lorenzo Baraldi,Rita Cucchiara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReT-2 is a unified multimodal retrieval model that handles both image and text queries to search across multimodal document collections, achieving state-of-the-art performance with improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing retrieval methods are limited to single-modality queries or documents and require task-specific fine-tuning, failing to address the complexity of emerging multimodal retrieval tasks.

Method: Uses multi-layer representations and a recurrent Transformer architecture with LSTM-inspired gating mechanisms to dynamically integrate information across layers and modalities, capturing fine-grained visual and textual details.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on M2KR and M-BEIR benchmarks across different retrieval configurations, with faster inference and reduced memory usage. Improves downstream performance when integrated into retrieval-augmented generation pipelines.

Conclusion: ReT-2 provides an effective unified solution for multimodal retrieval that supports complex queries and documents while offering efficiency advantages over previous approaches.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of multimodal retrieval and its application in
LLMs and multimodal LLMs, increasingly complex retrieval tasks have emerged.
Existing methods predominantly rely on task-specific fine-tuning of
vision-language models and are limited to single-modality queries or documents.
In this paper, we propose ReT-2, a unified retrieval model that supports
multimodal queries, composed of both images and text, and searches across
multimodal document collections where text and images coexist. ReT-2 leverages
multi-layer representations and a recurrent Transformer architecture with
LSTM-inspired gating mechanisms to dynamically integrate information across
layers and modalities, capturing fine-grained visual and textual details. We
evaluate ReT-2 on the challenging M2KR and M-BEIR benchmarks across different
retrieval configurations. Results demonstrate that ReT-2 consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance across diverse settings, while offering faster
inference and reduced memory usage compared to prior approaches. When
integrated into retrieval-augmented generation pipelines, ReT-2 also improves
downstream performance on Encyclopedic-VQA and InfoSeek datasets. Our source

### [2] [Diffusion-Based Action Recognition Generalizes to Untrained Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08908)
*Rogerio Guimaraes,Frank Xiao,Pietro Perona,Markus Marks*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Using Vision Diffusion Model features with transformer aggregation achieves state-of-the-art human-like action recognition across species, viewpoints, and contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans can recognize actions despite large variations in context and viewpoint, but current deep learning models struggle with such generalization.

Method: Proposes using features from a Vision Diffusion Model (VDM) aggregated via transformer, with conditioning on earlier timesteps to emphasize semantic over pixel-level information.

Result: Sets new state-of-the-art across three generalization benchmarks: cross-species action classification, different viewing angles, and different recording contexts.

Conclusion: The approach brings machine action recognition closer to human-like robustness by leveraging diffusion model features for better generalization.

Abstract: Humans can recognize the same actions despite large context and viewpoint
variations, such as differences between species (walking in spiders vs.
horses), viewpoints (egocentric vs. third-person), and contexts (real life vs
movies). Current deep learning models struggle with such generalization. We
propose using features generated by a Vision Diffusion Model (VDM), aggregated
via a transformer, to achieve human-like action recognition across these
challenging conditions. We find that generalization is enhanced by the use of a
model conditioned on earlier timesteps of the diffusion process to highlight
semantic information over pixel level details in the extracted features. We
experimentally explore the generalization properties of our approach in
classifying actions across animal species, across different viewing angles, and
different recording contexts. Our model sets a new state-of-the-art across all
three generalization benchmarks, bringing machine action recognition closer to
human-like robustness. Project page:

TL;DR: PromptGuard is a modular prompting framework with VulnGuard Prompt that prevents LLMs from generating harmful content using contrastive learning and multi-objective optimization, achieving 25-30% harm reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety approaches fail to proactively prevent harmful outputs from LLMs that could affect vulnerable populations like LGBTQ+ individuals and marginalized communities.

Method: Uses VulnGuard Prompt - a hybrid technique combining few-shot examples from GitHub, ethical chain-of-thought reasoning, adaptive role-prompting, and multi-objective optimization with formal proofs.

Result: Demonstrates 25-30% analytical harm reduction through entropy bounds and Pareto optimality, with comprehensive mathematical formalization and convergence proofs.

Conclusion: PromptGuard provides a systematic framework for real-time harm prevention in LLMs with strong theoretical foundations for empirical research.

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world applications
poses unprecedented risks of generating harmful, biased, or misleading
information to vulnerable populations including LGBTQ+ individuals, single
parents, and marginalized communities. While existing safety approaches rely on
post-hoc filtering or generic alignment techniques, they fail to proactively
prevent harmful outputs at the generation source. This paper introduces
PromptGuard, a novel modular prompting framework with our breakthrough
contribution: VulnGuard Prompt, a hybrid technique that prevents harmful
information generation using real-world data-driven contrastive learning.
VulnGuard integrates few-shot examples from curated GitHub repositories,
ethical chain-of-thought reasoning, and adaptive role-prompting to create
population-specific protective barriers. Our framework employs theoretical
multi-objective optimization with formal proofs demonstrating 25-30% analytical
harm reduction through entropy bounds and Pareto optimality. PromptGuard
orchestrates six core modules: Input Classification, VulnGuard Prompting,
Ethical Principles Integration, External Tool Interaction, Output Validation,
and User-System Interaction, creating an intelligent expert system for
real-time harm prevention. We provide comprehensive mathematical formalization
including convergence proofs, vulnerability analysis using information theory,
and theoretical validation framework using GitHub-sourced datasets,
establishing mathematical foundations for systematic empirical research.

*Waqar Ahmad,Evan Murphy,Vladimir A. Krylov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Beta-SOD: A Beta mixture similarity-based outlier detection framework for robust object re-identification that handles label noise by modeling pairwise similarity distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object re-identification methods are highly sensitive to label noise, which causes significant performance degradation. Existing approaches struggle with noisy training data.

Method: Reframes Re-ID as supervised image similarity using Siamese networks. Introduces Beta-SOD framework that models cosine similarity distributions with two-component Beta mixture model for outlier detection. Combines binary cross-entropy, contrastive, and cosine embedding losses.

Result: Superior performance on person Re-ID (CUHK03, Market-1501) and vehicle Re-ID (VeRi-776) across 10-30% noise levels. Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in noisy scenarios.

Conclusion: Beta-SOD provides robust and broadly applicable solution for noisy Re-ID tasks, with proven effectiveness through statistical modeling of pairwise relationships and novel identifiability guarantees.

Abstract: Object re-identification (Re-ID) methods are highly sensitive to label noise,
which typically leads to significant performance degradation. We address this
challenge by reframing Re-ID as a supervised image similarity task and adopting
a Siamese network architecture trained to capture discriminative pairwise
relationships. Central to our approach is a novel statistical outlier detection
(OD) framework, termed Beta-SOD (Beta mixture Similarity-based Outlier
Detection), which models the distribution of cosine similarities between
embedding pairs using a two-component Beta distribution mixture model. We
establish a novel identifiability result for mixtures of two Beta
distributions, ensuring that our learning task is well-posed.The proposed OD
step complements the Re-ID architecture combining binary cross-entropy,
contrastive, and cosine embedding losses that jointly optimize feature-level
similarity learning.We demonstrate the effectiveness of Beta-SOD in de-noising
and Re-ID tasks for person Re-ID, on CUHK03 and Market-1501 datasets, and
vehicle Re-ID, on VeRi-776 dataset. Our method shows superior performance
compared to the state-of-the-art methods across various noise levels (10-30\%),
demonstrating both robustness and broad applicability in noisy Re-ID scenarios.

*Nan Mu,Ruiqi Song,Zhihui Xu,Jingfeng Jiang,Chen Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SFD-Mamba2Net improves coronary artery segmentation and stenosis detection in ICA images using multi-scale structural priors, state-space modeling, and frequency-domain enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICA images have low contrast, high noise, and complex vascular structures that challenge existing segmentation and detection methods for CAD diagnosis.

Method: End-to-end framework with CASE module for multi-scale structural enhancement in encoder and PHFP module using wavelet decomposition for high-frequency detail refinement in decoder.

Result: Outperformed state-of-the-art methods across eight segmentation metrics and achieved highest true positive rate and positive predictive value in stenosis detection.

Conclusion: The proposed SFD-Mamba2Net framework effectively addresses challenges in ICA image analysis and demonstrates superior performance for coronary artery segmentation and stenosis detection.

Abstract: Background: Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is one of the leading causes of
death worldwide. Invasive Coronary Angiography (ICA), regarded as the gold
standard for CAD diagnosis, necessitates precise vessel segmentation and
stenosis detection. However, ICA images are typically characterized by low
contrast, high noise levels, and complex, fine-grained vascular structures,
which pose significant challenges to the clinical adoption of existing
segmentation and detection methods. Objective: This study aims to improve the
accuracy of coronary artery segmentation and stenosis detection in ICA images
by integrating multi-scale structural priors, state-space-based long-range
dependency modeling, and frequency-domain detail enhancement strategies.
Methods: We propose SFD-Mamba2Net, an end-to-end framework tailored for
ICA-based vascular segmentation and stenosis detection. In the encoder, a
Curvature-Aware Structural Enhancement (CASE) module is embedded to leverage
multi-scale responses for highlighting slender tubular vascular structures,
suppressing background interference, and directing attention toward vascular
regions. In the decoder, we introduce a Progressive High-Frequency Perception
(PHFP) module that employs multi-level wavelet decomposition to progressively
refine high-frequency details while integrating low-frequency global
structures. Results and Conclusions: SFD-Mamba2Net consistently outperformed
state-of-the-art methods across eight segmentation metrics, and achieved the
highest true positive rate and positive predictive value in stenosis detection.

### [6] [Live(r) Die: Predicting Survival in Colorectal Liver Metastasis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08935)
*Muhammad Alberb,Helen Cheung,Anne Martel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Automated MRI-based framework for predicting surgical outcomes in colorectal liver metastasis using segmentation and radiomics pipelines, achieving 10%+ improvement over existing biomarkers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current prognostic models for colorectal liver metastasis lack predictive power, especially for multifocal cases, and rely on limited clinical/molecular features.

Method: Two-pipeline framework: 1) Segmentation pipeline using SAMONAI (zero-shot 3D prompt propagation) to segment liver/tumors/spleen from partially annotated MRI data, 2) Radiomics pipeline using SurvAMINN (autoencoder-based multiple instance neural network) for survival prediction from extracted tumor features.

Result: Framework outperforms existing clinical and genomic biomarkers with C-index improvement exceeding 10% on institutional dataset of 227 patients.

Conclusion: Integration of automated segmentation and radiomics-based survival analysis provides accurate, annotation-efficient, and interpretable outcome prediction for colorectal liver metastasis.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer frequently metastasizes to the liver, significantly
reducing long-term survival. While surgical resection is the only potentially
curative treatment for colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM), patient outcomes
vary widely depending on tumor characteristics along with clinical and genomic
factors. Current prognostic models, often based on limited clinical or
molecular features, lack sufficient predictive power, especially in multifocal
CRLM cases. We present a fully automated framework for surgical outcome
prediction from pre- and post-contrast MRI acquired before surgery. Our
framework consists of a segmentation pipeline and a radiomics pipeline. The
segmentation pipeline learns to segment the liver, tumors, and spleen from
partially annotated data by leveraging promptable foundation models to complete
missing labels. Also, we propose SAMONAI, a novel zero-shot 3D prompt
propagation algorithm that leverages the Segment Anything Model to segment 3D
regions of interest from a single point prompt, significantly improving our
segmentation pipeline's accuracy and efficiency. The predicted pre- and
post-contrast segmentations are then fed into our radiomics pipeline, which
extracts features from each tumor and predicts survival using SurvAMINN, a
novel autoencoder-based multiple instance neural network for survival analysis.
SurvAMINN jointly learns dimensionality reduction and hazard prediction from
right-censored survival data, focusing on the most aggressive tumors. Extensive
evaluation on an institutional dataset comprising 227 patients demonstrates
that our framework surpasses existing clinical and genomic biomarkers,
delivering a C-index improvement exceeding 10%. Our results demonstrate the
potential of integrating automated segmentation algorithms and radiomics-based
survival analysis to deliver accurate, annotation-efficient, and interpretable
outcome prediction in CRLM.

### [7] [Discovering Divergent Representations between Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08940)
*Lisa Dunlap,Joseph E. Gonzalez,Trevor Darrell,Fabian Caba Heilbron,Josef Sivic,Bryan Russell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CompCon is an evolutionary search algorithm that discovers visual attribute differences between text-to-image models and identifies prompt concepts that trigger these divergences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand when and how visual representations learned by different generative models diverge, specifically discovering visual attributes that appear in one model's outputs but not another's, along with the prompt types that cause these differences.

Method: Introduced CompCon, an evolutionary search algorithm that discovers visual attributes more prevalent in one model's output than another, and uncovers prompt concepts linked to these visual differences. Created ID2 dataset with 60 input-dependent differences for evaluation.

Result: Successfully compared popular text-to-image models, finding divergent representations such as PixArt depicting loneliness prompts with wet streets and Stable Diffusion 3.5 depicting African American people in media professions. Outperformed LLM- and VLM-powered baselines.

Conclusion: CompCon effectively identifies and analyzes visual representation divergences between text-to-image models, providing insights into how different models interpret and visualize similar prompts differently.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate when and how visual representations learned by
two different generative models diverge. Given two text-to-image models, our
goal is to discover visual attributes that appear in images generated by one
model but not the other, along with the types of prompts that trigger these
attribute differences. For example, "flames" might appear in one model's
outputs when given prompts expressing strong emotions, while the other model
does not produce this attribute given the same prompts. We introduce CompCon
(Comparing Concepts), an evolutionary search algorithm that discovers visual
attributes more prevalent in one model's output than the other, and uncovers
the prompt concepts linked to these visual differences. To evaluate CompCon's
ability to find diverging representations, we create an automated data
generation pipeline to produce ID2, a dataset of 60 input-dependent
differences, and compare our approach to several LLM- and VLM-powered
baselines. Finally, we use CompCon to compare popular text-to-image models,
finding divergent representations such as how PixArt depicts prompts mentioning
loneliness with wet streets and Stable Diffusion 3.5 depicts African American
people in media professions. Code at: https://github.com/adobe-research/CompCon

### [8] [An U-Net-Based Deep Neural Network for Cloud Shadow and Sun-Glint Correction of Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08949)
*Yibin Wang,Wondimagegn Beshah,Padmanava Dash,Haifeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A machine learning approach using U-Net to detect and correct cloud shadows and sun glint in UAS imagery for water quality monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UAS imagery is often affected by cloud shadows and sun glint, which pose serious issues for estimating water quality parameters from the images.

Method: Proposed a U-Net based deep learning model trained on pixel-level data to identify and extract regions with cloud shadows and sun glint, then recover these areas through image correction.

Result: Developed a high-quality image correction model that successfully identifies and recovers cloud shadow and sun glint affected regions in UAS images.

Conclusion: The novel machine learning approach effectively addresses cloud shadow and sun glint issues in UAS imagery, enabling more accurate water quality parameter estimation.

Abstract: The use of unmanned aerial systems (UASs) has increased tremendously in the
current decade. They have significantly advanced remote sensing with the
capability to deploy and image the terrain as per required spatial, spectral,
temporal, and radiometric resolutions for various remote sensing applications.
One of the major advantages of UAS imagery is that images can be acquired in
cloudy conditions by flying the UAS under the clouds. The limitation to the
technology is that the imagery is often sullied by cloud shadows. Images taken
over water are additionally affected by sun glint. These are two pose serious
issues for estimating water quality parameters from the UAS images. This study
proposes a novel machine learning approach first to identify and extract
regions with cloud shadows and sun glint and separate such regions from
non-obstructed clear sky regions and sun-glint unaffected regions. The data was
extracted from the images at pixel level to train an U-Net based deep learning
model and best settings for model training was identified based on the various
evaluation metrics from test cases. Using this evaluation, a high-quality image
correction model was determined, which was used to recover the cloud shadow and
sun glint areas in the images.

### [9] [CoSwin: Convolution Enhanced Hierarchical Shifted Window Attention For Small-Scale Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08959)
*Puskal Khadka,Rodrigue Rizk,Longwei Wang,KC Santosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoSwin is a hybrid architecture that combines hierarchical shifted window attention with convolutional feature learning to enhance local feature extraction in Vision Transformers for small datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers lack key inductive biases like locality and translation equivariance, which limits their performance on small datasets where local feature extraction is crucial.

Method: Integrates learnable local feature enhancement modules into each attention block of Swin Transformer, enabling simultaneous capture of fine-grained spatial details and global semantic structure.

Result: Achieves consistent performance gains: 2.17% on CIFAR-10, 4.92% on CIFAR-100, 0.10% on MNIST, 0.26% on SVHN, and 4.47% on Tiny ImageNet over baseline Swin Transformer.

Conclusion: Local-global feature fusion significantly enhances generalization and robustness of transformers for small-scale vision tasks.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved impressive results in computer
vision by leveraging self-attention to model long-range dependencies. However,
their emphasis on global context often comes at the expense of local feature
extraction in small datasets, particularly due to the lack of key inductive
biases such as locality and translation equivariance. To mitigate this, we
propose CoSwin, a novel feature-fusion architecture that augments the
hierarchical shifted window attention with localized convolutional feature
learning. Specifically, CoSwin integrates a learnable local feature enhancement
module into each attention block, enabling the model to simultaneously capture
fine-grained spatial details and global semantic structure. We evaluate CoSwin
on multiple image classification benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
MNIST, SVHN, and Tiny ImageNet. Our experimental results show consistent
performance gains over state-of-the-art convolutional and transformer-based
models. Notably, CoSwin achieves improvements of 2.17% on CIFAR-10, 4.92% on
CIFAR-100, 0.10% on MNIST, 0.26% on SVHN, and 4.47% on Tiny ImageNet over the
baseline Swin Transformer. These improvements underscore the effectiveness of
local-global feature fusion in enhancing the generalization and robustness of
transformers for small-scale vision. Code and pretrained weights available at

### [10] [iMatcher: Improve matching in point cloud registration via local-to-global geometric consistency learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08982)
*Karim Slimani,Catherine Achard,Brahim Tamadazte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: iMatcher is a fully differentiable framework for point cloud feature matching that uses learned features to predict geometrically consistent confidence matrices, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve point cloud registration by developing a fully differentiable framework that incorporates both local and global geometric consistency for more accurate feature matching.

Method: Uses local graph embedding for score matrix initialization, followed by bilateral source-to-target and target-to-source matching refinement via nearest neighbor search, and global geometric consistency learning for final matching probability prediction.

Result: Achieves 95%-97% inlier ratios on KITTI, 94%-97% on KITTI-360, and up to 81.1% on 3DMatch, demonstrating significant improvement in rigid registration performance across diverse settings.

Conclusion: iMatcher significantly outperforms existing methods in point cloud registration, showing robustness across indoor, outdoor, partial-to-partial matching, and 6-DoF pose estimation tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents iMatcher, a fully differentiable framework for feature
matching in point cloud registration. The proposed method leverages learned
features to predict a geometrically consistent confidence matrix, incorporating
both local and global consistency. First, a local graph embedding module leads
to an initialization of the score matrix. A subsequent repositioning step
refines this matrix by considering bilateral source-to-target and
target-to-source matching via nearest neighbor search in 3D space. The paired
point features are then stacked together to be refined through global geometric
consistency learning to predict a point-wise matching probability. Extensive
experiments on real-world outdoor (KITTI, KITTI-360) and indoor (3DMatch)
datasets, as well as on 6-DoF pose estimation (TUD-L) and partial-to-partial
matching (MVP-RG), demonstrate that iMatcher significantly improves rigid
registration performance. The method achieves state-of-the-art inlier ratios,
scoring 95% - 97% on KITTI, 94% - 97% on KITTI-360, and up to 81.1% on 3DMatch,
highlighting its robustness across diverse settings.

### [11] [UltrON: Ultrasound Occupancy Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08991)
*Magdalena Wysocki,Felix Duelmer,Ananya Bal,Nassir Navab,Mohammad Farid Azampour*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UltrON is a novel occupancy-based representation that leverages acoustic features from B-mode ultrasound images for 3D shape reconstruction, addressing view-dependency and occlusion issues without requiring additional annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ultrasound shape reconstruction methods rely on precise annotations and struggle with view-dependent artifacts and acoustic shadowing. There's a need to utilize the rich acoustic information in B-mode images and overcome occlusion limitations for more accurate 3D reconstruction.

Method: Proposes an occupancy-based representation (UltrON) that uses acoustic features from B-mode images without extra annotation cost. Introduces a novel loss function to compensate for view-dependency and enables occupancy optimization from multiview ultrasound.

Result: UltrON improves geometric consistency in weakly-supervised optimization, mitigates occlusion and sparse labeling limitations, and generalizes to shapes of the same anatomy by incorporating acoustic properties.

Conclusion: The approach paves the way for more accurate 3D reconstruction from ultrasound by effectively utilizing acoustic information and addressing view-dependent challenges, with code and dataset made available for reproducibility.

Abstract: In free-hand ultrasound imaging, sonographers rely on expertise to mentally
integrate partial 2D views into 3D anatomical shapes. Shape reconstruction can
assist clinicians in this process. Central to this task is the choice of shape
representation, as it determines how accurately and efficiently the structure
can be visualized, analyzed, and interpreted. Implicit representations, such as
SDF and occupancy function, offer a powerful alternative to traditional voxel-
or mesh-based methods by modeling continuous, smooth surfaces with compact
storage, avoiding explicit discretization. Recent studies demonstrate that SDF
can be effectively optimized using annotations derived from segmented B-mode
ultrasound images. Yet, these approaches hinge on precise annotations,
overlooking the rich acoustic information embedded in B-mode intensity.
Moreover, implicit representation approaches struggle with the ultrasound's
view-dependent nature and acoustic shadowing artifacts, which impair
reconstruction. To address the problems resulting from occlusions and
annotation dependency, we propose an occupancy-based representation and
introduce \gls{UltrON} that leverages acoustic features to improve geometric
consistency in weakly-supervised optimization regime. We show that these
features can be obtained from B-mode images without additional annotation cost.
Moreover, we propose a novel loss function that compensates for view-dependency
in the B-mode images and facilitates occupancy optimization from multiview
ultrasound. By incorporating acoustic properties, \gls{UltrON} generalizes to
shapes of the same anatomy. We show that \gls{UltrON} mitigates the limitations
of occlusions and sparse labeling and paves the way for more accurate 3D
reconstruction. Code and dataset will be available at

Motivation: Automatic quantification of intramyocardial motion and strain from tagging MRI is important but challenging, requiring accurate and scalable solutions for large CMR datasets.

Method: Uses implicit neural representations (INRs) conditioned on learned latent codes to predict continuous left ventricular displacement without requiring inference-time optimization.

Result: Achieved best tracking accuracy (2.14 mm RMSE) and lowest combined error in global circumferential (2.86%) and radial (6.42%) strain on 452 UK Biobank test cases, while being ~380x faster than the most accurate baseline.

Conclusion: INR-based models are suitable for accurate and scalable analysis of myocardial strain in large CMR datasets.

Abstract: Automatic quantification of intramyocardial motion and strain from tagging
MRI remains an important but challenging task. We propose a method using
implicit neural representations (INRs), conditioned on learned latent codes, to
predict continuous left ventricular (LV) displacement -- without requiring
inference-time optimisation. Evaluated on 452 UK Biobank test cases, our method
achieved the best tracking accuracy (2.14 mm RMSE) and the lowest combined
error in global circumferential (2.86%) and radial (6.42%) strain compared to
three deep learning baselines. In addition, our method is $\sim$380$\times$
faster than the most accurate baseline. These results highlight the suitability
of INR-based models for accurate and scalable analysis of myocardial strain in
large CMR datasets.

### [13] [E-MLNet: Enhanced Mutual Learning for Universal Domain Adaptation with Sample-Specific Weighting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09006)
*Samuel Felipe dos Santos,Tiago Agostinho de Almeida,Jurandy Almeida*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: E-MLNet improves Universal Domain Adaptation by adding dynamic weighting to OEM, focusing adaptation on relevant class boundaries to better distinguish known vs unknown classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like MLNet treat all classifiers equally during adaptation, which dilutes the learning signal and doesn't effectively focus on the most relevant class boundaries for each target sample.

Method: Enhanced Mutual Learning Network (E-MLNet) integrates a dynamic weighting strategy to Open-set Entropy Minimization (OEM), leveraging the closed-set classifier's predictions to focus adaptation on the most relevant class boundaries.

Result: E-MLNet achieves highest average H-scores on VisDA and ImageCLEF benchmarks, outperforms MLNet in 22/31 Open-Partial DA tasks and 19/31 Open-Set DA tasks, demonstrating superior robustness.

Conclusion: The dynamic weighting strategy in E-MLNet effectively sharpens the distinction between known and unknown classes, confirming the benefits of focused adaptation in Universal Domain Adaptation.

Abstract: Universal Domain Adaptation (UniDA) seeks to transfer knowledge from a
labeled source to an unlabeled target domain without assuming any relationship
between their label sets, requiring models to classify known samples while
rejecting unknown ones. Advanced methods like Mutual Learning Network (MLNet)
use a bank of one-vs-all classifiers adapted via Open-set Entropy Minimization
(OEM). However, this strategy treats all classifiers equally, diluting the
learning signal. We propose the Enhanced Mutual Learning Network (E-MLNet),
which integrates a dynamic weighting strategy to OEM. By leveraging the
closed-set classifier's predictions, E-MLNet focuses adaptation on the most
relevant class boundaries for each target sample, sharpening the distinction
between known and unknown classes. We conduct extensive experiments on four
challenging benchmarks: Office-31, Office-Home, VisDA-2017, and ImageCLEF. The
results demonstrate that E-MLNet achieves the highest average H-scores on VisDA
and ImageCLEF and exhibits superior robustness over its predecessor. E-MLNet
outperforms the strong MLNet baseline in the majority of individual adaptation
tasks -- 22 out of 31 in the challenging Open-Partial DA setting and 19 out of
31 in the Open-Set DA setting -- confirming the benefits of our focused
adaptation strategy.

*Umair Hassan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COCO-Urdu is the largest publicly available Urdu image-caption dataset with 59,000 images and 319,000 captions, created to address the under-representation of Urdu in multimodal research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urdu is critically under-served in multimodal research despite being spoken by 250+ million people, with limited datasets causing biases in multilingual vision-language models.

Method: Dataset derived from MS COCO using stratified sampling, translated with SeamlessM4T v2, and validated with hybrid multimodal quality estimation (COMET-Kiwi, CLIP similarity, BERTScore with back-translation) with iterative refinement using LLMs.

Result: Created high-quality dataset benchmarked with strong BLEU, SacreBLEU, and chrF scores - largest publicly available Urdu captioning dataset.

Conclusion: COCO-Urdu reduces language bias in multimodal research and establishes foundation for inclusive vision-language systems in Urdu.

Abstract: Urdu, spoken by over 250 million people, remains critically under-served in
multimodal and vision-language research. The absence of large-scale,
high-quality datasets has limited the development of Urdu-capable systems and
reinforced biases in multilingual vision-language models trained primarily on
high-resource languages. To address this gap, we present COCO-Urdu, a
large-scale image-caption dataset derived from MS COCO, containing 59,000
images and 319,000 Urdu captions selected through stratified sampling to
preserve the original distribution. Captions were translated using SeamlessM4T
v2 and validated with a hybrid multimodal quality estimation framework that
integrates COMET-Kiwi for translation quality, CLIP-based similarity for visual
grounding, and BERTScore with back-translation for semantic consistency;
low-scoring captions were iteratively refined using open-source large language
models. We further benchmark COCO-Urdu on BLEU, SacreBLEU, and chrF, reporting
consistently strong results. To the best of our knowledge, COCO-Urdu is the
largest publicly available Urdu captioning dataset. By releasing both the
dataset and the quality estimation pipeline, we aim to reduce language bias in
multimodal research and establish a foundation for inclusive vision-language
systems.

### [16] [Integrating Anatomical Priors into a Causal Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09054)
*Binxu Li,Wei Peng,Mingjie Li,Ehsan Adeli,Kilian M. Pohl*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PCGM is a novel diffusion-based framework that generates anatomically plausible 3D brain MRIs by integrating probabilistic anatomical constraints to preserve subtle disease-related morphological variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D brain MRI studies need to detect subtle morphometric differences between cohorts, but counterfactual models struggle to produce anatomically plausible MRIs due to lack of explicit inductive biases for preserving fine-grained anatomical details and medically relevant local variations.

Method: Proposed Probabilistic Causal Graph Model (PCGM) integrates anatomical constraints via probabilistic graph module, translates them into spatial binary masks, uses 3D ControlNet extension to encode masks, and employs novel counterfactual denoising UNet with 3D diffusion decoder.

Result: PCGM generates structural brain MRIs of higher quality than baseline approaches. Brain measurements from PCGM counterfactuals replicate subtle disease effects on cortical regions previously reported in neuroscience literature.

Conclusion: PCGM represents an important milestone for using synthetic MRIs in studies investigating subtle morphological differences, successfully preserving medically relevant anatomical variations through explicit constraint integration.

Abstract: 3D brain MRI studies often examine subtle morphometric differences between
cohorts that are hard to detect visually. Given the high cost of MRI
acquisition, these studies could greatly benefit from image syntheses,
particularly counterfactual image generation, as seen in other domains, such as
computer vision. However, counterfactual models struggle to produce
anatomically plausible MRIs due to the lack of explicit inductive biases to
preserve fine-grained anatomical details. This shortcoming arises from the
training of the models aiming to optimize for the overall appearance of the
images (e.g., via cross-entropy) rather than preserving subtle, yet medically
relevant, local variations across subjects. To preserve subtle variations, we
propose to explicitly integrate anatomical constraints on a voxel-level as
prior into a generative diffusion framework. Called Probabilistic Causal Graph
Model (PCGM), the approach captures anatomical constraints via a probabilistic
graph module and translates those constraints into spatial binary masks of
regions where subtle variations occur. The masks (encoded by a 3D extension of
ControlNet) constrain a novel counterfactual denoising UNet, whose encodings
are then transferred into high-quality brain MRIs via our 3D diffusion decoder.
Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that PCGM generates
structural brain MRIs of higher quality than several baseline approaches.
Furthermore, we show for the first time that brain measurements extracted from
counterfactuals (generated by PCGM) replicate the subtle effects of a disease
on cortical brain regions previously reported in the neuroscience literature.
This achievement is an important milestone in the use of synthetic MRIs in
studies investigating subtle morphological differences.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed multi-task learning approach with fixed object information improves human action recognition accuracy to 99.25%, outperforming skeleton-only GCNs by 2.75% for human-object interaction detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GCNs fail at detecting human-object interactions due to lack of scene information representation and appropriate learning architectures for fixed object environments.

Method: Multi-task learning approach that incorporates fixed object information and interaction area data alongside human skeleton poses, using a custom dataset of hands-on fixed objects interactions.

Result: Achieved 99.25% accuracy in recognizing interaction and non-interaction actions, representing a 2.75% improvement over base skeleton-only models.

Conclusion: Incorporating fixed object information through multi-task learning significantly enhances human action recognition performance for human-object interaction scenarios in public environments.

Abstract: Recent graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) have shown high performance
in the field of human action recognition by using human skeleton poses.
However, it fails to detect human-object interaction cases successfully due to
the lack of effective representation of the scene information and appropriate
learning architectures. In this context, we propose a methodology to utilize
human action recognition performance by considering fixed object information in
the environment and following a multi-task learning approach. In order to
evaluate the proposed method, we collected real data from public environments
and prepared our data set, which includes interaction classes of hands-on fixed
objects (e.g., ATM ticketing machines, check-in/out machines, etc.) and
non-interaction classes of walking and standing. The multi-task learning
approach, along with interaction area information, succeeds in recognizing the
studied interaction and non-interaction actions with an accuracy of 99.25%,
outperforming the accuracy of the base model using only human skeleton poses by
2.75%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes IRDFusion framework for multispectral object detection using cross-modal feature contrastive screening to enhance salient structures and suppress background noise through iterative feedback mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multispectral object detection methods retain extraneous background or noise during feature fusion, limiting perceptual performance and detection accuracy.

Method: Introduces two novel modules: Mutual Feature Refinement Module (MFRM) for intra- and inter-modal feature enhancement, and Differential Feature Feedback Module (DFFM) that computes inter-modal differential features as guidance signals. These are integrated into an Iterative Relation-Map Differential Guided Feature Fusion mechanism (IRDFusion) that progressively amplifies salient signals while suppressing noise.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on FLIR, LLVIP and M^3FD datasets, consistently outperforming existing methods across diverse challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: IRDFusion demonstrates robust and effective cross-modal fusion through iterative feedback mechanism, significantly improving multispectral object detection performance while suppressing feature noise.

Abstract: Current multispectral object detection methods often retain extraneous
background or noise during feature fusion, limiting perceptual performance.To
address this, we propose an innovative feature fusion framework based on
cross-modal feature contrastive and screening strategy, diverging from
conventional approaches. The proposed method adaptively enhances salient
structures by fusing object-aware complementary cross-modal features while
suppressing shared background interference.Our solution centers on two novel,
specially designed modules: the Mutual Feature Refinement Module (MFRM) and the
Differential Feature Feedback Module (DFFM). The MFRM enhances intra- and
inter-modal feature representations by modeling their relationships, thereby
improving cross-modal alignment and discriminative power.Inspired by feedback
differential amplifiers, the DFFM dynamically computes inter-modal differential
features as guidance signals and feeds them back to the MFRM, enabling adaptive
fusion of complementary information while suppressing common-mode noise across
modalities. To enable robust feature learning, the MFRM and DFFM are integrated
into a unified framework, which is formally formulated as an Iterative
Relation-Map Differential Guided Feature Fusion mechanism, termed IRDFusion.
IRDFusion enables high-quality cross-modal fusion by progressively amplifying
salient relational signals through iterative feedback, while suppressing
feature noise, leading to significant performance gains.In extensive
experiments on FLIR, LLVIP and M$^3$FD datasets, IRDFusion achieves
state-of-the-art performance and consistently outperforms existing methods
across diverse challenging scenarios, demonstrating its robustness and
effectiveness. Code will be available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SQAP-VLA is a training-free framework that simultaneously applies quantization and token pruning to accelerate Vision-Language-Action models, achieving 1.93x speedup while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA models have high computational and memory costs that hinder practical deployment, and existing compression methods fail to combine quantization and token pruning effectively due to incompatibility issues.

Method: Co-design quantization and token pruning pipeline with new quantization-aware token pruning criteria that work on aggressively quantized models, while enhancing quantizer design to improve pruning effectiveness.

Result: Achieves 1.93x speedup and up to 4.5% average success rate enhancement compared to original VLA models while preserving core performance.

Conclusion: SQAP-VLA successfully overcomes the incompatibility between quantization and token pruning, enabling holistic efficiency improvement for VLA models without training.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models exhibit unprecedented capabilities for
embodied intelligence. However, their extensive computational and memory costs
hinder their practical deployment. Existing VLA compression and acceleration
approaches conduct quantization or token pruning in an ad-hoc manner but fail
to enable both for a holistic efficiency improvement due to an observed
incompatibility. This work introduces SQAP-VLA, the first structured,
training-free VLA inference acceleration framework that simultaneously enables
state-of-the-art quantization and token pruning. We overcome the
incompatibility by co-designing the quantization and token pruning pipeline,
where we propose new quantization-aware token pruning criteria that work on an
aggressively quantized model while improving the quantizer design to enhance
pruning effectiveness. When applied to standard VLA models, SQAP-VLA yields
significant gains in computational efficiency and inference speed while
successfully preserving core model performance, achieving a $\times$1.93
speedup and up to a 4.5\% average success rate enhancement compared to the
original model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: S-BEVLoc is a self-supervised LiDAR global localization framework that eliminates need for ground-truth poses by using BEV images and geographic distances to create training triplets, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LiDAR localization methods require expensive ground-truth poses from GPS/SLAM for supervision. This work aims to eliminate this dependency to reduce costs and improve scalability.

Method: Uses BEV images with keypoint-centered patches, CNN for local features, NetVLAD for global descriptors, and introduces SoftCos loss for triplet learning without ground-truth poses.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on KITTI and NCLT datasets for place recognition, loop closure, and global localization tasks while offering superior scalability.

Conclusion: S-BEVLoc demonstrates that self-supervised learning can effectively replace supervised approaches for LiDAR global localization, providing high performance without costly ground-truth data.

Abstract: LiDAR-based global localization is an essential component of simultaneous
localization and mapping (SLAM), which helps loop closure and re-localization.
Current approaches rely on ground-truth poses obtained from GPS or SLAM
odometry to supervise network training. Despite the great success of these
supervised approaches, substantial cost and effort are required for
high-precision ground-truth pose acquisition. In this work, we propose
S-BEVLoc, a novel self-supervised framework based on bird's-eye view (BEV) for
LiDAR global localization, which eliminates the need for ground-truth poses and
is highly scalable. We construct training triplets from single BEV images by
leveraging the known geographic distances between keypoint-centered BEV
patches. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to extract local features,
and NetVLAD is employed to aggregate global descriptors. Moreover, we introduce
SoftCos loss to enhance learning from the generated triplets. Experimental
results on the large-scale KITTI and NCLT datasets show that S-BEVLoc achieves
state-of-the-art performance in place recognition, loop closure, and global
localization tasks, while offering scalability that would require extra effort
for supervised approaches.

Motivation: Mobile device usage detection requires understanding behavioral context and human-device interactions, but existing benchmarks lack fine-grained annotations for faces, hands, and phones in diverse conditions.

Method: Created FPI-Det dataset with 22,879 images across workplace, education, transportation, and public scenarios, featuring synchronized annotations for faces and phones with extreme scale variation and occlusions.

Result: Evaluated YOLO and DETR detectors, providing baseline performance results across different object sizes, occlusion levels, and environmental conditions.

Conclusion: FPI-Det addresses the gap in fine-grained human-device interaction benchmarks and provides a foundation for improved phone usage detection systems in safety monitoring and attention management applications.

Abstract: The widespread use of mobile devices has created new challenges for vision
systems in safety monitoring, workplace productivity assessment, and attention
management. Detecting whether a person is using a phone requires not only
object recognition but also an understanding of behavioral context, which
involves reasoning about the relationship between faces, hands, and devices
under diverse conditions. Existing generic benchmarks do not fully capture such
fine-grained human--device interactions. To address this gap, we introduce the
FPI-Det, containing 22{,}879 images with synchronized annotations for faces and
phones across workplace, education, transportation, and public scenarios. The
dataset features extreme scale variation, frequent occlusions, and varied
capture conditions. We evaluate representative YOLO and DETR detectors,
providing baseline results and an analysis of performance across object sizes,
occlusion levels, and environments. Source code and dataset is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Segmenting entire plant individuals with multiple overlapping leaves is challenging and typically requires annotated training datasets that are species-specific and labor-intensive to create.

Method: Integrates a foundation segmentation model to extract leaf instances and a vision-language model to reason about plant structures for extracting complete plant individuals without additional training.

Result: Evaluations show the method surpasses existing zero-shot methods and achieves better cross-domain performance than supervised methods across multiple plant species, growth stages, and shooting environments.

Conclusion: ZeroPlantSeg provides an effective zero-shot solution for hierarchical plant segmentation that eliminates the need for annotated training data while maintaining strong cross-domain performance.

Abstract: Foundation segmentation models achieve reasonable leaf instance extraction
from top-view crop images without training (i.e., zero-shot). However,
segmenting entire plant individuals with each consisting of multiple
overlapping leaves remains challenging. This problem is referred to as a
hierarchical segmentation task, typically requiring annotated training
datasets, which are often species-specific and require notable human labor. To
address this, we introduce ZeroPlantSeg, a zero-shot segmentation for
rosette-shaped plant individuals from top-view images. We integrate a
foundation segmentation model, extracting leaf instances, and a vision-language
model, reasoning about plants' structures to extract plant individuals without
additional training. Evaluations on datasets with multiple plant species,
growth stages, and shooting environments demonstrate that our method surpasses
existing zero-shot methods and achieves better cross-domain performance than

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper improves CLIP for person representation learning by creating WebPerson dataset (5M high-quality image-text pairs) and proposing GA-DMS framework that uses gradient-attention guidance to mask noisy text tokens and enhance cross-modal alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP faces challenges in person representation learning due to: 1) scarcity of large-scale annotated person-centric vision-language data, and 2) limitations of global contrastive learning which struggles with fine-grained matching and is vulnerable to noisy text tokens.

Method: 1) Developed noise-resistant data pipeline using MLLMs to automatically filter and caption web images, creating WebPerson dataset. 2) Proposed GA-DMS framework with gradient-attention guided dual-masking to adaptively mask noisy textual tokens and incorporated masked token prediction objectives.

Result: Extensive experiments show that GA-DMS achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks for person representation learning.

Conclusion: The synergistic approach of improved data curation (WebPerson) and enhanced model architecture (GA-DMS) successfully advances CLIP for person representation learning by addressing data scarcity and noisy text vulnerability issues.

Abstract: Although Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) exhibits strong
performance across diverse vision tasks, its application to person
representation learning faces two critical challenges: (i) the scarcity of
large-scale annotated vision-language data focused on person-centric images,
and (ii) the inherent limitations of global contrastive learning, which
struggles to maintain discriminative local features crucial for fine-grained
matching while remaining vulnerable to noisy text tokens. This work advances
CLIP for person representation learning through synergistic improvements in
data curation and model architecture. First, we develop a noise-resistant data
construction pipeline that leverages the in-context learning capabilities of
MLLMs to automatically filter and caption web-sourced images. This yields
WebPerson, a large-scale dataset of 5M high-quality person-centric image-text
pairs. Second, we introduce the GA-DMS (Gradient-Attention Guided Dual-Masking
Synergetic) framework, which improves cross-modal alignment by adaptively
masking noisy textual tokens based on the gradient-attention similarity score.
Additionally, we incorporate masked token prediction objectives that compel the
model to predict informative text tokens, enhancing fine-grained semantic
representation learning. Extensive experiments show that GA-DMS achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.

TL;DR: ALL-PET is a low-resource PET foundation model that uses latent diffusion with innovative mask augmentation and attention mechanisms to achieve high-quality sinogram generation with only 500 samples, enabling multiple PET imaging tasks with efficient memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Building large-scale PET foundation models is challenging due to limited labeled data and computational resources. The goal is to overcome data scarcity and efficiency limitations for PET imaging applications.

Method: Uses latent diffusion model with three innovations: 1) Radon mask augmentation strategy generating 200K+ diverse samples, 2) positive/negative mask constraints for geometric consistency, 3) transparent medical attention mechanism for lesion-focused guidance in projection domain.

Result: Achieves high-quality sinogram generation using only 500 samples, with performance comparable to models trained on larger datasets. Generalizes across multiple tasks including low-dose reconstruction, attenuation correction, delayed-frame prediction, and tracer separation with memory under 24GB.

Conclusion: ALL-PET demonstrates that innovative mask augmentation and attention mechanisms can overcome data scarcity in PET imaging, enabling efficient foundation model development with minimal computational resources while maintaining clinical flexibility and interpretability.

Abstract: Building large-scale foundation model for PET imaging is hindered by limited
access to labeled data and insufficient computational resources. To overcome
data scarcity and efficiency limitations, we propose ALL-PET, a low-resource,
low-shot PET foundation model operating directly in the projection domain.
ALL-PET leverages a latent diffusion model (LDM) with three key innovations.
First, we design a Radon mask augmentation strategy (RMAS) that generates over
200,000 structurally diverse training samples by projecting randomized
image-domain masks into sinogram space, significantly improving generalization
with minimal data. This is extended by a dynamic multi-mask (DMM) mechanism
that varies mask quantity and distribution, enhancing data diversity without
added model complexity. Second, we implement positive/negative mask constraints
to embed strict geometric consistency, reducing parameter burden while
preserving generation quality. Third, we introduce transparent medical
attention (TMA), a parameter-free, geometry-driven mechanism that enhances
lesion-related regions in raw projection data. Lesion-focused attention maps
are derived from coarse segmentation, covering both hypermetabolic and
hypometabolic areas, and projected into sinogram space for physically
consistent guidance. The system supports clinician-defined ROI adjustments,
ensuring flexible, interpretable, and task-adaptive emphasis aligned with PET
acquisition physics. Experimental results show ALL-PET achieves high-quality
sinogram generation using only 500 samples, with performance comparable to
models trained on larger datasets. ALL-PET generalizes across tasks including
low-dose reconstruction, attenuation correction, delayed-frame prediction, and
tracer separation, operating efficiently with memory use under 24GB.

Motivation: Compare noise robustness between Artificial Neural Networks and Persistent Homology approaches for topological structure inference from data, particularly for predicting Betti numbers.

Method: Trained supervised neural network to predict Betti numbers and compared against PH pipeline using cubical complexes and Signed Euclidean Distance Transform (SEDT) on one synthetic and two real-world datasets.

Result: ANNs outperformed the PH approach under noise conditions, demonstrating better noise robustness.

Conclusion: ANNs offer a compelling alternative to PH for topology estimation under structural noise, leveraging their capacity to learn from training data.

Abstract: Persistent Homology (PH) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) offer
contrasting approaches to inferring topological structure from data. In this
study, we examine the noise robustness of a supervised neural network trained
to predict Betti numbers in 2D binary images. We compare an ANN approach
against a PH pipeline based on cubical complexes and the Signed Euclidean
Distance Transform (SEDT), which is a widely adopted strategy for noise-robust
topological analysis. Using one synthetic and two real-world datasets, we show
that ANNs can outperform this PH approach under noise, likely due to their
capacity to learn contextual and geometric priors from training data. Though
still emerging, the use of ANNs for topology estimation offers a compelling
alternative to PH under structural noise.

TL;DR: OSIM is a new object-centric evaluation metric for 3D scenes that better aligns with human perception by focusing on individual objects rather than overall image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D scene evaluation metrics assess overall image quality, which creates discrepancies with human perception since humans recognize scenes by focusing on individual objects as fundamental units of visual perception.

Method: Leverages an object detection model and its feature representations to quantify the 'objectness' of each object in 3D scenes, enabling object-centric evaluations based on neuropsychological insights about human visual perception.

Result: User studies demonstrate OSIM aligns more closely with human perception compared to existing metrics. The authors also re-evaluated recent 3D reconstruction and generation models under standardized experimental setups.

Conclusion: OSIM provides a more human-aligned evaluation approach for 3D scenes by focusing on object-level perception, offering better assessment of 3D reconstruction and generation models.

Abstract: This paper presents Objectness SIMilarity (OSIM), a novel evaluation metric
for 3D scenes that explicitly focuses on "objects," which are fundamental units
of human visual perception. Existing metrics assess overall image quality,
leading to discrepancies with human perception. Inspired by neuropsychological
insights, we hypothesize that human recognition of 3D scenes fundamentally
involves attention to individual objects. OSIM enables object-centric
evaluations by leveraging an object detection model and its feature
representations to quantify the "objectness" of each object in the scene. Our
user study demonstrates that OSIM aligns more closely with human perception
compared to existing metrics. We also analyze the characteristics of OSIM using
various approaches. Moreover, we re-evaluate recent 3D reconstruction and
generation models under a standardized experimental setup to clarify
advancements in this field. The code is available at

Conclusion: This survey provides both a comprehensive retrospective and a prescriptive roadmap for advancing general-purpose video understanding by unifying datasets, inductive biases, and architectures into a coherent framework.

Abstract: Video understanding has advanced rapidly, fueled by increasingly complex
datasets and powerful architectures. Yet existing surveys largely classify
models by task or family, overlooking the structural pressures through which
datasets guide architectural evolution. This survey is the first to adopt a
dataset-driven perspective, showing how motion complexity, temporal span,
hierarchical composition, and multimodal richness impose inductive biases that
models should encode. We reinterpret milestones, from two-stream and 3D CNNs to
sequential, transformer, and multimodal foundation models, as concrete
responses to these dataset-driven pressures. Building on this synthesis, we
offer practical guidance for aligning model design with dataset invariances
while balancing scalability and task demands. By unifying datasets, inductive
biases, and architectures into a coherent framework, this survey provides both
a comprehensive retrospective and a prescriptive roadmap for advancing

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OCELOT 2023 challenge demonstrated that incorporating multi-scale cell-tissue interactions significantly improves cell detection performance in pathology images, with top models achieving up to 7.99 F1-score increase over cell-only baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pathologists examine Whole-Slide Images at multiple magnifications to evaluate both tissue morphology and cellular details, but existing deep learning models struggle to learn these interdependent semantics due to lack of multi-scale annotated datasets.

Method: The challenge created a dataset with overlapping cell detection and tissue segmentation annotations from 673 pairs across 6 organs from TCGA Whole-Slide Images. Participants developed models that incorporate cell-tissue relationships.

Result: Top-performing models achieved substantial improvements, with up to 7.99 F1-score increase on the test set compared to baseline cell-only models that ignored tissue context.

Conclusion: Understanding cell-tissue interactions is crucial for human-level performance in pathology image analysis, and incorporating multi-scale semantics significantly enhances model performance over traditional cell-only detection methods.

Abstract: Pathologists routinely alternate between different magnifications when
examining Whole-Slide Images, allowing them to evaluate both broad tissue
morphology and intricate cellular details to form comprehensive diagnoses.
However, existing deep learning-based cell detection models struggle to
replicate these behaviors and learn the interdependent semantics between
structures at different magnifications. A key barrier in the field is the lack
of datasets with multi-scale overlapping cell and tissue annotations. The
OCELOT 2023 challenge was initiated to gather insights from the community to
validate the hypothesis that understanding cell and tissue (cell-tissue)
interactions is crucial for achieving human-level performance, and to
accelerate the research in this field. The challenge dataset includes
overlapping cell detection and tissue segmentation annotations from six organs,
comprising 673 pairs sourced from 306 The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
Whole-Slide Images with hematoxylin and eosin staining, divided into training,
validation, and test subsets. Participants presented models that significantly
enhanced the understanding of cell-tissue relationships. Top entries achieved
up to a 7.99 increase in F1-score on the test set compared to the baseline
cell-only model that did not incorporate cell-tissue relationships. This is a
substantial improvement in performance over traditional cell-only detection
methods, demonstrating the need for incorporating multi-scale semantics into
the models. This paper provides a comparative analysis of the methods used by
participants, highlighting innovative strategies implemented in the OCELOT 2023
challenge.

TL;DR: RT-DETR++ enhances UAV object detection with improved encoder design using channel-gated attention up/downsampling and CSP-PAC feature fusion for better small object detection while maintaining real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in UAV imagery object detection including densely packed small objects, scale variations, and occlusion issues that are common in aerial imagery.

Method: Enhances RT-DETR encoder with: 1) Channel-gated attention-based upsampling/downsampling (AU/AD) mechanism to minimize errors and preserve details, 2) CSP-PAC technique using parallel hollow convolutions for local and contextual information processing during feature fusion.

Result: Achieves superior performance in detecting small and densely packed objects while maintaining sufficient speed for real-time detection without increased computational complexity.

Conclusion: Provides an effective approach for feature encoding design in real-time detection systems, particularly beneficial for UAV imagery applications.

Abstract: Object detection in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery presents
significant challenges. Issues such as densely packed small objects, scale
variations, and occlusion are commonplace. This paper introduces RT-DETR++,
which enhances the encoder component of the RT-DETR model. Our improvements
focus on two key aspects. First, we introduce a channel-gated attention-based
upsampling/downsampling (AU/AD) mechanism. This dual-path system minimizes
errors and preserves details during feature layer propagation. Second, we
incorporate CSP-PAC during feature fusion. This technique employs parallel
hollow convolutions to process local and contextual information within the same
layer, facilitating the integration of multi-scale features. Evaluation
demonstrates that our novel neck design achieves superior performance in
detecting small and densely packed objects. The model maintains sufficient
speed for real-time detection without increasing computational complexity. This
study provides an effective approach for feature encoding design in real-time

### [31] [A Knowledge Noise Mitigation Framework for Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09159)
*Zhiyue Liu,Sihang Liu,Jinyuan Liu,Xinru Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free framework for KB-VQA that reduces knowledge redundancy by creating low-noise queries, extracting beneficial knowledge segments, and selectively integrating knowledge only when needed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KB-VQA approaches directly augment models with retrieved knowledge but ignore substantial knowledge redundancy, which introduces noise and reduces answer accuracy.

Method: Proposes a three-step framework: 1) Create low-noise queries from image-question pairs for better knowledge retrieval, 2) Use large models to extract answer-beneficial segments from retrieved knowledge, 3) Implement selective knowledge integration only when the model lacks confidence.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that the framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods by acquiring more accurate and critical knowledge while reducing noise.

Conclusion: The proposed training-free framework effectively mitigates knowledge redundancy issues in KB-VQA by enhancing knowledge relevance and reducing noise, leading to improved performance over existing approaches.

Abstract: Knowledge-based visual question answering (KB-VQA) requires a model to
understand images and utilize external knowledge to provide accurate answers.
Existing approaches often directly augment models with retrieved information
from knowledge sources while ignoring substantial knowledge redundancy, which
introduces noise into the answering process. To address this, we propose a
training-free framework with knowledge focusing for KB-VQA, that mitigates the
impact of noise by enhancing knowledge relevance and reducing redundancy.
First, for knowledge retrieval, our framework concludes essential parts from
the image-question pairs, creating low-noise queries that enhance the retrieval
of highly relevant knowledge. Considering that redundancy still persists in the
retrieved knowledge, we then prompt large models to identify and extract
answer-beneficial segments from knowledge. In addition, we introduce a
selective knowledge integration strategy, allowing the model to incorporate
knowledge only when it lacks confidence in answering the question, thereby
mitigating the influence of redundant information. Our framework enables the
acquisition of accurate and critical knowledge, and extensive experiments
demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

*Yulin Tong,Fengzong Zhang,Haiqin Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CWSSNet framework for hyperspectral image classification integrates 3D spectral-spatial features with wavelet convolution, achieving superior performance in ground object classification with good robustness and small-sample training capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral images suffer from feature redundancy due to numerous bands, high dimensionality, and spectral mixing characteristics, requiring improved classification methods for fine ground object recognition.

Method: Proposed CWSSNet framework using ZY1F satellite hyperspectral images, integrating 3D spectral-spatial features with wavelet convolution, multimodal information fusion via multiscale convolutional attention module, and multi-band decomposition in wavelet domain.

Result: Achieved 74.50% mIoU, 82.73% mAcc, and 84.94% mF1 in Yugan County; highest IoU for water bodies, vegetation, and bare land classification; good robustness and limited training time increase with 70% training set proportion.

Conclusion: CWSSNet effectively addresses hyperspectral image classification challenges, demonstrating superior performance, robustness, and reliable operation under small-sample training conditions, breaking through traditional method bottlenecks.

Abstract: Hyperspectral remote sensing technology has significant application value in
fields such as forestry ecology and precision agriculture, while also putting
forward higher requirements for fine ground object classification. However,
although hyperspectral images are rich in spectral information and can improve
recognition accuracy, they tend to cause prominent feature redundancy due to
their numerous bands, high dimensionality, and spectral mixing characteristics.
To address this, this study used hyperspectral images from the ZY1F satellite
as a data source and selected Yugan County, Shangrao City, Jiangxi Province as
the research area to perform ground object classification research. A
classification framework named CWSSNet was proposed, which integrates 3D
spectral-spatial features and wavelet convolution. This framework integrates
multimodal information us-ing a multiscale convolutional attention module and
breaks through the classification performance bottleneck of traditional methods
by introducing multi-band decomposition and convolution operations in the
wavelet domain. The experiments showed that CWSSNet achieved 74.50\%, 82.73\%,
and 84.94\% in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), mean Accuracy (mAcc), and
mean F1-score (mF1) respectively in Yugan County. It also obtained the highest
Intersection over Union (IoU) in the classifica-tion of water bodies,
vegetation, and bare land, demonstrating good robustness. Additionally, when
the training set proportion was 70\%, the increase in training time was
limited, and the classification effect was close to the optimal level,
indicating that the model maintains reliable performance under small-sample
training conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the research gap in evaluating AI-generated image detection methods under complex real-world conditions, as current datasets lack comprehensive coverage of diverse scenarios and real-world distortions.

Method: Created RRDataset with three evaluation dimensions: scenario generalization (7 major scenarios), internet transmission robustness (multiple platform sharing effects), and re-digitization robustness (4 distinct methods). Benchmarked 17 detectors and 10 vision-language models, plus human study with 192 participants.

Result: Benchmarking revealed significant limitations of current AI detection methods in real-world conditions. Human participants demonstrated better few-shot learning capabilities compared to automated methods.

Conclusion: Current AI detection methods struggle with real-world complexity. Future robust detection algorithms should incorporate human adaptability principles to improve performance across diverse scenarios and distortions.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative models, highly realistic image
synthesis has posed new challenges to digital security and media credibility.
Although AI-generated image detection methods have partially addressed these
concerns, a substantial research gap remains in evaluating their performance
under complex real-world conditions. This paper introduces the Real-World
Robustness Dataset (RRDataset) for comprehensive evaluation of detection models
across three dimensions: 1) Scenario Generalization: RRDataset encompasses
high-quality images from seven major scenarios (War and Conflict, Disasters and
Accidents, Political and Social Events, Medical and Public Health, Culture and
Religion, Labor and Production, and everyday life), addressing existing dataset
gaps from a content perspective. 2) Internet Transmission Robustness: examining
detector performance on images that have undergone multiple rounds of sharing
across various social media platforms. 3) Re-digitization Robustness: assessing
model effectiveness on images altered through four distinct re-digitization
methods. We benchmarked 17 detectors and 10 vision-language models (VLMs) on
RRDataset and conducted a large-scale human study involving 192 participants to
investigate human few-shot learning capabilities in detecting AI-generated
images. The benchmarking results reveal the limitations of current AI detection
methods under real-world conditions and underscore the importance of drawing on
human adaptability to develop more robust detection algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-light object detection is challenging due to degraded image quality. Existing approaches either use RAW-RGB images with information loss or employ complex frameworks, creating a need for a more efficient solution.

Method: Deconstructs conventional ISP pipelines into sequential linear (sensor calibration) and nonlinear (tone mapping) sub-modules as differentiable components optimized through task-driven losses. Uses content-aware adaptability and physics-informed priors, plus a Self-Boost mechanism for sub-module cooperation.

Conclusion: Dark-ISP enables seamless end-to-end training for object detection by directly processing Bayer RAW images, providing an effective lightweight solution for low-light object detection with automatic RAW-to-RGB conversion aligned with detection objectives.

Abstract: Low-light Object detection is crucial for many real-world applications but
remains challenging due to degraded image quality. While recent studies have
shown that RAW images offer superior potential over RGB images, existing
approaches either use RAW-RGB images with information loss or employ complex
frameworks. To address these, we propose a lightweight and self-adaptive Image
Signal Processing (ISP) plugin, Dark-ISP, which directly processes Bayer RAW
images in dark environments, enabling seamless end-to-end training for object
detection. Our key innovations are: (1) We deconstruct conventional ISP
pipelines into sequential linear (sensor calibration) and nonlinear (tone
mapping) sub-modules, recasting them as differentiable components optimized
through task-driven losses. Each module is equipped with content-aware
adaptability and physics-informed priors, enabling automatic RAW-to-RGB
conversion aligned with detection objectives. (2) By exploiting the ISP
pipeline's intrinsic cascade structure, we devise a Self-Boost mechanism that
facilitates cooperation between sub-modules. Through extensive experiments on
three RAW image datasets, we demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art RGB- and RAW-based detection approaches, achieving superior
results with minimal parameters in challenging low-light environments.

### [36] [MGTraj: Multi-Granularity Goal-Guided Human Trajectory Prediction with Recursive Refinement Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09200)
*Ge Sun,Jun Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MGTraj is a multi-granularity goal-guided model for human trajectory prediction that recursively refines trajectory proposals from coarse to fine granularity levels using transformer-based networks and cross-granularity feature integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most goal-guided trajectory prediction methods operate at extreme granularities (coarse goal prediction and fine trajectory completion), leaving intermediate temporal granularity unexplored despite its potential to better capture human dynamics and motion patterns.

Method: MGTraj uses recursive encoding from coarse to fine granularity levels with transformer-based recursive refinement networks (RRN) at each level. It integrates features across granularities through weight-sharing strategy and employs velocity prediction as an auxiliary task.

Result: MGTraj outperforms baseline methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance among goal-guided methods on ETH/UCY and Stanford Drone Dataset benchmarks.

Conclusion: Multi-granularity modeling with recursive refinement and cross-granularity feature integration significantly enhances goal-guided human trajectory prediction performance.

Abstract: Accurate human trajectory prediction is crucial for robotics navigation and
autonomous driving. Recent research has demonstrated that incorporating goal
guidance significantly enhances prediction accuracy by reducing uncertainty and
leveraging prior knowledge. Most goal-guided approaches decouple the prediction
task into two stages: goal prediction and subsequent trajectory completion
based on the predicted goal, which operate at extreme granularities:
coarse-grained goal prediction forecasts the overall intention, while
fine-grained trajectory completion needs to generate the positions for all
future timesteps. The potential utility of intermediate temporal granularity
remains largely unexplored, which motivates multi-granularity trajectory
modeling. While prior work has shown that multi-granularity representations
capture diverse scales of human dynamics and motion patterns, effectively
integrating this concept into goal-guided frameworks remains challenging. In
this paper, we propose MGTraj, a novel Multi-Granularity goal-guided model for
human Trajectory prediction. MGTraj recursively encodes trajectory proposals
from coarse to fine granularity levels. At each level, a transformer-based
recursive refinement network (RRN) captures features and predicts progressive
refinements. Features across different granularities are integrated using a
weight-sharing strategy, and velocity prediction is employed as an auxiliary
task to further enhance performance. Comprehensive experimental results in
EHT/UCY and Stanford Drone Dataset indicate that MGTraj outperforms baseline
methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance among goal-guided methods.

TL;DR: Medverse is a universal in-context learning model for 3D medical imaging that achieves high-fidelity predictions with global anatomical understanding across diverse tasks and anatomical regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ICL models for medical imaging cannot simultaneously achieve high-fidelity predictions and global anatomical understanding, and lack unified training across diverse medical imaging tasks and anatomical regions.

Method: Medverse employs a next-scale autoregressive in-context learning framework with progressive refinement from coarse to fine, and a blockwise cross-attention module for long-range interactions while maintaining computational efficiency through spatial sparsity.

Result: Extensive evaluation on held-out datasets shows Medverse substantially outperforms existing ICL baselines and establishes a novel paradigm for in-context learning in medical imaging.

Conclusion: Medverse represents a significant advancement in universal medical image analysis, enabling diverse 3D image processing tasks without retraining and demonstrating strong performance across unseen clinical centers, organs, species, and imaging modalities.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) offers a promising paradigm for universal medical
image analysis, enabling models to perform diverse image processing tasks
without retraining. However, current ICL models for medical imaging remain
limited in two critical aspects: they cannot simultaneously achieve
high-fidelity predictions and global anatomical understanding, and there is no
unified model trained across diverse medical imaging tasks (e.g., segmentation
and enhancement) and anatomical regions. As a result, the full potential of ICL
in medical imaging remains underexplored. Thus, we present \textbf{Medverse}, a
universal ICL model for 3D medical imaging, trained on 22 datasets covering
diverse tasks in universal image segmentation, transformation, and enhancement
across multiple organs, imaging modalities, and clinical centers. Medverse
employs a next-scale autoregressive in-context learning framework that
progressively refines predictions from coarse to fine, generating consistent,
full-resolution volumetric outputs and enabling multi-scale anatomical
awareness. We further propose a blockwise cross-attention module that
facilitates long-range interactions between context and target inputs while
preserving computational efficiency through spatial sparsity. Medverse is
extensively evaluated on a broad collection of held-out datasets covering
previously unseen clinical centers, organs, species, and imaging modalities.
Results demonstrate that Medverse substantially outperforms existing ICL
baselines and establishes a novel paradigm for in-context learning. Code and
model weights will be made publicly available. Our model are publicly available

Abstract: Background and objective Early diagnosis of gastric diseases is crucial to
prevent fatal outcomes. Although histopathologic examination remains the
diagnostic gold standard, it is performed entirely manually, making evaluations

TL;DR: MMOral is the first large-scale multimodal instruction dataset and benchmark for panoramic X-ray interpretation in dentistry, consisting of 20,563 annotated images with 1.3M instruction instances. Current LVLMs perform poorly (best model GPT-4o at 41.45% accuracy), but OralGPT (fine-tuned Qwen2.5-VL-7B) shows 24.73% improvement after SFT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large vision-language models show strong performance on general medical tasks but remain underexplored in specialized domains like dentistry. Panoramic X-rays present unique challenges with dense anatomical structures and subtle pathological cues not captured by existing medical benchmarks.

Method: Created MMOral dataset with 20,563 annotated panoramic X-ray images and 1.3M instruction instances across multiple task types. Developed MMOral-Bench evaluation suite covering five key diagnostic dimensions. Proposed OralGPT by conducting supervised fine-tuning on Qwen2.5-VL-7B using the MMOral dataset.

Result: Evaluation of 64 LVLMs showed poor performance, with GPT-4o achieving only 41.45% accuracy. OralGPT demonstrated substantial improvement with 24.73% performance enhancement after just one epoch of supervised fine-tuning.

Conclusion: MMOral and OralGPT provide a critical foundation for intelligent dentistry and enable more clinically impactful multimodal AI systems in dental applications. The significant performance gap reveals current limitations of LVLMs in specialized medical domains like dentistry.

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
strong performance on general-purpose medical tasks. However, their
effectiveness in specialized domains such as dentistry remains underexplored.
In particular, panoramic X-rays, a widely used imaging modality in oral
radiology, pose interpretative challenges due to dense anatomical structures
and subtle pathological cues, which are not captured by existing medical
benchmarks or instruction datasets. To this end, we introduce MMOral, the first
large-scale multimodal instruction dataset and benchmark tailored for panoramic
X-ray interpretation. MMOral consists of 20,563 annotated images paired with
1.3 million instruction-following instances across diverse task types,
including attribute extraction, report generation, visual question answering,
and image-grounded dialogue. In addition, we present MMOral-Bench, a
comprehensive evaluation suite covering five key diagnostic dimensions in
dentistry. We evaluate 64 LVLMs on MMOral-Bench and find that even the
best-performing model, i.e., GPT-4o, only achieves 41.45% accuracy, revealing
significant limitations of current models in this domain. To promote the
progress of this specific domain, we also propose OralGPT, which conducts
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) upon Qwen2.5-VL-7B with our meticulously curated
MMOral instruction dataset. Remarkably, a single epoch of SFT yields
substantial performance enhancements for LVLMs, e.g., OralGPT demonstrates a
24.73% improvement. Both MMOral and OralGPT hold significant potential as a
critical foundation for intelligent dentistry and enable more clinically
impactful multimodal AI systems in the dental field. The dataset, model,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DATE method enhances temporal awareness in MLLMs through timestamp injection and semantic-guided sampling for long video understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs struggle with long-range temporal dependencies in videos due to uniform frame sampling and implicit position encodings, leading to information loss and poor temporal comprehension.

Method: Proposes Dynamic Absolute Time Enhancement (DATE) with Timestamp Injection Mechanism (TIM) and Temporal-Aware Similarity Sampling (TASS) strategy that interleaves frame embeddings with timestamp tokens and uses a two-stage vision-language retrieval approach for sampling.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on hour-long video benchmarks, with the 7B model outperforming many 72B models on some tasks, showing remarkable improvements in absolute time understanding and event localization.

Conclusion: The DATE framework effectively addresses long video understanding challenges by enhancing temporal awareness through explicit timestamp modeling and semantic-guided sampling strategies.

Abstract: Long video understanding remains a fundamental challenge for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), particularly in tasks requiring precise temporal
reasoning and event localization. Existing approaches typically adopt uniform
frame sampling and rely on implicit position encodings to model temporal order.
However, these methods struggle with long-range dependencies, leading to
critical information loss and degraded temporal comprehension. In this paper,
we propose Dynamic Absolute Time Enhancement (DATE) that enhances temporal
awareness in MLLMs through the Timestamp Injection Mechanism (TIM) and a
semantically guided Temporal-Aware Similarity Sampling (TASS) strategy.
Specifically, we interleave video frame embeddings with textual timestamp
tokens to construct a continuous temporal reference system. We further
reformulate the video sampling problem as a vision-language retrieval task and
introduce a two-stage algorithm to ensure both semantic relevance and temporal
coverage: enriching each query into a descriptive caption to better align with
the vision feature, and sampling key event with a similarity-driven temporally
regularized greedy strategy. Our method achieves remarkable improvements w.r.t.
absolute time understanding and key event localization, resulting in
state-of-the-art performance among 7B and 72B models on hour-long video
benchmarks. Particularly, our 7B model even exceeds many 72B models on some
benchmarks.

Method: Progressive pruning framework starting with redundant model, iteratively pruning redundant modules using block-wise pruning and functional decoupling loss.

Result: PSP-Seg-S achieves performance comparable to nnU-Net while reducing GPU memory by 42-45%, training time by 29-48%, and parameters by 83-87% across five datasets.

Conclusion: PSP-Seg offers a cost-effective, high-performing alternative for widespread clinical 3D segmentation applications with significant efficiency gains.

Abstract: 3D medical image segmentation often faces heavy resource and time
consumption, limiting its scalability and rapid deployment in clinical
environments. Existing efficient segmentation models are typically static and
manually designed prior to training, which restricts their adaptability across
diverse tasks and makes it difficult to balance performance with resource
efficiency. In this paper, we propose PSP-Seg, a progressive pruning framework
that enables dynamic and efficient 3D segmentation. PSP-Seg begins with a
redundant model and iteratively prunes redundant modules through a combination
of block-wise pruning and a functional decoupling loss. We evaluate PSP-Seg on
five public datasets, benchmarking it against seven state-of-the-art models and
six efficient segmentation models. Results demonstrate that the lightweight
variant, PSP-Seg-S, achieves performance on par with nnU-Net while reducing GPU
memory usage by 42-45%, training time by 29-48%, and parameter number by 83-87%
across all datasets. These findings underscore PSP-Seg's potential as a
cost-effective yet high-performing alternative for widespread clinical
application.

*Bohao Tang,Yan Ma,Fei Zhang,Jiadi Su,Ethan Chern,Zhulin Hu,Zhixin Wang,Pengfei Liu,Ya Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Code-as-Thought (CaT) approach for chart understanding that adaptively chooses between code-based symbolic reasoning and direct visual analysis using reinforcement learning with dual rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of prior chart understanding methods - external tools make systems brittle, while single-strategy models lack verifiability and struggle with complex charts where symbolic representation is unsuitable.

Method: Proposes Visual Programmability concept and adaptive framework where VLM learns to choose between CaT (code-based symbolic representation) pathway and direct visual reasoning pathway using reinforcement learning with dual-reward system (data-accuracy reward and decision reward).

Result: Demonstrates strong and robust performance across diverse chart-understanding benchmarks, showing VLMs can dynamically select optimal reasoning pathways.

Conclusion: VLMs can be taught not only to reason but also how to reason, dynamically selecting the optimal reasoning pathway for each chart understanding task through adaptive code-based and visual reasoning strategies.

Abstract: Chart understanding presents a critical test to the reasoning capabilities of
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Prior approaches face critical limitations: some
rely on external tools, making them brittle and constrained by a predefined
toolkit, while others fine-tune specialist models that often adopt a single
reasoning strategy, such as text-based chain-of-thought (CoT). The intermediate
steps of text-based reasoning are difficult to verify, which complicates the
use of reinforcement-learning signals that reward factual accuracy. To address
this, we propose a Code-as-Thought (CaT) approach to represent the visual
information of a chart in a verifiable, symbolic format. Our key insight is
that this strategy must be adaptive: a fixed, code-only implementation
consistently fails on complex charts where symbolic representation is
unsuitable. This finding leads us to introduce Visual Programmability: a
learnable property that determines if a chart-question pair is better solved
with code or direct visual analysis. We implement this concept in an adaptive
framework where a VLM learns to choose between the CaT pathway and a direct
visual reasoning pathway. The selection policy of the model is trained with
reinforcement learning using a novel dual-reward system. This system combines a
data-accuracy reward to ground the model in facts and prevent numerical
hallucination, with a decision reward that teaches the model when to use each
strategy, preventing it from defaulting to a single reasoning mode. Experiments
demonstrate strong and robust performance across diverse chart-understanding
benchmarks. Our work shows that VLMs can be taught not only to reason but also
how to reason, dynamically selecting the optimal reasoning pathway for each
task.

*Anthony P. Addison,Felix Wagner,Wentian Xu,Natalie Voets,Konstantinos Kamnitsas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A U-net modification with modality-agnostic input channels enables brain MRI segmentation on both seen and unseen modalities using synthetic MRI augmentations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current segmentation models for multimodal brain MRI are restricted to fixed modalities and cannot effectively process new ones at inference, losing discriminative modality-specific information.

Method: Simple alteration to U-net architecture by integrating modality-agnostic input channels alongside modality-specific ones, trained with image augmentation scheme that synthesizes artificial MRI modalities while maintaining anatomical integrity.

Result: Evaluated on 8 MRI databases with 5 pathologies and 8 modalities, the approach preserves ability to process training modalities while effectively handling new unseen modalities to improve segmentation.

Conclusion: The proposed modality-agnostic approach enables flexible inference on any available imaging modalities, making it practical for clinical use with heterogeneous MRI data combinations.

Abstract: Segmentation models are important tools for the detection and analysis of
lesions in brain MRI. Depending on the type of brain pathology that is imaged,
MRI scanners can acquire multiple, different image modalities (contrasts). Most
segmentation models for multimodal brain MRI are restricted to fixed modalities
and cannot effectively process new ones at inference. Some models generalize to
unseen modalities but may lose discriminative modality-specific information.
This work aims to develop a model that can perform inference on data that
contain image modalities unseen during training, previously seen modalities,
and heterogeneous combinations of both, thus allowing a user to utilize any
available imaging modalities. We demonstrate this is possible with a simple,
thus practical alteration to the U-net architecture, by integrating a
modality-agnostic input channel or pathway, alongside modality-specific input
channels. To train this modality-agnostic component, we develop an image
augmentation scheme that synthesizes artificial MRI modalities. Augmentations
differentially alter the appearance of pathological and healthy brain tissue to
create artificial contrasts between them while maintaining realistic anatomical
integrity. We evaluate the method using 8 MRI databases that include 5 types of
pathologies (stroke, tumours, traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis and
white matter hyperintensities) and 8 modalities (T1, T1+contrast, T2, PD, SWI,
DWI, ADC and FLAIR). The results demonstrate that the approach preserves the
ability to effectively process MRI modalities encountered during training,
while being able to process new, unseen modalities to improve its segmentation.

*Spyridon Loukovitis,Anastasios Arsenos,Vasileios Karampinis,Athanasios Voulodimos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel model-agnostic open-set detection framework for UAV air-to-air object detection that handles unknown objects and corrupted flight data through embedding space entropy modeling with spectral normalization and temperature scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional closed-set detectors degrade significantly under domain shifts and flight data corruption, posing safety risks for UAV autonomy in real-world air-to-air detection scenarios.

Method: Estimates semantic uncertainty via entropy modeling in embedding space, incorporates spectral normalization and temperature scaling to enhance open-set discrimination, and uses background rejection for robustness.

Result: Achieves up to 10% relative AUROC gain compared to standard YOLO-based detectors on AOT aerial benchmark, with consistent improvements shown through ablation studies and real-world flight tests.

Conclusion: The framework provides reliable UAV perception in dynamic air-to-air environments by maintaining detection accuracy while significantly improving robustness against unknown objects and corrupted data.

Abstract: Open-set detection is crucial for robust UAV autonomy in air-to-air object
detection under real-world conditions. Traditional closed-set detectors degrade
significantly under domain shifts and flight data corruption, posing risks to
safety-critical applications. We propose a novel, model-agnostic open-set
detection framework designed specifically for embedding-based detectors. The
method explicitly handles unknown object rejection while maintaining robustness
against corrupted flight data. It estimates semantic uncertainty via entropy
modeling in the embedding space and incorporates spectral normalization and
temperature scaling to enhance open-set discrimination. We validate our
approach on the challenging AOT aerial benchmark and through extensive
real-world flight tests. Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate consistent
improvements over baseline methods, achieving up to a 10\% relative AUROC gain
compared to standard YOLO-based detectors. Additionally, we show that
background rejection further strengthens robustness without compromising
detection accuracy, making our solution particularly well-suited for reliable
UAV perception in dynamic air-to-air environments.

*Oh-Tae Jang,Min-Gon Cho,Kyung-Tae Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SlotSAR is a novel object-centric learning framework that disentangles target representations from background clutter in SAR images without mask annotations, using multi-level feature integration and achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR images contain complex background clutter that resembles targets, causing models to extract entangled or spurious features and undermining clear target representation formation regardless of classifier used.

Method: Extracts high-level semantic features from SARATR-X and low-level scattering features from wavelet scattering network, then integrates them through a multi-level slot attention module to enhance slot-wise representation distinctiveness for effective object-centric learning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in SAR imagery by preserving structural details compared to existing object-centric learning methods.

Conclusion: The proposed SlotSAR framework effectively addresses the challenge of disentangling target representations from background clutter in SAR images without requiring mask annotations, demonstrating superior performance through complementary multi-level feature integration.

Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images contain not only targets of interest
but also complex background clutter, including terrain reflections and speckle
noise. In many cases, such clutter exhibits intensity and patterns that
resemble targets, leading models to extract entangled or spurious features.
Such behavior undermines the ability to form clear target representations,
regardless of the classifier. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
object-centric learning (OCL) framework, named SlotSAR, that disentangles
target representations from background clutter in SAR images without mask
annotations. SlotSAR first extracts high-level semantic features from SARATR-X
and low-level scattering features from the wavelet scattering network in order
to obtain complementary multi-level representations for robust target
characterization. We further present a multi-level slot attention module that
integrates these low- and high-level features to enhance slot-wise
representation distinctiveness, enabling effective OCL. Experimental results
demonstrate that SlotSAR achieves state-of-the-art performance in SAR imagery
by preserving structural details compared to existing OCL methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap in multimodal large language models' understanding of real-world materials characterization imaging data, which is fundamental for materials science but remains underexplored.

Method: Created MatCha benchmark with 1,500 questions requiring expert-level domain expertise, covering four key stages of materials research and 21 distinct tasks reflecting authentic materials science challenges.

Result: State-of-the-art MLLMs show significant performance degradation compared to human experts, especially for questions requiring higher-level expertise and sophisticated visual perception. Few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting failed to alleviate these limitations.

Conclusion: Existing MLLMs have limited adaptability to real-world materials characterization scenarios, and MatCha can facilitate future research in new material discovery and autonomous scientific agents.

Abstract: Materials characterization is fundamental to acquiring materials information,
revealing the processing-microstructure-property relationships that guide
material design and optimization. While multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) have recently shown promise in generative and predictive tasks within
materials science, their capacity to understand real-world characterization
imaging data remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we present MatCha, the
first benchmark for materials characterization image understanding, comprising
1,500 questions that demand expert-level domain expertise. MatCha encompasses
four key stages of materials research comprising 21 distinct tasks, each
designed to reflect authentic challenges faced by materials scientists. Our
evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs on MatCha reveals a significant
performance gap compared to human experts. These models exhibit degradation
when addressing questions requiring higher-level expertise and sophisticated
visual perception. Simple few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting struggle to
alleviate these limitations. These findings highlight that existing MLLMs still
exhibit limited adaptability to real-world materials characterization
scenarios. We hope MatCha will facilitate future research in areas such as new
material discovery and autonomous scientific agents. MatCha is available at

### [47] [You Share Beliefs, I Adapt: Progressive Heterogeneous Collaborative Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09310)
*Hao Si,Ehsan Javanmardi,Manabu Tsukada*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PHCP enables heterogeneous collaborative perception without joint training by using few-shot unsupervised domain adaptation during inference, achieving SOTA-comparable performance with minimal unlabeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods require impractical joint training or pre-stored models for each collaborator, making real-world deployment challenging for heterogeneous vehicle perception systems.

Method: Progressive Heterogeneous Collaborative Perception (PHCP) formulates the problem as few-shot unsupervised domain adaptation, dynamically aligning features by self-training an adapter during inference without labeled data.

Result: Extensive experiments on OPV2V dataset show PHCP achieves strong performance across diverse heterogeneous scenarios, comparable to SOTA methods trained on full dataset while using only small unlabeled data.

Conclusion: PHCP successfully addresses heterogeneous collaborative perception without joint training, enabling practical real-world deployment by adapting during inference with minimal data requirements.

Abstract: Collaborative perception enables vehicles to overcome individual perception
limitations by sharing information, allowing them to see further and through
occlusions. In real-world scenarios, models on different vehicles are often
heterogeneous due to manufacturer variations. Existing methods for
heterogeneous collaborative perception address this challenge by fine-tuning
adapters or the entire network to bridge the domain gap. However, these methods
are impractical in real-world applications, as each new collaborator must
undergo joint training with the ego vehicle on a dataset before inference, or
the ego vehicle stores models for all potential collaborators in advance.
Therefore, we pose a new question: Can we tackle this challenge directly during
inference, eliminating the need for joint training? To answer this, we
introduce Progressive Heterogeneous Collaborative Perception (PHCP), a novel
framework that formulates the problem as few-shot unsupervised domain
adaptation. Unlike previous work, PHCP dynamically aligns features by
self-training an adapter during inference, eliminating the need for labeled
data and joint training. Extensive experiments on the OPV2V dataset demonstrate
that PHCP achieves strong performance across diverse heterogeneous scenarios.
Notably, PHCP achieves performance comparable to SOTA methods trained on the
entire dataset while using only a small amount of unlabeled data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models have strong zero-shot classification through image-text alignment, but their purely visual inference capabilities remain under-explored.

Method: Evaluated both language-guided and vision-only image classification using diverse dual-encoder VLMs on ImageNet-1k, analyzed key factors (prompt design, class diversity, k-NN neighbors, reference set size), and introduced a learning-free fusion method based on per-class precision.

Result: Language and vision offer complementary strengths - some classes favor textual prompts while others are better handled by visual similarity. The fusion method improves classification performance.

Conclusion: The complementary nature of language and vision in VLMs can be effectively exploited through simple fusion techniques to enhance zero-shot classification performance without additional learning.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled strong zero-shot classification
through image-text alignment. Yet, their purely visual inference capabilities
remain under-explored. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
both language-guided and vision-only image classification with a diverse set of
dual-encoder VLMs, including both well-established and recent models such as
SigLIP 2 and RADIOv2.5. The performance is compared in a standard setup on the
ImageNet-1k validation set and its label-corrected variant. The key factors
affecting accuracy are analysed, including prompt design, class diversity, the
number of neighbours in k-NN, and reference set size. We show that language and
vision offer complementary strengths, with some classes favouring textual
prompts and others better handled by visual similarity. To exploit this
complementarity, we introduce a simple, learning-free fusion method based on
per-class precision that improves classification performance. The code is

Method: Proposed Better Understanding Generation (BUG) workflow with LMM that automatically creates and fine-grain customizes cloth designs from chat using image-into-prompt conversion, eliminating the need for human involvement in design/editing.

Result: Created a new FashionEdit dataset simulating real-world clothing design workflow, evaluated on generation similarity, user satisfaction, and quality metrics. The framework successfully unleashes users' creative potential and lowers barriers to clothing design.

Conclusion: The BUG workflow effectively addresses text uncertainty issues in fashion design customization, making professional-level clothing design accessible to non-experts through automated AI-powered generation and editing capabilities.

Abstract: Generative AI evolves the execution of complex workflows in industry, where
the large multimodal model empowers fashion design in the garment industry.
Current generation AI models magically transform brainstorming into fancy

TL;DR: Self-supervised pre-training with domain-relevant surgical data outperforms large-scale but less aligned sources for few-shot surgical skill assessment, achieving up to 73.65% accuracy in 5-shot settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Surgical skill assessment requires expert annotations that are scarce and time-consuming to produce. Few-shot learning offers a scalable alternative but depends heavily on effective pre-training strategies, which remain unexplored in surgical skill assessment.

Method: Formulated surgical skill assessment as a few-shot task, annotated a robotic surgery dataset with OSATS scores, evaluated various pre-training sources across three few-shot settings (1-, 2-, and 5-shot), and analyzed domain similarity and procedure-specific data inclusion effects.

Result: Domain-relevant small datasets outperformed large-scale less aligned ones, achieving 60.16%, 66.03%, and 73.65% accuracy in 1-, 2-, and 5-shot settings respectively. Including procedure-specific data with domain-relevant external datasets boosted performance (+1.22% accuracy, +2.28% F1-score), while less similar large-scale sources caused degradation.

Conclusion: Domain relevance is more critical than dataset scale for pre-training in surgical skill assessment. Strategic inclusion of procedure-specific data with domain-relevant sources significantly improves few-shot performance, while mismatched large-scale sources can harm results.

Abstract: Automated surgical skill assessment (SSA) is a central task in surgical
computer vision. Developing robust SSA models is challenging due to the
scarcity of skill annotations, which are time-consuming to produce and require
expert consensus. Few-shot learning (FSL) offers a scalable alternative
enabling model development with minimal supervision, though its success
critically depends on effective pre-training. While widely studied for several
surgical downstream tasks, pre-training has remained largely unexplored in SSA.
In this work, we formulate SSA as a few-shot task and investigate how
self-supervised pre-training strategies affect downstream few-shot SSA
performance. We annotate a publicly available robotic surgery dataset with
Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skill (OSATS) scores, and evaluate
various pre-training sources across three few-shot settings. We quantify domain
similarity and analyze how domain gap and the inclusion of procedure-specific
data into pre-training influence transferability. Our results show that small
but domain-relevant datasets can outperform large scale, less aligned ones,
achieving accuracies of 60.16%, 66.03%, and 73.65% in the 1-, 2-, and 5-shot
settings, respectively. Moreover, incorporating procedure-specific data into
pre-training with a domain-relevant external dataset significantly boosts
downstream performance, with an average gain of +1.22% in accuracy and +2.28%
in F1-score; however, applying the same strategy with less similar but
large-scale sources can instead lead to performance degradation. Code and
models are available at https://github.com/anastadimi/ssa-fsl.

Motivation: Human error from distracted and impaired driving is a major cause of road accidents, requiring effective detection systems that can work with non-connected vehicles.

Method: Uses computer vision with real-time object tracking, lateral displacement analysis, and lane position monitoring via YOLO object detection model and custom lane estimation algorithms.

Result: Experimental evaluations show the framework is reliable and adaptable across diverse road and environmental conditions, successfully identifying unsafe behaviors like excessive lateral movement and erratic trajectories.

Conclusion: The vision-based approach provides an effective solution for driver behavior classification that works for both connected and non-connected vehicles, addressing a key limitation of inter-vehicular communication systems.

Abstract: Road traffic accidents remain a significant global concern, with human error,
particularly distracted and impaired driving, among the leading causes. This
study introduces a novel driver behavior classification system that uses
external observation techniques to detect indicators of distraction and
impairment. The proposed framework employs advanced computer vision
methodologies, including real-time object tracking, lateral displacement
analysis, and lane position monitoring. The system identifies unsafe driving
behaviors such as excessive lateral movement and erratic trajectory patterns by
implementing the YOLO object detection model and custom lane estimation
algorithms. Unlike systems reliant on inter-vehicular communication, this
vision-based approach enables behavioral analysis of non-connected vehicles.
Experimental evaluations on diverse video datasets demonstrate the framework's

TL;DR: Novel method for intrinsic image decomposition that handles complex scenes with severe lighting and rich textures using texture-guided regularization


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous learning-based methods produce texture-less and over-smoothing intrinsic images, failing to handle complex scenes with spatially-varying lighting and rich textures

Method: Design a texture-guided regularization term and formulate the decomposition problem into an optimization framework to separate material textures and lighting effects

Result: The proposed method produces high-quality intrinsic images for real-world images, superior to existing approaches

Conclusion: Combining texture-aware prior enables effective separation of reflectance and shading layers in complex scenes with varying lighting and rich textures

Abstract: This paper aims to recover the intrinsic reflectance layer and shading layer
given a single image. Though this intrinsic image decomposition problem has
been studied for decades, it remains a significant challenge in cases of
complex scenes, i.e. spatially-varying lighting effect and rich textures. In
this paper, we propose a novel method for handling severe lighting and rich
textures in intrinsic image decomposition, which enables to produce
high-quality intrinsic images for real-world images. Specifically, we observe
that previous learning-based methods tend to produce texture-less and
over-smoothing intrinsic images, which can be used to infer the lighting and
texture information given a RGB image. In this way, we design a texture-guided
regularization term and formulate the decomposition problem into an
optimization framework, to separate the material textures and lighting effect.
We demonstrate that combining the novel texture-aware prior can produce
superior results to existing approaches.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the connection between Plug-and-Play methods and Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models for solving ill-posed inverse problems, particularly in single-pixel imaging applications.

Method: Decouple diffusion process into three stages (denoising, data consistency enforcement, sampling), propose hybrid data-consistency module combining multiple PnP-style fidelity terms applied directly to denoised estimates.

Result: Experimental results on single-pixel imaging tasks demonstrate better reconstruction quality compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully integrates learned priors with physical forward models in a principled manner, improving measurement consistency without disrupting diffusion sampling trajectory.

Abstract: We explore the connection between Plug-and-Play (PnP) methods and Denoising
Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) for solving ill-posed inverse problems, with a
focus on single-pixel imaging. We begin by identifying key distinctions between
PnP and diffusion models-particularly in their denoising mechanisms and
sampling procedures. By decoupling the diffusion process into three
interpretable stages: denoising, data consistency enforcement, and sampling, we
provide a unified framework that integrates learned priors with physical
forward models in a principled manner. Building upon this insight, we propose a
hybrid data-consistency module that linearly combines multiple PnP-style
fidelity terms. This hybrid correction is applied directly to the denoised
estimate, improving measurement consistency without disrupting the diffusion
sampling trajectory. Experimental results on single-pixel imaging tasks
demonstrate that our method achieves better reconstruction quality.

TL;DR: A fully automatic two-stage framework for non-invasive intracranial pressure grading using optic nerve sheath diameter measurement from ultrasound videos and clinical data fusion, achieving significantly better accuracy than conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Intracranial pressure elevation threatens cerebral function but current monitoring methods like lumbar puncture are invasive. Optic nerve sheath diameter shows promise as a biomarker but manual measurement suffers from inconsistency, subjectivity, and variability.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Fundus ultrasound video processing with frame-level anatomical segmentation, rule-based keyframe identification, and precise ONSD measurement; 2) ICP grading stage that fuses ONSD metrics with clinical features to predict ICP grades.

Result: Achieved validation accuracy of 0.845 ± 0.071 (five-fold cross-validation) and independent test accuracy of 0.786, significantly outperforming conventional threshold-based method (0.637 ± 0.111 validation, 0.429 test accuracy).

Conclusion: The framework reduces operator variability and integrates multi-source information, establishing a reliable non-invasive approach for clinical ICP evaluation that can improve patient management in acute neurological conditions.

Abstract: Intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation poses severe threats to cerebral
function, thus necessitating monitoring for timely intervention. While lumbar
puncture is the gold standard for ICP measurement, its invasiveness and
associated risks drive the need for non-invasive alternatives. Optic nerve
sheath diameter (ONSD) has emerged as a promising biomarker, as elevated ICP
directly correlates with increased ONSD. However, current clinical practices
for ONSD measurement suffer from inconsistency in manual operation,
subjectivity in optimal view selection, and variability in thresholding,
limiting their reliability. To address these challenges, we introduce a fully
automatic two-stage framework for ICP grading, integrating keyframe
identification, ONSD measurement and clinical data. Specifically, the fundus
ultrasound video processing stage performs frame-level anatomical segmentation,
rule-based keyframe identification guided by an international consensus
statement, and precise ONSD measurement. The intracranial pressure grading
stage then fuses ONSD metrics with clinical features to enable the prediction
of ICP grades, thereby demonstrating an innovative blend of interpretable
ultrasound analysis and multi-source data integration for objective clinical
evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves a
validation accuracy of $0.845 \pm 0.071$ (with standard deviation from
five-fold cross-validation) and an independent test accuracy of 0.786,
significantly outperforming conventional threshold-based method ($0.637 \pm
0.111$ validation accuracy, $0.429$ test accuracy). Through effectively
reducing operator variability and integrating multi-source information, our
framework establishes a reliable non-invasive approach for clinical ICP
evaluation, holding promise for improving patient management in acute
neurological conditions.

Method: Proposes a framework with a learnable normal-information extractor that aggregates normal features from test images, coherence loss to associate features with normal regions, decoder to reconstruct normal content, and pseudo-anomaly augmentation for training stability.

Result: Experiments on datasets from three IC process stages show consistent improvements over existing approaches and strong robustness to product variability.

Conclusion: The proposed unsupervised framework effectively segments IC defects without external normal support, demonstrating superior performance and robustness across diverse IC manufacturing scenarios.

Abstract: Modern Integrated-Circuit(IC) manufacturing introduces diverse, fine-grained
defects that depress yield and reliability. Most industrial defect segmentation
compares a test image against an external normal set, a strategy that is
brittle for IC imagery where layouts vary across products and accurate
alignment is difficult. We observe that defects are predominantly local, while
each image still contains rich, repeatable normal patterns. We therefore
propose an unsupervised IC defect segmentation framework that requires no
external normal support. A learnable normal-information extractor aggregates
representative normal features from the test image, and a coherence loss
enforces their association with normal regions. Guided by these features, a
decoder reconstructs only normal content; the reconstruction residual then
segments defects. Pseudo-anomaly augmentation further stabilizes training.
Experiments on datasets from three IC process stages show consistent
improvements over existing approaches and strong robustness to product
variability.

*Umaima Rahman,Raza Imam,Mohammad Yaqub,Dwarikanath Mahapatra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DRiFt is a feature decoupling framework that separates clinically relevant signals from task-agnostic noise in medical VLMs, improving robustness to distribution shifts and enhancing clinical reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical vision-language models often learn task-agnostic correlations due to variability in imaging protocols and free-text reports, limiting their generalizability and increasing failure risks in real-world clinical settings.

Method: Uses parameter-efficient tuning (LoRA) and learnable prompt tokens to explicitly separate clinically relevant signals from task-agnostic noise. Curates high-quality, clinically grounded image-text pairs by generating captions for diverse medical datasets to enhance cross-modal alignment.

Result: Improves in-distribution performance by +11.4% Top-1 accuracy and +3.3% Macro-F1 over prior prompt-based methods, while maintaining strong robustness across unseen datasets.

Conclusion: Disentangling task-relevant features and careful alignment significantly enhance model generalization and reduce unpredictable behavior under domain shift, contributing to safer, more trustworthy VLMs for clinical use.

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) offer promise for clinical decision
support, yet their reliability under distribution shifts remains a major
concern for safe deployment. These models often learn task-agnostic
correlations due to variability in imaging protocols and free-text reports,
limiting their generalizability and increasing the risk of failure in
real-world settings. We propose DRiFt, a structured feature decoupling
framework that explicitly separates clinically relevant signals from
task-agnostic noise using parameter-efficient tuning (LoRA) and learnable
prompt tokens. To enhance cross-modal alignment and reduce uncertainty, we
curate high-quality, clinically grounded image-text pairs by generating
captions for a diverse medical dataset. Our approach improves in-distribution
performance by +11.4% Top-1 accuracy and +3.3% Macro-F1 over prior prompt-based
methods, while maintaining strong robustness across unseen datasets. Ablation
studies reveal that disentangling task-relevant features and careful alignment
significantly enhance model generalization and reduce unpredictable behavior
under domain shift. These insights contribute toward building safer, more
trustworthy VLMs for clinical use. The code is available at

*Yuchan Jie,Yushen Xu,Xiaosong Li,Fuqiang Zhou,Jianming Lv,Huafeng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FS-Diff is a joint image fusion and super-resolution method that uses semantic guidance and clarity-aware mechanisms to produce high-quality fused images with enhanced details and semantic information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image fusion techniques struggle with corrupted target/background structures, low resolution, and weak semantic information in real-world applications like military reconnaissance and long-range detection.

Method: Unifies image fusion and super-resolution as conditional generation using semantic guidance, clarity sensing mechanism, bidirectional feature Mamba for global feature extraction, and modified U-Net for random iterative denoising at multiple noise levels.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods at multiple magnifications on six public datasets and their new AVMS benchmark, recovering richer details and semantics in fused images.

Conclusion: FS-Diff effectively addresses the limitations of current fusion techniques by integrating semantic guidance and clarity-aware mechanisms, producing superior high-resolution fusion results with enhanced cross-modal features.

Abstract: As an influential information fusion and low-level vision technique, image
fusion integrates complementary information from source images to yield an
informative fused image. A few attempts have been made in recent years to
jointly realize image fusion and super-resolution. However, in real-world
applications such as military reconnaissance and long-range detection missions,
the target and background structures in multimodal images are easily corrupted,
with low resolution and weak semantic information, which leads to suboptimal
results in current fusion techniques. In response, we propose FS-Diff, a
semantic guidance and clarity-aware joint image fusion and super-resolution
method. FS-Diff unifies image fusion and super-resolution as a conditional
generation problem. It leverages semantic guidance from the proposed clarity
sensing mechanism for adaptive low-resolution perception and cross-modal
feature extraction. Specifically, we initialize the desired fused result as
pure Gaussian noise and introduce the bidirectional feature Mamba to extract
the global features of the multimodal images. Moreover, utilizing the source
images and semantics as conditions, we implement a random iterative denoising
process via a modified U-Net network. This network istrained for denoising at
multiple noise levels to produce high-resolution fusion results with
cross-modal features and abundant semantic information. We also construct a
powerful aerial view multiscene (AVMS) benchmark covering 600 pairs of images.
Extensive joint image fusion and super-resolution experiments on six public and
our AVMS datasets demonstrated that FS-Diff outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods at multiple magnifications and can recover richer details and semantics
in the fused images. The code is available at

### [58] [Semantic Concentration for Self-Supervised Dense Representations Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09429)
*Peisong Wen,Qianqian Xu,Siran Dai,Runmin Cong,Qingming Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the over-dispersion problem in dense self-supervised learning by proposing explicit semantic concentration methods including patch correspondence distillation with noise-tolerant ranking loss and object-aware filtering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mainstream image-level SSL methods suffer from over-dispersion where patches from the same instance/category scatter, harming downstream dense task performance. The authors aim to enable explicit semantic concentration for dense SSL.

Method: Proposes two main techniques: 1) Patch correspondence distillation with noise-tolerant ranking loss that extends AP loss to continuous targets, and 2) Object-aware filter that maps output space to object-based space using learnable prototypes via cross-attention.

Result: Empirical studies across various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in addressing over-dispersion and improving dense SSL performance.

Conclusion: The proposed CoTAP method successfully enables explicit semantic concentration for dense SSL, overcoming limitations of image-level approaches and providing effective solutions for patch-level representation learning.

Abstract: Recent advances in image-level self-supervised learning (SSL) have made
significant progress, yet learning dense representations for patches remains
challenging. Mainstream methods encounter an over-dispersion phenomenon that
patches from the same instance/category scatter, harming downstream performance
on dense tasks. This work reveals that image-level SSL avoids over-dispersion
by involving implicit semantic concentration. Specifically, the non-strict
spatial alignment ensures intra-instance consistency, while shared patterns,
i.e., similar parts of within-class instances in the input space, ensure
inter-image consistency. Unfortunately, these approaches are infeasible for
dense SSL due to their spatial sensitivity and complicated scene-centric data.
These observations motivate us to explore explicit semantic concentration for
dense SSL. First, to break the strict spatial alignment, we propose to distill
the patch correspondences. Facing noisy and imbalanced pseudo labels, we
propose a noise-tolerant ranking loss. The core idea is extending the Average
Precision (AP) loss to continuous targets, such that its decision-agnostic and
adaptive focusing properties prevent the student model from being misled.
Second, to discriminate the shared patterns from complicated scenes, we propose
the object-aware filter to map the output space to an object-based space.
Specifically, patches are represented by learnable prototypes of objects via
cross-attention. Last but not least, empirical studies across various tasks
soundly support the effectiveness of our method. Code is available in

*Yushen Xu,Xiaosong Li,Yuchun Wang,Xiaoqi Cheng,Huafeng Li,Haishu Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlexiD-Fuse is a diffusion-based medical image fusion network that handles flexible numbers of input modalities (2 or 3) with the same weights, outperforming existing fixed-modality methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical image fusion methods only work with fixed numbers of input modalities (e.g., only 2 or 3 modalities), which limits clinical application where varying numbers of modalities may be available.

Method: Transforms diffusion fusion into maximum likelihood estimation using hierarchical Bayesian modeling and incorporates Expectation-Maximization algorithm into diffusion sampling to handle varying input quantities.

Result: Achieves best performance on Harvard datasets with 9 evaluation metrics for medical image fusion with varying inputs, and shows effectiveness in extension experiments on infrared-visible, multi-exposure, and multi-focus fusion tasks.

Conclusion: FlexiD-Fuse successfully addresses the limitation of fixed-modality inputs in medical image fusion and demonstrates superior performance across various fusion tasks with arbitrary numbers of input images.

Abstract: Different modalities of medical images provide unique physiological and
anatomical information for diseases. Multi-modal medical image fusion
integrates useful information from different complementary medical images with
different modalities, producing a fused image that comprehensively and
objectively reflects lesion characteristics to assist doctors in clinical
diagnosis. However, existing fusion methods can only handle a fixed number of
modality inputs, such as accepting only two-modal or tri-modal inputs, and
cannot directly process varying input quantities, which hinders their
application in clinical settings. To tackle this issue, we introduce
FlexiD-Fuse, a diffusion-based image fusion network designed to accommodate
flexible quantities of input modalities. It can end-to-end process two-modal
and tri-modal medical image fusion under the same weight. FlexiD-Fuse
transforms the diffusion fusion problem, which supports only fixed-condition
inputs, into a maximum likelihood estimation problem based on the diffusion
process and hierarchical Bayesian modeling. By incorporating the
Expectation-Maximization algorithm into the diffusion sampling iteration
process, FlexiD-Fuse can generate high-quality fused images with cross-modal
information from source images, independently of the number of input images. We
compared the latest two and tri-modal medical image fusion methods, tested them
on Harvard datasets, and evaluated them using nine popular metrics. The
experimental results show that our method achieves the best performance in
medical image fusion with varying inputs. Meanwhile, we conducted extensive
extension experiments on infrared-visible, multi-exposure, and multi-focus
image fusion tasks with arbitrary numbers, and compared them with the
perspective SOTA methods. The results of the extension experiments consistently
demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A compact 3D Attention UNet model for glioma segmentation in Sub-Saharan Africa achieves strong performance (Dice scores 0.76-0.85) despite limited data quality and quantity, with efficient inference on consumer hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the scarcity of high-quality annotated MRI data in Sub-Saharan Africa for glioma segmentation, which is critical for diagnosis and treatment planning in resource-constrained clinical settings.

Method: 3D Attention UNet architecture with residual blocks, enhanced through transfer learning from pre-trained weights on BraTS 2021 dataset, evaluated on BraTS-Africa dataset (95 MRI cases).

Result: Achieved Dice scores of 0.76 (Enhancing Tumor), 0.80 (Necrotic and Non-Enhancing Tumor Core), and 0.85 (Surrounding Non-Functional Hemisphere) despite limited data quality.

Conclusion: The model demonstrates strong generalizability and practicality for low-resource settings with compact size (90MB) and fast inference (sub-minute per volume), contributing to equitable AI in global health.

Abstract: Gliomas are the most prevalent type of primary brain tumors, and their
accurate segmentation from MRI is critical for diagnosis, treatment planning,
and longitudinal monitoring. However, the scarcity of high-quality annotated
imaging data in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) poses a significant challenge for
deploying advanced segmentation models in clinical workflows. This study
introduces a robust and computationally efficient deep learning framework
tailored for resource-constrained settings. We leveraged a 3D Attention UNet
architecture augmented with residual blocks and enhanced through transfer
learning from pre-trained weights on the BraTS 2021 dataset. Our model was
evaluated on 95 MRI cases from the BraTS-Africa dataset, a benchmark for glioma
segmentation in SSA MRI data. Despite the limited data quality and quantity,
our approach achieved Dice scores of 0.76 for the Enhancing Tumor (ET), 0.80
for Necrotic and Non-Enhancing Tumor Core (NETC), and 0.85 for Surrounding
Non-Functional Hemisphere (SNFH). These results demonstrate the
generalizability of the proposed model and its potential to support clinical
decision making in low-resource settings. The compact architecture,
approximately 90 MB, and sub-minute per-volume inference time on consumer-grade
hardware further underscore its practicality for deployment in SSA health
systems. This work contributes toward closing the gap in equitable AI for
global health by empowering underserved regions with high-performing and
accessible medical imaging solutions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: New politically-focused deepfake detection dataset with 3M real images and 963k synthetic images from modern generative models, plus a crowdsourced adversarial platform to keep detection methods robust against evolving threats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfakes are intensifying misinformation spread in political contexts, and existing detection datasets are limited by outdated generation methods, low realism, or single-face imagery, making them ineffective for general synthetic image detection.

Method: Created a comprehensive dataset with real images paired with captions, used to generate high-quality synthetic images from proprietary and open-source models. Introduced a crowdsourced adversarial platform where participants generate challenging synthetic images to test detection methods.

Result: The dataset provides modern benchmarking capabilities, and the human perception study shows that recent proprietary models produce synthetic images increasingly indistinguishable from real ones, complicating public identification.

Conclusion: The ongoing community-driven initiative ensures deepfake detection methods remain robust and adaptive, proactively safeguarding public discourse from sophisticated misinformation threats through continuous adversarial testing.

Abstract: Deepfakes, synthetic media created using advanced AI techniques, have
intensified the spread of misinformation, particularly in politically sensitive
contexts. Existing deepfake detection datasets are often limited, relying on
outdated generation methods, low realism, or single-face imagery, restricting
the effectiveness for general synthetic image detection. By analyzing social
media posts, we identify multiple modalities through which deepfakes propagate
misinformation. Furthermore, our human perception study demonstrates that
recently developed proprietary models produce synthetic images increasingly
indistinguishable from real ones, complicating accurate identification by the
general public. Consequently, we present a comprehensive, politically-focused
dataset specifically crafted for benchmarking detection against modern
generative models. This dataset contains three million real images paired with
descriptive captions, which are used for generating 963k corresponding
high-quality synthetic images from a mix of proprietary and open-source models.
Recognizing the continual evolution of generative techniques, we introduce an
innovative crowdsourced adversarial platform, where participants are
incentivized to generate and submit challenging synthetic images. This ongoing
community-driven initiative ensures that deepfake detection methods remain
robust and adaptive, proactively safeguarding public discourse from
sophisticated misinformation threats.

*Ha Linh Nguyen,Tze Ho Elden Tse,Angela Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes using whole-body linear and angular momentum as a constraint to link local motion with global movement in human motion generation, reducing foot sliding and improving balance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion models fail to capture the physical coupling between local joint motion and global root movement, while physics-based approaches are computationally expensive.

Method: Introduces a new loss term that enforces consistency between generated momentum profiles and ground-truth data, using momentum as a physically grounded constraint.

Result: Incorporating the momentum loss reduces foot sliding and jitter, improves balance, and preserves motion accuracy.

Conclusion: Momentum provides an effective physical constraint for coupling local and global motion in human motion generation, offering computational efficiency compared to full physics simulation.

Abstract: Many studies decompose human motion into local motion in a frame attached to
the root joint and global motion of the root joint in the world frame, treating
them separately. However, these two components are not independent. Global
movement arises from interactions with the environment, which are, in turn,
driven by changes in the body configuration. Motion models often fail to
precisely capture this physical coupling between local and global dynamics,
while deriving global trajectories from joint torques and external forces is
computationally expensive and complex. To address these challenges, we propose
using whole-body linear and angular momentum as a constraint to link local
motion with global movement. Since momentum reflects the aggregate effect of
joint-level dynamics on the body's movement through space, it provides a
physically grounded way to relate local joint behavior to global displacement.
Building on this insight, we introduce a new loss term that enforces
consistency between the generated momentum profiles and those observed in
ground-truth data. Incorporating our loss reduces foot sliding and jitter,
improves balance, and preserves the accuracy of the recovered motion. Code and
data are available at the project page https://hlinhn.github.io/momentum_bmvc.

TL;DR: A Transformer-based framework for predicting region-wise correspondence between manga line art images without pre-existing labels, achieving high accuracy and consistent results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Region-wise correspondence is fundamental for manga processing applications like automatic colorization and frame generation, but remains unexplored in realistic scenarios without pre-existing segmentation or annotations.

Method: Divide line art images into patches, use Transformer-based framework to learn patch-level similarities, apply edge-aware clustering and region matching algorithm to convert to region-level correspondences.

Result: Achieves high patch-level accuracy (96.34%) and generates consistent region-level correspondences on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates strong potential for real-world manga applications by effectively solving the novel task of predicting region-wise correspondence without pre-existing labels.

Abstract: Understanding region-wise correspondence between manga line art images is a
fundamental task in manga processing, enabling downstream applications such as
automatic line art colorization and in-between frame generation. However, this
task remains largely unexplored, especially in realistic scenarios without
pre-existing segmentation or annotations. In this paper, we introduce a novel
and practical task: predicting region-wise correspondence between raw manga
line art images without any pre-existing labels or masks. To tackle this
problem, we divide each line art image into a set of patches and propose a
Transformer-based framework that learns patch-level similarities within and
across images. We then apply edge-aware clustering and a region matching
algorithm to convert patch-level predictions into coherent region-level
correspondences. To support training and evaluation, we develop an automatic
annotation pipeline and manually refine a subset of the data to construct
benchmark datasets. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our
method achieves high patch-level accuracy (e.g., 96.34%) and generates
consistent region-level correspondences, highlighting its potential for
real-world manga applications.

TL;DR: SGDF method uses generative diffusion for robust multi-view clustering with noisy/missing data, achieving SOTA results with GDCN framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address low-quality data issues in multi-view clustering caused by noisy views and missing data, which degrade fusion performance.

Method: Proposes Stochastic Generative Diffusion Fusion (SGDF) with multiple generative mechanism for multi-view features, then builds Generative Diffusion Contrastive Network (GDCN) on top.

Result: Extensive experiments show GDCN achieves state-of-the-art results in deep multi-view clustering tasks.

Conclusion: SGDF provides effective solution for handling low-quality multi-view data through generative diffusion fusion, enabling robust clustering performance.

Abstract: In recent years, Multi-View Clustering (MVC) has been significantly advanced
under the influence of deep learning. By integrating heterogeneous data from
multiple views, MVC enhances clustering analysis, making multi-view fusion
critical to clustering performance. However, there is a problem of low-quality
data in multi-view fusion. This problem primarily arises from two reasons: 1)
Certain views are contaminated by noisy data. 2) Some views suffer from missing
data. This paper proposes a novel Stochastic Generative Diffusion Fusion (SGDF)
method to address this problem. SGDF leverages a multiple generative mechanism
for the multi-view feature of each sample. It is robust to low-quality data.
Building on SGDF, we further present the Generative Diffusion Contrastive
Network (GDCN). Extensive experiments show that GDCN achieves the
state-of-the-art results in deep MVC tasks. The source code is publicly

TL;DR: DualTrack is a novel dual-encoder architecture for sensorless 3D ultrasound that decouples local and global feature extraction to achieve state-of-the-art trajectory estimation and 3D reconstruction with <5mm error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3D ultrasound systems are costly and complex, while existing sensorless approaches either ignore global anatomical features or tightly couple them with local features, limiting robustness in modeling complementary aspects.

Method: Proposes DualTrack with separate local and global encoders - local encoder uses dense spatiotemporal convolutions for fine-grained features, global encoder uses image backbone with temporal attention for anatomical features. Features are fused via lightweight module for trajectory estimation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on large public benchmark, outperforms previous methods, and yields average reconstruction error below 5 mm with globally consistent 3D reconstructions.

Conclusion: Decoupling local and global feature extraction through specialized encoders enables more robust 3D ultrasound probe trajectory estimation and superior reconstruction performance compared to prior approaches.

Abstract: Three-dimensional ultrasound (US) offers many clinical advantages over
conventional 2D imaging, yet its widespread adoption is limited by the cost and
complexity of traditional 3D systems. Sensorless 3D US, which uses deep
learning to estimate a 3D probe trajectory from a sequence of 2D US images, is
a promising alternative. Local features, such as speckle patterns, can help
predict frame-to-frame motion, while global features, such as coarse shapes and
anatomical structures, can situate the scan relative to anatomy and help
predict its general shape. In prior approaches, global features are either
ignored or tightly coupled with local feature extraction, restricting the
ability to robustly model these two complementary aspects. We propose
DualTrack, a novel dual-encoder architecture that leverages decoupled local and
global encoders specialized for their respective scales of feature extraction.
The local encoder uses dense spatiotemporal convolutions to capture
fine-grained features, while the global encoder utilizes an image backbone
(e.g., a 2D CNN or foundation model) and temporal attention layers to embed
high-level anatomical features and long-range dependencies. A lightweight
fusion module then combines these features to estimate the trajectory.
Experimental results on a large public benchmark show that DualTrack achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy and globally consistent 3D reconstructions,
outperforming previous methods and yielding an average reconstruction error
below 5 mm.

Conclusion: Feature alignment with pre-trained vision encoders is beneficial for video diffusion models. The proposed Align4Gen framework effectively integrates multi-feature fusion and alignment to improve video generation quality across different tasks.

Abstract: Video diffusion models have advanced rapidly in the recent years as a result
of series of architectural innovations (e.g., diffusion transformers) and use
of novel training objectives (e.g., flow matching). In contrast, less attention

this work, we show that training video diffusion models can benefit from
aligning the intermediate features of the video generator with feature
representations of pre-trained vision encoders. We propose a new metric and
conduct an in-depth analysis of various vision encoders to evaluate their
discriminability and temporal consistency, thereby assessing their suitability
for video feature alignment. Based on the analysis, we present Align4Gen which
provides a novel multi-feature fusion and alignment method integrated into
video diffusion model training. We evaluate Align4Gen both for unconditional

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Study reveals race and sex-based shortcut learning and bias in deep learning models for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis from MRI scans, showing models can identify demographic attributes and exhibit performance drops with imbalanced training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning algorithms for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis from MRI may suffer from shortcut learning and demographic bias, potentially leading to unfair performance against underrepresented racial and gender groups.

Method: Used multiple datasets and DL models (ResNet and SwinTransformer) to: 1) test if models can identify race/sex from brain MRI scans, 2) investigate performance drops with imbalanced training data, and 3) conduct quantitative/qualitative analysis of feature attributions in different brain regions.

Result: Demonstrated existence of both race and sex-based shortcut learning and bias in DL-based AD classification, with models able to identify demographic attributes and showing performance bias with imbalanced data.

Conclusion: The work establishes foundation for developing fairer DL diagnostic tools in brain MRI by identifying and addressing demographic bias issues in Alzheimer's disease classification models.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the gold standard for brain imaging. Deep
learning (DL) algorithms have been proposed to aid in the diagnosis of diseases
such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) from MRI scans. However, DL algorithms can
suffer from shortcut learning, in which spurious features, not directly related
to the output label, are used for prediction. When these features are related
to protected attributes, they can lead to performance bias against
underrepresented protected groups, such as those defined by race and sex. In
this work, we explore the potential for shortcut learning and demographic bias
in DL based AD diagnosis from MRI. We first investigate if DL algorithms can
identify race or sex from 3D brain MRI scans to establish the presence or
otherwise of race and sex based distributional shifts. Next, we investigate
whether training set imbalance by race or sex can cause a drop in model
performance, indicating shortcut learning and bias. Finally, we conduct a
quantitative and qualitative analysis of feature attributions in different
brain regions for both the protected attribute and AD classification tasks.
Through these experiments, and using multiple datasets and DL models (ResNet
and SwinTransformer), we demonstrate the existence of both race and sex based
shortcut learning and bias in DL based AD classification. Our work lays the
foundation for fairer DL diagnostic tools in brain MRI. The code is provided at

*Sijun Dong,Yuxuan Hu,LiBo Wang,Geng Chen,Xiaoliang Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PeftCD is a parameter-efficient change detection framework using Vision Foundation Models with LoRA and Adapter modules, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple remote sensing datasets with minimal additional parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in remote sensing change detection including pseudo changes, limited labeled samples, and cross-domain generalization difficulties in multi-temporal and multi-source imagery.

Method: Uses weight-sharing Siamese encoder from Vision Foundation Models (SAM2 and DINOv3) with integrated LoRA and Adapter modules for parameter-efficient fine-tuning, complemented by a lightweight decoder.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance across 7 public datasets: SYSU-CD (73.81% IoU), WHUCD (92.05%), MSRSCD (64.07%), MLCD (76.89%), CDD (97.01%), S2Looking (52.25%), and LEVIR-CD (85.62%), with precise boundary delineation and strong pseudo-change suppression.

Conclusion: PeftCD offers an optimal balance of accuracy, efficiency, and generalization, providing a powerful and scalable paradigm for adapting large-scale VFMs to real-world remote sensing change detection applications.

Abstract: To tackle the prevalence of pseudo changes, the scarcity of labeled samples,
and the difficulty of cross-domain generalization in multi-temporal and
multi-source remote sensing imagery, we propose PeftCD, a change detection
framework built upon Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) with Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT). At its core, PeftCD employs a weight-sharing Siamese
encoder derived from a VFM, into which LoRA and Adapter modules are seamlessly
integrated. This design enables highly efficient task adaptation by training
only a minimal set of additional parameters. To fully unlock the potential of
VFMs, we investigate two leading backbones: the Segment Anything Model v2
(SAM2), renowned for its strong segmentation priors, and DINOv3, a
state-of-the-art self-supervised representation learner. The framework is
complemented by a deliberately lightweight decoder, ensuring the focus remains
on the powerful feature representations from the backbones. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that PeftCD achieves state-of-the-art performance
across multiple public datasets, including SYSU-CD (IoU 73.81%), WHUCD
(92.05%), MSRSCD (64.07%), MLCD (76.89%), CDD (97.01%), S2Looking (52.25%) and
LEVIR-CD (85.62%), with notably precise boundary delineation and strong
suppression of pseudo-changes. In summary, PeftCD presents an optimal balance
of accuracy, efficiency, and generalization. It offers a powerful and scalable
paradigm for adapting large-scale VFMs to real-world remote sensing change
detection applications. The code and pretrained models will be released at

*Lingdong Kong,Dongyue Lu,Ao Liang,Rong Li,Yuhao Dong,Tianshuai Hu,Lai Xing Ng,Wei Tsang Ooi,Benoit R. Cottereau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Talk2Event is the first large-scale benchmark for language-driven object grounding using event camera data, featuring 5,567 driving scenes with 13,458 annotated objects and 30,000+ validated referring expressions enriched with structured attributes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras offer microsecond precision and reliability under challenging conditions, but their integration with natural language understanding remains unexplored, creating a gap in multimodal perception for dynamic scenes.

Method: Built on real-world driving scenarios, the benchmark includes carefully validated referring expressions with four structured attributes: appearance, status, relation to viewer, and relation to surrounding objects to capture spatial, temporal and relational cues.

Result: The benchmark enables interpretable and compositional grounding that supports contextual reasoning beyond simple object recognition in dynamic environments.

Conclusion: Talk2Event serves as a foundation for advancing multimodal and temporally-aware perception with applications in robotics, human-AI interaction, and other domains requiring dynamic scene understanding.

Abstract: Event cameras capture changes in brightness with microsecond precision and
remain reliable under motion blur and challenging illumination, offering clear
advantages for modeling highly dynamic scenes. Yet, their integration with
natural language understanding has received little attention, leaving a gap in
multimodal perception. To address this, we introduce Talk2Event, the first
large-scale benchmark for language-driven object grounding using event data.
Built on real-world driving scenarios, Talk2Event comprises 5,567 scenes,
13,458 annotated objects, and more than 30,000 carefully validated referring
expressions. Each expression is enriched with four structured attributes --
appearance, status, relation to the viewer, and relation to surrounding objects
-- that explicitly capture spatial, temporal, and relational cues. This
attribute-centric design supports interpretable and compositional grounding,
enabling analysis that moves beyond simple object recognition to contextual
reasoning in dynamic environments. We envision Talk2Event as a foundation for
advancing multimodal and temporally-aware perception, with applications
spanning robotics, human-AI interaction, and so on.

*Yikang Ding,Jiwen Liu,Wenyuan Zhang,Zekun Wang,Wentao Hu,Liyuan Cui,Mingming Lao,Yingchao Shao,Hui Liu,Xiaohan Li,Ming Chen,Xiaoqiang Liu,Yu-Shen Liu,Pengfei Wan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Kling-Avatar is a novel cascaded framework that unifies multimodal instruction understanding with photorealistic portrait generation, enabling semantically grounded, high-fidelity audio-driven avatar video synthesis with superior performance in lip sync, emotion expressiveness, and long-duration generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing audio-driven avatar methods treat instruction conditioning as low-level tracking without modeling communicative purpose, compromising narrative coherence and character expressiveness. There's a need to bridge the gap between multimodal instruction understanding and realistic avatar generation.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: 1) MLLM director produces blueprint video conditioned on diverse instructions to govern high-level semantics (motion, emotions), 2) Parallel generation of sub-clips using first-last frame strategy guided by blueprint keyframes, enabling global-to-local detail preservation.

Result: Generates vivid, fluent, long-duration videos at 1080p and 48 fps with superior performance in lip synchronization accuracy, emotion/dynamic expressiveness, instruction controllability, identity preservation, and cross-domain generalization. Evaluated on 375 curated samples.

Conclusion: Kling-Avatar establishes a new benchmark for semantically grounded, high-fidelity audio-driven avatar synthesis, making it suitable for real-world applications like digital human livestreaming and vlogging.

Abstract: Recent advances in audio-driven avatar video generation have significantly
enhanced audio-visual realism. However, existing methods treat instruction
conditioning merely as low-level tracking driven by acoustic or visual cues,
without modeling the communicative purpose conveyed by the instructions. This
limitation compromises their narrative coherence and character expressiveness.
To bridge this gap, we introduce Kling-Avatar, a novel cascaded framework that
unifies multimodal instruction understanding with photorealistic portrait
generation. Our approach adopts a two-stage pipeline. In the first stage, we
design a multimodal large language model (MLLM) director that produces a
blueprint video conditioned on diverse instruction signals, thereby governing
high-level semantics such as character motion and emotions. In the second
stage, guided by blueprint keyframes, we generate multiple sub-clips in
parallel using a first-last frame strategy. This global-to-local framework
preserves fine-grained details while faithfully encoding the high-level intent
behind multimodal instructions. Our parallel architecture also enables fast and
stable generation of long-duration videos, making it suitable for real-world
applications such as digital human livestreaming and vlogging. To
comprehensively evaluate our method, we construct a benchmark of 375 curated
samples covering diverse instructions and challenging scenarios. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Kling-Avatar is capable of generating vivid,
fluent, long-duration videos at up to 1080p and 48 fps, achieving superior
performance in lip synchronization accuracy, emotion and dynamic
expressiveness, instruction controllability, identity preservation, and
cross-domain generalization. These results establish Kling-Avatar as a new
benchmark for semantically grounded, high-fidelity audio-driven avatar
synthesis.

*Daria Laslo,Efthymios Georgiou,Marius George Linguraru,Andreas Rauschecker,Sabine Muller,Catherine R. Jutzeler,Sarah Bruningk*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hybrid framework combining mathematical tumor growth model with guided diffusion model to predict and synthesize future brain tumor MRI scans from previous images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting spatio-temporal progression of brain tumors is crucial for clinical decision-making in neuro-oncology, especially in data-limited scenarios.

Method: Combines mechanistic ODE-based tumor growth model (capturing radiotherapy effects) with gradient-guided denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) to synthesize anatomically feasible future MRIs conditioned on predicted tumor burden.

Result: Generates realistic follow-up scans based on spatial similarity metrics, produces tumor growth probability maps showing clinically relevant extent and directionality (95th percentile Hausdorff Distance), validated on BraTS and pediatric glioma datasets.

Conclusion: Enables biologically informed image generation that accounts for mechanistic priors, offering generative-space-time predictions for brain tumor progression.

Abstract: Predicting the spatio-temporal progression of brain tumors is essential for
guiding clinical decisions in neuro-oncology. We propose a hybrid mechanistic
learning framework that combines a mathematical tumor growth model with a
guided denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) to synthesize anatomically
feasible future MRIs from preceding scans. The mechanistic model, formulated as
a system of ordinary differential equations, captures temporal tumor dynamics
including radiotherapy effects and estimates future tumor burden. These
estimates condition a gradient-guided DDIM, enabling image synthesis that
aligns with both predicted growth and patient anatomy. We train our model on
the BraTS adult and pediatric glioma datasets and evaluate on 60 axial slices
of in-house longitudinal pediatric diffuse midline glioma (DMG) cases. Our
framework generates realistic follow-up scans based on spatial similarity
metrics. It also introduces tumor growth probability maps, which capture both
clinically relevant extent and directionality of tumor growth as shown by 95th
percentile Hausdorff Distance. The method enables biologically informed image
generation in data-limited scenarios, offering generative-space-time
predictions that account for mechanistic priors.

### [73] [Measuring Epistemic Humility in Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09658)
*Bingkui Tong,Jiaer Xia,Sifeng Shang,Kaiyang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HumbleBench is a new benchmark for evaluating multimodal LLMs' ability to reject incorrect answers and demonstrate epistemic humility by choosing "None of the above" when no provided options match the visual input.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLM benchmarks focus only on recognition accuracy but overlook the critical capability of rejecting plausible but incorrect answers, which is essential for trustworthy AI in safety-critical applications.

Method: Built from panoptic scene graph dataset using fine-grained annotations to extract ground-truth entities/relations, then used GPT-4-Turbo to generate multiple-choice questions with "None of the above" option, followed by rigorous manual filtering.

Result: Evaluated various state-of-the-art MLLMs and shared findings on their ability to reject false options across object, relation, and attribute hallucination types.

Conclusion: HumbleBench fills a key gap in current evaluation by testing epistemic humility and provides a more realistic measure of MLLM reliability for safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) -- where the model
generates content inconsistent with the input image -- pose significant risks
in real-world applications, from misinformation in visual question answering to
unsafe errors in decision-making. Existing benchmarks primarily test
recognition accuracy, i.e., evaluating whether models can select the correct
answer among distractors. This overlooks an equally critical capability for
trustworthy AI: recognizing when none of the provided options are correct, a
behavior reflecting epistemic humility. We present HumbleBench, a new
hallucination benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' ability to reject plausible
but incorrect answers across three hallucination types: object, relation, and
attribute. Built from a panoptic scene graph dataset, we leverage fine-grained
scene graph annotations to extract ground-truth entities and relations, and
prompt GPT-4-Turbo to generate multiple-choice questions, followed by a
rigorous manual filtering process. Each question includes a "None of the above"
option, requiring models not only to recognize correct visual information but
also to identify when no provided answer is valid. We evaluate a variety of
state-of-the-art MLLMs -- including both general-purpose and specialized
reasoning models -- on HumbleBench and share valuable findings and insights
with the community. By incorporating explicit false-option rejection,
HumbleBench fills a key gap in current evaluation suites, providing a more
realistic measure of MLLM reliability in safety-critical settings. Our code and
dataset are released publicly and can be accessed at

TL;DR: UAE framework unifies image understanding (I2T) and generation (T2I) through auto-encoder paradigm with reconstruction fidelity as training objective, using RL-based Unified-GRPO to achieve bidirectional improvement between caption generation and image reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified multimodal learning framework that bridges image understanding and generation through coherent bidirectional information flow, bringing mutual gains between the two processes.

Method: Proposes UAE framework with: 1) Pre-training decoder with large-scale image captions, 2) Unified-GRPO RL approach with three stages: cold-start initialization, generation for understanding (encoder trained to produce informative captions), and understanding for generation (decoder refined to reconstruct from detailed captions).

Result: Encoder autonomously produces more descriptive captions while decoder demonstrates improved ability to understand intricate descriptions, resulting in high-fidelity reconstructions. Introduced Unified-Bench benchmark for evaluating unification degree.

Conclusion: The auto-encoder paradigm with reconstruction fidelity as unified objective successfully enables bidirectional improvement between understanding and generation, achieving striking reconstruction fidelity through the proposed UAE framework and RL training approach.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an insightful paradigm through the Auto-Encoder
lens-understanding as the encoder (I2T) that compresses images into text, and
generation as the decoder (T2I) that reconstructs images from that text. Using
reconstruction fidelity as the unified training objective, we enforce the
coherent bidirectional information flow between the understanding and
generation processes, bringing mutual gains. To implement this, we propose UAE,
a novel framework for unified multimodal learning. We begin by pre-training the
decoder with large-scale long-context image captions to capture fine-grained
semantic and complex spatial relationships. We then propose Unified-GRPO via
reinforcement learning (RL), which covers three stages: (1) A cold-start phase
to gently initialize both encoder and decoder with a semantic reconstruction
loss; (2) Generation for Understanding, where the encoder is trained to
generate informative captions that maximize the decoder's reconstruction
quality, enhancing its visual understanding; (3) Understanding for Generation,
where the decoder is refined to reconstruct from these captions, forcing it to
leverage every detail and improving its long-context instruction following and
generation fidelity. For evaluation, we introduce Unified-Bench, the first
benchmark tailored to assess the degree of unification of the UMMs. A
surprising "aha moment" arises within the multimodal learning domain: as RL
progresses, the encoder autonomously produces more descriptive captions, while
the decoder simultaneously demonstrates a profound ability to understand these
intricate descriptions, resulting in reconstructions of striking fidelity.

TL;DR: NRMF is a novel 3D generative human motion prior that uses neural distance fields to model pose, velocity, and acceleration dynamics on Riemannian manifolds, enabling robust and physically plausible motion recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VAE and diffusion-based methods lack explicit modeling of human motion dynamics and physical plausibility. The authors aim to create a motion prior that respects the underlying geometry of human articulations and ensures temporal consistency.

Method: The method constructs neural distance fields (NDFs) on the product space of joint rotations, angular velocities, and accelerations. It introduces an adaptive-step hybrid algorithm for projection onto plausible motions and a geometric integrator for realistic motion trajectory generation.

Result: NRMF shows significant improvements in generalization across multiple input modalities and diverse tasks including denoising, motion in-betweening, and fitting to partial 2D/3D observations when trained on the AMASS dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed Neural Riemannian Motion Fields framework provides a rigorous and effective approach for 3D human motion generation and recovery, outperforming existing methods by explicitly modeling motion dynamics on appropriate geometric spaces.

Abstract: We introduce Neural Riemannian Motion Fields (NRMF), a novel 3D generative
human motion prior that enables robust, temporally consistent, and physically
plausible 3D motion recovery. Unlike existing VAE or diffusion-based methods,
our higher-order motion prior explicitly models the human motion in the zero
level set of a collection of neural distance fields (NDFs) corresponding to
pose, transition (velocity), and acceleration dynamics. Our framework is
rigorous in the sense that our NDFs are constructed on the product space of
joint rotations, their angular velocities, and angular accelerations,
respecting the geometry of the underlying articulations. We further introduce:
(i) a novel adaptive-step hybrid algorithm for projecting onto the set of
plausible motions, and (ii) a novel geometric integrator to "roll out"
realistic motion trajectories during test-time-optimization and generation. Our
experiments show significant and consistent gains: trained on the AMASS
dataset, NRMF remarkably generalizes across multiple input modalities and to
diverse tasks ranging from denoising to motion in-betweening and fitting to
partial 2D / 3D observations.

*Artem Lukoianov,Chenyang Yuan,Justin Solomon,Vincent Sitzmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper shows that locality in deep diffusion models stems from statistical properties of image datasets rather than convolutional neural network inductive biases, and develops an improved analytical denoiser.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why deep diffusion models perform better than the theoretically optimal denoiser, and to determine whether the performance gap is due to CNN architectural biases or statistical properties of image data.

Method: The authors demonstrate that an optimal parametric linear denoiser exhibits similar locality properties to deep neural denoisers, and show theoretically and experimentally that this locality arises from pixel correlations in natural images. They then use these insights to craft an improved analytical denoiser.

Result: The research reveals that locality emerges as a statistical property of image datasets rather than from CNN inductive biases. The crafted analytical denoiser better matches scores predicted by deep diffusion models compared to prior expert-crafted alternatives.

Conclusion: The performance gap between optimal denoisers and deep diffusion models is primarily due to statistical properties of natural image data (pixel correlations) rather than architectural biases of convolutional networks, enabling the creation of more accurate analytical models.

Abstract: Among generative models, diffusion models are uniquely intriguing due to the
existence of a closed-form optimal minimizer of their training objective, often
referred to as the optimal denoiser. However, diffusion using this optimal
denoiser merely reproduces images in the training set and hence fails to
capture the behavior of deep diffusion models. Recent work has attempted to
characterize this gap between the optimal denoiser and deep diffusion models,
proposing analytical, training-free models that can generate images that
resemble those generated by a trained UNet. The best-performing method
hypothesizes that shift equivariance and locality inductive biases of
convolutional neural networks are the cause of the performance gap, hence
incorporating these assumptions into its analytical model. In this work, we
present evidence that the locality in deep diffusion models emerges as a
statistical property of the image dataset, not due to the inductive bias of
convolutional neural networks. Specifically, we demonstrate that an optimal
parametric linear denoiser exhibits similar locality properties to the deep
neural denoisers. We further show, both theoretically and experimentally, that
this locality arises directly from the pixel correlations present in natural
image datasets. Finally, we use these insights to craft an analytical denoiser
that better matches scores predicted by a deep diffusion model than the prior
expert-crafted alternative.

TL;DR: SpatialVID is a large-scale video dataset with 7,089 hours of dynamic content and rich 3D annotations including camera poses, depth maps, and motion instructions, addressing the scarcity of high-quality training data for spatial intelligence tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current spatial intelligence models are constrained by limited training data - existing datasets are small, lack diversity, and have poor annotation quality, especially for real-world dynamic scenes with ground-truth camera motion.

Method: Collected 21,000+ hours of raw video, processed through hierarchical filtering into 2.7 million clips (7,089 hours), then annotated with camera poses, depth maps, dynamic masks, structured captions, and serialized motion instructions.

Result: Created SpatialVID dataset with diverse scenes, camera movements, and dense 3D annotations that analysis shows provides richness and diversity to improve model generalization and performance.

Conclusion: SpatialVID establishes itself as a key resource for video and 3D vision research by providing large-scale, high-quality training data that addresses current limitations in spatial intelligence model development.

Abstract: Significant progress has been made in spatial intelligence, spanning both
spatial reconstruction and world exploration. However, the scalability and
real-world fidelity of current models remain severely constrained by the
scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data. While several datasets
provide camera pose information, they are typically limited in scale,
diversity, and annotation richness, particularly for real-world dynamic scenes
with ground-truth camera motion. To this end, we collect \textbf{SpatialVID}, a
dataset consists of a large corpus of in-the-wild videos with diverse scenes,
camera movements and dense 3D annotations such as per-frame camera poses,
depth, and motion instructions. Specifically, we collect more than 21,000 hours
of raw video, and process them into 2.7 million clips through a hierarchical
filtering pipeline, totaling 7,089 hours of dynamic content. A subsequent
annotation pipeline enriches these clips with detailed spatial and semantic
information, including camera poses, depth maps, dynamic masks, structured
captions, and serialized motion instructions. Analysis of SpatialVID's data
statistics reveals a richness and diversity that directly foster improved model
generalization and performance, establishing it as a key asset for the video

Conclusion: The released dataset, benchmark, and evaluation code aim to catalyze reasoning-oriented T2I generation advancements in the open-source community.

Abstract: The advancement of open-source text-to-image (T2I) models has been hindered
by the absence of large-scale, reasoning-focused datasets and comprehensive
evaluation benchmarks, resulting in a performance gap compared to leading
closed-source systems. To address this challenge, We introduce FLUX-Reason-6M
and PRISM-Bench (Precise and Robust Image Synthesis Measurement Benchmark).
FLUX-Reason-6M is a massive dataset consisting of 6 million high-quality
FLUX-generated images and 20 million bilingual (English and Chinese)
descriptions specifically designed to teach complex reasoning. The image are
organized according to six key characteristics: Imagination, Entity, Text
rendering, Style, Affection, and Composition, and design explicit Generation
Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) to provide detailed breakdowns of image generation
steps. The whole data curation takes 15,000 A100 GPU days, providing the
