This paper investigates a black-box privacy attack, i.e., membership inference attack (MIA) on multi-modal vision-language models (VLMs). State-of-the-art research analyzes privacy attacks primarily to unimodal AI-ML systems, while recent studies indicate MMs can also be vulnerable to privacy attacks. While researchers have demonstrated that biologically inspired neural network representations can improve unimodal model resilience against adversarial attacks, it remains unexplored whether neuro-inspired MMs are resilient against privacy attacks. In this work, we introduce a systematic neuroscience-inspired topological regularization (tau) framework to analyze MM VLMs resilience against image-text-based inference privacy attacks. We examine this phenomenon using three VLMs: BLIP, PaliGemma 2, and ViT-GPT2, across three benchmark datasets: COCO, CC3M, and NoCaps. Our experiments compare the resilience of baseline and neuro VLMs (with topological regularization), where the tau > 0 configuration defines the NEURO variant of VLM. Our results on the BLIP model using the COCO dataset illustrate that MIA attack success in NEURO VLMs drops by 24% mean ROC-AUC, while achieving similar model utility (similarities between generated and reference captions) in terms of MPNet and ROUGE-2 metrics. This shows neuro VLMs are comparatively more resilient against privacy attacks, while not significantly compromising model utility. Our extensive evaluation with PaliGemma 2 and ViT-GPT2 models, on two additional datasets: CC3M and NoCaps, further validates the consistency of the findings.

Motivated by the goal of understanding how neurons encode information, compositional explanations leverage logical relationships between concepts to express the spatial alignment between neuron activations and human knowledge.

This paper addresses this limitation by introducing a framework for the vision domain that allows users to probe neurons for arbitrary concepts and datasets. Specifically, the framework leverages masks generated by open vocabulary semantic segmentation to compute open vocabulary compositional explanations. The proposed framework consists of three steps: specifying arbitrary concepts, generating semantic segmentation masks using open vocabulary models, and deriving compositional explanations from these masks. The paper compares the proposed framework with previous methods for computing compositional explanations both in terms of quantitative metrics and human interpretability, analyzes the differences in explanations when shifting from human-annotated data to model-annotated data, and showcases the additional capabilities provided by the framework in terms of flexibility of the explanations with respect to the tasks and properties of interest.", "AI": {"tldr": "A framework for open vocabulary compositional explanations of neurons in vision models using semantic segmentation masks instead of human-annotated data.", "motivation": "To overcome the limitation of existing compositional explanations that rely on human-annotated datasets, restricting their applicability to specific domains and predefined concepts.", "method": "Three-step framework: 1) specify arbitrary concepts, 2) generate semantic segmentation masks using open vocabulary models, 3) derive compositional explanations from these masks.", "result": "The framework enables probing neurons for arbitrary concepts and datasets, provides flexibility in explanations, and shows comparable performance to previous methods while expanding capabilities.", "conclusion": "The proposed framework successfully addresses the limitations of human-annotated compositional explanations by enabling open vocabulary analysis of neuron behavior across arbitrary concepts and datasets."}}

However, we observe that the effectiveness of MTE metrics is highly task-dependent and no single metric is universally optimal across all target datasets. To address this gap, we introduce MetaRank, a meta-learning framework for automatic, task-aware MTE metric selection. We formulate metric selection as a learning-to-rank problem. Rather than relying on conventional meta-features, MetaRank encodes textual descriptions of both datasets and MTE metrics using a pretrained language model, embedding them into a shared semantic space.

Although some priors introduce Knowledge Distillation to enhance student models, they overlook the fundamental differences in fine-grained vision comprehension caused by unbalanced vision tokens between the efficient student and vanilla teacher. In this paper, we propose EM-KD, a novel paradigm that enhances the Efficient MLLMs with Knowledge Distillation. To overcome the challenge of unbalanced vision tokens, we first calculate the Manhattan distance between the vision logits of teacher and student, and then align them in the spatial dimension with the Hungarian matching algorithm. After alignment, EM-KD introduces two distillation strategies: 1) Vision-Language Affinity Distillation (VLAD) and 2) Vision Semantic Distillation (VSD). Specifically, VLAD calculates the affinity matrix between text tokens and aligned vision tokens, and minimizes the smooth L1 distance of the student and the teacher affinity matrices. Considering the semantic richness of vision logits in the final layer, VSD employs the reverse KL divergence to measure the discrete probability distributions of the aligned vision logits over the vocabulary space. Comprehensive evaluation on diverse benchmarks demonstrates that EM-KD trained model outperforms prior Efficient MLLMs on both accuracy and efficiency with a large margin, validating its effectiveness.

This paper is the first to systematically investigate this seemingly implausible question. Towards this end, we propose a contrastive learning framework to train CamFormer, a dedicated encoder that projects camera pose trajectories into a joint embedding space, aligning them with natural language. We find that, contrary to its apparent simplicity, the camera trajectory is a remarkably informative signal to uncover video content. In other words, \"how you move\" can indeed reveal \"what you are doing\" (egocentric) or \"observing\" (exocentric). We demonstrate the versatility of our learned CamFormer embeddings on a diverse suite of downstream tasks, ranging from cross-modal alignment to classification and temporal analysis. Importantly, our representations are robust across diverse camera pose estimation methods, including both high-fidelity multi-sensored and standard RGB-only estimators.

We attribute this gap to the absence of a visual geometry learning process capable of reconstructing 3D space from 2D images. We present G$^2$VLM, a geometry grounded vision-language model that bridges two fundamental aspects of spatial intelligence: spatial 3D reconstruction and spatial understanding. G$^2$VLM natively leverages learned 3D visual geometry features to directly predict 3D attributes and enhance spatial reasoning tasks via in-context learning and interleaved reasoning. Our unified design is highly scalable for spatial understanding: it trains on abundant multi-view image and video data, while simultaneously leveraging the benefits of 3D visual priors that are typically only derived from hard-to-collect annotations. Experimental results demonstrate G$^2$VLM is proficient in both tasks, achieving comparable results to state-of-the-art feed-forward 3D reconstruction models and achieving better or competitive results across spatial understanding and reasoning tasks.

We introduce Canvas-to-Image, a unified framework that consolidates these heterogeneous controls into a single canvas interface, enabling users to generate images that faithfully reflect their intent. Our key idea is to encode diverse control signals into a single composite canvas image that the model can directly interpret for integrated visual-spatial reasoning. We further curate a suite of multi-task datasets and propose a Multi-Task Canvas Training strategy that optimizes the diffusion model to jointly understand and integrate heterogeneous controls into text-to-image generation within a unified learning paradigm. This joint training enables Canvas-to-Image to reason across multiple control modalities rather than relying on task-specific heuristics, and it generalizes well to multi-control scenarios during inference.
