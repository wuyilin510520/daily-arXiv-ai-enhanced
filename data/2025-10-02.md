*Usman Muhammad,Jorma Laaksonen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSUF module enhances hyperspectral image super-resolution by combining spectral unmixing with spatial-spectral feature extraction, using a custom gradient loss to improve both spatial details and spectral fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral SISR is challenging due to difficulty in restoring fine spatial details while preserving spectral fidelity across wavelengths, limiting conventional deep learning models.

Method: Proposed Spectral-Spatial Unmixing Fusion (SSUF) module integrated into 2D CNNs, combining spectral unmixing with spectral-spatial feature extraction, and a custom Spatial-Spectral Gradient Loss function.

Result: Experiments on three public remote sensing hyperspectral datasets show competitive performance with reduced model complexity.

Conclusion: The hybrid deep learning model with SSUF module effectively enhances both spatial resolution and spectral integrity in hyperspectral image super-resolution.

Abstract: Hyperspectral single image super-resolution (SISR) is a challenging task due
to the difficulty of restoring fine spatial details while preserving spectral
fidelity across a wide range of wavelengths, which limits the performance of
conventional deep learning models. To address this challenge, we introduce
Spectral-Spatial Unmixing Fusion (SSUF), a novel module that can be seamlessly
integrated into standard 2D convolutional architectures to enhance both spatial
resolution and spectral integrity. The SSUF combines spectral unmixing with
spectral--spatial feature extraction and guides a ResNet-based convolutional
neural network for improved reconstruction. In addition, we propose a custom
Spatial-Spectral Gradient Loss function that integrates mean squared error with
spatial and spectral gradient components, encouraging accurate reconstruction
of both spatial and spectral features. Experiments on three public remote
sensing hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that the proposed hybrid deep
learning model achieves competitive performance while reducing model
complexity.

### [2] [Review of Hallucination Understanding in Large Language and Vision Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00034)
*Zhengyi Ho,Siyuan Liang,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a unified framework to characterize hallucinations in large language and vision models, linking them to specific mechanisms in the model lifecycle to address underlying causes rather than surface symptoms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in AI models can propagate misinformation and cause financial/operational harm. Current understanding is fragmented, leading to solutions that only address symptoms rather than root causes.

Method: Developed a unified multi-level framework for characterizing image and text hallucinations across applications, using a task-modality interleaved approach to link hallucinations to specific model lifecycle mechanisms.

Result: Investigations revealed that hallucinations often stem from predictable patterns in data distributions and inherited biases, providing insights into their underlying causes.

Conclusion: The survey provides a foundation for developing more robust and effective solutions to hallucinations in real-world generative AI systems by promoting deeper understanding of their mechanisms.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of large language and vision models in real-world
applications has made urgent the need to address hallucinations -- instances
where models produce incorrect or nonsensical outputs. These errors can
propagate misinformation during deployment, leading to both financial and
operational harm. Although much research has been devoted to mitigating
hallucinations, our understanding of it is still incomplete and fragmented.
Without a coherent understanding of hallucinations, proposed solutions risk
mitigating surface symptoms rather than underlying causes, limiting their
effectiveness and generalizability in deployment. To tackle this gap, we first
present a unified, multi-level framework for characterizing both image and text
hallucinations across diverse applications, aiming to reduce conceptual
fragmentation. We then link these hallucinations to specific mechanisms within
a model's lifecycle, using a task-modality interleaved approach to promote a
more integrated understanding. Our investigations reveal that hallucinations
often stem from predictable patterns in data distributions and inherited
biases. By deepening our understanding, this survey provides a foundation for
developing more robust and effective solutions to hallucinations in real-world
generative AI systems.

### [3] [On Robustness of Vision-Language-Action Model against Multi-Modal Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00037)
*Jianing Guo,Zhenhong Wu,Chang Tu,Yiyao Ma,Xiangqi Kong,Zhiqian Liu,Jiaming Ji,Shuning Zhang,Yuanpei Chen,Kai Chen,Xianglong Liu,Qi Dou,Yaodong Yang,Huijie Zhao,Weifeng Lv,Simin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RobustVLA improves multi-modal robustness in Vision-Language-Action models against 17 perturbations across actions, instructions, environments, and observations, achieving significant performance gains and faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLA models focus only on visual robustness but overlook multi-modal perturbations in actions, instructions, environments, and observations, which are critical for real-world deployment.

Method: Proposes RobustVLA with offline robust optimization against worst-case action noise for output robustness, and consistent action enforcement across input variations for input robustness. Uses multi-armed bandit formulation with UCB algorithm to handle multiple perturbations.

Result: Achieves 12.6% gain on pi0 backbone and 10.4% on OpenVLA backbone across 17 perturbations, 50.6x faster inference than existing methods, and 65.6% gain on real-world FR5 robot with limited demonstrations.

Conclusion: RobustVLA effectively addresses multi-modal robustness in VLAs, demonstrating superior performance across various perturbations and real-world robotic applications.

Abstract: In Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, robustness to real-world
perturbations is critical for deployment. Existing methods target simple visual
disturbances, overlooking the broader multi-modal perturbations that arise in
actions, instructions, environments, and observations. Here, we first evaluate
the robustness of mainstream VLAs under 17 perturbations across four
modalities. We find (1) actions as the most fragile modality, (2) Existing
visual-robust VLA do not gain robustness in other modality, and (3) pi0
demonstrates superior robustness with a diffusion-based action head. To build
multi-modal robust VLAs, we propose RobustVLA against perturbations in VLA
inputs and outputs. For output robustness, we perform offline robust
optimization against worst-case action noise that maximizes mismatch in flow
matching objective. This can be seen as adversarial training, label smoothing,
and outlier penalization. For input robustness, we enforce consistent actions
across input variations that preserve task semantics. To account for multiple
perturbations, we formulate robustness as a multi-armed bandit problem and
apply an upper confidence bound algorithm to automatically identify the most
harmful noise. Experiments on LIBERO demonstrate our RobustVLA delivers
absolute gains over baselines of 12.6% on the pi0 backbone and 10.4% on the
OpenVLA backbone across all 17 perturbations, achieving 50.6x faster inference
than existing visual-robust VLAs, and a 10.4% gain under mixed perturbations.
Our RobustVLA is particularly effective on real-world FR5 robot with limited
demonstrations, showing absolute gains by 65.6% under perturbations of four
modalities.

### [4] [Uncovering Intrinsic Capabilities: A Paradigm for Data Curation in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00040)
*Junjie Li,Ziao Wang,Jianghong Ma,Xiaofeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CADC is a framework that curates instruction tuning data by analyzing intrinsic capabilities through gradient-based learning trajectories and influence estimation, achieving better performance with only 5% of data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current instruction tuning methods treat models as black boxes and overlook latent capabilities, causing regressions when reducing dataset size.

Method: Unsupervised discovery of intrinsic capabilities from gradient learning trajectories, data attribution via influence estimation, and capability-aware curriculum design with balanced selection and staged sequencing.

Result: CADC surpasses full-data training on multimodal benchmarks using only 5% of the original instruction tuning data.

Conclusion: Intrinsic capabilities are fundamental building blocks of model learning, and CADC establishes a principled paradigm for instruction data curation.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) achieve strong benchmark performance, but
controlling their behavior through instruction tuning remains difficult.
Reducing the budget of instruction tuning dataset often causes regressions, as
heuristic strategies treat models as black boxes and overlook the latent
capabilities that govern learning. We introduce Capability-Attributed Data
Curation (CADC), a framework that shifts curation from task-specific heuristics
to intrinsic capability analysis. CADC discovers intrinsic capabilities in an
unsupervised manner from gradient-based learning trajectories, attributes
training data to these capabilities via influence estimation, and curates
capability-aware curricula through balanced selection and staged sequencing.
This transforms black-box instruction tuning into a controllable,
capability-driven process. With as little as 5% of the original data, CADC
surpasses full-data training on multimodal benchmarks. These results validate
intrinsic capabilities as the fundamental building blocks of model learning and
establish CADC as a principle paradigm for instruction data curation.

### [5] [Culture In a Frame: C$^3$B as a Comic-Based Benchmark for Multimodal Culturally Awareness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00041)
*Yuchen Song,Andong Chen,Wenxin Zhu,Kehai Chen,Xuefeng Bai,Muyun Yang,Tiejun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: C³B is a new benchmark for evaluating cultural awareness in multimodal LLMs, featuring comics-based images and cross-lingual tasks with progressive difficulty levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current cultural awareness benchmarks lack difficulty progression, cross-lingual tasks, and use real-world images that typically contain only one culture, making them too easy for MLLMs.

Method: Created C³B benchmark with over 2000 images and 18000 QA pairs across three progressively difficult tasks: basic visual recognition, cultural conflict understanding, and cultural content generation.

Result: Evaluation of 11 open-source MLLMs revealed significant performance gaps compared to human performance, showing C³B poses substantial challenges for current models.

Conclusion: The benchmark demonstrates current MLLMs' limitations in cultural awareness and encourages future research to advance these capabilities.

Abstract: Cultural awareness capabilities has emerged as a critical capability for
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, current benchmarks lack
progressed difficulty in their task design and are deficient in cross-lingual
tasks. Moreover, current benchmarks often use real-world images. Each
real-world image typically contains one culture, making these benchmarks
relatively easy for MLLMs. Based on this, we propose C$^3$B ($\textbf{C}$omics
$\textbf{C}$ross-$\textbf{C}$ultural $\textbf{B}$enchmark), a novel
multicultural, multitask and multilingual cultural awareness capabilities
benchmark. C$^3$B comprises over 2000 images and over 18000 QA pairs,
constructed on three tasks with progressed difficulties, from basic visual
recognition to higher-level cultural conflict understanding, and finally to
cultural content generation. We conducted evaluations on 11 open-source MLLMs,
revealing a significant performance gap between MLLMs and human performance.
The gap demonstrates that C$^3$B poses substantial challenges for current
MLLMs, encouraging future research to advance the cultural awareness
capabilities of MLLMs.

### [6] [Beyond the Prompt: Gender Bias in Text-to-Image Models, with a Case Study on Hospital Professions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00045)
*Franck Vandewiele,Remi Synave,Samuel Delepoulle,Remi Cozot*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Analysis of gender bias in 6 text-to-image models reveals systematic occupational stereotypes where nurses are depicted exclusively as women and surgeons predominantly as men, with model-specific variations and prompt wording significantly influencing gender representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate gender representation biases in state-of-the-art text-to-image models, particularly in professional healthcare contexts, as these models are increasingly used in professional, educational, and creative settings where biased outputs can amplify social stereotypes.

Method: Generated 100 images each for combinations of five hospital professions (cardiologist, hospital director, nurse, paramedic, surgeon) and five portrait qualifiers using six open-weight TTI models, then analyzed gender representation patterns systematically.

Result: All models showed systematic occupational stereotypes: nurses exclusively depicted as women, surgeons predominantly as men. Models varied significantly - Qwen-Image and SDXL enforced rigid male dominance, FLUX.1-dev skewed female, while others showed mixed outcomes. Prompt qualifiers like 'corporate' reinforced male depictions and 'beautiful' favored female ones.

Conclusion: Gender bias in TTI models is both systematic and model-specific, with prompt wording playing a critical role in shaping demographic outcomes. Findings underscore the need for bias-aware design, balanced defaults, and user guidance to prevent reinforcement of occupational stereotypes in generative AI.

Abstract: Text-to-image (TTI) models are increasingly used in professional,
educational, and creative contexts, yet their outputs often embed and amplify
social biases. This paper investigates gender representation in six
state-of-the-art open-weight models: HunyuanImage 2.1, HiDream-I1-dev,
Qwen-Image, FLUX.1-dev, Stable-Diffusion 3.5 Large, and Stable-Diffusion-XL.
Using carefully designed prompts, we generated 100 images for each combination
of five hospital-related professions (cardiologist, hospital director, nurse,
paramedic, surgeon) and five portrait qualifiers ("", corporate, neutral,
aesthetic, beautiful).
  Our analysis reveals systematic occupational stereotypes: all models produced
nurses exclusively as women and surgeons predominantly as men. However,
differences emerge across models: Qwen-Image and SDXL enforce rigid male
dominance, HiDream-I1-dev shows mixed outcomes, and FLUX.1-dev skews female in
most roles. HunyuanImage 2.1 and Stable-Diffusion 3.5 Large also reproduce
gender stereotypes but with varying degrees of sensitivity to prompt
formulation. Portrait qualifiers further modulate gender balance, with terms
like corporate reinforcing male depictions and beautiful favoring female ones.
Sensitivity varies widely: Qwen-Image remains nearly unaffected, while
FLUX.1-dev, SDXL, and SD3.5 show strong prompt dependence.
  These findings demonstrate that gender bias in TTI models is both systematic
and model-specific. Beyond documenting disparities, we argue that prompt
wording plays a critical role in shaping demographic outcomes. The results
underscore the need for bias-aware design, balanced defaults, and user guidance
to prevent the reinforcement of occupational stereotypes in generative AI.

### [7] [Reinforcement Learning-Based Prompt Template Stealing for Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00046)
*Xiaotian Zou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RLStealer is a reinforcement learning framework that steals prompt templates from multimodal LLMs using only example images, achieving state-of-the-art performance while reducing attack costs by over 87%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt trading markets create security vulnerabilities where valuable prompts can be stolen, exposing an unexamined risk in the emerging MLLMs marketplace.

Method: Treats template stealing as sequential decision making using reinforcement learning with multiple similarity-based feedback signals as reward functions to explore prompt space.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance, reduces attack cost to under 13% of existing baselines, and effectively generalizes across different image styles to steal unseen prompt templates.

Conclusion: Highlights urgent security threat in prompt trading and lays groundwork for developing protective standards in MLLMs marketplace.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have transformed text-to-image
workflows, allowing designers to create novel visual concepts with
unprecedented speed. This progress has given rise to a thriving prompt trading
market, where curated prompts that induce trademark styles are bought and sold.
Although commercially attractive, prompt trading also introduces a largely
unexamined security risk: the prompts themselves can be stolen.
  In this paper, we expose this vulnerability and present RLStealer, a
reinforcement learning based prompt inversion framework that recovers its
template from only a small set of example images. RLStealer treats template
stealing as a sequential decision making problem and employs multiple
similarity based feedback signals as reward functions to effectively explore
the prompt space. Comprehensive experiments on publicly available benchmarks
demonstrate that RLStealer gets state-of-the-art performance while reducing the
total attack cost to under 13% of that required by existing baselines. Our
further analysis confirms that RLStealer can effectively generalize across
different image styles to efficiently steal unseen prompt templates. Our study
highlights an urgent security threat inherent in prompt trading and lays the
groundwork for developing protective standards in the emerging MLLMs
marketplace.

### [8] [Explanation-Driven Counterfactual Testing for Faithfulness in Vision-Language Model Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00047)
*Sihao Ding,Santosh Vasa,Aditi Ramadwar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EDCT is an automated method to test if vision-language models' explanations match their actual reasoning by generating counterfactual image edits and checking consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs often produce convincing but unfaithful explanations that don't reflect true causal factors, creating technical and governance risks.

Method: EDCT automatically: (1) gets model's answer and explanation, (2) parses explanation into testable concepts, (3) generates counterfactual image edits via inpainting, (4) computes Counterfactual Consistency Score using LLM analysis.

Result: Testing across 120 OK-VQA examples and multiple VLMs revealed substantial faithfulness gaps, with EDCT providing regulator-aligned audit artifacts.

Conclusion: EDCT effectively uncovers when VLMs' cited concepts fail causal tests, addressing the plausibility-faithfulness mismatch problem.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often produce fluent Natural Language
Explanations (NLEs) that sound convincing but may not reflect the causal
factors driving predictions. This mismatch of plausibility and faithfulness
poses technical and governance risks. We introduce Explanation-Driven
Counterfactual Testing (EDCT), a fully automated verification procedure for a
target VLM that treats the model's own explanation as a falsifiable hypothesis.
Given an image-question pair, EDCT: (1) obtains the model's answer and NLE, (2)
parses the NLE into testable visual concepts, (3) generates targeted
counterfactual edits via generative inpainting, and (4) computes a
Counterfactual Consistency Score (CCS) using LLM-assisted analysis of changes
in both answers and explanations. Across 120 curated OK-VQA examples and
multiple VLMs, EDCT uncovers substantial faithfulness gaps and provides
regulator-aligned audit artifacts indicating when cited concepts fail causal
tests.

### [9] [HiDe: Rethinking The Zoom-IN method in High Resolution MLLMs via Hierarchical Decoupling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00054)
*Xianjie Liu,Yiman Hu,Yixiong Zou,Liang Wu,Jian Xu,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiDe is a training-free framework that addresses poor MLLM performance on high-resolution images by decoupling key information from background interference through attention-based token alignment and layout-preserving reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs underperform on high-resolution images due to complex background interference rather than object size limitations, challenging the conventional 'zoom in' approach.

Method: HiDe uses Token-wise Attention Decoupling (TAD) to identify key information tokens and Layout-Preserving Decoupling (LPD) to reconstruct compact representations by eliminating background interference while preserving spatial layouts.

Result: HiDe achieves new SOTA on V*Bench (92.1% for Qwen2.5-VL 7B, 91.6% for InternVL3 8B), HRBench4K, and HRBench8K, surpassing RL methods while using 75% less memory than previous training-free approaches.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates that background interference, not object size, is the primary limitation for MLLMs on high-resolution images, and HiDe effectively addresses this through hierarchical decoupling without requiring training.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant strides in
visual understanding tasks. However, their performance on high-resolution
images remains suboptimal. While existing approaches often attribute this
limitation to perceptual constraints and argue that MLLMs struggle to recognize
small objects, leading them to use "zoom in" strategies for better detail, our
analysis reveals a different cause: the main issue is not object size, but
rather caused by complex background interference. We systematically analyze
this "zoom in" operation through a series of decoupling experiments and propose
the Hierarchical Decoupling Framework (HiDe), a training-free framework that
uses Token-wise Attention Decoupling (TAD) to decouple the question tokens and
identify the key information tokens, then leverages their attention weights to
achieve precise alignment with the target visual regions. Subsequently, it
employs Layout-Preserving Decoupling (LPD) to decouple these regions from the
background and reconstructs a compact representation that preserves essential
spatial layouts while eliminating background interference. HiDe sets a new SOTA
on V*Bench, HRBench4K, and HRBench8K, boosting Qwen2.5-VL 7B and InternVL3 8B
to SOTA (92.1% and 91.6% on V*Bench), even surpassing RL methods. After
optimization, HiDe uses 75% less memory than the previous training-free
approach. Code is provided in https://github.com/Tennine2077/HiDe.

### [10] [FSDENet: A Frequency and Spatial Domains based Detail Enhancement Network for Remote Sensing Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00059)
*Jiahao Fu,Yinfeng Yu,Liejun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FSDENet is a dual-domain network that combines spatial and frequency domain processing to enhance remote sensing image segmentation, particularly addressing edge ambiguities caused by grayscale variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage spatial information fully and address semantic edge ambiguities caused by grayscale variations (shadows, low-contrast regions) in remote sensing image segmentation.

Method: Uses spatial processing for multi-scale features, FFT for global frequency-domain information, Haar wavelet transform for frequency decomposition, and integrates spatial granularity with frequency-domain edge sensitivity.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on four datasets: LoveDA, Vaihingen, Potsdam, and iSAID, with significant improvement in boundary regions and grayscale transition zones.

Conclusion: FSDENet effectively combines spatial and frequency domains to enhance segmentation accuracy, particularly for challenging edge cases in remote sensing imagery.

Abstract: To fully leverage spatial information for remote sensing image segmentation
and address semantic edge ambiguities caused by grayscale variations (e.g.,
shadows and low-contrast regions), we propose the Frequency and Spatial Domains
based Detail Enhancement Network (FSDENet). Our framework employs spatial
processing methods to extract rich multi-scale spatial features and
fine-grained semantic details. By effectively integrating global and
frequency-domain information through the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in global
mappings, the model's capability to discern global representations under
grayscale variations is significantly strengthened. Additionally, we utilize
Haar wavelet transform to decompose features into high- and low-frequency
components, leveraging their distinct sensitivity to edge information to refine
boundary segmentation. The model achieves dual-domain synergy by integrating
spatial granularity with frequency-domain edge sensitivity, substantially
improving segmentation accuracy in boundary regions and grayscale transition
zones. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that FSDENet achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on four widely adopted datasets: LoveDA,
Vaihingen, Potsdam, and iSAID.

### [11] [Less is More: Lean yet Powerful Vision-Language Model for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00060)
*Sheng Yang,Tong Zhan,Guancheng Chen,Yanfeng Lu,Jian Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Max-V1 is a one-stage end-to-end autonomous driving framework that treats trajectory planning as next waypoint prediction using Vision-Language Models, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 30% improvement on nuScenes dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reconceptualize autonomous driving as a generalized language task and create a single-pass generation paradigm that aligns with the sequential nature of driving.

Method: Uses VLM for end-to-end trajectory prediction directly from front-view camera input with principled supervision strategy from statistical modeling, enabling imitation learning from expert demonstrations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes dataset with over 30% improvement over prior baselines, and shows superior generalization on cross-domain datasets from diverse vehicles.

Conclusion: The framework enables fundamental driving behaviors and lays foundation for more capable self-driving agents, demonstrating strong cross-vehicle robustness and adaptability.

Abstract: In this work, we reconceptualize autonomous driving as a generalized language
and formulate the trajectory planning task as next waypoint prediction. We
introduce Max-V1, a novel framework for one-stage end-to-end autonomous
driving. Our framework presents a single-pass generation paradigm that aligns
with the inherent sequentiality of driving. This approach leverages the
generative capacity of the VLM (Vision-Language Model) to enable end-to-end
trajectory prediction directly from front-view camera input. The efficacy of
this method is underpinned by a principled supervision strategy derived from
statistical modeling. This provides a well-defined learning objective, which
makes the framework highly amenable to master complex driving policies through
imitation learning from large-scale expert demonstrations. Empirically, our
method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes dataset,
delivers an overall improvement of over 30% compared to prior baselines.
Furthermore, it exhibits superior generalization performance on cross-domain
datasets acquired from diverse vehicles, demonstrating notable potential for
cross-vehicle robustness and adaptability. Due to these empirical strengths,
this work introduces a model enabling fundamental driving behaviors, laying the
foundation for the development of more capable self-driving agents. Code will
be available upon publication.

### [12] [Efficient CNN Compression via Multi-method Low Rank Factorization and Feature Map Similarity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00062)
*M. Kokhazadeh,G. Keramidas,V. Kelefouras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An end-to-end DSE framework for CNN compression using low-rank factorization with novel rank selection and one-shot fine-tuning, achieving substantial compression with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRF faces challenges like optimal rank selection, large design space, long fine-tuning times, and limited compatibility with different layer types and decomposition methods.

Method: Uses feature map similarity for rank selection, one-shot fine-tuning, integrates 3 LRF techniques for Conv layers and 3 for FC layers applied selectively per-layer, and combines multiple LRF methods within a single model.

Result: Achieves substantial compression with minimal accuracy loss, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques on 14 CNN models across 8 datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology effectively addresses LRF challenges and provides better compression results through selective multi-method approach, with TensorFlow 2.x integration for practical deployment.

Abstract: Low-Rank Factorization (LRF) is a widely adopted technique for compressing
deep neural networks (DNNs). However, it faces several challenges, including
optimal rank selection, a vast design space, long fine-tuning times, and
limited compatibility with different layer types and decomposition methods.
This paper presents an end-to-end Design Space Exploration (DSE) methodology
and framework for compressing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that
addresses all these issues. We introduce a novel rank selection strategy based
on feature map similarity, which captures non-linear interactions between layer
outputs more effectively than traditional weight-based approaches. Unlike prior
works, our method uses a one-shot fine-tuning process, significantly reducing
the overall fine-tuning time. The proposed framework is fully compatible with
all types of convolutional (Conv) and fully connected (FC) layers. To further
improve compression, the framework integrates three different LRF techniques
for Conv layers and three for FC layers, applying them selectively on a
per-layer basis. We demonstrate that combining multiple LRF methods within a
single model yields better compression results than using a single method
uniformly across all layers. Finally, we provide a comprehensive evaluation and
comparison of the six LRF techniques, offering practical insights into their
effectiveness across different scenarios. The proposed work is integrated into
TensorFlow 2.x, ensuring compatibility with widely used deep learning
workflows. Experimental results on 14 CNN models across eight datasets
demonstrate that the proposed methodology achieves substantial compression with
minimal accuracy loss, outperforming several state-of-the-art techniques.

(LLM), capable of assessing the five senses (Seiri, Seiton, Seiso, Seiketsu,
Shitsuke) in a standardized way through intelligent image analysis. The
system's reliability was validated using Cohen's concordance coefficient (kappa
= 0.75), showing strong alignment between the automated assessments and the
corresponding human audits. The results indicate that the proposed solution
contributes significantly to continuous improvement in automotive manufacturing
environments, speeding up the audit process by 50% of the traditional time and
maintaining the consistency of the assessments, with a 99.8% reduction in

presented establishes a new paradigm for integrating lean systems with emerging
AI technologies, offering scalability for implementation in automotive plants
of different sizes.

### [14] [OIG-Bench: A Multi-Agent Annotated Benchmark for Multimodal One-Image Guides Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00069)
*Jiancong Xie,Wenjin Wang,Zhuomeng Zhang,Zihan Liu,Qi Liu,Ke Feng,Zixun Sun,Yuedong Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OIG-Bench is a benchmark for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models' understanding of One-Image Guides - visual formats combining text, imagery, and symbols designed for human comprehension. The benchmark uses a semi-automated annotation pipeline with multiple intelligent agents to generate image descriptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation of MLLMs' capacity for human-like understanding in One-Image Guides is insufficiently explored, despite their impressive capabilities in other areas.

Method: Developed OIG-Bench with a semi-automated annotation pipeline using multiple intelligent agents to generate preliminary image descriptions, then evaluated 29 state-of-the-art MLLMs across diverse domains.

Result: Qwen2.5-VL-72B performed best with 77% overall accuracy, but all models showed weaknesses in semantic understanding and logical reasoning. The multi-agent annotation system outperformed all MLLMs in image captioning.

Conclusion: Current MLLMs still struggle to accurately interpret complex visual-text relationships in One-Image Guides, and the multi-agent annotation system shows promise for high-quality image description generation and dataset construction.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities. However, evaluating their capacity for human-like
understanding in One-Image Guides remains insufficiently explored. One-Image
Guides are a visual format combining text, imagery, and symbols to present
reorganized and structured information for easier comprehension, which are
specifically designed for human viewing and inherently embody the
characteristics of human perception and understanding. Here, we present
OIG-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark focused on One-Image Guide understanding
across diverse domains. To reduce the cost of manual annotation, we developed a
semi-automated annotation pipeline in which multiple intelligent agents
collaborate to generate preliminary image descriptions, assisting humans in
constructing image-text pairs. With OIG-Bench, we have conducted a
comprehensive evaluation of 29 state-of-the-art MLLMs, including both
proprietary and open-source models. The results show that Qwen2.5-VL-72B
performs the best among the evaluated models, with an overall accuracy of 77%.
Nevertheless, all models exhibit notable weaknesses in semantic understanding
and logical reasoning, indicating that current MLLMs still struggle to
accurately interpret complex visual-text relationships. In addition, we also
demonstrate that the proposed multi-agent annotation system outperforms all
MLLMs in image captioning, highlighting its potential as both a high-quality
image description generator and a valuable tool for future dataset
construction. Datasets are available at https://github.com/XiejcSYSU/OIG-Bench.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unlock geospatial reasoning capabilities in vision-language models without requiring costly human reasoning annotations, by shifting from traditional domain pretraining/supervised fine-tuning to reasoning-first post-training.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Scaffolding stage uses supervised fine-tuning on synthetic chain-of-thought exemplars to establish geospatial thinking paradigm; 2) Elevating stage uses GRPO-based reinforcement learning on weakly-supervised cross-view pairing proxy for verifiable reward signals.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across various geospatial reasoning benchmarks, enabling models to connect visual cues with geographic priors and reconcile features across modalities.

Conclusion: Geo-R1 successfully extends geospatial modeling to reasoning-first post-training and demonstrates effective geospatial reasoning capabilities through its innovative two-stage framework.

Abstract: We introduce Geo-R1, a reasoning-centric post-training framework that unlocks
geospatial reasoning in vision-language models by combining thinking
scaffolding and elevating. In the scaffolding stage, Geo-R1 instills a
``geospatial thinking paradigm" via supervised fine-tuning on synthetic
chain-of-thought exemplars, enabling models to connect visual cues with
geographic priors without costly human reasoning annotations. In the elevating
stage, it uses GRPO-based reinforcement learning on a weakly-supervised
cross-view pairing proxy. This design supplies a verifiable and scalable reward
signal: teaching models to capture and reconcile features across modalities,
and harnessing reasoning for accurate prediction. Geo-R1 extends geospatial
modeling from domain pretraining / supervised finetuning to reasoning-first
post-training, and achieves state-of-the-art performance across various
geospatial reasoning benchmarks. Our model is available at

*Hanjiang Hu,Bowei Li,Ziwei Wang,Tianhao Wei,Casidhe Hutchison,Eric Sample,Changliu Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a neural network pruning method based on Unbiased and Smooth Neuron (USN) metric to address over-parameterization issues in certified robustness against semantic transformations like brightness and contrast perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current certified training and robustness certification methods face challenges with over-parameterization in deep neural networks, which hinders tightness and scalability of robustness verification.

Method: 1) Analyze layer/neuron stability and variance against input perturbations to identify USN metric; 2) Prune neurons with low USN while retaining high-USN neurons; 3) Use Wasserstein distance loss to concentrate pruned neurons across layers.

Result: The method achieves superior robustness certification performance and efficiency on challenging robust keypoint detection task with realistic brightness and contrast perturbations.

Conclusion: The USN-based pruning approach effectively addresses over-parameterization while preserving model expressiveness, enabling better certified robustness against semantic transformations.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have been widely adopted in many vision and robotics
applications with visual inputs. It is essential to verify its robustness
against semantic transformation perturbations, such as brightness and contrast.
However, current certified training and robustness certification methods face
the challenge of over-parameterization, which hinders the tightness and
scalability due to the over-complicated neural networks. To this end, we first
analyze stability and variance of layers and neurons against input
perturbation, showing that certifiable robustness can be indicated by a
fundamental Unbiased and Smooth Neuron metric (USN). Based on USN, we introduce
a novel neural network pruning method that removes neurons with low USN and
retains those with high USN, thereby preserving model expressiveness without
over-parameterization. To further enhance this pruning process, we propose a
new Wasserstein distance loss to ensure that pruned neurons are more
concentrated across layers. We validate our approach through extensive
experiments on the challenging robust keypoint detection task, which involves
realistic brightness and contrast perturbations, demonstrating that our method
achieves superior robustness certification performance and efficiency compared
to baselines.

*Abu Hasnat Mohammad Rubaiyat,Jordan Vincent,Colin Olson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel hyperspectral anomaly detection method using transport-based mathematical modeling and signed cumulative distribution transform (SCDT) to represent pixels as deformed template patterns, enabling unsupervised subspace modeling for anomaly detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral anomaly detection faces challenges in complex real-world environments with limited prior knowledge of target signatures. Current methods struggle with these constraints.

Method: Proposes transport-based mathematical model where hyperspectral pixels are viewed as observations of template patterns undergoing unknown deformations. Uses SCDT domain representation and unsupervised subspace modeling to construct background signal models.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations across five distinct datasets demonstrate superiority over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed transport-based approach with SCDT representation provides an effective framework for hyperspectral anomaly detection, outperforming existing methods across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD), a crucial approach for many civilian
and military applications, seeks to identify pixels with spectral signatures
that are anomalous relative to a preponderance of background signatures.
Significant effort has been made to improve HAD techniques, but challenges
arise due to complex real-world environments and, by definition, limited prior
knowledge of potential signatures of interest. This paper introduces a novel
HAD method by proposing a transport-based mathematical model to describe the
pixels comprising a given hyperspectral image. In this approach, hyperspectral
pixels are viewed as observations of a template pattern undergoing unknown
deformations that enables their representation in the signed cumulative
distribution transform (SCDT) domain. An unsupervised subspace modeling
technique is then used to construct a model of abundant background signals in
this domain, whereupon anomalous signals are detected as deviations from the
learned model. Comprehensive evaluations across five distinct datasets
illustrate the superiority of our approach compared to state-of-the-art
methods.

TL;DR: MOLM is a watermarking framework that uses key-dependent LoRA adapters in generative models to embed imperceptible watermarks, achieving robust detection against various attacks while maintaining image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address concerns about detecting and attributing AI-generated images, as existing watermarking methods are fragile to distortions, susceptible to removal, and expensive to update when keys change.

Method: Formulates encoding as key-dependent perturbation of model parameters using Mixture of LoRA Markers - binary keys activate lightweight LoRA adapters in residual and attention blocks without requiring key-specific retraining.

Result: Experiments on Stable Diffusion and FLUX show MOLM preserves image quality while achieving robust key recovery against distortions, compression, regeneration, averaging attacks, and black-box adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: MOLM provides an effective watermarking solution with desired properties of imperceptibility, fidelity, verifiability, and robustness, avoiding the need for expensive retraining when keys change.

Abstract: Generative models can generate photorealistic images at scale. This raises
urgent concerns about the ability to detect synthetically generated images and
attribute these images to specific sources. While watermarking has emerged as a
possible solution, existing methods remain fragile to realistic distortions,
susceptible to adaptive removal, and expensive to update when the underlying
watermarking key changes. We propose a general watermarking framework that
formulates the encoding problem as key-dependent perturbation of the parameters
of a generative model. Within this framework, we introduce Mixture of LoRA
Markers (MOLM), a routing-based instantiation in which binary keys activate
lightweight LoRA adapters inside residual and attention blocks. This design
avoids key-specific re-training and achieves the desired properties such as
imperceptibility, fidelity, verifiability, and robustness. Experiments on
Stable Diffusion and FLUX show that MOLM preserves image quality while
achieving robust key recovery against distortions, compression and
regeneration, averaging attacks, and black-box adversarial attacks on the
extractor.

*Anay Majee,Amitesh Gangrade,Rishabh Iyer*

TL;DR: CROWD is a combinatorial framework for Open-World Object Detection that addresses semantic confusion and catastrophic forgetting through strategic unknown instance mining and joint representation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OWOD approaches suffer from semantic confusion between known/unknown classes and catastrophic forgetting, leading to reduced unknown recall and degraded known-class accuracy.

Method: Proposes CROWD with two components: CROWD-Discover uses Submodular Conditional Gain functions to mine unknown instances distinct from known objects, and CROWD-Learn employs combinatorial objectives to disentangle known/unknown representations while maintaining known-class discriminative coherence.

Result: Achieves improvements of 2.83% and 2.05% in known-class accuracy on M-OWODB and S-OWODB benchmarks, and nearly 2.4x unknown recall compared to leading baselines.

Conclusion: CROWD effectively mitigates semantic confusion and catastrophic forgetting in open-world object detection through its combinatorial approach to discovery and representation learning.

Abstract: Open-World Object Detection (OWOD) enriches traditional object detectors by
enabling continual discovery and integration of unknown objects via human
guidance. However, existing OWOD approaches frequently suffer from semantic
confusion between known and unknown classes, alongside catastrophic forgetting,
leading to diminished unknown recall and degraded known-class accuracy. To
overcome these challenges, we propose Combinatorial Open-World Detection
(CROWD), a unified framework reformulating unknown object discovery and
adaptation as an interwoven combinatorial (set-based) data-discovery
(CROWD-Discover) and representation learning (CROWD-Learn) task. CROWD-Discover
strategically mines unknown instances by maximizing Submodular Conditional Gain
(SCG) functions, selecting representative examples distinctly dissimilar from
known objects. Subsequently, CROWD-Learn employs novel combinatorial objectives
that jointly disentangle known and unknown representations while maintaining
discriminative coherence among known classes, thus mitigating confusion and
forgetting. Extensive evaluations on OWOD benchmarks illustrate that CROWD
achieves improvements of 2.83% and 2.05% in known-class accuracy on M-OWODB and
S-OWODB, respectively, and nearly 2.4x unknown recall compared to leading
baselines.

*Arpan Mahara,Md Rezaul Karim Khan,Naphtali Rishe,Wenjia Wang,Seyed Masoud Sadjadi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes ExpDWT-VAE, a novel VAE architecture that enhances latent space representation for satellite imagery by integrating spatial and frequency domains using Discrete Wavelet Transform, improving Latent Diffusion Models for remote sensing applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While Latent Diffusion Models (LDM) show advantages in remote sensing, existing research rarely focuses on improving the intrinsic latent space representation. Current approaches don't sufficiently leverage frequency-domain information for satellite imagery analysis.

Method: Proposed ExpDWT-VAE with dual branches: one processes spatial domain with convolutional operations, while the other extracts frequency-domain features via 2D Haar wavelet decomposition, convolution, and inverse DWT reconstruction. The integrated spatial-frequency representation is refined through convolutional and diagonal Gaussian mapping.

Result: Experimental validation on a new satellite imagery dataset from TerraFly mapping system shows improved performance across multiple metrics, demonstrating enhanced latent space representation capabilities.

Conclusion: The ExpDWT-VAE method effectively enhances latent space representation for satellite imagery by integrating spatial and frequency domains, providing a robust foundation for improved Latent Diffusion Models in remote sensing applications.

Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models (LDM), a subclass of diffusion models, mitigate the
computational complexity of pixel-space diffusion by operating within a
compressed latent space constructed by Variational Autoencoders (VAEs),
demonstrating significant advantages in Remote Sensing (RS) applications.
Though numerous studies enhancing LDMs have been conducted, investigations
explicitly targeting improvements within the intrinsic latent space remain
scarce. This paper proposes an innovative perspective, utilizing the Discrete
Wavelet Transform (DWT) to enhance the VAE's latent space representation,
designed for satellite imagery. The proposed method, ExpDWT-VAE, introduces
dual branches: one processes spatial domain input through convolutional
operations, while the other extracts and processes frequency-domain features
via 2D Haar wavelet decomposition, convolutional operation, and inverse DWT
reconstruction. These branches merge to create an integrated spatial-frequency
representation, further refined through convolutional and diagonal Gaussian
mapping into a robust latent representation. We utilize a new satellite imagery
dataset housed by the TerraFly mapping system to validate our method.
Experimental results across several performance metrics highlight the efficacy
of the proposed method at enhancing latent space representation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EgoTraj-Bench is a real-world benchmark for ego-centric trajectory prediction that addresses perceptual artifacts like occlusions and tracking drift. BiFlow model uses dual-stream flow matching with EgoAnchor mechanism to denoise observations and forecast motion, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing trajectory prediction methods assume idealized observation histories, failing to account for real-world perceptual artifacts in first-person vision like occlusions, ID switches, and tracking drift, which limits model robustness in deployment.

Method: Proposed BiFlow - a dual-stream flow matching model that concurrently denoises historical observations and forecasts future motion using shared latent representation. Includes EgoAnchor mechanism that conditions prediction decoder on distilled historical features via feature modulation.

Result: BiFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing minADE and minFDE by 10-15% on average and demonstrating superior robustness compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The EgoTraj-Bench benchmark and BiFlow model provide a critical foundation for developing trajectory forecasting systems that are resilient to real-world ego-centric perception challenges.

Abstract: Reliable trajectory prediction from an ego-centric perspective is crucial for
robotic navigation in human-centric environments. However, existing methods
typically assume idealized observation histories, failing to account for the
perceptual artifacts inherent in first-person vision, such as occlusions, ID
switches, and tracking drift. This discrepancy between training assumptions and
deployment reality severely limits model robustness. To bridge this gap, we
introduce EgoTraj-Bench, the first real-world benchmark that grounds noisy,
first-person visual histories in clean, bird's-eye-view future trajectories,
enabling robust learning under realistic perceptual constraints. Building on
this benchmark, we propose BiFlow, a dual-stream flow matching model that
concurrently denoises historical observations and forecasts future motion by
leveraging a shared latent representation. To better model agent intent, BiFlow
incorporates our EgoAnchor mechanism, which conditions the prediction decoder
on distilled historical features via feature modulation. Extensive experiments
show that BiFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing minADE and
minFDE by 10-15% on average and demonstrating superior robustness. We
anticipate that our benchmark and model will provide a critical foundation for
developing trajectory forecasting systems truly resilient to the challenges of
real-world, ego-centric perception.

TL;DR: Comparative analysis shows that supervised CNNs are strong baselines for chest X-ray diagnosis, but zero-shot VLMs like BiomedCLIP can match or exceed their performance when properly calibrated with optimized decision thresholds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of automated methods for chest radiograph interpretation, specifically comparing supervised CNNs against zero-shot medical VLMs for pneumonia and tuberculosis detection.

Method: Comparative analysis between supervised lightweight CNN and zero-shot medical VLM (BiomedCLIP) on PneumoniaMNIST for pneumonia detection and Shenzhen TB dataset for tuberculosis detection, with decision threshold calibration on validation sets.

Result: After calibration, BiomedCLIP achieved F1-score of 0.8841 for pneumonia detection (surpassing CNN's 0.8803) and 0.7684 for tuberculosis detection (close to CNN's 0.7834), showing dramatic improvements from uncalibrated performance.

Conclusion: Proper calibration is essential for unlocking the full diagnostic potential of zero-shot VLMs, enabling them to compete with or outperform task-specific supervised models in medical imaging tasks.

Abstract: The accurate interpretation of chest radiographs using automated methods is a
critical task in medical imaging. This paper presents a comparative analysis
between a supervised lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a
state-of-the-art, zero-shot medical Vision-Language Model (VLM), BiomedCLIP,
across two distinct diagnostic tasks: pneumonia detection on the PneumoniaMNIST
benchmark and tuberculosis detection on the Shenzhen TB dataset. Our
experiments show that supervised CNNs serve as highly competitive baselines in
both cases. While the default zero-shot performance of the VLM is lower, we
demonstrate that its potential can be unlocked via a simple yet crucial remedy:
decision threshold calibration. By optimizing the classification threshold on a
validation set, the performance of BiomedCLIP is significantly boosted across
both datasets. For pneumonia detection, calibration enables the zero-shot VLM
to achieve a superior F1-score of 0.8841, surpassing the supervised CNN's
0.8803. For tuberculosis detection, calibration dramatically improves the
F1-score from 0.4812 to 0.7684, bringing it close to the supervised baseline's
0.7834. This work highlights a key insight: proper calibration is essential for
leveraging the full diagnostic power of zero-shot VLMs, enabling them to match
or even outperform efficient, task-specific supervised models.

TL;DR: PAL-UI is a novel framework that enables GUI agents to adaptively retrieve past visual observations during long-horizon tasks, overcoming memory limitations through active look-back mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GUI agents struggle with long-horizon tasks due to memory constraints, either truncating history or using simple textual summaries that risk losing critical visual information needed for future decisions.

Method: PAL-UI combines dual-level summarization (observation-level cues and action-level outcomes) with a dedicated retrieval tool that allows agents to recall specific historical screenshots during planning. Models are trained on 8.6K mobile GUI navigation samples based on Qwen2.5-VL architecture.

Result: PAL-UI significantly outperforms baseline models and prior methods in mobile GUI navigation tasks, even under data-efficient settings. It also demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization, achieving notable improvements in web navigation without additional training.

Conclusion: The work highlights the potential of active memory retrieval for enhancing long-horizon planning capabilities of vision-based GUI agents, enabling more human-like interaction with software applications.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents powered by Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) promise human-like interaction with software applications, yet

risk losing critical information when past visual details become necessary for
future decisions. In this paper, we propose \textbf{PAL-UI} (\textbf{P}lanning
with \textbf{A}ctive \textbf{L}ook-back), a novel framework that enables GUI
agents to adaptively retrieve past observations when required. PAL-UI combines
a dual-level summarization agent, capturing both observation-level cues and
action-level outcomes, with a dedicated retrieval tool that allows the agent to
recall specific historical screenshots during planning. We curate a step-level

Motivation: Generic segmentation tools lack specificity for clinically critical tasks like meningioma RT planning, where precise delineation is crucial for treatment efficacy and healthy tissue preservation.

Method: Developed Interactive-MEN-RT, a dedicated IMIS tool with multiple clinically relevant interaction methods including point annotations, bounding boxes, lasso tools, and scribbles for 3D meningioma segmentation.

Result: Achieved Dice similarity coefficients of up to 77.6% and Intersection over Union scores of 64.8% on 500 contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI scans from BraTS 2025 Meningioma RT Segmentation Challenge.

Conclusion: Clinically tailored segmentation solutions are essential for critical applications like meningioma RT planning, and Interactive-MEN-RT demonstrates substantial improvement over other methods.

Abstract: Precise delineation of meningiomas is crucial for effective radiotherapy (RT)
planning, directly influencing treatment efficacy and preservation of adjacent
healthy tissues. While automated deep learning approaches have demonstrated
considerable potential, achieving consistently accurate clinical segmentation
remains challenging due to tumor heterogeneity. Interactive Medical Image
Segmentation (IMIS) addresses this challenge by integrating advanced AI
techniques with clinical input. However, generic segmentation tools, despite
widespread applicability, often lack the specificity required for clinically
critical and disease-specific tasks like meningioma RT planning. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce Interactive-MEN-RT, a dedicated IMIS tool
specifically developed for clinician-assisted 3D meningioma segmentation in RT
workflows. The system incorporates multiple clinically relevant interaction
methods, including point annotations, bounding boxes, lasso tools, and
scribbles, enhancing usability and clinical precision. In our evaluation
involving 500 contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI scans from the BraTS 2025
Meningioma RT Segmentation Challenge, Interactive-MEN-RT demonstrated
substantial improvement compared to other segmentation methods, achieving Dice
similarity coefficients of up to 77.6\% and Intersection over Union scores of

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation models struggle with subject-consistent video generation due to difficulty parsing prompts with complex spatial relationships, temporal logic, and interactions among multiple subjects.

Method: Proposes BindWeave with MLLM-DiT framework where a pretrained multimodal large language model performs cross-modal reasoning to ground entities and disentangle roles/attributes/interactions, generating subject-aware hidden states that condition a diffusion transformer.

Result: Experiments on OpenS2V benchmark show superior performance in subject consistency, naturalness, and text relevance, outperforming existing open-source and commercial models.

Conclusion: BindWeave effectively addresses the challenge of subject-consistent video generation for complex multi-subject scenarios through deep cross-modal reasoning and conditioning of diffusion transformers.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer has shown remarkable abilities in generating
high-fidelity videos, delivering visually coherent frames and rich details over
extended durations. However, existing video generation models still fall short
in subject-consistent video generation due to an inherent difficulty in parsing
prompts that specify complex spatial relationships, temporal logic, and
interactions among multiple subjects. To address this issue, we propose
BindWeave, a unified framework that handles a broad range of subject-to-video
scenarios from single-subject cases to complex multi-subject scenes with
heterogeneous entities. To bind complex prompt semantics to concrete visual
subjects, we introduce an MLLM-DiT framework in which a pretrained multimodal
large language model performs deep cross-modal reasoning to ground entities and
disentangle roles, attributes, and interactions, yielding subject-aware hidden
states that condition the diffusion transformer for high-fidelity
subject-consistent video generation. Experiments on the OpenS2V benchmark
demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance across subject
consistency, naturalness, and text relevance in generated videos, outperforming
existing open-source and commercial models.

*Wang Zhang,Huaqiu Li,Xiaowan Hu,Tao Jiang,Zikang Chen,Haoqian Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCNet addresses limitations in self-supervised denoising by controlling spectral learning to preserve high-frequency details while avoiding noise learning, using frequency band selection, Lipschitz-constrained optimization, and spectral separation modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-supervised denoising methods fail to preserve high-frequency structural details and tend to learn high-frequency noise from paired noisy images during training.

Method: Proposes SCNet with three components: frequency band selection strategy for faster convergence, Lipschitz-constrained parameter optimization to limit high-frequency noise learning, and SSR module for spectral separation and low-rank reconstruction to preserve high-frequency details.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SCNet in improving denoising performance while preserving image details.

Conclusion: SCNet successfully addresses spectral bias issues in self-supervised denoising by controlling frequency learning and separating noise from structural details through spectral manipulation.

Abstract: Current self-supervised denoising methods for paired noisy images typically
involve mapping one noisy image through the network to the other noisy image.
However, after measuring the spectral bias of such methods using our proposed
Image Pair Frequency-Band Similarity, it suffers from two practical
limitations. Firstly, the high-frequency structural details in images are not
preserved well enough. Secondly, during the process of fitting high
frequencies, the network learns high-frequency noise from the mapped noisy
images. To address these challenges, we introduce a Spectral Controlling
network (SCNet) to optimize self-supervised denoising of paired noisy images.
First, we propose a selection strategy to choose frequency band components for
noisy images, to accelerate the convergence speed of training. Next, we present
a parameter optimization method that restricts the learning ability of
convolutional kernels to high-frequency noise using the Lipschitz constant,
without changing the network structure. Finally, we introduce the Spectral
Separation and low-rank Reconstruction module (SSR module), which separates
noise and high-frequency details through frequency domain separation and
low-rank space reconstruction, to retain the high-frequency structural details
of images. Experiments performed on synthetic and real-world datasets verify
the effectiveness of SCNet.

TL;DR: VLOD-TTA is a test-time adaptation framework for vision-language object detectors that improves zero-shot performance under domain shifts using IoU-weighted entropy and image-conditioned prompt selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language object detectors perform well in zero-shot settings but degrade under domain shift, requiring adaptation methods to maintain performance across different environments.

Method: Uses two main techniques: 1) IoU-weighted entropy objective to focus adaptation on spatially coherent proposal clusters and reduce confirmation bias, 2) Image-conditioned prompt selection that ranks prompts by image-level compatibility and fuses informative prompts with detector logits.

Result: Shows consistent improvements across diverse distribution shifts including stylized domains, driving scenes, low-light conditions, and common corruptions on YOLO-World and Grounding DINO detectors.

Conclusion: VLOD-TTA effectively adapts vision-language object detectors to domain shifts through proposal clustering and prompt selection, outperforming zero-shot and baseline TTA methods.

Abstract: Vision-language object detectors (VLODs) such as YOLO-World and Grounding
DINO achieve impressive zero-shot recognition by aligning region proposals with
text representations. However, their performance often degrades under domain
shift. We introduce VLOD-TTA, a test-time adaptation (TTA) framework for VLODs
that leverages dense proposal overlap and image-conditioned prompt scores.
First, an IoU-weighted entropy objective is proposed that concentrates
adaptation on spatially coherent proposal clusters and reduces confirmation
bias from isolated boxes. Second, image-conditioned prompt selection is
introduced, which ranks prompts by image-level compatibility and fuses the most
informative prompts with the detector logits. Our benchmarking across diverse
distribution shifts -- including stylized domains, driving scenes, low-light
conditions, and common corruptions -- shows the effectiveness of our method on
two state-of-the-art VLODs, YOLO-World and Grounding DINO, with consistent
improvements over the zero-shot and TTA baselines. Code :

Motivation: To create a rigorous testbed that unifies visual perception, symbolic manipulation, and arithmetic consistency, addressing the limitations of current models in compositional reasoning across vision and symbols.

Method: Developed a benchmark with 1.4M generated instances including both text-guided and purely visual settings, systematically varying digit scale, move complexity, solution multiplicity, and operator variation.

limitations: closed-source models succeed only on simple cases, open-source
models fail in the visual regime, while humans exceed 90\% accuracy. These
findings establish \textsc{MathSticks} as a rigorous testbed for advancing
compositional reasoning across vision and symbols. Our code and dataset are

### [29] [Normal-Abnormal Guided Generalist Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00495)
*Yuexin Wang,Xiaolei Wang,Yizheng Gong,Jimin Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Normal-Abnormal Generalist Learning (NAGL) framework for generalist anomaly detection that uses both normal and anomalous samples as references, outperforming previous methods that only used normal samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous GAD methods only used normal samples as references, overlooking valuable information from anomalous samples that are often available in real-world scenarios.

Method: NAGL framework with two components: Residual Mining (RM) extracts abnormal patterns from normal-abnormal reference residuals, and Anomaly Feature Learning (AFL) adaptively learns anomaly features through residual mapping.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing GAD approaches.

Conclusion: This is the first work to adopt a mixture of normal and abnormal samples as references in generalist anomaly detection, enabling more accurate and efficient cross-domain anomaly detection.

Abstract: Generalist Anomaly Detection (GAD) aims to train a unified model on an
original domain that can detect anomalies in new target domains. Previous GAD
methods primarily use only normal samples as references, overlooking the
valuable information contained in anomalous samples that are often available in
real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a more practical
approach: normal-abnormal-guided generalist anomaly detection, which leverages
both normal and anomalous samples as references to guide anomaly detection
across diverse domains. We introduce the Normal-Abnormal Generalist Learning
(NAGL) framework, consisting of two key components: Residual Mining (RM) and
Anomaly Feature Learning (AFL). RM extracts abnormal patterns from
normal-abnormal reference residuals to establish transferable anomaly
representations, while AFL adaptively learns anomaly features in query images
through residual mapping to identify instance-aware anomalies. Our approach
effectively utilizes both normal and anomalous references for more accurate and
efficient cross-domain anomaly detection. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing GAD
approaches. This work represents the first to adopt a mixture of normal and
abnormal samples as references in generalist anomaly detection. The code and
datasets are available at https://github.com/JasonKyng/NAGL.

*Kaiqi Zhang,Mingguan Yang,Dali Chang,Chun Chen,Yuxiang Zhang,Kexun He,Jing Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAF (Relative-Absolute Fusion) improves image-based iterative method selection for sparse linear systems by fusing relative image features with absolute numerical values, preventing feature ambiguity and achieving state-of-the-art performance with 5.86%-11.50% speed improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image-based selection approaches for sparse linear systems suffer from feature ambiguity where distinct matrices can have identical image representations, leading to suboptimal method selection and reduced robustness.

Method: RAF combines relative features from image representations with absolute features from corresponding numerical values through simultaneous extraction and fusion, creating comprehensive matrix representations that prevent feature ambiguity.

Result: Evaluations on SuiteSparse and BMCMat datasets show solution time reductions of 0.08s-0.29s (5.86%-11.50% faster than conventional image-based approaches) and state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: RAF effectively enhances image-based selection approaches by preventing feature ambiguity through relative-absolute fusion, unlocking their full potential for iterative method selection in sparse linear systems.

Abstract: Iterative method selection is crucial for solving sparse linear systems
because these methods inherently lack robustness. Though image-based selection
approaches have shown promise, their feature extraction techniques might encode
distinct matrices into identical image representations, leading to the same
selection and suboptimal method. In this paper, we introduce RAF
(Relative-Absolute Fusion), an efficient feature extraction technique to
enhance image-based selection approaches. By simultaneously extracting and
fusing image representations as relative features with corresponding numerical
values as absolute features, RAF achieves comprehensive matrix representations
that prevent feature ambiguity across distinct matrices, thus improving
selection accuracy and unlocking the potential of image-based selection
approaches. We conducted comprehensive evaluations of RAF on SuiteSparse and
our developed BMCMat (Balanced Multi-Classification Matrix dataset),
demonstrating solution time reductions of 0.08s-0.29s for sparse linear
systems, which is 5.86%-11.50% faster than conventional image-based selection
approaches and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. BMCMat is

### [31] [Affordance-Guided Diffusion Prior for 3D Hand Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00506)
*Naru Suzuki,Takehiko Ohkawa,Tatsuro Banno,Jihyun Lee,Ryosuke Furuta,Yoichi Sato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A generative method for refining 3D hand poses under severe occlusion using affordance-aware textual descriptions from vision-language models to guide diffusion-based pose generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of reconstructing 3D hand poses when large portions are heavily occluded by leveraging contextual knowledge about object affordances.

Method: Uses a diffusion-based generative model that learns hand pose distributions conditioned on affordance descriptions inferred from a large vision-language model (VLM).

Result: Significantly improves hand pose estimation on HOGraspNet dataset with severe occlusions, outperforming recent regression methods and diffusion-based refinement without contextual reasoning.

Conclusion: Affordance-guided refinement enables more accurate and functionally coherent hand pose reconstruction under severe occlusion by incorporating contextual knowledge about hand-object interactions.

Abstract: How can we reconstruct 3D hand poses when large portions of the hand are
heavily occluded by itself or by objects? Humans often resolve such ambiguities
by leveraging contextual knowledge -- such as affordances, where an object's
shape and function suggest how the object is typically grasped. Inspired by
this observation, we propose a generative prior for hand pose refinement guided
by affordance-aware textual descriptions of hand-object interactions (HOI). Our
method employs a diffusion-based generative model that learns the distribution
of plausible hand poses conditioned on affordance descriptions, which are
inferred from a large vision-language model (VLM). This enables the refinement
of occluded regions into more accurate and functionally coherent hand poses.
Extensive experiments on HOGraspNet, a 3D hand-affordance dataset with severe
occlusions, demonstrate that our affordance-guided refinement significantly
improves hand pose estimation over both recent regression methods and
diffusion-based refinement lacking contextual reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EPIC is a progressive learning framework that improves multi-modal large model efficiency through token compression via token-wise and layer-wise consistency distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual tokens consume excessive computational resources in MLLMs, and existing compression methods overlook the increased learning difficulty caused by feature space perturbations from token compression.

Method: Progressive consistency distillation framework with token consistency distillation and layer consistency distillation, decomposing feature space perturbations along token-wise and layer-wise dimensions using teacher model guidance.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate superior effectiveness, robustness, and generalization capabilities of the proposed framework.

Conclusion: EPIC successfully addresses the efficiency challenge in MLLMs through progressive consistency distillation while maintaining model performance.

Abstract: Visual tokens consume substantial computational resources in multi-modal
large models (MLLMs), significantly compromising their efficiency. Recent works
have attempted to improve efficiency by compressing visual tokens during
training, either through modifications to model components or by introducing
additional parameters. However, they often overlook the increased learning
difficulty caused by such compression, as the model's parameter space struggles
to quickly adapt to the substantial perturbations in the feature space induced
by token compression. In this work, we propose to develop Efficient MLLMs via
Progressive Consistency Distillation (EPIC), a progressive learning framework.
Specifically, by decomposing the feature space perturbations introduced by
token compression along the token-wise and layer-wise dimensions, we introduce
token consistency distillation and layer consistency distillation,
respectively, aiming to reduce the training difficulty by leveraging guidance
from a teacher model and following a progressive learning trajectory. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior effectiveness, robustness, and
generalization capabilities of our proposed framework.

*Darya Taratynova,Ahmed Aly,Numan Saeed,Mohammad Yaqub*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CardioBench is a comprehensive benchmark for echocardiography foundation models that standardizes evaluation across 8 public datasets and 9 tasks, revealing complementary strengths of different model families and providing guidance for future model development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models are transforming medical imaging but lack standardized evaluation in echocardiography due to unique challenges like noisy data, frame redundancy, and limited public datasets with most existing solutions evaluated on private data.

Method: Created CardioBench by unifying 8 public echocardiography datasets into standardized evaluation suite with 4 regression and 5 classification tasks covering functional, structural, diagnostic, and view recognition endpoints. Evaluated cardiac-specific, biomedical, and general-purpose encoders under consistent zero-shot, probing, and alignment protocols.

Result: Found complementary strengths: temporal modeling critical for functional regression, retrieval provides robustness under distribution shift, domain-specific text encoders capture physiologically meaningful axes. General-purpose encoders transfer well but struggle with fine-grained distinctions like view classification and subtle pathology recognition.

Conclusion: CardioBench establishes reproducible reference point for echocardiography foundation models and provides actionable insights to guide future model design, with released preprocessing, splits, and public evaluation pipelines.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are reshaping medical imaging, yet their application
in echocardiography remains limited. While several echocardiography-specific
FMs have recently been introduced, no standardized benchmark exists to evaluate
them. Echocardiography poses unique challenges, including noisy acquisitions,
high frame redundancy, and limited public datasets. Most existing solutions
evaluate on private data, restricting comparability. To address this, we
introduce CardioBench, a comprehensive benchmark for echocardiography FMs.
CardioBench unifies eight publicly available datasets into a standardized suite
spanning four regression and five classification tasks, covering functional,
structural, diagnostic, and view recognition endpoints. We evaluate several
leading FM, including cardiac-specific, biomedical, and general-purpose
encoders, under consistent zero-shot, probing, and alignment protocols. Our
results highlight complementary strengths across model families: temporal
modeling is critical for functional regression, retrieval provides robustness
under distribution shift, and domain-specific text encoders capture
physiologically meaningful axes. General-purpose encoders transfer strongly and
often close the gap with probing, but struggle with fine-grained distinctions
like view classification and subtle pathology recognition. By releasing
preprocessing, splits, and public evaluation pipelines, CardioBench establishes
a reproducible reference point and offers actionable insights to guide the
design of future echocardiography foundation models.

### [34] [Cascaded Diffusion Framework for Probabilistic Coarse-to-Fine Hand Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00527)
*Taeyun Woo,Jinah Park,Tae-Kyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A cascaded diffusion framework for 3D hand pose reconstruction that combines probabilistic modeling with coarse-to-fine refinement to address pose ambiguities and capture pose uncertainties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deterministic models struggle with pose ambiguities from self-occlusions and complex articulations, while probabilistic methods are limited to single-stage estimation without refinement capabilities.

Method: Two-stage cascaded diffusion: 1) Joint diffusion model samples diverse 3D joint hypotheses, 2) Mesh Latent Diffusion Model reconstructs 3D hand mesh conditioned on joint samples, trained with diverse hypotheses in learned latent space.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on FreiHAND and HO3Dv2 datasets while effectively modeling pose distributions.

Conclusion: The framework successfully combines probabilistic modeling with cascaded refinement, learning distribution-aware joint-mesh relationships and robust hand priors for accurate 3D hand reconstruction.

Abstract: Deterministic models for 3D hand pose reconstruction, whether single-staged
or cascaded, struggle with pose ambiguities caused by self-occlusions and
complex hand articulations. Existing cascaded approaches refine predictions in
a coarse-to-fine manner but remain deterministic and cannot capture pose
uncertainties. Recent probabilistic methods model pose distributions yet are
restricted to single-stage estimation, which often fails to produce accurate 3D
reconstructions without refinement. To address these limitations, we propose a
coarse-to-fine cascaded diffusion framework that combines probabilistic
modeling with cascaded refinement. The first stage is a joint diffusion model
that samples diverse 3D joint hypotheses, and the second stage is a Mesh Latent
Diffusion Model (Mesh LDM) that reconstructs a 3D hand mesh conditioned on a
joint sample. By training Mesh LDM with diverse joint hypotheses in a learned
latent space, our framework learns distribution-aware joint-mesh relationships
and robust hand priors. Furthermore, the cascaded design mitigates the
difficulty of directly mapping 2D images to dense 3D poses, enhancing accuracy
through sequential refinement. Experiments on FreiHAND and HO3Dv2 demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while effectively
modeling pose distributions.

*Aoduo Li,Peikai Lin,Jiancheng Li,Zhen Zhang,Shiting Wu,Zexiao Liang,Zhifa Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Forestpest-YOLO is a detection framework optimized for agricultural pest detection in forestry remote sensing, achieving state-of-the-art performance on small, occluded pests through lossless downsampling, cross-stage feature fusion, and refined training objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agricultural pest detection in forestry environments faces challenges due to minuscule targets, heavy occlusion, visual similarity to cluttered backgrounds, and extreme data imbalance, causing conventional object detection models to fail.

Method: Builds on YOLOv8 with three key innovations: 1) SPD-Conv for lossless downsampling to preserve small target details, 2) CSPOK cross-stage feature fusion block for multi-scale feature enhancement and background noise suppression, 3) VarifocalLoss to focus training on high-quality and hard-to-classify samples.

Result: Extensive experiments on the self-constructed ForestPest dataset show Forestpest-YOLO achieves state-of-the-art performance with marked improvements in detecting small, occluded pests, significantly outperforming established baseline models.

Conclusion: Forestpest-YOLO successfully overcomes the challenges of agricultural pest detection in complex forestry environments through its synergistic innovations, demonstrating superior performance for this specialized application.

Abstract: Detecting agricultural pests in complex forestry environments using remote
sensing imagery is fundamental for ecological preservation, yet it is severely
hampered by practical challenges. Targets are often minuscule, heavily
occluded, and visually similar to the cluttered background, causing
conventional object detection models to falter due to the loss of fine-grained
features and an inability to handle extreme data imbalance. To overcome these
obstacles, this paper introduces Forestpest-YOLO, a detection framework
meticulously optimized for the nuances of forestry remote sensing. Building
upon the YOLOv8 architecture, our framework introduces a synergistic trio of
innovations. We first integrate a lossless downsampling module, SPD-Conv, to
ensure that critical high-resolution details of small targets are preserved
throughout the network. This is complemented by a novel cross-stage feature
fusion block, CSPOK, which dynamically enhances multi-scale feature
representation while suppressing background noise. Finally, we employ
VarifocalLoss to refine the training objective, compelling the model to focus
on high-quality and hard-to-classify samples. Extensive experiments on our
challenging, self-constructed ForestPest dataset demonstrate that
Forestpest-YOLO achieves state-of-the-art performance, showing marked
improvements in detecting small, occluded pests and significantly outperforming
established baseline models.

### [36] [Assessing Foundation Models for Mold Colony Detection with Limited Training Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00561)
*Henrik Pichler,Janis Keuper,Matthew Copping*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision foundation models like MaskDINO can achieve near-parity with extensively trained traditional models (YoloV9) for mold colony detection on Petri dishes using only 150 annotated images, enabling data-efficient automation in microbiology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that exhaustive annotation is not necessary for new vision tasks, particularly in automating mold colony quantification for indoor air quality assessment, which is traditionally labor-intensive.

Method: Compiled a dataset of 5000 Petri dish images with bounding boxes and instance masks, benchmarking vision foundation models against traditional baselines in few-shot and low-shot scenarios.

Result: MaskDINO achieved near-parity performance with extensively trained YoloV9 using only 150 images, maintained competitive performance with 25 images, and remained reliable on approximately 70% of samples.

Conclusion: Data-efficient foundation models can match traditional approaches with significantly less data, enabling faster development and superior performance in automated microbiological systems.

Abstract: The process of quantifying mold colonies on Petri dish samples is of critical
importance for the assessment of indoor air quality, as high colony counts can
indicate potential health risks and deficiencies in ventilation systems.
Conventionally the automation of such a labor-intensive process, as well as
other tasks in microbiology, relies on the manual annotation of large datasets
and the subsequent extensive training of models like YoloV9. To demonstrate
that exhaustive annotation is not a prerequisite anymore when tackling a new
vision task, we compile a representative dataset of 5000 Petri dish images
annotated with bounding boxes, simulating both a traditional data collection
approach as well as few-shot and low-shot scenarios with well curated subsets
with instance level masks. We benchmark three vision foundation models against
traditional baselines on task specific metrics, reflecting realistic real-world
requirements. Notably, MaskDINO attains near-parity with an extensively trained
YoloV9 model while finetuned only on 150 images, retaining competitive
performance with as few as 25 images, still being reliable on $\approx$ 70% of
the samples. Our results show that data-efficient foundation models can match
traditional approaches with only a fraction of the required data, enabling
earlier development and faster iterative improvement of automated
microbiological systems with a superior upper-bound performance than
traditional models would achieve.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes adaptive shared experts (ASE) within a LoRA-based MoE framework to improve multi-task learning by facilitating single-task to multi-task transition, enhancing expert specialization and cooperation, and enabling fine-grained knowledge sharing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing MoE-MTL methods that rely on single-task pretrained backbones and suffer from redundant adaptation and inefficient knowledge sharing during STL to MTL transition.

Method: ASE with router-computed gating weights for shared experts jointly normalized with sparse experts, plus fine-grained experts by increasing LoRA experts while reducing their rank proportionally.

Result: Extensive experiments on PASCAL-Context benchmark show ASE consistently improves performance across diverse configurations and validates effectiveness of fine-grained designs for MTL.

Conclusion: ASE framework effectively addresses STL to MTL transition challenges and enables more efficient knowledge sharing in multi-task learning.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a powerful framework for multi-task
learning (MTL). However, existing MoE-MTL methods often rely on single-task
pretrained backbones and suffer from redundant adaptation and inefficient
knowledge sharing during the transition from single-task to multi-task learning
(STL to MTL). To address these limitations, we propose adaptive shared experts
(ASE) within a low-rank adaptation (LoRA) based MoE, where shared experts are
assigned router-computed gating weights jointly normalized with sparse experts.
This design facilitates STL to MTL transition, enhances expert specialization,
and cooperation. Furthermore, we incorporate fine-grained experts by increasing
the number of LoRA experts while proportionally reducing their rank, enabling
more effective knowledge sharing under a comparable parameter budget. Extensive
experiments on the PASCAL-Context benchmark, under unified training settings,
demonstrate that ASE consistently improves performance across diverse
configurations and validates the effectiveness of fine-grained designs for MTL.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ArbInterp is a novel generative video frame interpolation framework that enables flexible interpolation at any timestamp and of any length, overcoming limitations of fixed-frame methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative VFI methods are constrained to synthesize a fixed number of intermediate frames, lacking flexibility to adjust generated frame rates or total sequence duration.

Method: Proposes Timestamp-aware Rotary Position Embedding (TaRoPE) for any-timestamp interpolation and decomposes long-sequence generation into segment-wise frame synthesis with appearance-motion decoupled conditioning for seamless transitions.

Result: Outperforms prior methods across all scenarios (2x to 32x interpolation) with higher fidelity and more seamless spatiotemporal continuity.

Conclusion: ArbInterp provides a flexible and efficient solution for arbitrary-length video frame interpolation with superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Video frame interpolation (VFI), which generates intermediate frames from
given start and end frames, has become a fundamental function in video
generation applications. However, existing generative VFI methods are
constrained to synthesize a fixed number of intermediate frames, lacking the
flexibility to adjust generated frame rates or total sequence duration. In this
work, we present ArbInterp, a novel generative VFI framework that enables
efficient interpolation at any timestamp and of any length. Specifically, to
support interpolation at any timestamp, we propose the Timestamp-aware Rotary
Position Embedding (TaRoPE), which modulates positions in temporal RoPE to
align generated frames with target normalized timestamps. This design enables
fine-grained control over frame timestamps, addressing the inflexibility of
fixed-position paradigms in prior work. For any-length interpolation, we
decompose long-sequence generation into segment-wise frame synthesis. We
further design a novel appearance-motion decoupled conditioning strategy: it
leverages prior segment endpoints to enforce appearance consistency and
temporal semantics to maintain motion coherence, ensuring seamless
spatiotemporal transitions across segments. Experimentally, we build
comprehensive benchmarks for multi-scale frame interpolation (2x to 32x) to
assess generalizability across arbitrary interpolation factors. Results show
that ArbInterp outperforms prior methods across all scenarios with higher
fidelity and more seamless spatiotemporal continuity. Project website:

TL;DR: MDS-NeRF is a novel neural radiance field approach for 3D style transfer that reengineers the NeRF pipeline with multi-level feature adaptation and dynamic style injection to achieve superior content preservation and artistic stylization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NeRF-based style transfer methods often produce suboptimal results in both content preservation and artistic stylization by simply integrating style statistics into the original NeRF pipeline.

Method: Proposes multi-level feature adaptor to generate multi-level feature grid representation, dynamic style injection module to extract and adaptively integrate style features, and multi-level cascade decoder to transform stylized features into final views.

Result: Extensive experiments show MDS-NeRF achieves outstanding performance for 3D style transfer, preserving multi-scale spatial structures while effectively transferring stylistic characteristics.

Conclusion: MDS-NeRF successfully reengineers the NeRF pipeline specifically for stylization and supports omni-view style transfer using 3D style references.

Abstract: As the application of neural radiance fields (NeRFs) in various 3D vision
tasks continues to expand, numerous NeRF-based style transfer techniques have
been developed. However, existing methods typically integrate style statistics
into the original NeRF pipeline, often leading to suboptimal results in both
content preservation and artistic stylization. In this paper, we present
multi-level dynamic style transfer for NeRFs (MDS-NeRF), a novel approach that
reengineers the NeRF pipeline specifically for stylization and incorporates an
innovative dynamic style injection module. Particularly, we propose a
multi-level feature adaptor that helps generate a multi-level feature grid
representation from the content radiance field, effectively capturing the
multi-scale spatial structure of the scene. In addition, we present a dynamic
style injection module that learns to extract relevant style features and
adaptively integrates them into the content patterns. The stylized multi-level
features are then transformed into the final stylized view through our proposed
multi-level cascade decoder. Furthermore, we extend our 3D style transfer
method to support omni-view style transfer using 3D style references. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MDS-NeRF achieves outstanding performance for 3D
style transfer, preserving multi-scale spatial structures while effectively
transferring stylistic characteristics.

Method: Integrates LVLMs with semantic pattern matching and iterative self-questioning refinement using optimized domain-specific prompting and recursive verification.

Result: Achieves 98% accuracy in defect detection, 85%-98% annotation accuracy across four defect categories in balanced settings, and 80%-92% accuracy on imbalanced datasets.

Conclusion: ADPT provides a scalable, cost-effective solution for high-fidelity dataset construction that supports downstream tasks like transfer learning and domain adaptation in structural damage assessment.

Abstract: Automated structural defect annotation is essential for ensuring
infrastructure safety while minimizing the high costs and inefficiencies of
manual labeling. A novel agentic annotation framework, Agent-based Defect
Pattern Tagger (ADPT), is introduced that integrates Large Vision-Language

*Yunbo Xu,Xuesong Zhang,Jia Li,Zhenzhen Hu,Richang Hong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COFA is a vision-language navigation strategy that augments visual features by separating foreground and background information, using consensus-driven online feature selection to improve navigation generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLN approaches underutilize the distinct roles of foreground (semantic cues) and background (spatial connectivity) in visual observations, limiting navigation performance.

Method: Uses semantically-enhanced landmark identification to disentangle foreground/background features, then applies consensus-driven online augmentation with two-stage voting to select preferred features based on instructions and locations.

Result: Experiments on REVERIE and R2R benchmarks show improved generalization over baselines and state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: Separating and strategically augmenting foreground and background features through consensus-driven selection significantly enhances VLN agent generalization and performance.

Abstract: Following language instructions, vision-language navigation (VLN) agents are
tasked with navigating unseen environments. While augmenting multifaceted
visual representations has propelled advancements in VLN, the significance of
foreground and background in visual observations remains underexplored.
Intuitively, foreground regions provide semantic cues, whereas the background
encompasses spatial connectivity information. Inspired on this insight, we
propose a Consensus-driven Online Feature Augmentation strategy (COFA) with
alternative foreground and background features to facilitate the navigable
generalization. Specifically, we first leverage semantically-enhanced landmark
identification to disentangle foreground and background as candidate augmented
features. Subsequently, a consensus-driven online augmentation strategy
encourages the agent to consolidate two-stage voting results on feature
preferences according to diverse instructions and navigational locations.
Experiments on REVERIE and R2R demonstrate that our online
foreground-background augmentation boosts the generalization of baseline and
attains state-of-the-art performance.

### [43] [Robust Context-Aware Object Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00618)
*Klara Janouskova,Cristian Gavrus,Jiri Matas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RCOR is a novel approach that achieves both robustness and context-awareness in visual recognition by treating localization as integral to recognition, decoupling object-centric and context-aware modeling, and using robust non-parametric fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard supervised learning in visual recognition often leads to over-reliance on background context (shortcut learning), limiting model robustness. Existing approaches suppress background at the cost of losing valuable context information.

Method: RCOR treats localization as an integral part of recognition to decouple object-centric and context-aware modeling, followed by robust non-parametric fusion. This enables localization before recognition even in complex scenes.

Result: RCOR improves performance of both supervised models and VLMs on datasets with both in-domain and out-of-domain backgrounds, even without fine-tuning. It works effectively on complex datasets like ImageNet-1k.

Conclusion: RCOR demonstrates that it's possible to achieve both robustness and context-awareness without compromising either, making localization before recognition feasible in complex visual scenes.

Abstract: In visual recognition, both the object of interest (referred to as
foreground, FG, for simplicity) and its surrounding context (background, BG)
play an important role. However, standard supervised learning often leads to
unintended over-reliance on the BG, known as shortcut learning of spurious
correlations, limiting model robustness in real-world deployment settings. In
the literature, the problem is mainly addressed by suppressing the BG,
sacrificing context information for improved generalization.
  We propose RCOR -- Robust Context-Aware Object Recognition -- the first
approach that jointly achieves robustness and context-awareness without
compromising either. RCOR treats localization as an integral part of
recognition to decouple object-centric and context-aware modelling, followed by
a robust, non-parametric fusion. It improves the performance of both supervised
models and VLM on datasets with both in-domain and out-of-domain BG, even
without fine-tuning. The results confirm that localization before recognition
is now possible even in complex scenes as in ImageNet-1k.

### [44] [UCD: Unconditional Discriminator Promotes Nash Equilibrium in GANs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00624)
*Mengfei Xia,Nan Xue,Jiapeng Zhu,Yujun Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using an unconditional discriminator (UCD) in GAN training to improve convergence and prevent mode collapse by enforcing the discriminator to extract more comprehensive features without condition injection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GAN training struggles with convergence and mode collapse, and the authors identify that redundant shortcuts from conditional inputs in the discriminator disable meaningful knowledge extraction, preventing proper Nash equilibrium.

Method: The authors propose using an unconditional discriminator (UCD) where the discriminator is enforced to extract comprehensive and robust features without condition injection, allowing it to provide better supervision to the generator.

Result: Extensive experiments show significant performance improvements with high efficiency, achieving 1.47 FID on ImageNet-64 dataset, surpassing StyleGAN-XL and state-of-the-art one-step diffusion models.

Conclusion: UCD promotes Nash equilibrium in GAN training, is theoretically compatible with vanilla GAN theory, and can be implemented in a plug-in manner with substantial performance gains.

Abstract: Adversarial training turns out to be the key to one-step generation,
especially for Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and diffusion model
distillation. Yet in practice, GAN training hardly converges properly and
struggles in mode collapse. In this work, we quantitatively analyze the extent
of Nash equilibrium in GAN training, and conclude that redundant shortcuts by
inputting condition in $D$ disables meaningful knowledge extraction. We thereby
propose to employ an unconditional discriminator (UCD), in which $D$ is
enforced to extract more comprehensive and robust features with no condition
injection. In this way, $D$ is able to leverage better knowledge to supervise
$G$, which promotes Nash equilibrium in GAN literature. Theoretical guarantee
on compatibility with vanilla GAN theory indicates that UCD can be implemented
in a plug-in manner. Extensive experiments confirm the significant performance
improvements with high efficiency. For instance, we achieved \textbf{1.47 FID}
on the ImageNet-64 dataset, surpassing StyleGAN-XL and several state-of-the-art
one-step diffusion models. The code will be made publicly available.

### [45] [Virtual Fashion Photo-Shoots: Building a Large-Scale Garment-Lookbook Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00633)
*Yannick Hauri,Luca A. Lanzendörfer,Till Aczel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces virtual fashion photo-shoot, a new task that transforms standardized garment images into editorial fashion imagery with dynamic poses, diverse locations, and visual narratives, moving beyond traditional virtual try-on.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fashion image generation focuses on narrow tasks like virtual try-on in clean studio environments, missing the richness of editorial fashion with dynamic poses, diverse locations, and visual storytelling.

Method: Constructed a large-scale dataset of garment-lookbook pairs using an automated retrieval pipeline that combines visual-language reasoning with object-level localization to align garments across domains, creating three quality levels: high (10K), medium (50K), and low (300K) quality pairs.

Result: Created the first large-scale dataset bridging e-commerce and fashion media domains, enabling models to generate fashion imagery that reflects creativity, atmosphere, and storytelling rather than just catalog-style generation.

Conclusion: The dataset provides a foundation for advancing fashion image generation beyond traditional catalog-style approaches toward more creative, contextual, and narrative-driven editorial fashion imagery.

Abstract: Fashion image generation has so far focused on narrow tasks such as virtual
try-on, where garments appear in clean studio environments. In contrast,
editorial fashion presents garments through dynamic poses, diverse locations,
and carefully crafted visual narratives. We introduce the task of virtual
fashion photo-shoot, which seeks to capture this richness by transforming
standardized garment images into contextually grounded editorial imagery. To
enable this new direction, we construct the first large-scale dataset of
garment-lookbook pairs, bridging the gap between e-commerce and fashion media.
Because such pairs are not readily available, we design an automated retrieval
pipeline that aligns garments across domains, combining visual-language
reasoning with object-level localization. We construct a dataset with three
garment-lookbook pair accuracy levels: high quality (10,000 pairs), medium
quality (50,000 pairs), and low quality (300,000 pairs). This dataset offers a
foundation for models that move beyond catalog-style generation and toward
fashion imagery that reflects creativity, atmosphere, and storytelling.

*Jiayao Jiang,Siran Peng,Bin Liu,Qi Chu,Nenghai Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel face forgery detection method using Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) with learnable splines and landmark-assisted adaptive module (LAKAN) to focus on critical facial areas with artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CNN and Transformer-based methods have limitations in modeling the complex non-linear nature of forgery artifacts, requiring more robust detection algorithms.

Method: Proposed KAN-based detection with learnable splines instead of fixed activation functions, enhanced by LAKAN module that uses facial landmarks as structural prior to generate instance-specific parameters and guide attention to artifact-rich facial regions.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The combination of geometric priors (facial landmarks) with KAN's adaptive learning creates an effective approach for face forgery detection that outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: The rapid development of deepfake generation techniques necessitates robust
face forgery detection algorithms. While methods based on Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and Transformers are effective, there is still room for
improvement in modeling the highly complex and non-linear nature of forgery
artifacts. To address this issue, we propose a novel detection method based on
the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). By replacing fixed activation functions
with learnable splines, our KAN-based approach is better suited to this
challenge. Furthermore, to guide the network's focus towards critical facial
areas, we introduce a Landmark-assisted Adaptive Kolmogorov-Arnold Network
(LAKAN) module. This module uses facial landmarks as a structural prior to
dynamically generate the internal parameters of the KAN, creating an
instance-specific signal that steers a general-purpose image encoder towards
the most informative facial regions with artifacts. This core innovation
creates a powerful combination between geometric priors and the network's
learning process. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets show that
our proposed method achieves superior performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReFlux is the first concept attack method designed to test concept erasure robustness in rectified flow-based text-to-image models like Flux, using reverse-attention optimization and velocity guidance to reactivate suppressed concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing concept erasure methods and attack evaluations are tailored to Stable Diffusion and show limited effectiveness when transferred to next-generation rectified flow transformers like Flux, creating a need for specialized attack methods.

Method: Proposes a reverse-attention optimization strategy to reactivate suppressed signals while stabilizing attention, reinforced by velocity-guided dynamics for robust concept reactivation and consistency-preserving objectives to maintain global layout.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the method's effectiveness and efficiency in attacking concept erasure in rectified flow transformers, establishing a reliable benchmark for evaluating erasure robustness.

Conclusion: ReFlux successfully addresses the limitations of existing attack methods for next-generation T2I models and provides a specialized framework for assessing concept erasure robustness in rectified flow transformers.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have enabled
impressive generative capabilities, but they also raise significant safety
concerns due to the potential to produce harmful or undesirable content. While
concept erasure has been explored as a mitigation strategy, most existing
approaches and corresponding attack evaluations are tailored to Stable
Diffusion (SD) and exhibit limited effectiveness when transferred to
next-generation rectified flow transformers such as Flux. In this work, we
present ReFlux, the first concept attack method specifically designed to assess
the robustness of concept erasure in the latest rectified flow-based T2I
framework. Our approach is motivated by the observation that existing concept
erasure techniques, when applied to Flux, fundamentally rely on a phenomenon
known as attention localization. Building on this insight, we propose a simple
yet effective attack strategy that specifically targets this property. At its
core, a reverse-attention optimization strategy is introduced to effectively
reactivate suppressed signals while stabilizing attention. This is further
reinforced by a velocity-guided dynamic that enhances the robustness of concept
reactivation by steering the flow matching process, and a
consistency-preserving objective that maintains the global layout and preserves
unrelated content. Extensive experiments consistently demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed attack method, establishing a
reliable benchmark for evaluating the robustness of concept erasure strategies
in rectified flow transformers.

TL;DR: A novel real-time camera-radar fusion architecture for BEV map segmentation that achieves high accuracy (53.5 mIoU) with 260% faster inference than baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-sensor fusion is needed for robust perception in autonomous vehicles, combining camera semantic information with radar distance measurements cost-effectively. Map segmentation faces challenges in accuracy and real-time performance.

Method: Uses camera-radar fusion in BEV space with an advanced loss set and new lightweight head to improve perception results while maintaining real-time performance.

Result: Achieves 53.5 mIoU, comparable to large models, with 260% faster inference time than strongest baseline models.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture successfully addresses map segmentation challenges by balancing high accuracy, per-class balancing, and real-time inference requirements through efficient camera-radar fusion.

Abstract: Multi-sensor fusion in autonomous vehicles is becoming more common to offer a
more robust alternative for several perception tasks. This need arises from the
unique contribution of each sensor in collecting data: camera-radar fusion
offers a cost-effective solution by combining rich semantic information from
cameras with accurate distance measurements from radar, without incurring
excessive financial costs or overwhelming data processing requirements. Map
segmentation is a critical task for enabling effective vehicle behaviour in its
environment, yet it continues to face significant challenges in achieving high
accuracy and meeting real-time performance requirements. Therefore, this work
presents a novel and efficient map segmentation architecture, using cameras and
radars, in the \acrfull{bev} space. Our model introduces a real-time map
segmentation architecture considering aspects such as high accuracy, per-class
balancing, and inference time. To accomplish this, we use an advanced loss set
together with a new lightweight head to improve the perception results. Our
results show that, with these modifications, our approach achieves results
comparable to large models, reaching 53.5 mIoU, while also setting a new
benchmark for inference time, improving it by 260\% over the strongest baseline
models.

adaptability of user-driven open tags. OTTER is built upon a large-scale,
hierarchically organized multi-modal dataset, collected from diverse online

baselines on two benchmark datasets: it achieves an overall F1 score of 0.81 on
Otter and 0.75 on Favorite, surpassing the next-best results by margins of 0.10

*Shaocong Zhu,Zhiwei Li,Xinghua Li,Huanfeng Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A weakly supervised cloud detection method called SpecMCD that combines spectral features with multi-scale scene-level deep networks to generate accurate pixel-level cloud masks from satellite images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clouds degrade optical satellite image quality, limiting applications. Current deep learning methods struggle with thin clouds and low-quality training samples, leaving room for improvement in cloud detection accuracy.

Method: Uses progressive training with multi-scale scene-level dataset, combines multi-scale probability maps with cloud thickness maps, and applies adaptive thresholds with distance-weighted optimization to generate binary cloud masks.

Result: Tested on WDCD and GF1MS-WHU datasets with 60 Gaofen-1 multispectral images. Achieved over 7.82% improvement in F1-score compared to other weakly supervised methods like WDCD and WSFNet.

Conclusion: SpecMCD demonstrates superior performance for cloud detection under different cloud coverage conditions, showing potential for practical applications in satellite image processing.

Abstract: Clouds significantly affect the quality of optical satellite images, which
seriously limits their precise application. Recently, deep learning has been
widely applied to cloud detection and has achieved satisfactory results.
However, the lack of distinctive features in thin clouds and the low quality of
training samples limit the cloud detection accuracy of deep learning methods,
leaving space for further improvements. In this paper, we propose a weakly
supervised cloud detection method that combines spectral features and
multi-scale scene-level deep network (SpecMCD) to obtain highly accurate
pixel-level cloud masks. The method first utilizes a progressive training
framework with a multi-scale scene-level dataset to train the multi-scale
scene-level cloud detection network. Pixel-level cloud probability maps are
then obtained by combining the multi-scale probability maps and cloud thickness
map based on the characteristics of clouds in dense cloud coverage and large
cloud-area coverage images. Finally, adaptive thresholds are generated based on
the differentiated regions of the scene-level cloud masks at different scales
and combined with distance-weighted optimization to obtain binary cloud masks.
Two datasets, WDCD and GF1MS-WHU, comprising a total of 60 Gaofen-1
multispectral (GF1-MS) images, were used to verify the effectiveness of the
proposed method. Compared to the other weakly supervised cloud detection
methods such as WDCD and WSFNet, the F1-score of the proposed SpecMCD method
shows an improvement of over 7.82%, highlighting the superiority and potential
of the SpecMCD method for cloud detection under different cloud coverage
conditions.

*Beomsu Kim,Byunghee Cha,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Align Your Tangent (AYT) method accelerates Consistency Models training by using manifold-aligned tangents that point toward the data manifold, enabling faster training with smaller batch sizes while maintaining sample quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Consistency Models require prolonged training with large batch sizes to achieve competitive sample quality. The training dynamics show oscillatory tangents that move parallel to the data manifold rather than towards it.

Method: Proposed manifold feature distance (MFD) loss function that provides manifold-aligned tangents pointing toward the data manifold, mitigating oscillatory behavior in CM training.

Result: AYT accelerates CM training by orders of magnitude, enables training with extremely small batch sizes without compromising quality, and even outperforms LPIPS metric.

Conclusion: The manifold-aligned tangent approach effectively addresses oscillatory training dynamics in Consistency Models, significantly improving training efficiency and sample quality.

Abstract: With diffusion and flow matching models achieving state-of-the-art generating
performance, the interest of the community now turned to reducing the inference
time without sacrificing sample quality. Consistency Models (CMs), which are
trained to be consistent on diffusion or probability flow ordinary differential
equation (PF-ODE) trajectories, enable one or two-step flow or diffusion
sampling. However, CMs typically require prolonged training with large batch
sizes to obtain competitive sample quality. In this paper, we examine the
training dynamics of CMs near convergence and discover that CM tangents -- CM
output update directions -- are quite oscillatory, in the sense that they move
parallel to the data manifold, not towards the manifold. To mitigate
oscillatory tangents, we propose a new loss function, called the manifold
feature distance (MFD), which provides manifold-aligned tangents that point
toward the data manifold. Consequently, our method -- dubbed Align Your Tangent
(AYT) -- can accelerate CM training by orders of magnitude and even out-perform
the learned perceptual image patch similarity metric (LPIPS). Furthermore, we
find that our loss enables training with extremely small batch sizes without
compromising sample quality. Code: https://github.com/1202kbs/AYT

*Huaying Li,Liansheng Wang,Yinran Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes U2-rPCA, an unsupervised unfolded robust PCA method for ultrasound microvascular imaging that combines mathematical interpretability with deep learning, achieving superior clutter filtering without requiring ground truth labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SVD and rPCA methods have limitations in feature modeling and tissue-blood flow separation, while supervised deep learning filters face interpretability issues and lack of ground truth data for training.

Method: Unfolded robust PCA from IRLS baseline with intrinsic low-rank and sparse regularization, adding a sparse-enhancement unit to capture micro-flow signals. Works as an adaptive filter trained on part of image sequence.

Result: Outperformed SVD-based method, rPCA baseline, and other deep learning filters on in-silico and in-vivo datasets, improving CNR of power Doppler images by 2-10 dB. Effectiveness validated through ablation studies.

Conclusion: U2-rPCA successfully addresses interpretability and ground truth challenges in ultrasound clutter filtering while achieving superior performance for microvascular imaging.

Abstract: High-sensitivity clutter filtering is a fundamental step in ultrasound
microvascular imaging. Singular value decomposition (SVD) and robust principal
component analysis (rPCA) are the main clutter filtering strategies. However,
both strategies are limited in feature modeling and tissue-blood flow
separation for high-quality microvascular imaging. Recently, deep
learning-based clutter filtering has shown potential in more thoroughly
separating tissue and blood flow signals. However, the existing supervised
filters face the challenges of interpretability and lack of in-vitro and
in-vivo ground truths. While the interpretability issue can be addressed by
algorithm deep unfolding, the training ground truth remains unsolved. To this
end, this paper proposes an unsupervised unfolded rPCA (U2-rPCA) method that
preserves mathematical interpretability and is insusceptible to learning
labels. Specifically, U2-rPCA is unfolded from an iteratively reweighted least
squares (IRLS) rPCA baseline with intrinsic low-rank and sparse regularization.
A sparse-enhancement unit is added to the network to strengthen its capability
to capture the sparse micro-flow signals. U2-rPCA is like an adaptive filter
that is trained with part of the image sequence and then used for the following
frames. Experimental validations on a in-silico dataset and public in-vivo
datasets demonstrated the outperformance of U2-rPCA when compared with the
SVD-based method, the rPCA baseline, and another deep learning-based filter.
Particularly, the proposed method improved the contrastto-noise ratio (CNR) of
the power Doppler image by 2 dB to 10 dB when compared with other methods.
Furthermore, the effectiveness of the building modules of U2-rPCA was validated
through ablation studies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework for brain vessel segmentation using image-to-image translation with disentanglement techniques to handle multiple domains without domain-specific model design or data harmonization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Brain vessel morphology is complex and requires comprehensive understanding across different imaging modalities for accurate treatment of brain-related conditions, but current models typically focus on single modalities.

Method: Uses disentanglement techniques to independently manipulate image properties, specifically focusing on vessel appearances while preserving spatial information like shapes and locations crucial for segmentation.

Result: Effectively bridges large domain gaps across medical centers, image modalities, and vessel types, demonstrating robustness and versatility in cerebrovascular image segmentation.

Conclusion: Shows the potential of domain adaptation methodologies for accurate cerebrovascular image segmentation in multiple scenarios, with code publicly available.

Abstract: The intricate morphology of brain vessels poses significant challenges for
automatic segmentation models, which usually focus on a single imaging
modality. However, accurately treating brain-related conditions requires a
comprehensive understanding of the cerebrovascular tree, regardless of the
specific acquisition procedure. Our framework effectively segments brain
arteries and veins in various datasets through image-to-image translation while
avoiding domain-specific model design and data harmonization between the source
and the target domain. This is accomplished by employing disentanglement
techniques to independently manipulate different image properties, allowing
them to move from one domain to another in a label-preserving manner.
Specifically, we focus on manipulating vessel appearances during adaptation
while preserving spatial information, such as shapes and locations, which are
crucial for correct segmentation. Our evaluation effectively bridges large and
varied domain gaps across medical centers, image modalities, and vessel types.
Additionally, we conduct ablation studies on the optimal number of required
annotations and other architectural choices. The results highlight our
framework's robustness and versatility, demonstrating the potential of domain
adaptation methodologies to perform cerebrovascular image segmentation in
multiple scenarios accurately. Our code is available at

*Leah Bar,Liron Mor Yosef,Shai Zucker,Neta Shoham,Inbar Seroussi,Nir Sochen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a geometric framework that unifies geometric and probabilistic perspectives in generative AI, interpreting diffusion models as projections onto image manifolds and introducing a new deterministic model (MPPM) that outperforms latent diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative AI approaches often overlook geometric structure and focus only on probabilistic methods, treating probability distributions in latent spaces as uninteresting or predefined. The paper aims to bridge this gap by unifying geometric and probabilistic perspectives.

Method: Developed a geometric framework with kernel-based probabilistic methods, interpreting diffusion models as projection mechanisms onto image manifolds. Created the Manifold-Probabilistic Projection Model (MPPM) operating in both pixel and latent spaces.

Result: The Latent MPPM (LMPPM) outperforms Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) across various datasets, achieving superior performance in image restoration and generation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed geometric framework successfully unifies geometric and probabilistic perspectives, providing new insights into diffusion models and demonstrating improved performance with the introduced MPPM approach.

Abstract: The foundational premise of generative AI for images is the assumption that
images are inherently low-dimensional objects embedded within a
high-dimensional space. Additionally, it is often implicitly assumed that
thematic image datasets form smooth or piecewise smooth manifolds. Common
approaches overlook the geometric structure and focus solely on probabilistic
methods, approximating the probability distribution through universal
approximation techniques such as the kernel method. In some generative models,
the low dimensional nature of the data manifest itself by the introduction of a
lower dimensional latent space. Yet, the probability distribution in the latent
or the manifold coordinate space is considered uninteresting and is predefined
or considered uniform. This study unifies the geometric and probabilistic
perspectives by providing a geometric framework and a kernel-based
probabilistic method simultaneously. The resulting framework demystifies
diffusion models by interpreting them as a projection mechanism onto the
manifold of ``good images''. This interpretation leads to the construction of a
new deterministic model, the Manifold-Probabilistic Projection Model (MPPM),
which operates in both the representation (pixel) space and the latent space.
We demonstrate that the Latent MPPM (LMPPM) outperforms the Latent Diffusion
Model (LDM) across various datasets, achieving superior results in terms of
image restoration and generation.

*Aaron Kujawa,Thomas Booth,Tom Vercauteren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores binary encoding methods to reduce computational complexity for medical image segmentation with many classes, but finds they underperform compared to standard one-hot encoding despite efficiency gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the linear increase in computational complexity and memory requirements with class count in medical image segmentation, seeking more efficient encoding methods.

Method: Proposed binary encoding approaches including vanilla binary encoding, error-correcting output codes (ECOCs), class weighting, hard/soft decoding, class-to-codeword assignment, and label embedding trees.

Result: Binary encodings reduced computational complexity to logarithmic in class count but achieved significantly lower segmentation performance (DSC 39.3-73.8) compared to one-hot encoding (DSC 82.4) in whole brain parcellation with 108 classes.

Conclusion: While binary encodings offer computational efficiency, they currently underperform state-of-the-art segmentation quality, highlighting the need for future research on compact encoding strategies for large multi-class segmentation tasks.

Abstract: This work presents novel methods to reduce computational and memory
requirements for medical image segmentation with a large number of classes. We
curiously observe challenges in maintaining state-of-the-art segmentation
performance with all of the explored options. Standard learning-based methods
typically employ one-hot encoding of class labels. The computational complexity
and memory requirements thus increase linearly with the number of classes. We
propose a family of binary encoding approaches instead of one-hot encoding to
reduce the computational complexity and memory requirements to logarithmic in
the number of classes. In addition to vanilla binary encoding, we investigate
the effects of error-correcting output codes (ECOCs), class weighting,
hard/soft decoding, class-to-codeword assignment, and label embedding trees. We
apply the methods to the use case of whole brain parcellation with 108 classes
based on 3D MRI images. While binary encodings have proven efficient in
so-called extreme classification problems in computer vision, we faced
challenges in reaching state-of-the-art segmentation quality with binary
encodings. Compared to one-hot encoding (Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) =
82.4 (2.8)), we report reduced segmentation performance with the binary
segmentation approaches, achieving DSCs in the range from 39.3 to 73.8.
Informative negative results all too often go unpublished. We hope that this
work inspires future research of compact encoding strategies for large
multi-class segmentation tasks.

### [56] [Adaptive Event Stream Slicing for Open-Vocabulary Event-Based Object Detection via Vision-Language Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00681)
*Jinchang Zhang,Zijun Li,Jiakai Lin,Guoyu Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an event-image knowledge distillation framework using CLIP to enable open-vocabulary object detection on event data, overcoming modality gaps through spatial attention-based distillation and a hybrid SNN-CNN architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras lack texture/color information, making open-vocabulary detection challenging. Current methods are limited to predefined categories and cannot generalize to novel objects. Direct CLIP transfer fails due to modality gap between images and event streams.

Method: Uses image frames as teacher model inputs to guide event-based student model via spatial attention-based distillation. Implements hybrid SNN-CNN framework where SNN adaptively determines optimal event segmentation moments to preserve temporal information, and CNNs process features for detection.

Result: The framework enables the student network to learn meaningful visual features from raw event inputs while inheriting CLIP's broad visual knowledge for open-vocabulary detection.

Conclusion: The proposed knowledge distillation approach successfully bridges the modality gap between images and event streams, achieving open-vocabulary object detection on event data without requiring direct CLIP training on event streams.

Abstract: Event cameras offer advantages in object detection tasks due to high-speed
response, low latency, and robustness to motion blur. However, event cameras
lack texture and color information, making open-vocabulary detection
particularly challenging. Current event-based detection methods are typically
trained on predefined categories, limiting their ability to generalize to novel
objects, where encountering previously unseen objects is common.
Vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled open-vocabulary object detection in
RGB images. However, the modality gap between images and event streams makes it
ineffective to directly transfer CLIP to event data, as CLIP was not designed
for event streams. To bridge this gap, we propose an event-image knowledge
distillation framework that leverages CLIP's semantic understanding to achieve
open-vocabulary object detection on event data. Instead of training CLIP
directly on event streams, we use image frames as inputs to a teacher model,
guiding the event-based student model to learn CLIP's rich visual
representations. Through spatial attention-based distillation, the student
network learns meaningful visual features directly from raw event inputs while
inheriting CLIP's broad visual knowledge. Furthermore, to prevent information
loss due to event data segmentation, we design a hybrid spiking neural network
(SNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) framework. Unlike fixed-group
event segmentation methods, which often discard crucial temporal information,
our SNN adaptively determines the optimal event segmentation moments, ensuring
that key temporal features are extracted. The extracted event features are then
processed by CNNs for object detection.

TL;DR: ProtoMask improves explainable AI by using image segmentation foundation models to create more truthful saliency maps, restricting computation to predefined semantic patches to reduce uncertainty in visualizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current prototypical case-based XAI methods rely on post-hoc saliency techniques that have reliability and quality issues. The authors aim to improve truthfulness in mapping between embedding and input space.

Method: Uses image segmentation foundation models to generate segmentation masks, crops images using bounding boxes from masks, and processes each mask as individual input in the novel ProtoMask architecture.

Result: Experiments on three fine-grained classification datasets show competitive performance and unique explainability features compared to other popular models.

Conclusion: ProtoMask demonstrates improved explainability through semantic segmentation-based approach, providing more reliable and truthful visualizations while maintaining competitive classification performance.

Abstract: XAI gained considerable importance in recent years. Methods based on
prototypical case-based reasoning have shown a promising improvement in
explainability. However, these methods typically rely on additional post-hoc
saliency techniques to explain the semantics of learned prototypes. Multiple
critiques have been raised about the reliability and quality of such
techniques. For this reason, we study the use of prominent image segmentation
foundation models to improve the truthfulness of the mapping between embedding
and input space. We aim to restrict the computation area of the saliency map to
a predefined semantic image patch to reduce the uncertainty of such
visualizations. To perceive the information of an entire image, we use the
bounding box from each generated segmentation mask to crop the image. Each mask
results in an individual input in our novel model architecture named ProtoMask.
We conduct experiments on three popular fine-grained classification datasets
with a wide set of metrics, providing a detailed overview on explainability
characteristics. The comparison with other popular models demonstrates
competitive performance and unique explainability features of our model.

*Jiakai Lin,Jinchang Zhang,Guoyu Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoE-SGT enhances Concept Bottleneck Models by incorporating structured concept relationships through graph transformers and Mixture of Experts, improving interpretability and performance on complex concept reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of traditional CBMs that are single-modal and ignore structured concept relationships, aiming to improve interpretability in high-stakes domains.

Method: Constructs answer-concept and answer-question graphs for multimodal inputs, integrates Graph Transformer to capture multi-level dependencies, and replaces feed-forward layers with Mixture of Experts module for dynamic expert selection.

Result: Achieves higher accuracy than other concept bottleneck networks on multiple datasets by modeling structured concept relationships and using dynamic expert selection.

Conclusion: MoE-SGT successfully overcomes limitations of traditional CBMs by explicitly modeling structured concept relationships and dynamically allocating reasoning tasks, significantly enhancing model adaptability to complex concept reasoning.

Abstract: With growing demand for interpretability in deep learning, especially in high
stakes domains, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) address this by inserting
human understandable concepts into the prediction pipeline, but they are
generally single modal and ignore structured concept relationships. To overcome
these limitations, we present MoE-SGT, a reasoning driven framework that
augments CBMs with a structure injecting Graph Transformer and a Mixture of
Experts (MoE) module. We construct answer-concept and answer-question graphs
for multimodal inputs to explicitly model the structured relationships among
concepts. Subsequently, we integrate Graph Transformer to capture multi level
dependencies, addressing the limitations of traditional Concept Bottleneck
Models in modeling concept interactions. However, it still encounters
bottlenecks in adapting to complex concept patterns. Therefore, we replace the
feed forward layers with a Mixture of Experts (MoE) module, enabling the model
to have greater capacity in learning diverse concept relationships while
dynamically allocating reasoning tasks to different sub experts, thereby
significantly enhancing the model's adaptability to complex concept reasoning.
MoE-SGT achieves higher accuracy than other concept bottleneck networks on
multiple datasets by modeling structured relationships among concepts and
utilizing a dynamic expert selection mechanism.

### [59] [Training-free Uncertainty Guidance for Complex Visual Tasks with MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00705)
*Sanghwan Kim,Rui Xiao,Stephan Alaniz,Yongqin Xian,Zeynep Akata*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free framework that uses MLLMs' intrinsic uncertainty to guide attention to salient visual information, improving fine-grained perception without task-specific fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle with fine-grained perception tasks like identifying small objects or finding key moments, and existing methods require complex task-specific fine-tuning that limits generalizability.

Method: Proposes using MLLMs' output entropy as a proactive guidance signal - when entropy decreases, relevant visual information is present. A unified mechanism scores candidate visual inputs by response uncertainty to autonomously focus on salient data.

Result: Applied to Visual Search, Long Video Understanding, and Temporal Grounding tasks, achieving performance competitive with specialized fine-tuned methods using off-the-shelf MLLMs.

Conclusion: Harnessing intrinsic uncertainty is a powerful, general strategy for enhancing fine-grained multimodal performance without requiring additional training.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often struggle with fine-grained
perception, such as identifying small objects in high-resolution images or
finding key moments in long videos. Existing works typically rely on
complicated, task-specific fine-tuning, which limits their generalizability and
increases model complexity. In this work, we propose an effective,
training-free framework that uses an MLLM's intrinsic uncertainty as a
proactive guidance signal. Our core insight is that a model's output entropy
decreases when presented with relevant visual information. We introduce a
unified mechanism that scores candidate visual inputs by response uncertainty,
enabling the model to autonomously focus on the most salient data. We apply
this simple principle to three complex visual tasks: Visual Search, Long Video
Understanding, and Temporal Grounding, allowing off-the-shelf MLLMs to achieve
performance competitive with specialized, fine-tuned methods. Our work
validates that harnessing intrinsic uncertainty is a powerful, general strategy
for enhancing fine-grained multimodal performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning-based motion correction for stress perfusion CMR that replaces slow iterative registration with efficient one-shot estimation, improving processing speed 15x while maintaining alignment quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional registration-based motion correction methods for quantitative stress perfusion CMR are slow and sensitive to acquisition variability, limiting robustness and scalability in clinical practice.

Method: Unsupervised deep learning pipeline that corrects motion in three steps using robust principal component analysis to reduce contrast effects. Aligns perfusion series and auxiliary images (arterial input function and proton density-weighted series). Trained on multivendor data from 201 patients.

Result: Significantly improved temporal smoothness (p<0.001), comparable myocardial alignment to baseline (Dice = 0.92 vs 0.91), reduced standard deviation in perfusion maps (0.52 vs 0.55 ml/min/g), and 15x faster processing time.

Conclusion: The deep learning pipeline enables fast, robust motion correction for stress perfusion CMR, improving accuracy across dynamic and auxiliary images, and may facilitate broader clinical adoption of quantitative perfusion imaging.

Abstract: Background: Quantitative stress perfusion cardiovascular magnetic resonance
(CMR) is a powerful tool for assessing myocardial ischemia. Motion correction
is essential for accurate pixel-wise mapping but traditional registration-based
methods are slow and sensitive to acquisition variability, limiting robustness
and scalability.
  Methods: We developed an unsupervised deep learning-based motion correction
pipeline that replaces iterative registration with efficient one-shot
estimation. The method corrects motion in three steps and uses robust principal
component analysis to reduce contrast-related effects. It aligns the perfusion
series and auxiliary images (arterial input function and proton
density-weighted series). Models were trained and validated on multivendor data
from 201 patients, with 38 held out for testing. Performance was assessed via
temporal alignment and quantitative perfusion values, compared to a previously
published registration-based method.
  Results: The deep learning approach significantly improved temporal
smoothness of time-intensity curves (p<0.001). Myocardial alignment (Dice =
0.92 (0.04) and 0.91 (0.05)) was comparable to the baseline and superior to
before registration (Dice = 0.80 (0.09), p<0.001). Perfusion maps showed
reduced motion, with lower standard deviation in the myocardium (0.52 (0.39)
ml/min/g) compared to baseline (0.55 (0.44) ml/min/g). Processing time was
reduced 15-fold.
  Conclusion: This deep learning pipeline enables fast, robust motion
correction for stress perfusion CMR, improving accuracy across dynamic and
auxiliary images. Trained on multivendor data, it generalizes across sequences
and may facilitate broader clinical adoption of quantitative perfusion imaging.

### [61] [DEAP DIVE: Dataset Investigation with Vision transformers for EEG evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00725)
*Annemarie Hoffsommer,Helen Schneider,Svetlana Pavlitska,J. Marius Zöllner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that emotion prediction from EEG signals can be achieved with high accuracy using only 12 channels instead of the standard 32, making it suitable for low-cost EEG devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional emotion assessment methods like self-reporting and facial analysis are subjective. EEG provides direct brain activity data, but full EEG setups are complex and expensive. Low-cost EEG devices with fewer channels offer a practical alternative.

Method: Used Continuous Wavelet Transformation to convert EEG data from the DEAP dataset into scaleograms, then trained a vision transformer (ViT) model for emotion classification using only 12 EEG channels.

Result: Achieved 91.57% accuracy in predicting 4 emotion quadrants (high/low arousal and valence) with only 12 channels, compared to state-of-the-art 96.9% accuracy with 32 channels.

Conclusion: Significant reduction in EEG input channels (from 32 to 12) still yields high emotion prediction accuracy, making this approach viable for low-cost EEG devices while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: Accurately predicting emotions from brain signals has the potential to
achieve goals such as improving mental health, human-computer interaction, and
affective computing. Emotion prediction through neural signals offers a
promising alternative to traditional methods, such as self-assessment and
facial expression analysis, which can be subjective or ambiguous. Measurements
of the brain activity via electroencephalogram (EEG) provides a more direct and
unbiased data source. However, conducting a full EEG is a complex,
resource-intensive process, leading to the rise of low-cost EEG devices with
simplified measurement capabilities. This work examines how subsets of EEG
channels from the DEAP dataset can be used for sufficiently accurate emotion
prediction with low-cost EEG devices, rather than fully equipped
EEG-measurements. Using Continuous Wavelet Transformation to convert EEG data
into scaleograms, we trained a vision transformer (ViT) model for emotion
classification. The model achieved over 91,57% accuracy in predicting 4
quadrants (high/low per arousal and valence) with only 12 measuring points
(also referred to as channels). Our work shows clearly, that a significant
reduction of input channels yields high results compared to state-of-the-art
results of 96,9% with 32 channels. Training scripts to reproduce our code can

*Hongeun Kim,Bryan Sangwoo Kim,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a novel framework for Extreme Blind Image Restoration (EBIR) that decomposes the challenging ELQ-to-HQ restoration into two stages: first projecting ELQ images to an intermediate LQ manifold, then using frozen off-the-shelf BIR models for final restoration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing BIR methods fail on EBIR tasks with severe compounded degradations beyond training scope, causing unnatural artifacts and detail loss due to massive domain gap between ELQ and HQ images.

Method: Two-stage approach: learn a projector to map ELQ images to intermediate LQ manifold, then use frozen BIR models for final restoration. Grounded in information theory as Information Bottleneck problem with novel loss function balancing reconstruction and prior-matching terms.

Result: Framework enables Look Forward Once for inference-time prompt refinement and plug-and-play strengthening of existing models without finetuning. Extensive experiments show effectiveness under severe degradation regimes.

Conclusion: The proposed decomposition approach effectively addresses EBIR challenges by bridging the massive domain gap through intermediate projection, providing stable training and flexible inference capabilities.

Abstract: Blind Image Restoration (BIR) methods have achieved remarkable success but
falter when faced with Extreme Blind Image Restoration (EBIR), where inputs
suffer from severe, compounded degradations beyond their training scope.
Directly learning a mapping from extremely low-quality (ELQ) to high-quality
(HQ) images is challenging due to the massive domain gap, often leading to
unnatural artifacts and loss of detail. To address this, we propose a novel
framework that decomposes the intractable ELQ-to-HQ restoration process. We
first learn a projector that maps an ELQ image onto an intermediate,
less-degraded LQ manifold. This intermediate image is then restored to HQ using
a frozen, off-the-shelf BIR model. Our approach is grounded in information
theory; we provide a novel perspective of image restoration as an Information
Bottleneck problem and derive a theoretically-driven objective to train our
projector. This loss function effectively stabilizes training by balancing a
low-quality reconstruction term with a high-quality prior-matching term. Our
framework enables Look Forward Once (LFO) for inference-time prompt refinement,
and supports plug-and-play strengthening of existing image restoration models
without need for finetuning. Extensive experiments under severe degradation
regimes provide a thorough analysis of the effectiveness of our work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-destructive testing is essential in ceramic manufacturing to ensure component quality without compromising integrity. Optical Coherence Tomography enables high-resolution internal imaging to detect defects like pores, delaminations, or inclusions.

Method: Developed a neural network based on U-Net architecture trained on OCT images with manually segmented annotations. Evaluated multiple experimental configurations and used post-processing techniques for quantitative and qualitative evaluation of predictions.

Conclusion: The system enables more efficient, reliable, and automated quality control in ceramic manufacturing through automated defect detection using Deep Learning and OCT imaging.

Abstract: Non-destructive testing (NDT) is essential in ceramic manufacturing to ensure

*Eunki Kim,Na Min An,James Thorne,Hyunjung Shim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MULTI-TAP is a plug-and-play architecture for evaluating image-text alignment that addresses limitations in existing methods by providing multi-objective scoring, long-sequence processing, inference efficiency, and alignment with human judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image-text alignment evaluation methods lack comprehensive benchmarks and key properties like human judgment alignment, long-sequence processing, efficiency, and multi-objective scoring capability, especially in real-world scenarios with multiple valid descriptions.

Method: Proposed MULTI-TAP architecture uses a reward head on top of large vision-language models (LVLMs) with a lightweight ridge regression layer on frozen hidden states to produce both overall and fine-grained multi-objective scores.

Result: MULTI-TAP achieves significantly higher performance than existing metrics, performs on par with GPT-4o-based G-VEval with smaller model size (7-8B), and outperforms VisionREWARD in both performance and efficiency on multi-objective benchmarks.

Conclusion: MULTI-TAP provides a robust solution for image-text alignment evaluation with human-interpretable multi-objective scoring, supported by the new EYE4ALL dataset capturing human preferences including those of blind and low-vision individuals.

Abstract: Evaluating image-text alignment while reflecting human preferences across
multiple aspects is a significant issue for the development of reliable
vision-language applications. It becomes especially crucial in real-world
scenarios where multiple valid descriptions exist depending on contexts or user
needs. However, research progress is hindered by the lack of comprehensive
benchmarks and existing evaluation predictors lacking at least one of these key
properties: (1) Alignment with human judgments, (2) Long-sequence processing,
(3) Inference efficiency, and (4) Applicability to multi-objective scoring. To
address these challenges, we propose a plug-and-play architecture to build a
robust predictor, MULTI-TAP (Multi-Objective Task-Aware Predictor), capable of
both multi and single-objective scoring. MULTI-TAP can produce a single overall
score, utilizing a reward head built on top of a large vision-language model
(LVLMs). We show that MULTI-TAP is robust in terms of application to different
LVLM architectures, achieving significantly higher performance than existing
metrics and even on par with the GPT-4o-based predictor, G-VEval, with a
smaller size (7-8B). By training a lightweight ridge regression layer on the
frozen hidden states of a pre-trained LVLM, MULTI-TAP can produce fine-grained
scores for multiple human-interpretable objectives. MULTI-TAP performs better
than VisionREWARD, a high-performing multi-objective reward model, in both
performance and efficiency on multi-objective benchmarks and our newly released
text-image-to-text dataset, EYE4ALL. Our new dataset, consisting of
chosen/rejected human preferences (EYE4ALLPref) and human-annotated
fine-grained scores across seven dimensions (EYE4ALLMulti), can serve as a
foundation for developing more accessible AI systems by capturing the
underlying preferences of users, including blind and low-vision (BLV)
individuals.

*Joana C. Costa,Tiago Roxo,Hugo Proença,Pedro R. M. Inácio*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ZQBA is a zero-query black-box adversarial attack that uses feature maps from one DNN to fool other models, achieving effective transfer attacks without multiple queries or training surrogate models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current black-box attacks require multiple queries or diffusion models with surrogate training, limiting real-world applicability. ZQBA aims to overcome these limitations by exploiting DNN representations.

Method: Extracts feature maps from a DNN and adds them to clean images to create adversarial samples that impair target model classification, enabling transfer attacks across models and datasets.

Result: ZQBA successfully transfers adversarial samples across different models and datasets (CIFAR, Tiny ImageNet), outperforms state-of-the-art single-query attacks, and maintains imperceptible perturbations (verified by SSIM and qualitative evaluation).

Conclusion: ZQBA demonstrates effective black-box adversarial attacks without queries, highlighting vulnerabilities in DNN deployments and providing a practical attack method for real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Current black-box adversarial attacks either require multiple queries or
diffusion models to produce adversarial samples that can impair the target
model performance. However, these methods require training a surrogate loss or
diffusion models to produce adversarial samples, which limits their
applicability in real-world settings. Thus, we propose a Zero Query Black-box
Adversarial (ZQBA) attack that exploits the representations of Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs) to fool other networks. Instead of requiring thousands of
queries to produce deceiving adversarial samples, we use the feature maps
obtained from a DNN and add them to clean images to impair the classification
of a target model. The results suggest that ZQBA can transfer the adversarial
samples to different models and across various datasets, namely CIFAR and Tiny
ImageNet. The experiments also show that ZQBA is more effective than
state-of-the-art black-box attacks with a single query, while maintaining the
imperceptibility of perturbations, evaluated both quantitatively (SSIM) and
qualitatively, emphasizing the vulnerabilities of employing DNNs in real-world
contexts. All the source code is available at

### [66] [Uncertainty-Aware Concept Bottleneck Models with Enhanced Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00773)
*Haifei Zhang,Patrick Barry,Eduardo Brandao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an uncertainty-aware interpretable classifier for Concept Bottleneck Models that uses binary class-level concept prototypes to improve both interpretability and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CBMs sacrifice predictive performance compared to end-to-end CNNs, and uncertainty propagation from concept predictions to final labels remains underexplored.

Method: Learns binary class-level concept prototypes and uses distances between predicted concept vectors and prototypes as classification scores and uncertainty measures.

Result: The framework enhances interpretability and robustness by enabling conformal prediction for uncertain/outlier inputs based on deviation from learned prototypes.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides both interpretable classification rules and uncertainty quantification for Concept Bottleneck Models.

Abstract: In the context of image classification, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs)
first embed images into a set of human-understandable concepts, followed by an
intrinsically interpretable classifier that predicts labels based on these
intermediate representations. While CBMs offer a semantically meaningful and
interpretable classification pipeline, they often sacrifice predictive
performance compared to end-to-end convolutional neural networks. Moreover, the
propagation of uncertainty from concept predictions to final label decisions
remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel uncertainty-aware and
interpretable classifier for the second stage of CBMs. Our method learns a set
of binary class-level concept prototypes and uses the distances between
predicted concept vectors and each class prototype as both a classification
score and a measure of uncertainty. These prototypes also serve as
interpretable classification rules, indicating which concepts should be present
in an image to justify a specific class prediction. The proposed framework
enhances both interpretability and robustness by enabling conformal prediction
for uncertain or outlier inputs based on their deviation from the learned
binary class-level concept prototypes.

*Yifan Shen,Yangyang Shu,Hye-young Paik,Yulei Sui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MetaLogic is a novel evaluation framework that detects semantic inconsistencies in text-to-image models by comparing image pairs generated from logically equivalent prompts, revealing significant robustness failures in state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models struggle with maintaining semantic consistency when prompts undergo minor linguistic variations, exposing limitations in reasoning and generalization despite improved visual quality.

Method: Leverages metamorphic testing by generating image pairs from prompts that differ grammatically but are semantically identical, then directly compares these pairs to identify inconsistencies without requiring ground truth images.

Result: Evaluation across multiple SOTA T2I models revealed consistent robustness failures, with Flux.dev and DALLE-3 showing 59% and 71% misalignment rates respectively. The framework effectively uncovers fine-grained logical inconsistencies overlooked by existing metrics.

Conclusion: MetaLogic provides a scalable, ground-truth-free approach for identifying alignment failures in text-to-image models, categorizing errors and providing counterexamples for model debugging and refinement.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models, especially diffusion-based
architectures, have significantly improved the visual quality of generated
images. However, these models continue to struggle with a critical limitation:
maintaining semantic consistency when input prompts undergo minor linguistic
variations. Despite being logically equivalent, such prompt pairs often yield
misaligned or semantically inconsistent images, exposing a lack of robustness
in reasoning and generalisation. To address this, we propose MetaLogic, a novel
evaluation framework that detects T2I misalignment without relying on ground
truth images. MetaLogic leverages metamorphic testing, generating image pairs
from prompts that differ grammatically but are semantically identical. By
directly comparing these image pairs, the framework identifies inconsistencies
that signal failures in preserving the intended meaning, effectively diagnosing
robustness issues in the model's logic understanding. Unlike existing
evaluation methods that compare a generated image to a single prompt, MetaLogic
evaluates semantic equivalence between paired images, offering a scalable,
ground-truth-free approach to identifying alignment failures. It categorises
these alignment errors (e.g., entity omission, duplication, positional
misalignment) and surfaces counterexamples that can be used for model debugging
and refinement. We evaluate MetaLogic across multiple state-of-the-art T2I
models and reveal consistent robustness failures across a range of logical
constructs. We find that even the SOTA text-to-image models like Flux.dev and
DALLE-3 demonstrate a 59 percent and 71 percent misalignment rate,
respectively. Our results show that MetaLogic is not only efficient and
scalable, but also effective in uncovering fine-grained logical inconsistencies
that are overlooked by existing evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: The framework enables efficient regional potential studies, urban energy planning, and BIPV deployment with substantial efficiency gains over manual methods.

Abstract: Building facades represent a significant untapped resource for solar energy
generation in dense urban environments, yet assessing their photovoltaic (PV)
potential remains challenging due to complex geometries and semantic com
ponents. This study introduces SF-SPA (Semantic Facade Solar-PV Assessment), an
automated framework that transforms street-view photographs into quantitative
PV deployment assessments. The approach combines com puter vision and
artificial intelligence techniques to address three key challenges: perspective
distortion correction, semantic understanding of facade elements, and spatial
reasoning for PV layout optimization. Our four-stage pipeline processes images
through geometric rectification, zero-shot semantic segmentation, Large
Language Model (LLM) guided spatial reasoning, and energy simulation.
Validation across 80 buildings in four countries demonstrates ro bust
performance with mean area estimation errors of 6.2% &#177; 2.8% compared to
expert annotations. The auto mated assessment requires approximately 100
seconds per building, a substantial gain in efficiency over manual methods.

### [70] [What You See is What You Ask: Evaluating Audio Descriptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00808)
*Divy Kala,Eshika Khandelwal,Makarand Tapaswi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ADQA is a new benchmark for evaluating audio descriptions (ADs) that addresses subjectivity in AD generation by testing on longer video segments rather than trimmed clips, focusing on visual appreciation and narrative understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AD evaluation methods use single ground-truth references and focus on short clips, ignoring the inherent subjectivity in AD writing and failing to assess whether ADs actually help BLV users understand stories and appreciate visual details.

Method: Proposed ADQA benchmark evaluates ADs on few-minute long coherent video segments using two types of questions: visual appreciation (VA) about visual facts and narrative understanding (NU) based on plot comprehension.

Result: Current AD generation methods significantly underperform human-authored ADs on the ADQA benchmark, showing the limitations of existing approaches.

Conclusion: The paper recommends moving beyond trimmed clip evaluation and introduces a public leaderboard for benchmarking future AD generation methods using the ADQA framework.

Abstract: Audio descriptions (ADs) narrate important visual details in movies, enabling
Blind and Low Vision (BLV) users to understand narratives and appreciate visual
details. Existing works in automatic AD generation mostly focus on few-second
trimmed clips, and evaluate them by comparing against a single ground-truth
reference AD. However, writing ADs is inherently subjective. Through alignment
and analysis of two independent AD tracks for the same movies, we quantify the
subjectivity in when and whether to describe, and what and how to highlight.
Thus, we show that working with trimmed clips is inadequate. We propose ADQA, a
QA benchmark that evaluates ADs at the level of few-minute long, coherent video
segments, testing whether they would help BLV users understand the story and
appreciate visual details. ADQA features visual appreciation (VA) questions
about visual facts and narrative understanding (NU) questions based on the
plot. Through ADQA, we show that current AD generation methods lag far behind

*Thomas Campagnolo,Ezio Malis,Philippe Martinet,Gaetan Bahl*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhraseStereo is the first dataset for phrase-region segmentation in stereo images, created by generating right-view images from single-view data to enable multimodal learning with depth cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current phrase grounding methods are limited to single-view images and miss the geometric information available in stereo vision, which could improve segmentation accuracy.

Method: Extends the PhraseCut dataset using GenStereo to generate accurate right-view images, creating stereo image pairs with aligned segmentation masks and phrase annotations.

Result: Created PhraseStereo dataset that enables phrase grounding in stereo domain, introducing new challenges and opportunities for leveraging depth cues in multimodal learning.

Conclusion: PhraseStereo provides foundation for research combining language, vision and 3D perception, encouraging models that jointly reason about semantics and geometry.

Abstract: Understanding how natural language phrases correspond to specific regions in
images is a key challenge in multimodal semantic segmentation. Recent advances
in phrase grounding are largely limited to single-view images, neglecting the
rich geometric cues available in stereo vision. For this, we introduce
PhraseStereo, the first novel dataset that brings phrase-region segmentation to
stereo image pairs. PhraseStereo builds upon the PhraseCut dataset by
leveraging GenStereo to generate accurate right-view images from existing
single-view data, enabling the extension of phrase grounding into the stereo
domain. This new setting introduces unique challenges and opportunities for
multimodal learning, particularly in leveraging depth cues for more precise and
context-aware grounding. By providing stereo image pairs with aligned
segmentation masks and phrase annotations, PhraseStereo lays the foundation for
future research at the intersection of language, vision, and 3D perception,
encouraging the development of models that can reason jointly over semantics
and geometry. The PhraseStereo dataset will be released online upon acceptance
of this work.

### [72] [NSARM: Next-Scale Autoregressive Modeling for Robust Real-World Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00820)
*Xiangtao Kong,Rongyuan Wu,Shuaizheng Liu,Lingchen Sun,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NSARM introduces a robust Real-ISR framework using next-scale autoregressive modeling that achieves superior visual quality and faster inference while being more robust to input image quality variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Real-ISR methods using T2I diffusion models face trade-offs: slow inference with random noise inputs or lower quality with direct input processing. Current approaches using fixed pre-trained models often cause over-enhanced artifacts and lack robustness to varying degradations.

Method: Two-stage training: first train a transformation network to map low-quality images to preliminary scales, then perform end-to-end full-model fine-tuning. Builds upon visual autoregressive models using next-scale prediction strategy.

Result: Achieves superior visual results over existing Real-ISR methods while maintaining fast inference speed. Shows much higher robustness to input image quality and stronger generalization performance.

Conclusion: NSARM demonstrates that comprehensive fine-tuning of autoregressive models enables robust Real-ISR without compromising generative capability, offering an effective solution to the speed-quality trade-off in current methods.

Abstract: Most recent real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) methods employ
pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models to synthesize the high-quality
image either from random Gaussian noise, which yields realistic results but is
slow due to iterative denoising, or directly from the input low-quality image,
which is efficient but at the price of lower output quality. These approaches
train ControlNet or LoRA modules while keeping the pre-trained model fixed,
which often introduces over-enhanced artifacts and hallucinations, suffering
from the robustness to inputs of varying degradations. Recent visual
autoregressive (AR) models, such as pre-trained Infinity, can provide strong
T2I generation capabilities while offering superior efficiency by using the
bitwise next-scale prediction strategy. Building upon next-scale prediction, we
introduce a robust Real-ISR framework, namely Next-Scale Autoregressive
Modeling (NSARM). Specifically, we train NSARM in two stages: a transformation
network is first trained to map the input low-quality image to preliminary
scales, followed by an end-to-end full-model fine-tuning. Such a comprehensive
fine-tuning enhances the robustness of NSARM in Real-ISR tasks without
compromising its generative capability. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
evaluations demonstrate that as a pure AR model, NSARM achieves superior visual
results over existing Real-ISR methods while maintaining a fast inference
speed. Most importantly, it demonstrates much higher robustness to the quality
of input images, showing stronger generalization performance. Project page:

*Julius Ott,Nastassia Vysotskaya,Huawei Sun,Lorenzo Servadei,Robert Wille*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed two hierarchical contrastive learning methods (G-HMLC and A-HMLC) that model inter-class relationships and imbalanced distributions across hierarchy levels, achieving state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR100 and ModelNet40.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional classification approaches neglect inherent inter-class relationships at different hierarchy levels, missing important supervisory signals for hierarchical classification tasks.

Method: Two hierarchical contrastive learning methods: G-HMLC using Gaussian Mixture Model and A-HMLC using attention mechanism to capture hierarchy-specific features and model inter-class relationships across hierarchy levels.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR100 and ModelNet40 datasets, outperforming existing hierarchical contrastive learning methods by 2 percentage points in accuracy.

Conclusion: The approach effectively models hierarchical relationships and imbalanced distributions, showing strong potential for computer vision applications and beyond.

Abstract: Hierarchical classification is a crucial task in many applications, where
objects are organized into multiple levels of categories. However, conventional
classification approaches often neglect inherent inter-class relationships at
different hierarchy levels, thus missing important supervisory signals. Thus,
we propose two novel hierarchical contrastive learning (HMLC) methods. The
first, leverages a Gaussian Mixture Model (G-HMLC) and the second uses an
attention mechanism to capture hierarchy-specific features (A-HMLC), imitating
human processing. Our approach explicitly models inter-class relationships and
imbalanced class distribution at higher hierarchy levels, enabling fine-grained
clustering across all hierarchy levels. On the competitive CIFAR100 and
ModelNet40 datasets, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in linear
evaluation, outperforming existing hierarchical contrastive learning methods by
2 percentage points in terms of accuracy. The effectiveness of our approach is
backed by both quantitative and qualitative results, highlighting its potential
for applications in computer vision and beyond.

*Kevin Zhang,Kuangzhi Ge,Xiaowei Chi,Renrui Zhang,Shaojun Shi,Zhen Dong,Sirui Han,Shanghang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: World-Language Models (WorldLMs) use video diffusion models as generative encoders to enhance vision-language understanding, achieving state-of-the-art performance on visual reasoning tasks by leveraging motion-consistency priors from video pre-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether generative world models can replace conventional vision encoders for multimodal understanding, leveraging their ability to generate consistent dynamics over structure, motion, and physics.

Method: Repurpose a video diffusion model as a generative encoder by performing a single denoising step and using the resulting latents as visual embeddings, creating World-Language Models (WorldLMs) with a best variant called Dynamic Vision Aligner (DyVA).

Result: WorldLMs capture latents useful for downstream understanding that differ from conventional encoders, significantly enhance spatial reasoning, enable single-image models to perform multi-frame reasoning, and achieve state-of-the-art or comparable performance on visual reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: WorldLMs represent a promising new family of vision-language models that leverage world model priors, showing enhanced reasoning capabilities and paving the way for generalist vision learners.

Abstract: Trained on internet-scale video data, generative world models are
increasingly recognized as powerful world simulators that can generate
consistent and plausible dynamics over structure, motion, and physics. This
raises a natural question: with the advent of strong video foundational models,
might they supplant conventional vision encoder paradigms for general-purpose
multimodal understanding? While recent studies have begun to explore the
potential of world models on common vision tasks, these explorations typically
lack a systematic investigation of generic, multimodal tasks. In this work, we
strive to investigate the capabilities when world model priors are transferred
into Vision-Language Models: we re-purpose a video diffusion model as a
generative encoder to perform a single denoising step and treat the resulting
latents as a set of visual embedding. We empirically investigate this class of
models, which we refer to as World-Language Models (WorldLMs), and we find that
generative encoders can capture latents useful for downstream understanding
that show distinctions from conventional encoders. Naming our best-performing
variant Dynamic Vision Aligner (DyVA), we further discover that this method
significantly enhances spatial reasoning abilities and enables single-image
models to perform multi-frame reasoning. Through the curation of a suite of
visual reasoning tasks, we find DyVA to surpass both open-source and
proprietary baselines, achieving state-of-the-art or comparable performance. We
attribute these gains to WorldLM's inherited motion-consistency internalization
from video pre-training. Finally, we systematically explore extensive model
designs to highlight promising directions for future work. We hope our study
can pave the way for a new family of VLMs that leverage priors from world
models and are on a promising path towards generalist vision learners.

*Hyun-kyu Ko,Youbin Kim,Jihyeon Park,Dongheok Park,Gyeongjin Kang,Wonjun Cho,Hyung Yi,Eunbyung Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid architecture combining Mamba-based selective scanning for efficient temporal propagation with shifted window self-attention for spatial context aggregation, plus GSM mechanism for feature alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of traditional RNNs in VSR (vanishing gradients, lack of parallelism) and Transformers (quadratic complexity), while overcoming Mamba's inability to capture fine-grained spatial dependencies.

Method: Hybrid approach: shifted window self-attention for spatial context + Mamba-based selective scanning for temporal propagation + Gather-Scatter Mamba (GSM) for feature alignment and occlusion reduction.

Result: Proposed method effectively handles long sequences with linear complexity while maintaining strong spatial-temporal modeling capabilities.

Conclusion: The hybrid GSMamba architecture successfully combines the strengths of attention mechanisms and selective SSMs for efficient and effective video super-resolution.

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs)-most notably RNNs-have historically played a
central role in sequential modeling. Although attention mechanisms such as
Transformers have since dominated due to their ability to model global context,
their quadratic complexity and limited scalability make them less suited for
long sequences. Video super-resolution (VSR) methods have traditionally relied
on recurrent architectures to propagate features across frames. However, such
approaches suffer from well-known issues including vanishing gradients, lack of
parallelism, and slow inference speed. Recent advances in selective SSMs like
Mamba offer a compelling alternative: by enabling input-dependent state
transitions with linear-time complexity, Mamba mitigates these issues while
maintaining strong long-range modeling capabilities. Despite this potential,
Mamba alone struggles to capture fine-grained spatial dependencies due to its
causal nature and lack of explicit context aggregation. To address this, we
propose a hybrid architecture that combines shifted window self-attention for
spatial context aggregation with Mamba-based selective scanning for efficient
temporal propagation. Furthermore, we introduce Gather-Scatter Mamba (GSM), an
alignment-aware mechanism that warps features toward a center anchor frame
within the temporal window before Mamba propagation and scatters them back
afterward, effectively reducing occlusion artifacts and ensuring effective
redistribution of aggregated information across all frames. The official
implementation is provided at: https://github.com/Ko-Lani/GSMamba.

### [76] [AI-CNet3D: An Anatomically-Informed Cross-Attention Network with Multi-Task Consistency Fine-tuning for 3D Glaucoma Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00882)
*Roshan Kenia,Anfei Li,Rishabh Srivastava,Kaveri A. Thakoor*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel hybrid deep learning model called AI-CNet3D integrates cross-attention mechanisms into 3D CNNs to improve glaucoma diagnosis from OCT volumes by capturing hemiretinal asymmetries and integrating optic nerve head/macula information, achieving superior performance with significantly reduced parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional practice of condensing 3D OCT volumes into 2D reports loses key structural details needed for accurate glaucoma diagnosis, which requires analyzing asymmetries between hemiretinal regions and integrating information from optic nerve head and macula.

Method: Hybrid deep learning model combining cross-attention mechanisms with 3D CNN, using Channel Attention REpresentations (CAREs) for visualization and consistency-based multi-task fine-tuning aligned with Grad-CAMs. Divides volume along two axes to capture hemiretinal asymmetries.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art attention and convolutional models across all key metrics on two large datasets, while being computationally efficient with 100x parameter reduction compared to other attention mechanisms while maintaining high diagnostic performance.

Conclusion: AI-CNet3D provides an anatomically-informed approach that enhances glaucoma classification performance, interpretability, and anatomical coherence while being computationally efficient, making it suitable for clinical deployment.

Abstract: Glaucoma is a progressive eye disease that leads to optic nerve damage,
causing irreversible vision loss if left untreated. Optical coherence
tomography (OCT) has become a crucial tool for glaucoma diagnosis, offering
high-resolution 3D scans of the retina and optic nerve. However, the
conventional practice of condensing information from 3D OCT volumes into 2D
reports often results in the loss of key structural details. To address this,
we propose a novel hybrid deep learning model that integrates cross-attention
mechanisms into a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN), enabling the
extraction of critical features from the superior and inferior hemiretinas, as
well as from the optic nerve head (ONH) and macula, within OCT volumes. We
introduce Channel Attention REpresentations (CAREs) to visualize
cross-attention outputs and leverage them for consistency-based multi-task
fine-tuning, aligning them with Gradient-Weighted Class Activation Maps
(Grad-CAMs) from the CNN's final convolutional layer to enhance performance,
interpretability, and anatomical coherence. We have named this model AI-CNet3D
(AI-`See'-Net3D) to reflect its design as an Anatomically-Informed
Cross-attention Network operating on 3D data. By dividing the volume along two
axes and applying cross-attention, our model enhances glaucoma classification
by capturing asymmetries between the hemiretinal regions while integrating
information from the optic nerve head and macula. We validate our approach on
two large datasets, showing that it outperforms state-of-the-art attention and
convolutional models across all key metrics. Finally, our model is
computationally efficient, reducing the parameter count by one-hundred--fold
compared to other attention mechanisms while maintaining high diagnostic
performance and comparable GFLOPS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study examines how machine learning practitioners select source datasets for medical imaging transfer learning, finding choices are task-dependent and influenced by community practices, dataset properties, and various similarity metrics, challenging the traditional "more similar is better" assumption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current source dataset selection in medical imaging transfer learning relies on researcher intuition rather than systematic principles, which can impact algorithm generalizability and patient outcomes.

Method: Conducted a task-based survey with machine learning practitioners to understand source dataset selection decisions from a human-centered HCI perspective.

Result: Practitioners' choices are task-dependent and influenced by community practices, dataset properties, computational embeddings, and perceived visual/semantic similarity. However, similarity ratings don't always align with expected performance, challenging traditional assumptions.

Conclusion: The study reveals ambiguous terminology in dataset selection and suggests a need for clearer definitions and HCI tools to make selection heuristics explicit and usable for more systematic source selection in transfer learning.

Abstract: Transfer learning is crucial for medical imaging, yet the selection of source
datasets - which can impact the generalizability of algorithms, and thus
patient outcomes - often relies on researchers' intuition rather than
systematic principles. This study investigates these decisions through a
task-based survey with machine learning practitioners. Unlike prior work that
benchmarks models and experimental setups, we take a human-centered HCI
perspective on how practitioners select source datasets. Our findings indicate
that choices are task-dependent and influenced by community practices, dataset
properties, and computational (data embedding), or perceived visual or semantic
similarity. However, similarity ratings and expected performance are not always
aligned, challenging a traditional "more similar is better" view. Participants
often used ambiguous terminology, which suggests a need for clearer definitions
and HCI tools to make them explicit and usable. By clarifying these heuristics,
this work provides practical insights for more systematic source selection in
transfer learning.

*Ali Shadman Yazdi,Annalisa Cappella,Benedetta Baldini,Riccardo Solazzo,Gianluca Tartaglia,Chiarella Sforza,Giuseppe Baselli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PAL-Net is an automated deep learning pipeline for localizing 50 anatomical landmarks on 3D facial scans, combining coarse alignment, ROI filtering, and a patch-based pointwise CNN with attention mechanisms, achieving accuracy comparable to intra-observer variability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual annotation of anatomical landmarks on 3D facial scans is time-consuming and expertise-dependent, limiting clinical applications. Existing deep learning methods often focus on pseudo-landmarks or require complex inputs, reducing clinical applicability.

Method: Combines coarse alignment, region-of-interest filtering, initial landmark approximation, and a patch-based pointwise CNN enhanced by attention mechanisms for 3D facial landmark localization.

Result: Achieved mean localization error of 3.686 mm on 214 annotated scans, with 2.822 mm average anatomical distance error. On FaceScape dataset (700 subjects), achieved 0.41 mm point-wise error and 0.38 mm distance-wise error, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: PAL-Net provides a lightweight, scalable solution for high-throughput 3D anthropometric analysis, generalizing effectively across datasets and facial regions, with potential to support clinical workflows and reduce manual annotation reliance.

Abstract: Manual annotation of anatomical landmarks on 3D facial scans is a
time-consuming and expertise-dependent task, yet it remains critical for
clinical assessments, morphometric analysis, and craniofacial research. While
several deep learning methods have been proposed for facial landmark
localization, most focus on pseudo-landmarks or require complex input
representations, limiting their clinical applicability. This study presents a
fully automated deep learning pipeline (PAL-Net) for localizing 50 anatomical
landmarks on stereo-photogrammetry facial models. The method combines coarse
alignment, region-of-interest filtering, and an initial approximation of
landmarks with a patch-based pointwise CNN enhanced by attention mechanisms.
Trained and evaluated on 214 annotated scans from healthy adults, PAL-Net
achieved a mean localization error of 3.686 mm and preserves relevant
anatomical distances with a 2.822 mm average error, comparable to
intra-observer variability. To assess generalization, the model was further
evaluated on 700 subjects from the FaceScape dataset, achieving a point-wise
error of 0.41\,mm and a distance-wise error of 0.38\,mm. Compared to existing
methods, PAL-Net offers a favorable trade-off between accuracy and
computational cost. While performance degrades in regions with poor mesh
quality (e.g., ears, hairline), the method demonstrates consistent accuracy
across most anatomical regions. PAL-Net generalizes effectively across datasets
and facial regions, outperforming existing methods in both point-wise and
structural evaluations. It provides a lightweight, scalable solution for
high-throughput 3D anthropometric analysis, with potential to support clinical
workflows and reduce reliance on manual annotation. Source code can be found at

TL;DR: Proposes a new self-supervised learning strategy for inverse problems using equivariant reconstruction networks and splitting losses, achieving state-of-the-art performance with incomplete measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable learning-based solutions when ground-truth training data is expensive or impossible to obtain, particularly in settings with single incomplete observation models.

Method: Introduces equivariant reconstruction networks combined with self-supervised splitting losses to create unbiased estimates of supervised loss.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in highly rank-deficient forward models across image inpainting, accelerated MRI, and compressive sensing tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed self-supervised learning strategy effectively handles challenging inverse problems with incomplete measurements without requiring ground-truth data.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning for inverse problems allows to train a
reconstruction network from noise and/or incomplete data alone. These methods
have the potential of enabling learning-based solutions when obtaining
ground-truth references for training is expensive or even impossible. In this
paper, we propose a new self-supervised learning strategy devised for the
challenging setting where measurements are observed via a single incomplete
observation model. We introduce a new definition of equivariance in the context
of reconstruction networks, and show that the combination of self-supervised
splitting losses and equivariant reconstruction networks results in unbiased
estimates of the supervised loss. Through a series of experiments on image
inpainting, accelerated magnetic resonance imaging, and compressive sensing, we
demonstrate that the proposed loss achieves state-of-the-art performance in
settings with highly rank-deficient forward models.

*Zanwu Liu,Chao Yuan,Bo Li,Xiaowei Zhang,Guanglin Niu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a lightweight Vector Panning Feature Alignment (VPFA) framework for Cross-Resolution ReID that models resolution-specific feature discrepancies instead of using super-resolution methods, achieving superior performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Cross-Resolution ReID methods rely on complex super-resolution or joint learning approaches that increase training complexity and have reached performance bottlenecks. The authors discovered semantic directions indicating resolution differences in ReID feature space.

Method: Proposed VPFA framework that conducts CR-ReID by modeling resolution-specific feature discrepancy, inspired by semantic directions in word embedding space. Validated the resolution semantic direction discovery using Canonical Correlation Analysis and Pearson Correlation Analysis.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple CR-ReID benchmarks show the method significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art models while achieving higher efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed VPFA framework based on modeling resolution-specific feature discrepancies is an effective and superior approach for Cross-Resolution ReID, demonstrating the value of the new finding about semantic directions in feature space.

Abstract: In surveillance scenarios, varying camera distances cause significant
differences among pedestrian image resolutions, making it hard to match
low-resolution (LR) images with high-resolution (HR) counterparts, limiting the
performance of Re-Identification (ReID) tasks. Most existing Cross-Resolution
ReID (CR-ReID) methods rely on super-resolution (SR) or joint learning for
feature compensation, which increases training and inference complexity and has
reached a performance bottleneck in recent studies. Inspired by semantic
directions in the word embedding space, we empirically discover that semantic
directions implying resolution differences also emerge in the feature space of
ReID, and we substantiate this finding from a statistical perspective using
Canonical Correlation Analysis and Pearson Correlation Analysis. Based on this
interesting finding, we propose a lightweight and effective Vector Panning
Feature Alignment (VPFA) framework, which conducts CR-ReID from a novel
perspective of modeling the resolution-specific feature discrepancy. Extensive
experimental results on multiple CR-ReID benchmarks show that our method
significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art baseline models while
obtaining higher efficiency, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of
our model based on the new finding in this paper.

*Ziqing Zhang,Kai Liu,Zheng Chen,Xi Li,Yucong Chen,Bingnan Duan,Linghe Kong,Yulun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfVSR is a novel video super-resolution method that uses an autoregressive one-step diffusion paradigm to efficiently process long videos, achieving 58x speed-up over existing methods while maintaining high quality and temporal consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VSR methods are inefficient for long videos due to multi-step denoising and suffer from poor scalability with temporal decomposition causing artifacts and discontinuities.

Method: Reformulates VSR as autoregressive one-step diffusion, adapts pre-trained DiT into causal structure with rolling KV-cache and joint visual guidance, and distills diffusion process into single step with patch-wise pixel supervision and cross-chunk distribution matching.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art quality with enhanced semantic consistency, delivers up to 58x speed-up over methods like MGLD-VSR, and enables efficient VSR for unbounded-length videos.

Conclusion: InfVSR pushes the frontier of long-form VSR by enabling streaming inference while leveraging pre-trained video diffusion priors, with new benchmark and semantic-level metrics for comprehensive evaluation.

Abstract: Real-world videos often extend over thousands of frames. Existing video
super-resolution (VSR) approaches, however, face two persistent challenges when
processing long sequences: (1) inefficiency due to the heavy cost of multi-step
denoising for full-length sequences; and (2) poor scalability hindered by
temporal decomposition that causes artifacts and discontinuities. To break
these limits, we propose InfVSR, which novelly reformulates VSR as an
autoregressive-one-step-diffusion paradigm. This enables streaming inference
while fully leveraging pre-trained video diffusion priors. First, we adapt the
pre-trained DiT into a causal structure, maintaining both local and global
coherence via rolling KV-cache and joint visual guidance. Second, we distill
the diffusion process into a single step efficiently, with patch-wise pixel
supervision and cross-chunk distribution matching. Together, these designs
enable efficient and scalable VSR for unbounded-length videos. To fill the gap
in long-form video evaluation, we build a new benchmark tailored for extended
sequences and further introduce semantic-level metrics to comprehensively
assess temporal consistency. Our method pushes the frontier of long-form VSR,
achieves state-of-the-art quality with enhanced semantic consistency, and
delivers up to 58x speed-up over existing methods such as MGLD-VSR. Code will
be available at https://github.com/Kai-Liu001/InfVSR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern T2I generation faces challenges in effectively fusing text with visual tokens in token-centric architectures trained with self-supervision.

Method: Encodes images and captions into discrete visual/textual tokens using joint-embedding predictive Transformer, incorporates cross-attention after feature predictor for conditional denoising, injects raw text embeddings before flow matching loss for alignment.

Result: Achieves strong data efficiency and open-vocabulary generalization on ImageNet-1K, consistently outperforms non-fusion and late-fusion baselines.

Conclusion: Late architectural fusion combined with objective-level alignment offers effective balance between conditioning strength and backbone generality in token-based T2I.

Abstract: Modern Text-to-Image (T2I) generation increasingly relies on token-centric
architectures that are trained with self-supervision, yet effectively fusing
text with visual tokens remains a challenge. We propose \textbf{JEPA-T}, a
unified multimodal framework that encodes images and captions into discrete
visual and textual tokens, processed by a joint-embedding predictive
Transformer. To enhance fusion, we incorporate cross-attention after the
feature predictor for conditional denoising while maintaining a task-agnostic
backbone. Additionally, raw texts embeddings are injected prior to the flow
matching loss to improve alignment during training. During inference, the same
network performs both class-conditional and free-text image generation by
iteratively denoising visual tokens conditioned on text. Evaluations on
ImageNet-1K demonstrate that JEPA-T achieves strong data efficiency,
open-vocabulary generalization, and consistently outperforms non-fusion and
late-fusion baselines. Our approach shows that late architectural fusion
combined with objective-level alignment offers an effective balance between
conditioning strength and backbone generality in token-based T2I.The code is

TL;DR: FastForward enables real-time image localization by creating maps and relocalizing queries in a single feed-forward pass, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with minimal preparation time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image localization methods require hours of mapping time even with known camera poses, making them impractical for real-time applications. This work aims to achieve competitive accuracy much faster.

Method: FastForward represents multiple mapping images as 3D-anchored feature collections and uses these to predict image-to-scene correspondences for query images, enabling camera pose estimation in a single feed-forward pass.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with minimal map preparation time and demonstrates robust generalization to unseen domains, including challenging large-scale outdoor environments.

Conclusion: FastForward provides a practical solution for real-time image localization by significantly reducing mapping time while maintaining competitive accuracy and strong generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Visually localizing an image, i.e., estimating its camera pose, requires
building a scene representation that serves as a visual map. The representation
we choose has direct consequences towards the practicability of our system.
Even when starting from mapping images with known camera poses,
state-of-the-art approaches still require hours of mapping time in the worst
case, and several minutes in the best. This work raises the question whether we
can achieve competitive accuracy much faster. We introduce FastForward, a
method that creates a map representation and relocalizes a query image
on-the-fly in a single feed-forward pass. At the core, we represent multiple
mapping images as a collection of features anchored in 3D space. FastForward
utilizes these mapping features to predict image-to-scene correspondences for
the query image, enabling the estimation of its camera pose. We couple
FastForward with image retrieval and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy when
compared to other approaches with minimal map preparation time. Furthermore,
FastForward demonstrates robust generalization to unseen domains, including
challenging large-scale outdoor environments.

Motivation: Autoregressive models struggle with spatial nature of visual signals conflicting with sequential dependencies, leading to suboptimal vision-language modeling results.

Method: A post-pretraining refinement module that operates on all generated tokens simultaneously, leveraging global context and relationships across tokens to improve spatial correspondence.

Result: The method improves generation quality and enhances semantic consistency in vision-language modeling, mitigating error accumulation in sequential generation.

Conclusion: The proposed refinement module effectively enhances autoregressive vision-language models by better handling spatial correspondence through global token relationships.

Abstract: Autoregressive models excel in sequential modeling and have proven to be
effective for vision-language data. However, the spatial nature of visual
signals conflicts with the sequential dependencies of next-token prediction,
leading to suboptimal results. This work proposes a plug-and-play refinement
module to enhance the complex spatial correspondence modeling within the
generated visual sequence. This module operates as a post-pretraining step to
jointly refine all generated tokens of autoregressive model, enhancing
vision-language modeling under a shared sequential prediction framework. By
leveraging global context and relationship across the tokens, our method
mitigates the error accumulation issue within the sequential generation.
Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves the generation
quality, enhancing the model's ability to produce semantically consistent
results.

### [85] [SoftCFG: Uncertainty-guided Stable Guidance for Visual autoregressive Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00996)
*Dongli Xu,Aleksei Tiulpin,Matthew B. Blaschko*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SoftCFG is an uncertainty-guided inference method that addresses guidance diminishing and over-guidance issues in autoregressive image generation models by distributing adaptive perturbations across all tokens with certainty-weighted guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) in autoregressive models suffers from guidance diminishing (conditional-unconditional gap vanishes during decoding) and over-guidance (strong conditions distort visual coherence), limiting its effectiveness.

Method: Proposes SoftCFG with uncertainty-guided adaptive perturbations across all tokens, where each token contributes certainty-weighted guidance. Also introduces Step Normalization to bound cumulative perturbations for stable long-sequence generation. The method is training-free and model-agnostic.

Result: SoftCFG significantly improves image quality over standard CFG and achieves state-of-the-art FID on ImageNet 256 among autoregressive models.

Conclusion: SoftCFG effectively addresses CFG limitations in autoregressive image generation through uncertainty-guided adaptive perturbations and step normalization, providing persistent guidance while maintaining visual coherence.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have emerged as powerful tools for image
generation by modeling images as sequences of discrete tokens. While
Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) has been adopted to improve conditional
generation, its application in AR models faces two key issues: guidance
diminishing, where the conditional-unconditional gap quickly vanishes as
decoding progresses, and over-guidance, where strong conditions distort visual
coherence. To address these challenges, we propose SoftCFG, an
uncertainty-guided inference method that distributes adaptive perturbations
across all tokens in the sequence. The key idea behind SoftCFG is to let each
generated token contribute certainty-weighted guidance, ensuring that the
signal persists across steps while resolving conflicts between text guidance
and visual context. To further stabilize long-sequence generation, we introduce
Step Normalization, which bounds cumulative perturbations of SoftCFG. Our
method is training-free, model-agnostic, and seamlessly integrates with
existing AR pipelines. Experiments show that SoftCFG significantly improves
image quality over standard CFG and achieves state-of-the-art FID on ImageNet
256 among autoregressive models.

### [86] [TextCAM: Explaining Class Activation Map with Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01004)
*Qiming Zhao,Xingjian Li,Xiaoyu Cao,Xiaolong Wu,Min Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TextCAM enhances Class Activation Mapping (CAM) by integrating natural language descriptions using vision-language models, providing both spatial localization and semantic insights into model decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CAM methods highlight spatial regions but lack semantic understanding of what visual attributes drive predictions, limiting interpretability in high-stakes applications.

Method: TextCAM combines CAM's spatial localization with CLIP embeddings and linear discriminant analysis to derive channel-level semantic representations, aggregating them to produce textual descriptions of visual evidence.

Result: Experiments on ImageNet, CLEVR, and CUB show TextCAM produces faithful explanations that improve human understanding, detect spurious correlations, and preserve model fidelity.

Conclusion: TextCAM successfully bridges the gap between spatial activation maps and semantic understanding, providing more interpretable explanations for deep vision models.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success across domains
but remain difficult to interpret, limiting their trustworthiness in
high-stakes applications. This paper focuses on deep vision models, for which a
dominant line of explainability methods are Class Activation Mapping (CAM) and
its variants working by highlighting spatial regions that drive predictions. We
figure out that CAM provides little semantic insight into what attributes
underlie these activations. To address this limitation, we propose TextCAM, a
novel explanation framework that enriches CAM with natural languages. TextCAM
combines the precise spatial localization of CAM with the semantic alignment of
vision-language models (VLMs). Specifically, we derive channel-level semantic
representations using CLIP embeddings and linear discriminant analysis, and
aggregate them with CAM weights to produce textual descriptions of salient
visual evidence. This yields explanations that jointly specify where the model
attends and what visual attributes likely support its decision. We further
extend TextCAM to generate feature channels into semantically coherent groups,
enabling more fine-grained visual-textual explanations. Experiments on
ImageNet, CLEVR, and CUB demonstrate that TextCAM produces faithful and
interpretable rationales that improve human understanding, detect spurious
correlations, and preserve model fidelity.

*Ashim Dahal,Ankit Ghimire,Saydul Akbar Murad,Nick Rahimi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: POVQA is a data-efficient pipeline that compresses video into temporally pooled images (1 fps) and fine-tunes LVLMs with lightweight supervision, achieving significant performance improvements in video question answering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VQA systems with large context windows (1500+ frames) only cover ~50 seconds of video, which is insufficient for longer video understanding. There's a need for more efficient temporal compression methods.

Method: Compress each second of video into single temporally pooled images using motion blur and weighted averaging variants. Fine-tune QWEN-2.5-VL 7B with SFT and DPO on ReasonVQA dataset containing 12 movies with 239 human-annotated QA pairs with reasoning prompts.

Result: Dramatic improvements on ReasonVQA: F1 score from 0.212 to 0.543, BLEU-4 from 0.031 to 0.291, ROUGE-L from 0.196 to 0.528. Rationale quality significantly increased. Gains persist across different pooling schemes and show robustness in temporal evidence summarization.

Conclusion: POVQA provides an effective data-efficient approach for long video understanding by compressing temporal information into pooled images and aligning LVLMs with lightweight supervision, achieving strong performance improvements and robustness across different temporal pooling methods.

Abstract: Video Question Answering (VQA) with Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) has
gained significant traction in research ever since the Flamingo was introduced
by Deepmind. Recent advancements in large context/long video question answering
have allowed VQA tasks to have context window of 1500+ frames. However, this
only leads to 50 seconds of video footage without losing any significant
information. We introduce POVQA, a data-efficient pipeline that compresses each
second of video into a single temporally pooled image (via motion blur and
weighted averaging variants) and then align LVLMs with lightweight supervision.
Concretely, we build 1 fps input sources using Blend Blur with Last Frame,
Weighted Average, Exponential and Ramp pooling and fine-tune QWEN-2.5-VL 7B
with supervised two turn target including reasoning and final answer. We apply
Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on our
novel dataset ReasonVQA consisting of 12 movies with 239 human annotated
question-answer with reasoning prompts. On our ReasonVQA dataset, this method
dramatically improves performance over pooled baselines: F1 score improves from
0.212 to 0.543, BLEU-4 from 0.031 to 0.291, and ROUGE-L from 0.196 to 0.528.
Rationale quality also significantly increases. Cross-evaluation of SFT + DPO
on various pooling functions show that the gains persist regardless of the
pooling scheme used at train or test time, indicating strong robustness on
summarization of temporal evidence. Similar observations were made on zero-shot
in TVQA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ImageDoctor is a multi-aspect evaluation framework for text-to-image models that assesses image quality across four dimensions and provides pixel-level flaw detection, outperforming scalar-based reward models by 10% in generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image model evaluation approaches use single scalar scores, limiting comprehensive and interpretable feedback on image quality. There's a need for more detailed assessment methods to support preference alignment in reinforcement learning.

Method: Built on a vision-language model using a 'look-think-predict' paradigm: first localizes potential flaws, generates reasoning, then concludes with quantitative scores. Trained through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to evaluate four dimensions: plausibility, semantic alignment, aesthetics, and overall quality.

Result: ImageDoctor demonstrates strong alignment with human preference across multiple datasets and significantly improves generation quality by 10% over scalar-based reward models when used for preference tuning.

Conclusion: ImageDoctor provides a unified multi-aspect evaluation framework that offers comprehensive, interpretable feedback for text-to-image models and serves as an effective dense reward signal for preference alignment.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) models has increased the need
for reliable human preference modeling, a demand further amplified by recent
progress in reinforcement learning for preference alignment. However, existing
approaches typically quantify the quality of a generated image using a single
scalar, limiting their ability to provide comprehensive and interpretable
feedback on image quality. To address this, we introduce ImageDoctor, a unified
multi-aspect T2I model evaluation framework that assesses image quality across
four complementary dimensions: plausibility, semantic alignment, aesthetics,
and overall quality. ImageDoctor also provides pixel-level flaw indicators in
the form of heatmaps, which highlight misaligned or implausible regions, and
can be used as a dense reward for T2I model preference alignment. Inspired by
the diagnostic process, we improve the detail sensitivity and reasoning
capability of ImageDoctor by introducing a "look-think-predict" paradigm, where
the model first localizes potential flaws, then generates reasoning, and
finally concludes the evaluation with quantitative scores. Built on top of a
vision-language model and trained through a combination of supervised
fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, ImageDoctor demonstrates strong
alignment with human preference across multiple datasets, establishing its
effectiveness as an evaluation metric. Furthermore, when used as a reward model
for preference tuning, ImageDoctor significantly improves generation quality --
achieving an improvement of 10% over scalar-based reward models.

*Weihua Zhang,Chengze Jiang,Jie Gui,Lu Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces adversarial training to hyperspectral classification and proposes AT-RA, a novel method that enhances robustness by preserving spectral semantics through data augmentation and spatial smoothness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral deep learning models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and existing defense methods have limited scalability and effectiveness against strong attacks.

Method: Proposed AT-RA adversarial training method that uses data augmentation to increase spectral diversity and ensures spatial smoothness to preserve spectral semantic information.

Result: AT-RA improves adversarial robustness by 21.34% against AutoAttack and 18.78% against PGD-50, while increasing benign accuracy by 2.68%.

Conclusion: Adversarial training is effective for hyperspectral security, and AT-RA successfully addresses unique challenges in hyperspectral data by preserving spectral semantics.

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that hyperspectral classification models based
on deep learning are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which pose
significant security risks. Although several approaches have attempted to
enhance adversarial robustness by modifying network architectures, these
methods often rely on customized designs that limit scalability and fail to
defend effectively against strong attacks. To address these challenges, we
introduce adversarial training to the hyperspectral domain, which is widely
regarded as one of the most effective defenses against adversarial attacks.
Through extensive empirical analyses, we demonstrate that while adversarial
training does enhance robustness across various models and datasets,
hyperspectral data introduces unique challenges not seen in RGB images.
Specifically, we find that adversarial noise and the non-smooth nature of
adversarial examples can distort or eliminate important spectral semantic
information. To mitigate this issue, we employ data augmentation techniques and
propose a novel hyperspectral adversarial training method, termed AT-RA. By
increasing the diversity of spectral information and ensuring spatial
smoothness, AT-RA preserves and corrects spectral semantics in hyperspectral
images. Experimental results show that AT-RA improves adversarial robustness by
21.34% against AutoAttack and 18.78% against PGD-50 while boosting benign
accuracy by 2.68%.

### [90] [Secure and reversible face anonymization with diffusion models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01031)
*Pol Labarbarie,Vincent Itier,William Puech*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First secure, high-quality reversible face anonymization method using diffusion models with secret key mechanism for controlled reversibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current face anonymization methods lack secure reversibility - diffusion models produce high quality but lack key-based control, while other methods don't offer good quality/reversibility trade-off.

Method: Combine secret key with latent face representations in diffusion model, use facial mask to preserve identity-irrelevant features, employ deterministic forward/backward diffusion process.

Result: Produces high-quality anonymized faces that are less visually similar to originals than previous work, enables original face recovery with correct secret key.

Conclusion: Proposed method successfully addresses the trade-off between secure reversibility and high-quality image generation in face anonymization.

Abstract: Face images processed by computer vision algorithms contain sensitive
personal information that malicious actors can capture without consent. These
privacy and security risks highlight the need for effective face anonymization
methods. Current methods struggle to propose a good trade-off between a secure
scheme with high-quality image generation and reversibility for later person
authentication. Diffusion-based approaches produce high-quality anonymized
images but lack the secret key mechanism to ensure that only authorized parties
can reverse the process. In this paper, we introduce, to our knowledge, the
first secure, high-quality reversible anonymization method based on a diffusion
model. We propose to combine the secret key with the latent faces
representation of the diffusion model. To preserve identity-irrelevant
features, generation is constrained by a facial mask, maintaining high-quality
images. By using a deterministic forward and backward diffusion process, our
approach enforces that the original face can be recovered with the correct
secret key. We also show that the proposed method produces anonymized faces
that are less visually similar to the original faces, compared to other
previous work.

TL;DR: ADD is an authentic discrete diffusion framework that operates directly in one-hot space using float-encoded class data, replacing pseudo-discrete diffusion methods with coordinated mechanisms including timestep-conditioned cross-entropy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To fundamentally redefine prior pseudo-discrete diffusion approaches by preserving core diffusion characteristics directly in one-hot space, avoiding reliance on continuous latent spaces or masking policies.

Method: Uses float-encoded one-hot class data as diffusion input, introduces timestep-conditioned cross-entropy loss between model outputs and original one-hot labels, creating a bridge between discriminative and generative learning.

Result: Achieves superior performance on classification tasks compared to baseline and exhibits excellent text generation capabilities on image captioning.

Conclusion: The proposed ADD framework successfully preserves authentic diffusion characteristics in discrete space, with extensive ablations validating the gains of each component.

Abstract: We propose an Authentic Discrete Diffusion (ADD) framework that fundamentally
redefines prior pseudo-discrete approaches by preserving core diffusion
characteristics directly in the one-hot space through a suite of coordinated
mechanisms. Unlike conventional "pseudo" discrete diffusion (PDD) methods, ADD
reformulates the diffusion input by directly using float-encoded one-hot class
data, without relying on diffusing in the continuous latent spaces or masking
policies. At its core, a timestep-conditioned cross-entropy loss is introduced
between the diffusion model's outputs and the original one-hot labels. This
synergistic design establishes a bridge between discriminative and generative
learning. Our experiments demonstrate that ADD not only achieves superior
performance on classification tasks compared to the baseline, but also exhibits
excellent text generation capabilities on Image captioning. Extensive ablations
validate the measurable gains of each component.

*Abdelrhman Werby,Dennis Rotondi,Fabio Scaparro,Kai O. Arras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KeySG is a hierarchical 3D scene graph framework that uses keyframes and multi-modal information to enable efficient scene understanding and complex query processing, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D scene graph approaches are limited to predefined relationships and face scalability issues with large environments that exceed LLM context windows.

Method: Represents scenes as hierarchical graphs (floors, rooms, objects, functional elements) with multi-modal information from keyframes, using VLM for scene extraction and hierarchical RAG pipeline for context retrieval.

Result: Outperforms prior approaches on most metrics across four benchmarks including 3D object segmentation and complex query retrieval.

Conclusion: KeySG provides superior semantic richness and efficiency for 3D scene understanding and reasoning tasks.

Abstract: In recent years, 3D scene graphs have emerged as a powerful world
representation, offering both geometric accuracy and semantic richness.
Combining 3D scene graphs with large language models enables robots to reason,
plan, and navigate in complex human-centered environments. However, current
approaches for constructing 3D scene graphs are semantically limited to a
predefined set of relationships, and their serialization in large environments
can easily exceed an LLM's context window. We introduce KeySG, a framework that
represents 3D scenes as a hierarchical graph consisting of floors, rooms,
objects, and functional elements, where nodes are augmented with multi-modal
information extracted from keyframes selected to optimize geometric and visual
coverage. The keyframes allow us to efficiently leverage VLM to extract scene
information, alleviating the need to explicitly model relationship edges
between objects, enabling more general, task-agnostic reasoning and planning.
Our approach can process complex and ambiguous queries while mitigating the
scalability issues associated with large scene graphs by utilizing a
hierarchical retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline to extract relevant
context from the graph. Evaluated across four distinct benchmarks -- including
3D object segmentation and complex query retrieval -- KeySG outperforms prior
approaches on most metrics, demonstrating its superior semantic richness and
efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Shapley-credited Context-Aware Dawid-Skene with Agreement is a game-theoretic fusion method that improves multi-label understanding in autonomous vehicle dashcam video analysis by learning context-conditioned model reliabilities and combining them with contextual priors and reputation states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large vision-language models are increasingly used in autonomous vehicle stacks, but hallucination limits their reliability in safety-critical pipelines, necessitating robust fusion methods.

Method: The method learns per-model, per-label, context-conditioned reliabilities from labeled history and converts model reports into agreement-guardrailed log-likelihood ratios combined with contextual priors and Shapley-based reputation updates. Three heterogeneous VLMs were fine-tuned with LoRA on curated dashcam clips.

Result: The proposed method achieves 23% reduction in Hamming distance, 55% improvement in Macro-F1, and 47% improvement in Micro-F1 compared to the best single model.

Conclusion: VLM fusion serves as a calibrated, interpretable, and robust decision-support component for autonomous vehicle pipelines, effectively amplifying agreement among reliable models while preserving uniquely correct single-model signals.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly used in
autonomous-vehicle (AV) stacks, but hallucination limits their reliability in
safety-critical pipelines. We present Shapley-credited Context-Aware
Dawid-Skene with Agreement, a game-theoretic fusion method for multi-label
understanding of ego-view dashcam video. It learns per-model, per-label,
context-conditioned reliabilities from labelled history and, at inference,
converts each model's report into an agreement-guardrailed log-likelihood ratio
that is combined with a contextual prior and a public reputation state updated
via Shapley-based team credit. The result is calibrated, thresholdable
posteriors that (i) amplify agreement among reliable models, (ii) preserve
uniquely correct single-model signals, and (iii) adapt to drift. To specialise
general VLMs, we curate 1,000 real-world dashcam clips with structured
annotations (scene description, manoeuvre recommendation, rationale) via an
automatic pipeline that fuses HDD ground truth, vehicle kinematics, and YOLOv11
+ BoT-SORT tracking, guided by a three-step chain-of-thought prompt; three
heterogeneous VLMs are then fine-tuned with LoRA. We evaluate with Hamming
distance, Micro-Macro-F1, and average per-video latency. Empirically, the
proposed method achieves a 23% reduction in Hamming distance, 55% improvement
in Macro-F1, and 47% improvement in Micro-F1 when comparing with the best
single model, supporting VLM fusion as a calibrated, interpretable, and robust

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative models are limited in producing professional educational videos that require disciplinary knowledge, precise visual structures, and coherent transitions. These requirements are better addressed through renderable environments controlled by logical commands like code.

Method: The framework uses three agents: Planner structures lecture content into coherent flows and prepares visual assets; Coder converts instructions into executable Python code with scope-guided auto-fix; Critic uses vision-language models with visual anchor prompts to refine spatial layout and ensure clarity.

Result: Code2Video achieves 40% improvement over direct code generation and produces videos comparable to human-crafted tutorials, as measured by VLM-as-a-Judge aesthetic scores, code efficiency, and the novel TeachQuiz metric that quantifies knowledge recovery from generated videos.

Conclusion: Code2Video demonstrates potential as a scalable, interpretable, and controllable approach for educational video generation, with code and datasets publicly available for further research and development.

Abstract: While recent generative models advance pixel-space video synthesis, they
remain limited in producing professional educational videos, which demand
disciplinary knowledge, precise visual structures, and coherent transitions,
limiting their applicability in educational scenarios. Intuitively, such
requirements are better addressed through the manipulation of a renderable
environment, which can be explicitly controlled via logical commands (e.g.,
code). In this work, we propose Code2Video, a code-centric agent framework for
generating educational videos via executable Python code. The framework
comprises three collaborative agents: (i) Planner, which structures lecture
content into temporally coherent flows and prepares corresponding visual
assets; (ii) Coder, which converts structured instructions into executable
Python codes while incorporating scope-guided auto-fix to enhance efficiency;
and (iii) Critic, which leverages vision-language models (VLM) with visual
anchor prompts to refine spatial layout and ensure clarity. To support
systematic evaluation, we build MMMC, a benchmark of professionally produced,
discipline-specific educational videos. We evaluate MMMC across diverse
dimensions, including VLM-as-a-Judge aesthetic scores, code efficiency, and
particularly, TeachQuiz, a novel end-to-end metric that quantifies how well a
VLM, after unlearning, can recover knowledge by watching the generated videos.
Our results demonstrate the potential of Code2Video as a scalable,
interpretable, and controllable approach, achieving 40% improvement over direct
code generation and producing videos comparable to human-crafted tutorials. The

TL;DR: EvoWorld is a world model that combines panoramic video generation with evolving 3D memory to enable long-horizon spatial exploration, using explicit 3D reconstruction as spatial guidance for enhanced visual realism and geometric consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspired by human mental exploration and replay of 3D environments, the paper aims to create a world model that can maintain spatial consistency over extended trajectories, addressing limitations of prior methods that only synthesize videos without explicit spatial guidance.

Method: Given a single panoramic image, the method: 1) generates future video frames using a video generator with view control, 2) evolves 3D scene reconstruction using a feedforward plug-and-play transformer, and 3) synthesizes futures by conditioning on geometric reprojections from the evolving 3D memory.

Result: Extensive experiments show that the evolving 3D memory substantially improves visual fidelity and maintains spatial scene coherence compared to existing approaches, particularly excelling in loop-closure detection and spatial coherence over extended trajectories.

Conclusion: EvoWorld represents a significant advance toward long-horizon spatially consistent world modeling by bridging video generation with explicit 3D memory evolution, enabling more realistic and geometrically consistent environmental exploration.

Abstract: Humans possess a remarkable ability to mentally explore and replay 3D
environments they have previously experienced. Inspired by this mental process,
we present EvoWorld: a world model that bridges panoramic video generation with
evolving 3D memory to enable spatially consistent long-horizon exploration.
Given a single panoramic image as input, EvoWorld first generates future video
frames by leveraging a video generator with fine-grained view control, then
evolves the scene's 3D reconstruction using a feedforward plug-and-play
transformer, and finally synthesizes futures by conditioning on geometric
reprojections from this evolving explicit 3D memory. Unlike prior
state-of-the-arts that synthesize videos only, our key insight lies in
exploiting this evolving 3D reconstruction as explicit spatial guidance for the
video generation process, projecting the reconstructed geometry onto target
viewpoints to provide rich spatial cues that significantly enhance both visual
realism and geometric consistency. To evaluate long-range exploration
capabilities, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark spanning synthetic
outdoor environments, Habitat indoor scenes, and challenging real-world
scenarios, with particular emphasis on loop-closure detection and spatial
coherence over extended trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our evolving 3D memory substantially improves visual fidelity and maintains
spatial scene coherence compared to existing approaches, representing a
significant advance toward long-horizon spatially consistent world modeling.

TL;DR: IMAGEdit is a training-free framework for multi-subject video editing that manipulates appearances of multiple designated subjects while preserving non-target regions, using multimodal conditioning and mask sequences without finetuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing video editing methods that struggle with insufficient multimodal conditioning and mask boundary entanglement when handling multiple subjects, expanding the applicability of video editing.

Method: Uses prompt-guided multimodal alignment and prior-based mask retargeting modules to generate multimodal information and mask motion sequences, then feeds these into a pretrained mask-driven video generation model for synthesis.

Result: Extensive experiments on MSVBench show IMAGEdit consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods, with strong generalization capability for any number of subjects.

Conclusion: IMAGEdit significantly improves video editing performance, is compatible with any mask-driven video generation model, and overcomes key limitations in multi-subject video editing.

Abstract: In this paper, we present IMAGEdit, a training-free framework for any number
of video subject editing that manipulates the appearances of multiple
designated subjects while preserving non-target regions, without finetuning or
retraining. We achieve this by providing robust multimodal conditioning and
precise mask sequences through a prompt-guided multimodal alignment module and
a prior-based mask retargeting module. We first leverage large models'
understanding and generation capabilities to produce multimodal information and
mask motion sequences for multiple subjects across various types. Then, the
obtained prior mask sequences are fed into a pretrained mask-driven video
generation model to synthesize the edited video. With strong generalization
capability, IMAGEdit remedies insufficient prompt-side multimodal conditioning
and overcomes mask boundary entanglement in videos with any number of subjects,
thereby significantly expanding the applicability of video editing. More
importantly, IMAGEdit is compatible with any mask-driven video generation
model, significantly improving overall performance. Extensive experiments on
our newly constructed multi-subject benchmark MSVBench verify that IMAGEdit
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Code, models, and datasets are
