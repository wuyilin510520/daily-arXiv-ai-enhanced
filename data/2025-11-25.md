*Rayan Aldajani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AI models using frontal body images can estimate body fat percentage with RMSE of 4.44% and R² of 0.807, offering low-cost alternative to expensive DEXA scans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gold-standard body fat measurement methods like DEXA scans are expensive and inaccessible for most people, creating need for affordable alternatives.

Method: Developed two approaches: ResNet-based image models using frontal body images and regression models using anthropometric measurements. Used dataset of 535 samples including web-scraped Reddit images with self-reported body fat percentages.

Result: Image-based model achieved RMSE of 4.44% and R² of 0.807 for body fat estimation. Also outlined multimodal fusion framework for future development.

Conclusion: AI-assisted models can provide accessible, low-cost body fat estimates, supporting future consumer health and fitness applications.

Abstract: Tracking body fat percentage is essential for effective weight management, yet gold-standard methods such as DEXA scans remain expensive and inaccessible for most people. This study evaluates the feasibility of artificial intelligence (AI) models as low-cost alternatives using frontal body images and basic anthropometric data. The dataset consists of 535 samples: 253 cases with recorded anthropometric measurements (weight, height, neck, ankle, and wrist) and 282 images obtained via web scraping from Reddit posts with self-reported body fat percentages, including some reported as DEXA-derived by the original posters. Because no public datasets exist for computer-vision-based body fat estimation, this dataset was compiled specifically for this study. Two approaches were developed: (1) ResNet-based image models and (2) regression models using anthropometric measurements. A multimodal fusion framework is also outlined for future expansion once paired datasets become available. The image-based model achieved a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 4.44% and a Coefficient of Determination (R^2) of 0.807. These findings demonstrate that AI-assisted models can offer accessible and low-cost body fat estimates, supporting future consumer applications in health and fitness.

*Yassir Benhammou,Suman Kalyan,Sujay Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Multimodal Autoencoder (MMAE) learns unified representations across text, audio, and visual data to automate metadata extraction and semantic clustering for broadcast content, outperforming linear baselines on clustering metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI systems for broadcast content indexing operate on single modalities, limiting understanding of cross-modal relationships in complex media material.

Method: Proposed a Multimodal Autoencoder (MMAE) trained on LUMA dataset that minimizes joint reconstruction losses across text, audio, and visual modalities to learn modality-invariant semantic structures.

Result: Significant improvements in clustering and alignment metrics (Silhouette, ARI, NMI) compared to linear baselines, demonstrating effective cross-modal representation learning.

Conclusion: Reconstruction-based multimodal embeddings can serve as foundation for scalable metadata generation and cross-modal retrieval in broadcast archives, enhancing automation and content management efficiency.

Abstract: Broadcast and media organizations increasingly rely on artificial intelligence to automate the labor-intensive processes of content indexing, tagging, and metadata generation. However, existing AI systems typically operate on a single modality-such as video, audio, or text-limiting their understanding of complex, cross-modal relationships in broadcast material. In this work, we propose a Multimodal Autoencoder (MMAE) that learns unified representations across text, audio, and visual data, enabling end-to-end automation of metadata extraction and semantic clustering. The model is trained on the recently introduced LUMA dataset, a fully aligned benchmark of multimodal triplets representative of real-world media content. By minimizing joint reconstruction losses across modalities, the MMAE discovers modality-invariant semantic structures without relying on large paired or contrastive datasets. We demonstrate significant improvements in clustering and alignment metrics (Silhouette, ARI, NMI) compared to linear baselines, indicating that reconstruction-based multimodal embeddings can serve as a foundation for scalable metadata generation and cross-modal retrieval in broadcast archives. These results highlight the potential of reconstruction-driven multimodal learning to enhance automation, searchability, and content management efficiency in modern broadcast workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the scarcity of public benchmark datasets for wildfire risk prediction that support long-term temporal modeling, large-scale spatial coverage, and multimodal drivers.

Method: Present a 25-year, daily-resolution wildfire dataset covering 240 million hectares with 38 covariates including fire detections, weather, fuel, terrain, and human factors. Evaluate various time-series models and analyze position embedding and factor importance.

Result: The dataset enables evaluation of diverse forecasting models and investigation of position embedding effectiveness and relative importance of fire-driving factors.

Conclusion: The dataset and code are publicly available to support wildfire risk prediction research, facilitating comparison of different modeling approaches and understanding of key drivers.

Abstract: Wildfire risk prediction remains a critical yet challenging task due to the complex interactions among fuel conditions, meteorology, topography, and human activity. Despite growing interest in data-driven approaches, publicly available benchmark datasets that support long-term temporal modeling, large-scale spatial coverage, and multimodal drivers remain scarce. To address this gap, we present a 25-year, daily-resolution wildfire dataset covering 240 million hectares across British Columbia and surrounding regions. The dataset includes 38 covariates, encompassing active fire detections, weather variables, fuel conditions, terrain features, and anthropogenic factors. Using this benchmark, we evaluate a diverse set of time-series forecasting models, including CNN-based, linear-based, Transformer-based, and Mamba-based architectures. We also investigate effectiveness of position embedding and the relative importance of different fire-driving factors.

### [4] [Robustness of Structured Data Extraction from Perspectively Distorted Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17607)
*Hyakka Nakada,Yoshiyasu Tanaka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Study examines how perspective distortions and rotations affect Gemini-1.5-pro's OCR accuracy, finding significant degradation in structure recognition that can be improved with simple rotational correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world document images often contain both in-plane rotations and perspective distortions, but existing research primarily focuses on rotations. This study investigates how these combined perturbations affect multi-modal LLM performance in data extraction tasks.

Method: Analyzed typical document distortions and found most follow isosceles-trapezoidal transformations, reducing parameters from 8 to 2 (rotation angle and distortion ratio). Evaluated Gemini-1.5-pro on synthetically generated documents with varying parameters, measuring both character-recognition and structure-recognition accuracy.

Result: Structure-recognition accuracy was significantly degraded by document distortion, while character recognition was less affected. Simple rotational correction was found to improve accuracy, particularly for structure recognition tasks.

Conclusion: Document distortions significantly impact multi-modal LLM performance, especially for structure recognition. Simple corrections can mitigate these effects, providing practical insights for real-world OCR applications using multi-modal LLMs.

Abstract: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for data extraction from documents is essential to intelligent informatics, such as digitizing medical records and recognizing road signs. Multi-modal Large Language Models (LLMs) can solve this task and have shown remarkable performance. Recently, it has been noticed that the accuracy of data extraction by multi-modal LLMs can be affected when in-plane rotations are present in the documents. However, real-world document images are usually not only in-plane rotated but also perspectively distorted. This study investigates the impacts of such perturbations on the data extraction accuracy for the state-of-the-art model, Gemini-1.5-pro. Because perspective distortions have a high degree of freedom, designing experiments in the same manner as single-parametric rotations is difficult. We observed typical distortions of document images and showed that most of them approximately follow an isosceles-trapezoidal transformation, which allows us to evaluate distortions with a small number of parameters. We were able to reduce the number of independent parameters from eight to two, i.e. rotation angle and distortion ratio. Then, specific entities were extracted from synthetically generated sample documents with varying these parameters. As the performance of LLMs, we evaluated not only a character-recognition accuracy but also a structure-recognition accuracy. Whereas the former represents the classical indicators for optical character recognition, the latter is related to the correctness of reading order. In particular, the structure-recognition accuracy was found to be significantly degraded by document distortion. In addition, we found that this accuracy can be improved by a simple rotational correction. This insight will contribute to the practical use of multi-modal LLMs for OCR tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate 3D ground truth is critical for autonomous navigation, surveillance, and robotics applications, but existing approaches often provide only ground-plane information.

Method: Multi-camera single-object tracking using homography-based projection and UKF-based fusion to transform 2D image coordinates into 3D world coordinates from human-annotated 2D ground truth.

Result: High accuracy in 3D localization on CMC, Wildtrack, and Panoptic datasets compared to available 3D ground truth, with full 3D shape output instead of just ground-plane information.

Conclusion: The algorithm provides a scalable and fully automatic solution for multi-camera systems using only 2D image annotations, overcoming limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Accurate 3D ground truth estimation is critical for applications such as autonomous navigation, surveillance, and robotics. This paper introduces a novel method that uses an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) to fuse 2D bounding box or pose keypoint ground truth annotations from multiple calibrated cameras into accurate 3D ground truth. By leveraging human-annotated ground-truth 2D, our proposed method, a multi-camera single-object tracking algorithm, transforms 2D image coordinates into robust 3D world coordinates through homography-based projection and UKF-based fusion. Our proposed algorithm processes multi-view data to estimate object positions and shapes while effectively handling challenges such as occlusion. We evaluate our method on the CMC, Wildtrack, and Panoptic datasets, demonstrating high accuracy in 3D localization compared to the available 3D ground truth. Unlike existing approaches that provide only ground-plane information, our method also outputs the full 3D shape of each object. Additionally, the algorithm offers a scalable and fully automatic solution for multi-camera systems using only 2D image annotations.

### [6] [Unified Low-Light Traffic Image Enhancement via Multi-Stage Illumination Recovery and Adaptive Noise Suppression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17612)
*Siddiqua Namrah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unsupervised multi-stage deep learning framework for enhancing low-light traffic images by decomposing into illumination and reflectance components with specialized modules for brightness correction, noise suppression, and exposure compensation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-light traffic images suffer from poor visibility due to low illumination, noise, motion blur, non-uniform lighting, and glare, which hinder object detection and scene understanding in autonomous driving and surveillance systems.

Method: Multi-stage framework that decomposes images into illumination and reflectance components, refined by three modules: Illumination Adaptation (brightness correction), Reflectance Restoration (noise suppression with spatial-channel attention), and Over-Exposure Compensation (reconstructing saturated regions). Uses self-supervised reconstruction, reflectance smoothness, perceptual consistency, and domain-aware regularization losses without paired ground-truth.

Result: Superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on general and traffic-specific datasets in both quantitative metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, NIQE) and qualitative visual quality. Enhances visibility, preserves structure, and improves downstream perception reliability.

Conclusion: The proposed unsupervised framework effectively addresses low-light traffic image enhancement challenges, improving visibility and perception reliability in real-world scenarios without requiring paired training data.

Abstract: Enhancing low-light traffic images is crucial for reliable perception in autonomous driving, intelligent transportation, and urban surveillance systems. Nighttime and dimly lit traffic scenes often suffer from poor visibility due to low illumination, noise, motion blur, non-uniform lighting, and glare from vehicle headlights or street lamps, which hinder tasks such as object detection and scene understanding. To address these challenges, we propose a fully unsupervised multi-stage deep learning framework for low-light traffic image enhancement. The model decomposes images into illumination and reflectance components, progressively refined by three specialized modules: (1) Illumination Adaptation, for global and local brightness correction; (2) Reflectance Restoration, for noise suppression and structural detail recovery using spatial-channel attention; and (3) Over-Exposure Compensation, for reconstructing saturated regions and balancing scene luminance. The network is trained using self-supervised reconstruction, reflectance smoothness, perceptual consistency, and domain-aware regularization losses, eliminating the need for paired ground-truth images. Experiments on general and traffic-specific datasets demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, NIQE) and qualitative visual quality. Our approach enhances visibility, preserves structure, and improves downstream perception reliability in real-world low-light traffic scenarios.

### [7] [HSMix: Hard and Soft Mixing Data Augmentation for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17614)
*Danyang Sun,Fadi Dornaika,Nagore Barrena*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HSMix is a novel data augmentation method for medical image segmentation that combines hard and soft mixing of superpixels from two source images, preserving local semantics while increasing diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image segmentation faces data scarcity and overfitting issues due to high annotation costs and rare diseases. While self-supervised and semi-supervised learning help, they are complex. Data augmentation offers a simpler solution but local image editing techniques for segmentation are underexplored.

Method: HSMix creates hard-augmented images by combining homogeneous regions (superpixels) from two source images. Soft mixing adjusts brightness using locally aggregated pixel-wise saliency coefficients. Ground-truth masks undergo the same mixing operations to generate augmented masks.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate HSMix's effectiveness across various medical segmentation tasks. The method preserves local semantic information while enriching augmentation diversity.

Conclusion: HSMix is a plug-and-play, model-agnostic solution that fully exploits contour and saliency information, making it applicable to various medical imaging modalities and effectively addressing data scarcity in medical segmentation.

Abstract: Due to the high cost of annotation or the rarity of some diseases, medical image segmentation is often limited by data scarcity and the resulting overfitting problem. Self-supervised learning and semi-supervised learning can mitigate the data scarcity challenge to some extent. However, both of these paradigms are complex and require either hand-crafted pretexts or well-defined pseudo-labels. In contrast, data augmentation represents a relatively simple and straightforward approach to addressing data scarcity issues. It has led to significant improvements in image recognition tasks. However, the effectiveness of local image editing augmentation techniques in the context of segmentation has been less explored. We propose HSMix, a novel approach to local image editing data augmentation involving hard and soft mixing for medical semantic segmentation. In our approach, a hard-augmented image is created by combining homogeneous regions (superpixels) from two source images. A soft mixing method further adjusts the brightness of these composed regions with brightness mixing based on locally aggregated pixel-wise saliency coefficients. The ground-truth segmentation masks of the two source images undergo the same mixing operations to generate the associated masks for the augmented images. Our method fully exploits both the prior contour and saliency information, thus preserving local semantic information in the augmented images while enriching the augmentation space with more diversity. Our method is a plug-and-play solution that is model agnostic and applicable to a range of medical imaging modalities. Extensive experimental evidence has demonstrated its effectiveness in a variety of medical segmentation tasks. The source code is available in https://github.com/DanielaPlusPlus/HSMix.

### [8] [Plug-and-Play Multi-Concept Adaptive Blending for High-Fidelity Text-to-Image Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17615)
*Young-Beom Woo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PnP-MIX is a tuning-free method for multi-concept personalization in text-to-image generation that addresses issues like unintended alterations, semantic inconsistencies, and concept leakage through guided appearance attention, mask-guided noise mixing, and background dilution++.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multi-concept personalization often underperform on complex scenes, causing unintended alterations in both personalized and non-personalized regions, disrupting prompt structure and semantic consistency.

Method: Uses guided appearance attention to reflect intended concept appearances, mask-guided noise mixing to preserve non-personalized regions, and background dilution++ to prevent concept leakage and ensure accurate feature localization.

Result: Extensive experiments show PnP-MIX consistently outperforms existing methods in both single- and multi-concept personalization scenarios without requiring additional model tuning.

Conclusion: PnP-MIX provides a robust, tuning-free solution for high-fidelity multi-concept integration in text-to-image generation, effectively addressing key limitations of previous approaches.

Abstract: Integrating multiple personalized concepts into a single image has recently become a significant area of focus within Text-to-Image (T2I) generation. However, existing methods often underperform on complex multi-object scenes due to unintended alterations in both personalized and non-personalized regions. This not only fails to preserve the intended prompt structure but also disrupts interactions among regions, leading to semantic inconsistencies. To address this limitation, we introduce plug-and-play multi-concept adaptive blending for high-fidelity text-to-image synthesis (PnP-MIX), an innovative, tuning-free approach designed to seamlessly embed multiple personalized concepts into a single generated image. Our method leverages guided appearance attention to faithfully reflect the intended appearance of each personalized concept. To further enhance compositional fidelity, we present a mask-guided noise mixing strategy that preserves the integrity of non-personalized regions such as the background or unrelated objects while enabling the precise integration of personalized objects. Finally, to mitigate concept leakage, i.e., the inadvertent leakage of personalized concept features into other regions, we propose background dilution++, a novel strategy that effectively reduces such leakage and promotes accurate localization of features within personalized regions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that PnP-MIX consistently surpasses existing methodologies in both single- and multi-concept personalization scenarios, underscoring its robustness and superior performance without additional model tuning.

### [9] [Foundational Question Generation for Video Question Answering via an Embedding-Integrated Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17618)
*Ju-Young Oh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FIQ framework enhances VQA models by generating foundational Q&A pairs from video descriptive information and aligning question embeddings with visual features, achieving SOTA on SUTD-TrafficQA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VQA annotations are event-centric and lack fundamental scene information like object categories and spatial configurations, limiting model generalization and reasoning capabilities.

Method: FIQ generates Q&A pairs from descriptive video information and uses VQ-CAlign module to align question embeddings with visual features for better contextual preservation.

Result: Experimental results on SUTD-TrafficQA dataset show FIQ achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing baseline approaches.

Conclusion: FIQ improves VQA model reasoning by enhancing foundational scene comprehension through generated Q&A pairs and embedding alignment, demonstrating superior generalization and performance.

Abstract: Conventional VQA approaches primarily rely on question-answer (Q&A) pairs to learn the spatio-temporal dynamics of video content. However, most existing annotations are event-centric, which restricts the model's ability to capture the comprehensive context of a scene. The lack of fundamental information such as object categories, spatial configurations, and descriptive visual attributes prevents the model from forming a complete understanding of the environment, ultimately limiting its generalization and reasoning capability. In this paper, we introduce Foundational Question Generation for Video Question Answering via an Embedding-Integrated Approach (FIQ), a framework designed to enhance the reasoning capability of VQA models by improving their foundational comprehension of video content. FIQ generates Q&A pairs from descriptive information extracted directly from videos, thereby enriching the dataset with core scene-level attributes. These generated pairs help the model develop a more holistic understanding of the video, leading to improved generalizability and reasoning performance. In addition, we propose a VQ-CAlign module that aligns task-specific question embeddings with corresponding visual features, preserving essential contextual cues and enhancing adaptability to downstream tasks. Experimental results on the SUTD-TrafficQA dataset demonstrate that FIQ achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing baseline approaches.

### [10] [Rethinking the Encoding and Annotating of 3D Bounding Box: Corner-Aware 3D Object Detection from Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17619)
*Qinghao Meng,Junbo Yin,Jianbing Shen,Yunde Jia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes corner-aligned regression for LiDAR 3D object detection to address center instability, enabling weakly supervised learning with only BEV corner annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Center-aligned regression suffers from instability as object centers often fall in sparse LiDAR regions, leading to noisy predictions. Corners are more stable as they reside in dense, observable areas.

Method: Shifts prediction target from centers to geometrically informative corners, uses geometric constraints to recover partial 3D parameters from corner annotations, and designs a corner-aware detection head that integrates with existing detectors.

Result: Improves performance by 3.5% AP over center-based baseline on KITTI dataset, achieves 83% of fully supervised accuracy using only BEV corner clicks.

Conclusion: Corner-aligned regression effectively addresses center instability in LiDAR detection and enables weakly supervised learning with minimal annotation requirements.

Abstract: Center-aligned regression remains dominant in LiDAR-based 3D object detection, yet it suffers from fundamental instability: object centers often fall in sparse or empty regions of the bird's-eye-view (BEV) due to the front-surface-biased nature of LiDAR point clouds, leading to noisy and inaccurate bounding box predictions. To circumvent this limitation, we revisit bounding box representation and propose corner-aligned regression, which shifts the prediction target from unstable centers to geometrically informative corners that reside in dense, observable regions. Leveraging the inherent geometric constraints among corners and image 2D boxes, partial parameters of 3D bounding boxes can be recovered from corner annotations, enabling a weakly supervised paradigm without requiring complete 3D labels. We design a simple yet effective corner-aware detection head that can be plugged into existing detectors. Experiments on KITTI show our method improves performance by 3.5% AP over center-based baseline, and achieves 83% of fully supervised accuracy using only BEV corner clicks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our corner-aware regression strategy.

Motivation: Extreme quantization in Binary Neural Networks limits representational capacity and destabilizes training, especially for lightweight architectures with depth-wise convolutions.

Method: Uses 1.58-bit convolution to enhance expressiveness and pre-BN residual connection to stabilize optimization by improving Hessian condition number.

Conclusion: Successfully enables binarization of depth-wise convolutions in BNNs, establishing new state-of-the-art performance and demonstrating consistent improvements across various datasets.

Abstract: Recent advances in model compression have highlighted the potential of low-bit precision techniques, with Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) attracting attention for their extreme efficiency. However, extreme quantization in BNNs limits representational capacity and destabilizes training, posing significant challenges for lightweight architectures with depth-wise convolutions. To address this, we propose a 1.58-bit convolution to enhance expressiveness and a pre-BN residual connection to stabilize optimization by improving the Hessian condition number. These innovations enable, to the best of our knowledge, the first successful binarization of depth-wise convolutions in BNNs. Our method achieves 33M OPs on ImageNet with MobileNet V1, establishing a new state-of-the-art in BNNs by outperforming prior methods with comparable OPs. Moreover, it consistently outperforms existing methods across various datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, STL-10, Tiny ImageNet, and Oxford Flowers 102, with accuracy improvements of up to 9.3 percentage points.

*Kaikwan Lau,Andrew S. Na,Justin W. L. Wan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework accelerates score-based diffusion models by converting them to Fokker-Planck formulation and using cross-matrix Krylov projection to exploit mathematical similarities between matrices, achieving significant speed improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard stable diffusion models converted to Fokker-Planck formulation require solving large linear systems for each image, leading to high computational costs when training with many images.

Method: Convert standard stable diffusion to Fokker-Planck formulation, then use cross-matrix Krylov projection method that exploits mathematical similarities between matrices by building shared subspace from seed matrices to rapidly solve for target matrices.

Result: Achieves 15.8% to 43.7% time reduction over standard sparse solvers, up to 115× speedup in denoising tasks compared to DDPM baselines, and produces high-quality images under fixed computational budget where DDPM fails.

Conclusion: The approach provides a practical method for efficient generation in resource-limited settings by significantly accelerating diffusion models while maintaining image quality.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework to accelerate score-based diffusion models. It first converts the standard stable diffusion model into the Fokker-Planck formulation which results in solving large linear systems for each image. For training involving many images, it can lead to a high computational cost. The core innovation is a cross-matrix Krylov projection method that exploits mathematical similarities between matrices, using a shared subspace built from ``seed" matrices to rapidly solve for subsequent ``target" matrices. Our experiments show that this technique achieves a 15.8\% to 43.7\% time reduction over standard sparse solvers. Additionally, we compare our method against DDPM baselines in denoising tasks, showing a speedup of up to 115$\times$. Furthermore, under a fixed computational budget, our model is able to produce high-quality images while DDPM fails to generate recognizable content, illustrating our approach is a practical method for efficient generation in resource-limited settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UPMI is a lightweight augmentation method that generates synthetic meta-features in low-dimensional space using GMMs to improve pediatric pancreatitis diagnosis from multimodal MRI, achieving ~5% AUC improvement over baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pediatric pancreatitis diagnosis faces challenges due to limited sample availability and multimodal imaging complexity, which also hinders machine learning approaches.

Method: UPMI uses modality-specific logistic regressions on T1W/T2W MRI radiomics to create 7D meta-features, then applies class-conditional GMMs to sample synthetic meta-features that train a Random Forest meta-classifier.

Result: On 67 pediatric subjects, UPMI achieved mean AUC of 0.908 ± 0.072, a ~5% relative gain over real-only baseline (AUC 0.864 ± 0.061).

Conclusion: UPMI effectively addresses data scarcity in pediatric pancreatitis diagnosis through probabilistic meta-imputation in low-dimensional space, demonstrating significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Pediatric pancreatitis is a progressive and debilitating inflammatory condition, including acute pancreatitis and chronic pancreatitis, that presents significant clinical diagnostic challenges. Machine learning-based methods also face diagnostic challenges due to limited sample availability and multimodal imaging complexity. To address these challenges, this paper introduces Upstream Probabilistic Meta-Imputation (UPMI), a light-weight augmentation strategy that operates upstream of a meta-learner in a low-dimensional meta-feature space rather than in image space. Modality-specific logistic regressions (T1W and T2W MRI radiomics) produce probability outputs that are transformed into a 7-dimensional meta-feature vector. Class-conditional Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) are then fit within each cross-validation fold to sample synthetic meta-features that, combined with real meta-features, train a Random Forest (RF) meta-classifier. On 67 pediatric subjects with paired T1W/T2W MRIs, UPMI achieves a mean AUC of 0.908 $\pm$ 0.072, a $\sim$5% relative gain over a real-only baseline (AUC 0.864 $\pm$ 0.061).

*Weijun Gao,Rundong He,Jinyang Dong,Yongshun Gong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a typical set refinement method for OOD detection that considers channel characteristics and distributional skewness to improve activation rectification and achieve state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing activation-based OOD detection methods overlook channel characteristics and distributional skewness, leading to inaccurate typical set estimation and improper inclusion of anomalous activations.

Method: Introduces channel-aware typical set refinement based on discriminability and activity, plus skewness-based refinement to mitigate distributional bias, then uses rectified activations to compute energy scores.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet-1K and CIFAR-100 benchmarks and demonstrates effective generalization across different backbones and score functions.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses limitations in existing activation-based OOD detection by incorporating channel awareness and distributional considerations, leading to improved detection performance.

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is a critical capability for ensuring the safe deployment of machine learning models in open-world environments, where unexpected or anomalous inputs can compromise model reliability and performance. Activation-based methods play a fundamental role in OOD detection by mitigating anomalous activations and enhancing the separation between in-distribution (ID) and OOD data. However, existing methods apply activation rectification while often overlooking channel's intrinsic characteristics and distributional skewness, which results in inaccurate typical set estimation. This discrepancy can lead to the improper inclusion of anomalous activations across channels. To address this limitation, we propose a typical set refinement method based on discriminability and activity, which rectifies activations into a channel-aware typical set. Furthermore, we introduce a skewness-based refinement to mitigate distributional bias in typical set estimation. Finally, we leverage the rectified activations to compute the energy score for OOD detection. Experiments on the ImageNet-1K and CIFAR-100 benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and generalizes effectively across backbones and score functions.

Motivation: Current benchmarks lack testing for grounding, partial observability, and post-hoc verification in real-world control interface interactions, which are crucial for autonomous intelligence but have safety implications when failed.

Method: Created SWITCH benchmark through iterative releases, with first iteration (SWITCH-Basic) evaluating five abilities: task-aware VQA, semantic UI grounding, action generation, state-transition prediction, and result verification using egocentric RGB video input across 351 tasks spanning 98 real devices.

Result: Commercial and open LMMs show inconsistent performance on single-step interactions, often over-relying on text cues and under-using visual/video evidence, with high aggregate scores masking these failures.

Conclusion: SWITCH provides reproducible evaluation framework to address gaps in current benchmarks and enable community contributions toward more challenging iterations and training datasets for autonomous interaction with real-world interfaces.

Abstract: Autonomous intelligence requires not only perception and reasoning, but critically, effective interaction with the existing world and its infrastructure. Everyday environments are rich in tangible control interfaces (TCIs), e.g., light switches, appliance panels, and embedded GUIs, that demand commonsense and physics reasoning, but also causal prediction and outcome verification in time and space (e.g., delayed heating, remote lights). Moreover, failures here have potential safety implications, yet current benchmarks rarely test grounding, partial observability (video), or post-hoc verification in situated settings. We introduce SWITCH (Semantic World Interface Tasks for Control and Handling), an embodied, task-driven benchmark created through iterative releases to probe these gaps. Its first iteration, SWITCH-Basic, evaluates five complementary abilities:task-aware VQA, semantic UI grounding, action generation, state-transition prediction, and result verification, under egocentric RGB video input and device diversity. Across 351 tasks spanning 98 real devices and appliances, commercial and open LMMMs exhibit inconsistent performance even on single-step interactions, often over-relying on textual cues and under-using visual or video evidence (and high aggregate scores can mask such failures). SWITCH provides data, code, and held-out splits to enable reproducible evaluation and community contributions toward more challenging future iterations of the benchmark and the creation of training datasets.

TL;DR: A comprehensive deep learning system for brain tumor classification from MRI images using six architectures, achieving state-of-the-art performance (99.53% accuracy) with Inception-ResNet V2 and developing a compact 1.31M parameter CNN for edge deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an automated, standardized system for brain tumor classification that addresses the black-box issue in AI, enables deployment in low-resource settings, and provides trustworthy AI for clinical screening and triage.

Method: Used six CNN architectures (five ImageNet-pre-trained models and one custom compact CNN) with standardized preprocessing, AdamW optimizer, CosineAnnealingLR, and early stopping. Applied Grad-CAM and GradientShap for explainability, and evaluated with multiple metrics including IoU, Hausdorff distance, and precision-recall curves.

Result: Inception-ResNet V2 achieved state-of-the-art 99.53% testing accuracy with precision, recall, and F1-score ≥99.50%. The custom compact CNN achieved 96.49% accuracy while being 100x smaller than Inception-ResNet V2 and enabling real-time inference (375ms) on edge devices.

Conclusion: The study provides an end-to-end solution that balances accuracy, interpretability, and deployability, creating a framework suitable for both advanced and low-resource healthcare systems, enabling clinical screening and triage participation.

Abstract: Our study provides a full deep learning system for automated classification of brain tumors from MRI images, includes six benchmarked architectures (five ImageNet-pre-trained models (VGG-16, Inception V3, ResNet-50, Inception-ResNet V2, Xception) and a custom built, compact CNN (1.31M params)). The study moves the needle forward in a number of ways, including (1) full standardization of assessment with respect to preprocessing, training sets/protocols (optimizing networks with the AdamW optimizer, CosineAnnealingLR, patiene for early stopping = 7), and metrics to assess performance were identical along all models; (2) a high level of confidence in the localizations based on prior studies as both Grad-CAM and GradientShap explanation were used to establish anatomically important and meaningful attention regions and address the black-box issue; (3) a compact 1.31 million parameter CNN was developed that achieved 96.49% testing accuracy and was 100 times smaller than Inception-ResNet V2 while permitting real-time inference (375ms) on edge devices; (4) full evaluation beyond accuracy reporting based on measures of intersection over union, Hausdorff distance, and precision-recall curves, and confusion matrices across all splits. Inception-ResNet V2 reached state-of-the-art performance, achieving a 99.53% accuracy on testing and obtaining a precision, recall, and F1-score of at least 99.50% dominant performance based on metrics of recent studies. We demonstrated a lightweight model that is suitable to deploy on devices that do not have multi-GPU infrastructure in under-resourced settings. This end-to-end solution considers accuracy, interpretability, and deployability of trustworthy AI to create the framework necessary for performance assessment and deployment within advance and low-resource healthcare systems to an extent that enabled participation at the clinical screening and triage level.

Method: Dual-phase architecture based on CLIPSeg: (1) adaptive learning phase with semantic similarity-based adapter allocation and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, (2) knowledge consolidation phase with bi-directional Fisher-memory coordination. Uses semantic-driven adapter allocation, bi-modal LoRA adaptation, and bidirectional Fisher-memory coordination.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse medical datasets demonstrate superior forgetting mitigation and performance retention with minimal parameter overhead.

Conclusion: The framework is effective for continual learning in medical vision-language scenarios, enabling efficient learning of new tasks while preserving previous knowledge with minimal computational cost.

Abstract: Medical vision-language segmentation models suffer from catastrophic forgetting when adapting to new anatomical structures, requiring complete retraining that limits their clinical deployment. Although continual learning approaches have been studied for various applications, targeted research on continual learning approaches specifically designed for medical vision-language tasks remains underexplored. We propose MedPEFT-CL, a parameter-efficient continual learning framework that addresses both efficient learning of new tasks and preservation of previous knowledge through a dual-phase architecture based on CLIPSeg. Our dual-phase architecture features an adaptive learning phase that employs semantic similarity-based adapter allocation and parameter-efficient fine-tuning for medical tasks through prompt similarity analysis, and a knowledge consolidation phase employing bi-directional Fisher-memory coordination. This creates a reinforcing cycle: consolidation directs replay priorities while new tasks provide challenging samples that improve retention strategies. Our key contributions are: (1) a semantic-driven adapter allocation mechanism that enables efficient learning of new medical tasks, (2) a bi-modal LoRA adaptation that significantly reduces trainable parameters while maintaining cross-modal learning, and (3) bidirectional Fisher-memory coordination that prevents catastrophic forgetting from previous medical tasks. Extensive experiments across diverse medical datasets demonstrate superior forgetting mitigation and performance retention with minimal parameter overhead, making the framework effective for continual learning in medical vision-language scenarios.

*Weiyi Lv,Ning Zhang,Hanyang Sun,Haoran Jiang,Kai Zhao,Jing Xiao,Dan Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VMRMOT is a novel Vision-Motion-Reference aligned framework for Referring Multi-Object Tracking that addresses the limitation of static language references by incorporating motion modality extracted from object dynamics using MLLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RMOT benchmarks only use static language references that describe appearance, positions, and initial motion states, failing to capture dynamic motion changes. This causes temporal discrepancy between static references and dynamic vision, limiting multi-modal tracking performance.

Method: Integrates motion modality extracted from object dynamics using MLLMs' temporal-reasoning capabilities. Includes Vision-Motion-Reference Alignment module for hierarchical cross-modal alignment and Motion-Guided Prediction Head to enhance prediction using motion modality.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple RMOT benchmarks show that VMRMOT outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: VMRMOT successfully addresses the static reference limitation in RMOT by incorporating motion modality through MLLMs, achieving superior tracking performance through enhanced vision-motion-reference alignment.

Abstract: Referring Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT) extends conventional multi-object tracking (MOT) by introducing natural language references for multi-modal fusion tracking. RMOT benchmarks only describe the object's appearance, relative positions, and initial motion states. This so-called static regulation fails to capture dynamic changes of the object motion, including velocity changes and motion direction shifts. This limitation not only causes a temporal discrepancy between static references and dynamic vision modality but also constrains multi-modal tracking performance. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Vision-Motion-Reference aligned RMOT framework, named VMRMOT. It integrates a motion modality extracted from object dynamics to enhance the alignment between vision modality and language references through multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). Specifically, we introduce motion-aware descriptions derived from object dynamic behaviors and, leveraging the powerful temporal-reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, extract motion features as the motion modality. We further design a Vision-Motion-Reference Alignment (VMRA) module to hierarchically align visual queries with motion and reference cues, enhancing their cross-modal consistency. In addition, a Motion-Guided Prediction Head (MGPH) is developed to explore motion modality to enhance the performance of the prediction head. To the best of our knowledge, VMRMOT is the first approach to employ MLLMs in the RMOT task for vision-reference alignment. Extensive experiments on multiple RMOT benchmarks demonstrate that VMRMOT outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: This paper investigates how LLMs and LVLMs process numerical information in counting tasks using mechanistic interpretability methods, revealing layerwise numerical representation emergence and internal counter mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how large language and vision-language models represent and compute numerical information in counting tasks through controlled experiments and mechanistic analysis.

Method: Used controlled experiments with repeated items, causal mediation analysis, activation patching, and developed CountScope tool for mechanistic interpretability of numerical content.

Result: Found that individual tokens/visual features encode latent positional count information, layerwise progression of numerical representations, internal counter mechanism that updates with each item, and reliance on structural cues like separators.

Conclusion: Counting emerges as a structured, layerwise process in LLMs and follows the same pattern in LVLMs, shaped by vision encoder properties, with numerical information transferable across contexts.

Abstract: This paper examines how large language models (LLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs) represent and compute numerical information in counting tasks. We use controlled experiments with repeated textual and visual items and analyze model behavior through causal mediation and activation patching. To this end, we design a specialized tool, CountScope, for mechanistic interpretability of numerical content. Results show that individual tokens or visual features encode latent positional count information that can be extracted and transferred across contexts. Layerwise analyses reveal a progressive emergence of numerical representations, with lower layers encoding small counts and higher layers representing larger ones. We identify an internal counter mechanism that updates with each item, stored mainly in the final token or region and transferable between contexts. In LVLMs, numerical information also appears in visual embeddings, shifting between background and foreground regions depending on spatial composition. Models rely on structural cues such as separators in text, which act as shortcuts for tracking item counts and influence the accuracy of numerical predictions. Overall, counting emerges as a structured, layerwise process in LLMs and follows the same general pattern in LVLMs, shaped by the properties of the vision encoder.

*Saurav Sengupta,Nazanin Moradinasab,Jiebei Liu,Donald E. Brown*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs struggle with counting tasks due to inherent biases, especially with specific queries requiring focused attention on image regions. A synthetic benchmark and attention interventions were developed to analyze and improve counting performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Language Models often rely on training biases when answering visual property queries, particularly for counting tasks that require focused attention on specific image areas.

Method: Developed a synthetic benchmark dataset and evaluation framework to systematically test counting performance across varying image properties and prompt specificity. Used open-source VLMs and implemented attention-based interventions to modulate focus on visual tokens.

Result: VLM counting performance remains challenging under high visual or linguistic complexity, but certain attention interventions can lead to modest performance gains in counting tasks.

Conclusion: While VLMs face significant challenges in counting tasks, attention-based interventions show promise for improving performance by better directing model focus to relevant visual information.

Abstract: Recent research suggests that Vision Language Models (VLMs) often rely on inherent biases learned during training when responding to queries about visual properties of images. These biases are exacerbated when VLMs are asked highly specific questions that require them to focus on particular areas of the image in tasks such as counting. We build upon this research by developing a synthetic benchmark dataset and evaluation framework to systematically determine how counting performance varies as image and prompt properties change. Using open-source VLMs, we then analyze how attention allocation fluctuates with varying input parameters (e.g. number of objects in the image, objects color, background color, objects texture, background texture, and prompt specificity). We further implement attention-based interventions to modulate focus on visual tokens at different layers and evaluate their impact on counting performance across a range of visual conditions. Our experiments reveal that while VLM counting performance remains challenging, especially under high visual or linguistic complexity, certain attention interventions can lead to modest gains in counting performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AngioDG is a novel domain generalization method for coronary vessel segmentation in X-ray angiography that uses channel regularization to amplify domain-invariant features and attenuate domain-specific ones, achieving superior out-of-distribution performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally, and XCA is the gold standard for cardiac interventions. However, developing generalizable vessel segmentation models is challenging due to domain shifts from variations in imaging protocols and patient demographics, exacerbated by limited annotated datasets.

Method: Proposes AngioDG with channel regularization strategy that identifies contributions of early feature channels to task-specific metrics, then reweights channels to calibrate and amplify domain-invariant features while attenuating domain-specific ones.

Result: Evaluated on 6 x-ray angiography datasets for coronary vessel segmentation, achieving the best out-of-distribution performance among compared methods while maintaining consistent in-domain test performance.

Conclusion: AngioDG effectively bridges the gap in single-source domain generalization for coronary vessel segmentation by promoting generalization through interpretable channel regularization, outperforming existing augmentation-based methods.

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally, with X-ray Coronary Angiography (XCA) as the gold standard during real-time cardiac interventions. Segmentation of coronary vessels from XCA can facilitate downstream quantitative assessments, such as measurement of the stenosis severity and enhancing clinical decision-making. However, developing generalizable vessel segmentation models for XCA is challenging due to variations in imaging protocols and patient demographics that cause domain shifts. These limitations are exacerbated by the lack of annotated datasets, making Single-source Domain Generalization (SDG) a necessary solution for achieving generalization. Existing SDG methods are largely augmentation-based, which may not guarantee the mitigation of overfitting to augmented or synthetic domains. We propose a novel approach, ``AngioDG", to bridge this gap by channel regularization strategy to promote generalization. Our method identifies the contributions of early feature channels to task-specific metrics for DG, facilitating interpretability, and then reweights channels to calibrate and amplify domain-invariant features while attenuating domain-specific ones. We evaluate AngioDG on 6 x-ray angiography datasets for coronary vessels segmentation, achieving the best out-of-distribution performance among the compared methods, while maintaining consistent in-domain test performance.

TL;DR: VLMs show promise for stroke rehabilitation analysis but currently lack fine-grained motion understanding needed for precise quantification of rehabilitation dose and impairment from videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of vision-language models (VLMs) for automatic quantification of rehabilitation dose and impairment from videos in stroke rehabilitation, addressing fundamental challenges in data-driven healthcare applications.

Method: Formulated rehabilitation analysis as motion-identification tasks using VLMs, evaluated on cohort of 29 healthy controls and 51 stroke survivors with optimized prompting and post-processing, without task-specific training or finetuning.

Result: Current VLMs lack fine-grained motion understanding: dose estimates comparable to baseline without visual information, impairment scores unreliable. However, VLMs can classify high-level activities from few frames, detect motion/grasp with moderate accuracy, and approximate dose counts within 25% of ground truth for mildly impaired and healthy participants.

Conclusion: Results highlight both current limitations and emerging opportunities of VLMs for data-driven stroke rehabilitation and broader clinical video analysis, suggesting future promise with improved motion understanding capabilities.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of computer-vision tasks, sparking interest in their potential for digital health applications. Here, we apply VLMs to two fundamental challenges in data-driven stroke rehabilitation: automatic quantification of rehabilitation dose and impairment from videos. We formulate these problems as motion-identification tasks, which can be addressed using VLMs. We evaluate our proposed framework on a cohort of 29 healthy controls and 51 stroke survivors. Our results show that current VLMs lack the fine-grained motion understanding required for precise quantification: dose estimates are comparable to a baseline that excludes visual information, and impairment scores cannot be reliably predicted. Nevertheless, several findings suggest future promise. With optimized prompting and post-processing, VLMs can classify high-level activities from a few frames, detect motion and grasp with moderate accuracy, and approximate dose counts within 25% of ground truth for mildly impaired and healthy participants, all without task-specific training or finetuning. These results highlight both the current limitations and emerging opportunities of VLMs for data-driven stroke rehabilitation and broader clinical video analysis.

TL;DR: VisReason is a large-scale dataset for visual Chain-of-Thought reasoning, comprising 489K annotated examples across four domains with multi-round human-like rationales, plus a 165K expert-curated subset (VisReason-Pro) with enhanced reasoning traces and 3D spatial grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual-CoT resources are limited - small, domain-specific, and lack human-like stepwise structure needed for compositional visual reasoning in multimodal LLMs.

Method: Created VisReason dataset with 489K examples across four domains featuring multi-round rationales, and VisReason-Pro subset with expert-level annotations, depth-informed 3D spatial grounding, and detailed reasoning traces.

Result: Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL on VisReason and VisReason-Pro yields substantial improvements in step-by-step visual reasoning accuracy, interpretability, and cross-benchmark generalization.

Conclusion: VisReason equips MLLMs with more systematic and generalizable reasoning capabilities, serving as a cornerstone for cultivating human-like visual reasoning in next-generation multimodal intelligence.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has proven remarkably effective for eliciting complex reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Yet, its potential in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remains largely untapped, hindered by the absence of large-scale datasets that capture the rich, spatially grounded reasoning intrinsic to visual understanding. Existing visual-CoT resources are typically small, domain-specific, or lack the human-like stepwise structure necessary for compositional visual reasoning. In this paper, we introduce VisReason, a large-scale dataset designed to advance visual Chain-of-Thought reasoning. VisReason comprises 489K annotated examples spanning four diverse domains, each featuring multi-round, human-like rationales that guide MLLMs through interpretable visual reasoning steps. Building upon this, we curate VisReason-Pro, a 165K subset produced with a stronger expert-level GPT annotator, enriched with detailed reasoning traces and 3D spatial grounding via depth-informed annotations. Fine-tuning the state-of-the-art Qwen2.5-VL model on VisReason and VisReason-Pro yields substantial improvements in step-by-step visual reasoning accuracy, interpretability, and cross-benchmark generalization. These results demonstrate that VisReason equips MLLMs with more systematic and generalizable reasoning capabilities. We envision VisReason as a cornerstone for cultivating human-like visual reasoning, paving the way toward the next generation of multimodal intelligence.

*Samuel Stevens,Jacob Beattie,Tanya Berger-Wolf,Yu Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sparse autoencoders enable open-ended feature discovery from foundation model representations, allowing identification of unknown patterns in scientific data without pre-specified targets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientific archives contain vast datasets that could reveal undiscovered patterns, but existing methods only extract structure for pre-specified targets, limiting open-ended discovery.

Method: Use sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to decompose foundation model representations and evaluate feature alignment with semantic concepts on segmentation benchmarks, comparing against label-free alternatives.

Result: SAEs successfully surface fine-grained anatomical structure in ecological imagery without segmentation labels and outperform strong label-free alternatives on concept-alignment metrics.

Conclusion: Sparse decomposition provides a practical tool for exploring what scientific foundation models have learned, enabling the transition from confirmation to genuine discovery across domains.

Abstract: Scientific archives now contain hundreds of petabytes of data across genomics, ecology, climate, and molecular biology that could reveal undiscovered patterns if systematically analyzed at scale. Large-scale, weakly-supervised datasets in language and vision have driven the development of foundation models whose internal representations encode structure (patterns, co-occurrences and statistical regularities) beyond their training objectives. Most existing methods extract structure only for pre-specified targets; they excel at confirmation but do not support open-ended discovery of unknown patterns. We ask whether sparse autoencoders (SAEs) can enable open-ended feature discovery from foundation model representations. We evaluate this question in controlled rediscovery studies, where the learned SAE features are tested for alignment with semantic concepts on a standard segmentation benchmark and compared against strong label-free alternatives on concept-alignment metrics. Applied to ecological imagery, the same procedure surfaces fine-grained anatomical structure without access to segmentation or part labels, providing a scientific case study with ground-truth validation. While our experiments focus on vision with an ecology case study, the method is domain-agnostic and applicable to models in other sciences (e.g., proteins, genomics, weather). Our results indicate that sparse decomposition provides a practical instrument for exploring what scientific foundation models have learned, an important prerequisite for moving from confirmation to genuine discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing adoption of photorealistic 3D facial avatars introduces risks of online identity theft, especially in biometric authentication systems, creating a need for robust identity protection in dynamic 3D avatars.

Method: AEGIS applies adversarial perturbations to Gaussian color coefficients guided by a pre-trained face verification network, ensuring consistent protection across multiple viewpoints without retraining or modifying avatar geometry.

Result: AEGIS achieves complete de-identification (0% face retrieval and verification accuracy) while maintaining high perceptual quality (SSIM = 0.9555, PSNR = 35.52 dB) and preserving key facial attributes like age, race, gender, and emotion.

Conclusion: AEGIS demonstrates strong privacy protection with minimal visual distortion, providing effective identity masking for 3D Gaussian Avatars while preserving their perceptual realism and functional characteristics.

Abstract: The growing adoption of photorealistic 3D facial avatars, particularly those utilizing efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting representations, introduces new risks of online identity theft, especially in systems that rely on biometric authentication. While effective adversarial masking methods have been developed for 2D images, a significant gap remains in achieving robust, viewpoint-consistent identity protection for dynamic 3D avatars. To address this, we present AEGIS, the first privacy-preserving identity masking framework for 3D Gaussian Avatars that maintains the subject's perceived characteristics. Our method aims to conceal identity-related facial features while preserving the avatar's perceptual realism and functional integrity. AEGIS applies adversarial perturbations to the Gaussian color coefficients, guided by a pre-trained face verification network, ensuring consistent protection across multiple viewpoints without retraining or modifying the avatar's geometry. AEGIS achieves complete de-identification, reducing face retrieval and verification accuracy to 0%, while maintaining high perceptual quality (SSIM = 0.9555, PSNR = 35.52 dB). It also preserves key facial attributes such as age, race, gender, and emotion, demonstrating strong privacy protection with minimal visual distortion.

*Zhimin Shao,Abhay Yadav,Rama Chellappa,Cheng Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPIDER is a universal feature matching framework that combines 2D and 3D correspondence estimation to handle challenging cross-domain image matching with large viewpoint changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 2D feature matching struggles with large appearance, scale, and viewpoint variations across domains like aerial, indoor, and outdoor scenes. Recent 3D foundation models provide spatial coherence but focus on dominant planar regions while missing fine-grained geometric details.

Method: SPIDER integrates a shared feature extraction backbone with two specialized network heads for estimating both 2D-based and 3D-based correspondences from coarse to fine. The approach builds on insights from linear probe experiments evaluating various vision foundation models.

Result: SPIDER significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on an image-matching benchmark focused on unconstrained scenarios with large baselines.

Conclusion: SPIDER demonstrates strong performance as a universal image-matching method by effectively combining 2D and 3D correspondence estimation to handle challenging cross-domain matching scenarios.

Abstract: Reliable image correspondences form the foundation of vision-based spatial perception, enabling recovery of 3D structure and camera poses. However, unconstrained feature matching across domains such as aerial, indoor, and outdoor scenes remains challenging due to large variations in appearance, scale and viewpoint. Feature matching has been conventionally formulated as a 2D-to-2D problem; however, recent 3D foundation models provides spatial feature matching properties based on two-view geometry. While powerful, we observe that these spatially coherent matches often concentrate on dominant planar regions, e.g., walls or ground surfaces, while being less sensitive to fine-grained geometric details, particularly under large viewpoint changes. To better understand these trade-offs, we first perform linear probe experiments to evaluate the performance of various vision foundation models for image matching. Building on these insights, we introduce SPIDER, a universal feature matching framework that integrates a shared feature extraction backbone with two specialized network heads for estimating both 2D-based and 3D-based correspondences from coarse to fine. Finally, we introduce an image-matching evaluation benchmark that focuses on unconstrained scenarios with large baselines. SPIDER significantly outperforms SoTA methods, demonstrating its strong ability as a universal image-matching method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CORA is a semi-supervised reasoning segmentation framework that achieves robust performance with minimal labeled data by using conditional visual instructions, pseudo-label filtering, and contrastive alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal language models for reasoning segmentation have limited generalization due to the high cost of curating diverse pixel annotations with rich linguistic supervision, leading to brittle performance under distribution shift.

Method: CORA introduces three components: 1) conditional visual instructions encoding spatial and contextual relationships, 2) noisy pseudo-label filter based on MLLM output consistency across equivalent queries, and 3) token-level contrastive alignment between labeled and pseudo-labeled samples.

Result: CORA achieves state-of-the-art results with minimal supervision: +2.3% improvement with only 100 labeled images on Cityscapes, and +2.4% improvement with only 180 labeled images on PanNuke.

Conclusion: CORA enables robust reasoning segmentation with minimal supervision, outperforming existing baselines under constrained annotation settings across different domains.

Abstract: Reasoning segmentation seeks pixel-accurate masks for targets referenced by complex, often implicit instructions, requiring context-dependent reasoning over the scene. Recent multimodal language models have advanced instruction following segmentation, yet generalization remains limited. The key bottleneck is the high cost of curating diverse, high-quality pixel annotations paired with rich linguistic supervision leading to brittle performance under distribution shift. Therefore, we present CORA, a semi-supervised reasoning segmentation framework that jointly learns from limited labeled data and a large corpus of unlabeled images. CORA introduces three main components: 1) conditional visual instructions that encode spatial and contextual relationships between objects; 2) a noisy pseudo-label filter based on the consistency of Multimodal LLM's outputs across semantically equivalent queries; and 3) a token-level contrastive alignment between labeled and pseudo-labeled samples to enhance feature consistency. These components enable CORA to perform robust reasoning segmentation with minimal supervision, outperforming existing baselines under constrained annotation settings. CORA achieves state-of-the-art results, requiring as few as 100 labeled images on Cityscapes, a benchmark dataset for urban scene understanding, surpassing the baseline by $+2.3\%$. Similarly, CORA improves performance by $+2.4\%$ with only 180 labeled images on PanNuke, a histopathology dataset.

### [29] [Latent Dirichlet Transformer VAE for Hyperspectral Unmixing with Bundled Endmembers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17757)
*Giancarlo Giannetti,Faisal Z. Qureshi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LDVAE-T is a transformer-based variational autoencoder with Dirichlet prior for hyperspectral unmixing, treating materials as bundled endmembers with structured covariance to capture spectral variability while enforcing physical constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spectral mixing in hyperspectral images obscures pure material signatures, making accurate material identification challenging. Existing methods often rely on fixed ground truth spectra and don't adequately capture intrinsic material variability.

Method: Combines transformer architecture for global context modeling with Dirichlet prior in latent space to enforce sum-to-one and non-negativity constraints. Uses bundled endmembers with mean spectrum and structured covariance per patch, mixed with Dirichlet-distributed abundances from transformer encoder.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art models on Samson, Jasper Ridge, and HYDICE Urban datasets in both abundance estimation (RMSE) and endmember extraction (spectral angle distance).

Conclusion: LDVAE-T effectively addresses hyperspectral unmixing by combining transformer capabilities with physically meaningful constraints, enabling better representation of material variability while maintaining interpretability.

Abstract: Hyperspectral images capture rich spectral information that enables per-pixel material identification; however, spectral mixing often obscures pure material signatures. To address this challenge, we propose the Latent Dirichlet Transformer Variational Autoencoder (LDVAE-T) for hyperspectral unmixing. Our model combines the global context modeling capabilities of transformer architectures with physically meaningful constraints imposed by a Dirichlet prior in the latent space. This prior naturally enforces the sum-to-one and non-negativity conditions essential for abundance estimation, thereby improving the quality of predicted mixing ratios. A key contribution of LDVAE-T is its treatment of materials as bundled endmembers, rather than relying on fixed ground truth spectra. In the proposed method our decoder predicts, for each endmember and each patch, a mean spectrum together with a structured (segmentwise) covariance that captures correlated spectral variability. Reconstructions are formed by mixing these learned bundles with Dirichlet-distributed abundances garnered from a transformer encoder, allowing the model to represent intrinsic material variability while preserving physical interpretability. We evaluate our approach on three benchmark datasets, Samson, Jasper Ridge, and HYDICE Urban and show that LDVAE-T consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in abundance estimation and endmember extraction, as measured by root mean squared error and spectral angle distance, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViTs significantly outperform CNNs (95.11% vs 87.02% accuracy) in detecting AI-generated satellite images, with better robustness due to their ability to model long-range dependencies and global structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid advancement of generative models poses threats to satellite imagery authenticity, which is crucial for scientific and security domains. While deepfake detection has been studied for faces, satellite imagery presents unique challenges like terrain-level inconsistencies.

Method: Comprehensive comparison between CNNs and Vision Transformers using over 130,000 labeled RGB images from DM-AER and FSI datasets. Used architecture-specific interpretability methods (Grad-CAM for CNNs, Chefer's attention attribution for ViTs) to enhance transparency.

Result: ViTs achieved 95.11% accuracy vs 87.02% for CNNs, demonstrating superior performance in detecting structural inconsistencies and repetitive textural patterns in synthetic imagery. ViTs showed better overall robustness.

Conclusion: Vision Transformers are more effective than CNNs for detecting AI-generated satellite images due to their ability to capture global semantic structures and long-range dependencies. Future work will extend to multispectral/SAR modalities and frequency-domain analysis.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models such as StyleGAN2 and Stable Diffusion poses a growing threat to the authenticity of satellite imagery, which is increasingly vital for reliable analysis and decision-making across scientific and security domains. While deepfake detection has been extensively studied in facial contexts, satellite imagery presents distinct challenges, including terrain-level inconsistencies and structural artifacts. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive comparison between Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) for detecting AI-generated satellite images. Using a curated dataset of over 130,000 labeled RGB images from the DM-AER and FSI datasets, we show that ViTs significantly outperform CNNs in both accuracy (95.11 percent vs. 87.02 percent) and overall robustness, owing to their ability to model long-range dependencies and global semantic structures. We further enhance model transparency using architecture-specific interpretability methods, including Grad-CAM for CNNs and Chefer's attention attribution for ViTs, revealing distinct detection behaviors and validating model trustworthiness. Our results highlight the ViT's superior performance in detecting structural inconsistencies and repetitive textural patterns characteristic of synthetic imagery. Future work will extend this research to multispectral and SAR modalities and integrate frequency-domain analysis to further strengthen detection capabilities and safeguard satellite imagery integrity in high-stakes applications.

Conclusion: Current world models have significant limitations for robotic planning, but targeted fine-tuning on appropriate datasets can substantially improve path planning capabilities.

Abstract: While recent world models generate highly realistic videos, their ability to perform robot path planning remains unclear and unquantified. We introduce Target-Bench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate world models on mapless path planning toward semantic targets in real-world environments. Target-Bench provides 450 robot-collected video sequences spanning 45 semantic categories with SLAM-based ground truth trajectories. Our evaluation pipeline recovers camera motion from generated videos and measures planning performance using five complementary metrics that quantify target-reaching capability, trajectory accuracy, and directional consistency. We evaluate state-of-the-art models including Sora 2, Veo 3.1, and the Wan series. The best off-the-shelf model (Wan2.2-Flash) achieves only 0.299 overall score, revealing significant limitations in current world models for robotic planning tasks. We show that fine-tuning an open-source 5B-parameter model on only 325 scenarios from our dataset achieves 0.345 overall score -- an improvement of more than 400% over its base version (0.066) and 15% higher than the best off-the-shelf model. We will open-source the code and dataset.

TL;DR: AGE-VLM is a novel framework that reduces object hallucination in efficient VLMs by using interleaved cross-attention layers and spatial knowledge from SAM to improve visual grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current concatenation-based VLMs often fail to distinguish between matching and non-matching image-text pairs, leading to object hallucination issues.

Method: Introduces interleaved cross-attention layers to enhance visual grounding and leverages spatial knowledge from Segment Anything Model (SAM) to enforce correct attention to image regions.

Result: Significantly reduces hallucination and performs better or comparable to prior work on efficient VLMs across vision-centric benchmarks.

Conclusion: The approach provides valuable insights for achieving enhanced visual and linguistic understanding in VLMs and addresses key limitations of current efficient VLM architectures.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) rely on effective multimodal alignment between pre-trained vision encoders and Large Language Models (LLMs) to integrate visual and textual information. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of attention patterns in efficient VLMs, revealing that concatenation-based architectures frequently fail to distinguish between semantically matching and non-matching image-text pairs. This is a key factor for object hallucination in these models. To address this, we introduce Attention-Guided Efficient Vision-Language Models (AGE-VLM), a novel framework that enhances visual grounding through interleaved cross-attention layers to instill vision capabilities in pretrained small language models. This enforces in VLM the ability "look" at the correct image regions by leveraging spatial knowledge distilled from the Segment Anything Model (SAM), significantly reducing hallucination. We validate our approach across different vision-centric benchmarks where our method is better or comparable to prior work on efficient VLMs. Our findings provide valuable insights for future research aimed at achieving enhanced visual and linguistic understanding in VLMs.

TL;DR: Pillar-0 is a radiology foundation model that processes volumetric CT/MRI scans with high fidelity, outperforming existing medical AI models across multiple imaging domains and clinical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing medical foundation models that process volumetric scans as 2D slices, discard grayscale contrast information, and lack clinically relevant evaluation frameworks.

Method: Pretrained on 42,990 abdomen-pelvis CTs, 86,411 chest CTs, 14,348 head CTs, and 11,543 breast MRIs using RATE framework for automated labeling of 366 radiologic findings with LLMs.

Result: Achieved mean AUROCs of 86.4-90.1 across different CT/MRI domains, outperforming competitors by 7.8-15.8 AUROC points. Ranked best in 87.2% of tasks and showed strong generalization in external validation.

Conclusion: Pillar-0 and RATE provide an open, clinically rigorous foundation for high-performance radiology systems, enabling previously infeasible applications by overcoming computational, data, and evaluation constraints.

Abstract: Radiology plays an integral role in modern medicine, yet rising imaging volumes have far outpaced workforce growth. Foundation models offer a path toward assisting with the full spectrum of radiology tasks, but existing medical models remain limited: they process volumetric CT and MRI as low-fidelity 2D slices, discard critical grayscale contrast information, and lack evaluation frameworks that reflect real clinical practice. We introduce Pillar-0, a radiology foundation model pretrained on 42,990 abdomen-pelvis CTs, 86,411 chest CTs, 14,348 head CTs, and 11,543 breast MRIs from a large academic center, together with RATE, a scalable framework that extracts structured labels for 366 radiologic findings with near-perfect accuracy using LLMs. Across internal test sets of 14,230 abdomen-pelvis CTs, 10,646 chest CTs, 4,906 head CTs, and 1,585 breast MRIs, Pillar-0 establishes a new performance frontier, achieving mean AUROCs of 86.4, 88.0, 90.1, and 82.9, outperforming MedGemma (Google), MedImageInsight (Microsoft), Lingshu (Alibaba), and Merlin (Stanford) by 7.8-15.8 AUROC points and ranking best in 87.2\% (319/366) tasks. Pillar-0 similarly outperforms all baselines in an external validation on the Stanford Abdominal CT dataset, including Merlin (82.2 vs 80.6 AUROC). Pillar-0 extends to tasks beyond its pretraining, such as long-horizon lung cancer risk prediction, where it improves upon the state-of-the-art Sybil by 3.0 C-index points on NLST, and generalizes with gains of 5.9 (MGH) and 1.9 (CGMH). In brain hemorrhage detection, Pillar-0 obtained a >95 AUROC when using only 1/20th of the data of the next most sample efficient baseline. Pillar-0 and RATE together provide an open, clinically rigorous foundation for building high-performance radiology systems, enabling applications that were previously infeasible due to computational, data, and evaluation constraints.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PL-Stitch is a self-supervised learning framework that uses temporal order as supervisory signal for procedural videos, achieving significant improvements in surgical and cooking activity recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SSL methods overlook the procedural nature of activities like cooking and surgery, failing to capture temporal order dependencies in video sequences.

Method: Proposes PL-Stitch with two probabilistic objectives: primary PL objective for chronological frame sorting to learn global workflow, and secondary spatio-temporal jigsaw loss for fine-grained cross-frame correlations.

Result: Consistently superior performance across five surgical and cooking benchmarks, with +11.4 pp k-NN accuracy on Cholec80 and +5.7 pp linear probing accuracy on Breakfast dataset.

Conclusion: PL-Stitch effectively learns procedural video representations by leveraging temporal order as supervisory signal, demonstrating strong performance in surgical phase recognition and cooking action segmentation.

Abstract: Procedural activities, ranging from routine cooking to complex surgical operations, are highly structured as a set of actions conducted in a specific temporal order. Despite their success on static images and short clips, current self-supervised learning methods often overlook the procedural nature that underpins such activities. We expose the lack of procedural awareness in current SSL methods with a motivating experiment: models pretrained on forward and time-reversed sequences produce highly similar features, confirming that their representations are blind to the underlying procedural order. To address this shortcoming, we propose PL-Stitch, a self-supervised framework that harnesses the inherent temporal order of video frames as a powerful supervisory signal. Our approach integrates two novel probabilistic objectives based on the Plackett-Luce (PL) model. The primary PL objective trains the model to sort sampled frames chronologically, compelling it to learn the global workflow progression. The secondary objective, a spatio-temporal jigsaw loss, complements the learning by capturing fine-grained, cross-frame object correlations. Our approach consistently achieves superior performance across five surgical and cooking benchmarks. Specifically, PL-Stitch yields significant gains in surgical phase recognition (e.g., +11.4 pp k-NN accuracy on Cholec80) and cooking action segmentation (e.g., +5.7 pp linear probing accuracy on Breakfast), demonstrating its effectiveness for procedural video representation learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: REXO is a multi-view radar object detection method that uses 3D bounding box diffusion for explicit cross-view feature association, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on indoor radar datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-view radar perception methods rely on implicit cross-view feature association, leading to ambiguous feature matches and degraded detection in complex indoor scenes.

Method: REXO lifts 2D bounding box diffusion into 3D radar space, using noisy 3D bounding boxes to guide explicit cross-view radar feature association and leveraging ground contact prior to reduce diffusion parameters.

Result: REXO achieves +4.22 AP improvement on HIBER dataset and +11.02 AP improvement on MMVR dataset compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed explicit cross-view feature association through 3D bounding box diffusion significantly enhances multi-view radar object detection performance in indoor environments.

Abstract: Multi-view indoor radar perception has drawn attention due to its cost-effectiveness and low privacy risks. Existing methods often rely on {implicit} cross-view radar feature association, such as proposal pairing in RFMask or query-to-feature cross-attention in RETR, which can lead to ambiguous feature matches and degraded detection in complex indoor scenes. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{REXO} (multi-view Radar object dEtection with 3D bounding boX diffusiOn), which lifts the 2D bounding box (BBox) diffusion process of DiffusionDet into the 3D radar space. REXO utilizes these noisy 3D BBoxes to guide an {explicit} cross-view radar feature association, enhancing the cross-view radar-conditioned denoising process. By accounting for prior knowledge that the person is in contact with the ground, REXO reduces the number of diffusion parameters by determining them from this prior. Evaluated on two open indoor radar datasets, our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods by a margin of +4.22 AP on the HIBER dataset and +11.02 AP on the MMVR dataset.

TL;DR: Proposes an importance-weighted non-IID sampling framework for flow-matching models that jointly draws multiple samples to cover diverse regions while maintaining unbiased estimation via learned importance weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Estimating expectations of functions from flow-matching models is challenging under limited sampling budgets, as independent sampling often yields high-variance estimates, especially when rare but high-impact outcomes dominate the expectation.

Method: Introduces an importance-weighted non-IID sampling framework with score-based regularization for diversity, using the score function to push samples apart within high-density regions. Also develops a method for importance weighting of non-IID flow samples by learning a residual velocity field.

Result: Empirically produces diverse, high-quality samples and accurate estimates of both importance weights and expectations.

Conclusion: Advances the reliable characterization of flow-matching model outputs by enabling more efficient and accurate expectation estimation through non-IID sampling with proper importance weighting.

Abstract: Flow-matching models effectively represent complex distributions, yet estimating expectations of functions of their outputs remains challenging under limited sampling budgets. Independent sampling often yields high-variance estimates, especially when rare but with high-impact outcomes dominate the expectation. We propose an importance-weighted non-IID sampling framework that jointly draws multiple samples to cover diverse, salient regions of a flow's distribution while maintaining unbiased estimation via estimated importance weights. To balance diversity and quality, we introduce a score-based regularization for the diversity mechanism, which uses the score function, i.e., the gradient of the log probability, to ensure samples are pushed apart within high-density regions of the data manifold, mitigating off-manifold drift. We further develop the first approach for importance weighting of non-IID flow samples by learning a residual velocity field that reproduces the marginal distribution of the non-IID samples. Empirically, our method produces diverse, high-quality samples and accurate estimates of both importance weights and expectations, advancing the reliable characterization of flow-matching model outputs. Our code will be publicly available on GitHub.

TL;DR: QAL is a new loss function that replaces Chamfer Distance and Earth Mover's Distance in 3D volumetric learning, explicitly decoupling recall and precision with tunable components to improve coverage of thin structures and underrepresented regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing training objectives like Chamfer Distance and Earth Mover's Distance fail to balance recall and precision in 3D vision tasks, leading to poor coverage of thin structures and underrepresented regions.

Method: Quality-Aware Loss (QAL) combines a coverage-weighted nearest-neighbor term with an uncovered-ground-truth attraction term, explicitly decoupling recall and precision into tunable components as a drop-in replacement for CD/EMD.

Result: QAL achieves consistent coverage gains averaging +4.3 pts over CD and +2.8 pts over best alternatives, reliably recovering thin structures and underrepresented regions. It also yields higher grasp scores in robotic manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: QAL offers a principled, interpretable, and practical objective for robust 3D vision and safety-critical robotics pipelines, with improved coverage translating directly into more reliable robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Volumetric learning underpins many 3D vision tasks such as completion, reconstruction, and mesh generation, yet training objectives still rely on Chamfer Distance (CD) or Earth Mover's Distance (EMD), which fail to balance recall and precision. We propose Quality-Aware Loss (QAL), a drop-in replacement for CD/EMD that combines a coverage-weighted nearest-neighbor term with an uncovered-ground-truth attraction term, explicitly decoupling recall and precision into tunable components.
  Across diverse pipelines, QAL achieves consistent coverage gains, improving by an average of +4.3 pts over CD and +2.8 pts over the best alternatives. Though modest in percentage, these improvements reliably recover thin structures and under-represented regions that CD/EMD overlook. Extensive ablations confirm stable performance across hyperparameters and across output resolutions, while full retraining on PCN and ShapeNet demonstrates generalization across datasets and backbones. Moreover, QAL-trained completions yield higher grasp scores under GraspNet evaluation, showing that improved coverage translates directly into more reliable robotic manipulation.
  QAL thus offers a principled, interpretable, and practical objective for robust 3D vision and safety-critical robotics pipelines

Abstract: Foundation models hold promise for specialized medical imaging tasks, though their effectiveness in breast imaging remains underexplored.

TL;DR: ShowMe is a unified framework that combines image manipulation and video prediction using video diffusion models, achieving superior performance in both tasks through selective activation of spatial and temporal components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior works treat text-guided image manipulation and video prediction as separate tasks, leading to limitations: image methods ignore temporal dynamics while video models overlook intended outcomes.

Method: Proposes ShowMe framework that selectively activates spatial and temporal components of video diffusion models, with structure and motion consistency rewards for improved fidelity and coherence.

Result: Outperforms expert models in both instructional image and video generation across diverse benchmarks, demonstrating dual benefits from unified approach.

Conclusion: Video diffusion models serve as effective unified action-object state transformers, with spatial knowledge from video pretraining enhancing image edits and instruction-guided manipulation improving video prediction.

Abstract: Generating visual instructions in a given context is essential for developing interactive world simulators. While prior works address this problem through either text-guided image manipulation or video prediction, these tasks are typically treated in isolation. This separation reveals a fundamental issue: image manipulation methods overlook how actions unfold over time, while video prediction models often ignore the intended outcomes. To this end, we propose ShowMe, a unified framework that enables both tasks by selectively activating the spatial and temporal components of video diffusion models. In addition, we introduce structure and motion consistency rewards to improve structural fidelity and temporal coherence. Notably, this unification brings dual benefits: the spatial knowledge gained through video pretraining enhances contextual consistency and realism in non-rigid image edits, while the instruction-guided manipulation stage equips the model with stronger goal-oriented reasoning for video prediction. Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms expert models in both instructional image and video generation, highlighting the strength of video diffusion models as a unified action-object state transformer.

TL;DR: JigsawComm is a semantic-aware cooperative perception framework that maximizes perception accuracy under limited bandwidth by transmitting only essential, non-redundant features using utility-based selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome bandwidth limitations in multi-agent cooperative perception by focusing on transmitting semantically relevant data rather than compressing or heuristically selecting messages, addressing cross-agent redundancy.

Method: End-to-end trained framework with regularized encoder for sparse semantic features, Feature Utility Estimator to predict feature contributions, and optimal transmission policy that selects highest-utility features per location.

Result: Achieves up to >500x data volume reduction while matching or exceeding state-of-the-art accuracy on OPV2V and DAIR-V2X benchmarks, with scalable O(1) communication cost.

Conclusion: JigsawComm demonstrates that semantic-aware feature selection is more effective than compression for bandwidth-efficient cooperative perception, enabling practical multi-agent systems with minimal communication overhead.

Abstract: Multi-agent cooperative perception (CP) promises to overcome the inherent occlusion and sensing-range limitations of single-agent systems (e.g., autonomous driving). However, its practicality is severely constrained by the limited communication bandwidth. Existing approaches attempt to improve bandwidth efficiency via compression or heuristic message selection, without considering the semantic relevance or cross-agent redundancy of sensory data. We argue that a practical CP system must maximize the contribution of every transmitted bit to the final perception task, by extracting and transmitting semantically essential and non-redundant data. In this paper, we formulate a joint semantic feature encoding and transmission problem, which aims to maximize CP accuracy under limited bandwidth. To solve this problem, we introduce JigsawComm, an end-to-end trained, semantic-aware, and communication-efficient CP framework that learns to ``assemble the puzzle'' of multi-agent feature transmission. It uses a regularized encoder to extract semantically-relevant and sparse features, and a lightweight Feature Utility Estimator to predict the contribution of each agent's features to the final perception task. The resulting meta utility maps are exchanged among agents and leveraged to compute a provably optimal transmission policy, which selects features from agents with the highest utility score for each location. This policy inherently eliminates redundancy and achieves a scalable $\mathcal{O}(1)$ communication cost as the number of agents increases. On the benchmarks OPV2V and DAIR-V2X, JigsawComm reduces the total data volume by up to $>$500$\times$ while achieving matching or superior accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: Fine-tuning large-scale text-to-video models for camera parameter controls typically requires vast, high-fidelity datasets that are difficult to acquire.

Method: Proposed a data-efficient fine-tuning strategy that learns camera parameter controls from sparse, low-quality synthetic data rather than photorealistic real data.

Result: Fine-tuning on simple synthetic data not only enables desired camera controls but yields superior results compared to models fine-tuned on photorealistic real data.

Conclusion: Provides a framework justifying why sparse, low-quality synthetic data outperforms real data for learning camera parameter controls in text-to-video diffusion models.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large-scale text-to-video diffusion models to add new generative controls, such as those over physical camera parameters (e.g., shutter speed or aperture), typically requires vast, high-fidelity datasets that are difficult to acquire. In this work, we propose a data-efficient fine-tuning strategy that learns these controls from sparse, low-quality synthetic data. We show that not only does fine-tuning on such simple data enable the desired controls, it actually yields superior results to models fine-tuned on photorealistic "real" data. Beyond demonstrating these results, we provide a framework that justifies this phenomenon both intuitively and quantitatively.

Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (DocVQA) requires models to jointly understand textual semantics, spatial layout, and visual features. Current methods struggle with explicit spatial relationship modeling, inefficiency with high-resolution documents, multi-hop reasoning, and limited interpretability. We propose MGA-VQA, a multi-modal framework that integrates token-level encoding, spatial graph reasoning, memory-augmented inference, and question-guided compression. Unlike prior black-box models, MGA-VQA introduces interpretable graph-based decision pathways and structured memory access for enhanced reasoning transparency.

*Jiong Lin,Jinchen Ruan,Hod Lipson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ArticFlow is a two-stage flow matching framework for generating articulated 3D shapes under explicit action control, enabling both generative modeling and neural simulation of diverse articulated mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Articulated 3D generation remains challenging due to action-dependent deformations and limited datasets, while current generative models focus mainly on static 3D shapes.

Method: Two-stage flow matching framework with (i) latent flow that transports noise to shape-prior code and (ii) point flow that transports points conditioned on action and shape prior, enabling single model to represent diverse articulated categories.

Result: ArticFlow achieves higher kinematic accuracy and better shape quality compared to object-specific simulators and action-conditioned static point-cloud generators on MuJoCo Menagerie dataset.

Conclusion: Action-conditioned flow matching is a practical route to controllable and high-quality articulated mechanism generation.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have produced strong results for static 3D shapes, whereas articulated 3D generation remains challenging due to action-dependent deformations and limited datasets. We introduce ArticFlow, a two-stage flow matching framework that learns a controllable velocity field from noise to target point sets under explicit action control. ArticFlow couples (i) a latent flow that transports noise to a shape-prior code and (ii) a point flow that transports points conditioned on the action and the shape prior, enabling a single model to represent diverse articulated categories and generalize across actions. On MuJoCo Menagerie, ArticFlow functions both as a generative model and as a neural simulator: it predicts action-conditioned kinematics from a compact prior and synthesizes novel morphologies via latent interpolation. Compared with object-specific simulators and an action-conditioned variant of static point-cloud generators, ArticFlow achieves higher kinematic accuracy and better shape quality. Results show that action-conditioned flow matching is a practical route to controllable and high-quality articulated mechanism generation.

*Guoyang Xia,Yifeng Ding,Fengfa Li,Lei Ren,Wei Chen,Fangxiang Feng,Xiaojie Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastMMoE is a training-free acceleration framework for MoE-based MLLMs that reduces FLOPs by up to 55% while maintaining ~95.5% performance through expert activation reduction and routing-aware token pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution visual inputs in MLLMs create long visual token sequences and substantial inference latency, making token reduction critical for deployment in resource-constrained or latency-sensitive scenarios.

Method: Combines two strategies: (1) expert activation reduction for visual tokens to minimize unnecessary expert computation, and (2) routing-aware token pruning using similarity in routing probability distributions to identify and remove redundant visual tokens.

Result: Reduces FLOPs by up to 55.0% while retaining approximately 95.5% of original performance, outperforming dense-model pruning baselines like FastV and SparseVLM across multiple retention rates.

Conclusion: FastMMoE effectively accelerates MoE-based MLLMs without retraining, demonstrating superior performance over existing dense-model pruning methods while maintaining high accuracy.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive performance, but high-resolution visual inputs result in long sequences of visual tokens and substantial inference latency. Reducing redundant visual tokens is critical to ease computational/memory burdens while preserving performance, enabling MLLM deployment in resource-constrained or latency-sensitive scenarios. Current visual token pruning methods mainly rely on attention-based redundancy analysis and are tailored to dense architectures. We propose Fast Multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (FastMMoE), a training-free acceleration framework for mixture-of-experts (MoE) based MLLMs, developed from a routing analysis perspective. FastMMoE combines two complementary strategies: (i) expert activation reduction for visual tokens to minimize unnecessary expert computation; and (ii) routing-aware token pruning that leverages similarity in routing probability distributions to identify and remove highly redundant visual tokens. Experiments on large-scale MoE-MLLMs such as DeepSeek-VL2 and InternVL3.5 demonstrate that FastMMoE can reduce FLOPs by up to 55.0% while retaining approximately 95.5% of the original performance, consistently outperforming dense-model pruning baselines including FastV and SparseVLM across multiple retention rates.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Systematic study of knowledge distillation for CLIP-style VLMs reveals that stronger teachers don't always yield better students, challenging conventional KD assumptions in multimodal domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models have high computational demands, and while knowledge distillation works well in language and vision domains, its application to CLIP-style models remains limited with narrow evaluations.

Method: Conducted systematic study of distillation across various CLIP-style teacher models, from standard baselines to large-scale state-of-the-art models.

Result: Contrary to NLP and vision trends, stronger teachers don't consistently produce better students; existing distillation frameworks often fail to scale and degrade performance in downstream multimodal tasks like VQA.

Conclusion: Findings challenge prevailing KD assumptions and point toward new directions for designing parameter-efficient multimodal models.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success across multimodal tasks, yet their substantial computational demands hinder efficient deployment. Knowledge distillation (KD) has emerged as a powerful approach for building lightweight but competitive models, with strong evidence from both language and vision domains. However, its application to VLMs, particularly CLIP-style models, remains limited, often constrained to small-scale teachers and narrow evaluation tasks such as classification or retrieval. In this work, we present the first systematic study of distillation across a range of CLIP-style teacher models, ranging from standard baselines to large-scale state-of-the-art models. Contrary to trends observed in NLP and vision, we find that stronger teachers do not consistently yield better students; in fact, existing distillation frameworks often fail to scale, leading to degraded performance in downstream multimodal tasks such as visual question answering. Our findings challenge prevailing assumptions in KD and point toward new directions for designing parameter-efficient multimodal models.

*Seulgi Jeong,Jaeil Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MINDiff introduces negative attention to suppress subject influence in irrelevant regions during inference, enabling better semantic control and text alignment without retraining DreamBooth models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address overfitting in personalized text-to-image models like DreamBooth, which use computationally expensive class-specific prior-preservation loss during training and limit user control during inference.

Method: Modifies cross-attention mechanism during inference using negative attention concept to suppress subject's influence in masked irrelevant regions, with adjustable scale parameter for balancing subject fidelity and text alignment.

Result: Qualitative and quantitative experiments show MINDiff mitigates overfitting more effectively than class-specific prior-preservation loss, improving text alignment while maintaining subject fidelity.

Conclusion: MINDiff provides an inference-time solution that can be directly applied to existing DreamBooth models without retraining, offering better control over subject fidelity and text alignment through negative attention.

Abstract: In the personalization process of large-scale text-to-image models, overfitting often occurs when learning specific subject from a limited number of images. Existing methods, such as DreamBooth, mitigate this issue through a class-specific prior-preservation loss, which requires increased computational cost during training and limits user control during inference time. To address these limitations, we propose Mask-Integrated Negative Attention Diffusion (MINDiff). MINDiff introduces a novel concept, negative attention, which suppresses the subject's influence in masked irrelevant regions. We achieve this by modifying the cross-attention mechanism during inference. This enables semantic control and improves text alignment by reducing subject dominance in irrelevant regions. Additionally, during the inference time, users can adjust a scale parameter lambda to balance subject fidelity and text alignment. Our qualitative and quantitative experiments on DreamBooth models demonstrate that MINDiff mitigates overfitting more effectively than class-specific prior-preservation loss. As our method operates entirely at inference time and does not alter the model architecture, it can be directly applied to existing DreamBooth models without re-training.

*Wenyuan Li,Guang Li,Keisuke Maeda,Takahiro Ogawa,Miki Haseyama*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAVDD is a pretraining-based decoupled audio-visual distillation framework that addresses cross-modal alignment challenges in dataset distillation by disentangling features into common and private representations using pretrained encoders and lightweight decouplers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional Distribution Matching methods struggle with cross-modal alignment in audio-visual dataset distillation, and existing approaches face challenges with inconsistent modality mapping spaces and damage to modality-specific information during direct cross-modal interactions.

Method: DAVDD uses a diverse pretrained bank for stable modality features, lightweight decouplers to disentangle features into common and private representations, Common Intermodal Matching, and Sample-Distribution Joint Alignment to preserve cross-modal structure while isolating private representations.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that DAVDD achieves state-of-the-art results under all IPC (images per class) settings, demonstrating superior performance in audio-visual dataset distillation.

Conclusion: The proposed decoupled representation learning approach effectively addresses cross-modal alignment challenges and preserves modality-specific information, enabling high-quality audio-visual dataset distillation with improved performance.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Dataset Distillation aims to compress large-scale datasets into compact subsets while preserving the performance of the original data. However, conventional Distribution Matching (DM) methods struggle to capture intrinsic cross-modal alignment. Subsequent studies have attempted to introduce cross-modal matching, but two major challenges remain: (i) independently and randomly initialized encoders lead to inconsistent modality mapping spaces, increasing training difficulty; and (ii) direct interactions between modalities tend to damage modality-specific (private) information, thereby degrading the quality of the distilled data. To address these challenges, we propose DAVDD, a pretraining-based decoupled audio-visual distillation framework. DAVDD leverages a diverse pretrained bank to obtain stable modality features and uses a lightweight decoupler bank to disentangle them into common and private representations. To effectively preserve cross-modal structure, we further introduce Common Intermodal Matching together with a Sample-Distribution Joint Alignment strategy, ensuring that shared representations are aligned both at the sample level and the global distribution level. Meanwhile, private representations are entirely isolated from cross-modal interaction, safeguarding modality-specific cues throughout distillation. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that DAVDD achieves state-of-the-art results under all IPC settings, demonstrating the effectiveness of decoupled representation learning for high-quality audio-visual dataset distillation. Code will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CUS-GS bridges the gap between semantics-oriented and structure-oriented 3D scene representations by connecting multimodal semantic features with structured 3D geometry using a compact unified Gaussian Splatting framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing approaches where semantics-oriented methods lack explicit 3D geometry modeling and structure-oriented methods provide limited semantic abstraction.

Method: Uses a voxelized anchor structure with multimodal semantic features from foundation models (CLIP, DINOv2, SEEM), multimodal latent feature allocation to unify appearance/geometry/semantics, and feature-aware significance evaluation for dynamic anchor management.

Result: Achieves competitive performance with only 6M parameters - an order of magnitude smaller than the closest competitor (35M), demonstrating excellent performance-efficiency trade-off.

Conclusion: CUS-GS successfully bridges the semantic-structure gap in 3D scene representation while maintaining high efficiency and compactness.

Abstract: Recent advances in Gaussian Splatting based 3D scene representation have shown two major trends: semantics-oriented approaches that focus on high-level understanding but lack explicit 3D geometry modeling, and structure-oriented approaches that capture spatial structures yet provide limited semantic abstraction. To bridge this gap, we present CUS-GS, a compact unified structured Gaussian Splatting representation, which connects multimodal semantic features with structured 3D geometry. Specifically, we design a voxelized anchor structure that constructs a spatial scaffold, while extracting multimodal semantic features from a set of foundation models (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2, SEEM). Moreover, we introduce a multimodal latent feature allocation mechanism to unify appearance, geometry, and semantics across heterogeneous feature spaces, ensuring a consistent representation across multiple foundation models. Finally, we propose a feature-aware significance evaluation strategy to dynamically guide anchor growing and pruning, effectively removing redundant or invalid anchors while maintaining semantic integrity. Extensive experiments show that CUS-GS achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods using as few as 6M parameters - an order of magnitude smaller than the closest rival at 35M - highlighting the excellent trade off between performance and model efficiency of the proposed framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dataset distillation methods focus on balanced datasets and struggle with real-world long-tailed distributions, leading to performance degradation in tail classes.

Method: Proposed ADSA (Adaptive Soft-label Alignment) module that identifies and calibrates soft-label biases from distillation models and distilled images through systematic perturbation of data imbalance levels.

Result: On ImageNet-1k-LT with EDC and IPC=50, ADSA improves tail-class accuracy by up to 11.8% and raises overall accuracy to 41.4%. Consistently improves performance across various distillation techniques.

Conclusion: ADSA provides a robust and generalizable solution for long-tailed dataset distillation that integrates seamlessly into existing pipelines and performs well under limited label budgets.

Abstract: Dataset distillation compresses large-scale datasets into compact, highly informative synthetic data, significantly reducing storage and training costs. However, existing research primarily focuses on balanced datasets and struggles to perform under real-world long-tailed distributions. In this work, we emphasize the critical role of soft labels in long-tailed dataset distillation and uncover the underlying mechanisms contributing to performance degradation. Specifically, we derive an imbalance-aware generalization bound for model trained on distilled dataset. We then identify two primary sources of soft-label bias, which originate from the distillation model and the distilled images, through systematic perturbation of the data imbalance levels. To address this, we propose ADSA, an Adaptive Soft-label Alignment module that calibrates the entangled biases. This lightweight module integrates seamlessly into existing distillation pipelines and consistently improves performance. On ImageNet-1k-LT with EDC and IPC=50, ADSA improves tail-class accuracy by up to 11.8% and raises overall accuracy to 41.4%. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ADSA provides a robust and generalizable solution under limited label budgets and across a range of distillation techniques.

*Youngsik Yun,Dongjun Gu,Youngjung Uh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FASR improves 3D Gaussian Splatting's generalization in few-shot scenarios by using frequency-adaptive sharpness regularization to prevent overfitting while preserving high-frequency details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting lacks generalization across novel viewpoints in few-shot scenarios due to overfitting to sparse observations, which is framed as a machine learning generalization problem.

Method: Proposes Frequency-Adaptive Sharpness Regularization (FASR) that adapts regularization weight and neighborhood radius based on local image frequency, preventing excessive smoothing while reducing sharpness.

Result: Consistently improves various baselines across datasets, prevents floater artifacts in novel viewpoints, and reconstructs fine details that standard SAM oversmooths.

Conclusion: FASR effectively addresses the generalization problem in 3DGS by frequency-aware sharpness regularization, achieving better novel view synthesis in few-shot scenarios.

Abstract: Despite 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) excelling in most configurations, it lacks generalization across novel viewpoints in a few-shot scenario because it overfits to the sparse observations. We revisit 3DGS optimization from a machine learning perspective, framing novel view synthesis as a generalization problem to unseen viewpoints-an underexplored direction. We propose Frequency-Adaptive Sharpness Regularization (FASR), which reformulates the 3DGS training objective, thereby guiding 3DGS to converge toward a better generalization solution. Although Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) similarly reduces the sharpness of the loss landscape to improve generalization of classification models, directly employing it to 3DGS is suboptimal due to the discrepancy between the tasks. Specifically, it hinders reconstructing high-frequency details due to excessive regularization, while reducing its strength leads to under-penalizing sharpness. To address this, we reflect the local frequency of images to set the regularization weight and the neighborhood radius when estimating the local sharpness. It prevents floater artifacts in novel viewpoints and reconstructs fine details that SAM tends to oversmooth. Across datasets with various configurations, our method consistently improves a wide range of baselines. Code will be available at https://bbangsik13.github.io/FASR.

TL;DR: PA-FAS enhances multimodal face anti-spoofing by constructing extended reasoning sequences and using answer-shuffling to improve reasoning paths and prevent shortcut learning, achieving better accuracy and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL approaches for multimodal FAS face limitations in reasoning paths and suffer from shortcut learning due to mismatched supervision, restricting their effectiveness in leveraging complementary modalities.

Method: Proposes PA-FAS with two key components: constructing high-quality extended reasoning sequences from limited annotations, and an answer-shuffling mechanism during supervised fine-tuning to force comprehensive multimodal analysis.

Result: PA-FAS significantly improves multimodal reasoning accuracy and cross-domain generalization, and better unifies multimodal fusion, generalization, and interpretability for trustworthy FAS.

Conclusion: The proposed PA-FAS framework effectively addresses limitations in multimodal FAS reasoning by enriching reasoning paths and preventing shortcut learning, leading to improved performance across multiple aspects of face anti-spoofing.

Abstract: Face anti-spoofing (FAS) has recently advanced in multimodal fusion, cross-domain generalization, and interpretability. With large language models and reinforcement learning (RL), strategy-based training offers new opportunities to jointly model these aspects. However, multimodal reasoning is more complex than unimodal reasoning, requiring accurate feature representation and cross-modal verification while facing scarce, high-quality annotations, which makes direct application of RL sub-optimal. We identify two key limitations of supervised fine-tuning plus RL (SFT+RL) for multimodal FAS: (1) limited multimodal reasoning paths restrict the use of complementary modalities and shrink the exploration space after SFT, weakening the effect of RL; and (2) mismatched single-task supervision versus diverse reasoning paths causes reasoning confusion, where models may exploit shortcuts by mapping images directly to answers and ignoring the intended reasoning. To address this, we propose PA-FAS, which enhances reasoning paths by constructing high-quality extended reasoning sequences from limited annotations, enriching paths and relaxing exploration constraints. We further introduce an answer-shuffling mechanism during SFT to force comprehensive multimodal analysis instead of using superficial cues, thereby encouraging deeper reasoning and mitigating shortcut learning. PA-FAS significantly improves multimodal reasoning accuracy and cross-domain generalization, and better unifies multimodal fusion, generalization, and interpretability for trustworthy FAS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional TAD methods struggle with long-span action detection due to lack of global awareness and inefficient detection heads. State-space models face decay of temporal context and self-element conflict during global visual context modeling.

Method: Proposes MambaTAD with: 1) Diagonal-Masked Bidirectional State-Space module for global feature fusion, 2) Global feature fusion head with multi-granularity features, 3) End-to-end one-stage approach using state-space temporal adapter with linear complexity.

Result: Achieves superior TAD performance consistently across multiple public benchmarks with reduced parameters and computation cost.

Conclusion: MambaTAD effectively addresses long-range modeling challenges in temporal action detection through novel state-space designs and demonstrates strong performance on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Temporal Action Detection (TAD) aims to identify and localize actions by determining their starting and ending frames within untrimmed videos. Recent Structured State-Space Models such as Mamba have demonstrated potential in TAD due to their long-range modeling capability and linear computational complexity. On the other hand, structured state-space models often face two key challenges in TAD, namely, decay of temporal context due to recursive processing and self-element conflict during global visual context modeling, which become more severe while handling long-span action instances. Additionally, traditional methods for TAD struggle with detecting long-span action instances due to a lack of global awareness and inefficient detection heads. This paper presents MambaTAD, a new state-space TAD model that introduces long-range modeling and global feature detection capabilities for accurate temporal action detection. MambaTAD comprises two novel designs that complement each other with superior TAD performance. First, it introduces a Diagonal-Masked Bidirectional State-Space (DMBSS) module which effectively facilitates global feature fusion and temporal action detection. Second, it introduces a global feature fusion head that refines the detection progressively with multi-granularity features and global awareness. In addition, MambaTAD tackles TAD in an end-to-end one-stage manner using a new state-space temporal adapter(SSTA) which reduces network parameters and computation cost with linear complexity. Extensive experiments show that MambaTAD achieves superior TAD performance consistently across multiple public benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing change detection methods require expert-designed specialized decoders for different tasks, introducing uncertainty in model selection and limiting architecture universality, especially for abrupt changes like disasters.

Method: Uses state space model backbone with frequency change prompt generator as unified encoder, integrating high/low frequency information. Unified decoder and prediction head create shared representation space through hierarchical feature interaction and task-adaptive output mapping.

Result: Achieves leading performance on five datasets including LEVIR-CD (binary change), SECOND (semantic change), and xBD (building damage assessment), adapting to multiple change detection tasks.

Conclusion: UniRSCD provides a unified architecture that accommodates different output granularity requirements across various change detection tasks, demonstrating strong adaptability and performance.

Abstract: In recent years, remote sensing change detection has garnered significant attention due to its critical role in resource monitoring and disaster assessment. Change detection tasks exist with different output granularities such as BCD, SCD, and BDA. However, existing methods require substantial expert knowledge to design specialized decoders that compensate for information loss during encoding across different tasks. This not only introduces uncertainty into the process of selecting optimal models for abrupt change scenarios (such as disaster outbreaks) but also limits the universality of these architectures. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a unified, general change detection framework named UniRSCD. Building upon a state space model backbone, we introduce a frequency change prompt generator as a unified encoder. The encoder dynamically scans bitemporal global context information while integrating high-frequency details with low-frequency holistic information, thereby eliminating the need for specialized decoders for feature compensation. Subsequently, the unified decoder and prediction head establish a shared representation space through hierarchical feature interaction and task-adaptive output mapping. This integrating various tasks such as binary change detection and semantic change detection into a unified architecture, thereby accommodating the differing output granularity requirements of distinct change detection tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed architecture can adapt to multiple change detection tasks and achieves leading performance on five datasets, including the binary change dataset LEVIR-CD, the semantic change dataset SECOND, and the building damage assessment dataset xBD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of synthesizing novel views from sparse inputs by treating it as video completion through space, filling both spatial gaps and temporal continuity.

Method: Uses pretrained video diffusion models to hallucinate plausible in-between views with uncertainty-aware mechanism, then employs 3D Gaussian Splatting for scene reconstruction with iterative feedback between 3D geometry and 2D view synthesis.

Result: Significantly outperforms strong 3D-GS baselines on LLFF, DTU, DL3DV, and MipNeRF-360 datasets under extreme sparsity conditions.

Conclusion: The framework successfully generates coherent, high-fidelity renderings from sparse inputs without any scene-specific training or fine-tuning, demonstrating effective zero-shot novel view synthesis.

Abstract: Given just a few glimpses of a scene, can you imagine the movie playing out as the camera glides through it? That's the lens we take on \emph{sparse-input novel view synthesis}, not only as filling spatial gaps between widely spaced views, but also as \emph{completing a natural video} unfolding through space.
  We recast the task as \emph{test-time natural video completion}, using powerful priors from \emph{pretrained video diffusion models} to hallucinate plausible in-between views. Our \emph{zero-shot, generation-guided} framework produces pseudo views at novel camera poses, modulated by an \emph{uncertainty-aware mechanism} for spatial coherence. These synthesized frames densify supervision for \emph{3D Gaussian Splatting} (3D-GS) for scene reconstruction, especially in under-observed regions. An iterative feedback loop lets 3D geometry and 2D view synthesis inform each other, improving both the scene reconstruction and the generated views.
  The result is coherent, high-fidelity renderings from sparse inputs \emph{without any scene-specific training or fine-tuning}. On LLFF, DTU, DL3DV, and MipNeRF-360, our method significantly outperforms strong 3D-GS baselines under extreme sparsity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In dense V2X scenarios, frequent identity switching hinders cross-view association, multi-source information creates redundant interactions, and traditional vehicle-centric encoding leads to repetitive feature encoding that degrades real-time performance.

Method: Proposes three key modules: 1) Multi-source identity matching and correction using multi-view spatiotemporal relationships, 2) Traffic signal-guided interaction encoding traffic light changes to filter key vehicles, 3) Local spatiotemporal coordinate encoding for reusable historical features supporting parallel decoding.

Result: Extensive experiments on V2X-Seq and V2X-Traj datasets show significant improvements over SOTA methods, with enhanced robustness and inference efficiency across diverse traffic densities.

Conclusion: V2X-RECT effectively addresses challenges in dense traffic prediction by improving data association consistency, reducing redundant interactions, and enabling efficient feature reuse, making it suitable for real-time V2X applications.

Abstract: V2X prediction can alleviate perception incompleteness caused by limited line of sight through fusing trajectory data from infrastructure and vehicles, which is crucial to traffic safety and efficiency. However, in dense traffic scenarios, frequent identity switching of targets hinders cross-view association and fusion. Meanwhile, multi-source information tends to generate redundant interactions during the encoding stage, and traditional vehicle-centric encoding leads to large amounts of repetitive historical trajectory feature encoding, degrading real-time inference performance. To address these challenges, we propose V2X-RECT, a trajectory prediction framework designed for high-density environments. It enhances data association consistency, reduces redundant interactions, and reuses historical information to enable more efficient and accurate prediction. Specifically, we design a multi-source identity matching and correction module that leverages multi-view spatiotemporal relationships to achieve stable and consistent target association, mitigating the adverse effects of mismatches on trajectory encoding and cross-view feature fusion. Then we introduce traffic signal-guided interaction module, encoding trend of traffic light changes as features and exploiting their role in constraining spatiotemporal passage rights to accurately filter key interacting vehicles, while capturing the dynamic impact of signal changes on interaction patterns. Furthermore, a local spatiotemporal coordinate encoding enables reusable features of historical trajectories and map, supporting parallel decoding and significantly improving inference efficiency. Extensive experimental results across V2X-Seq and V2X-Traj datasets demonstrate that our V2X-RECT achieves significant improvements compared to SOTA methods, while also enhancing robustness and inference efficiency across diverse traffic densities.

Conclusion: Establishes a new paradigm for scientific video comprehension and education through self-evolving reasoning mechanisms and multimodal content generation.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and video agent systems have significantly improved general video understanding. However, when applied to scientific video understanding and educating, a domain that demands external professional knowledge integration and rigorous step-wise reasoning, existing approaches often struggle. To bridge this gap, we propose SciEducator, the first iterative self-evolving multi-agent system for scientific video comprehension and education. Rooted in the classical Deming Cycle from management science, our design reformulates its Plan-Do-Study-Act philosophy into a self-evolving reasoning and feedback mechanism, which facilitates the interpretation of intricate scientific activities in videos. Moreover, SciEducator can produce multimodal educational content tailored to specific scientific processes, including textual instructions, visual guides, audio narrations, and interactive references. To support evaluation, we construct SciVBench, a benchmark consisting of 500 expert-verified and literature-grounded science QA pairs across five categories, covering physical, chemical, and everyday phenomena. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SciEducator substantially outperforms leading closed-source MLLMs (e.g., Gemini, GPT-4o) and state-of-the-art video agents on the benchmark, establishing a new paradigm for the community.

*Kaibin Wang,Mingbao Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: T3S is a training-free inference wrapper that enables efficient long video processing in MLLMs by generating multiple diverse video subsequences, packing them in one forward pass, and aggregating predictions, reducing computational cost while improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for processing long videos with MLLMs face computational challenges due to quadratic self-attention scaling, with existing solutions compromising accuracy, requiring additional training, or reducing inference speed.

Method: T3S generates multiple short and diverse video token subsequences at inference time, packs them within a single forward pass, and aggregates their predictions to exploit spatiotemporal redundancy and reduce computational costs.

Result: Experiments show T3S improves accuracy by up to 3.1% and reduces first token delay by 2.04x on long video understanding benchmarks, with minimal integration effort and no model modifications required.

Conclusion: T3S effectively turns video redundancy into a computational advantage, providing a scalable, plug-and-play solution for efficient long-video understanding that works with various pretrained MLLMs without fine-tuning.

Abstract: Processing long videos with multimodal large language models (MLLMs) poses a significant computational challenge, as the model's self-attention mechanism scales quadratically with the number of video tokens, resulting in high computational demand and slow inference speed. Current solutions, such as rule-based sub-sampling, learned frame selector, or memory-based summarization, often introduce their own trade-offs: they compromise accuracy, necessitate additional training, or decrease inference speed. In this paper, we propose Test-Time Temporal Sampling (T3S), a training-free, plug-and-play inference wrapper that enables MLLMs to process long videos both efficiently and effectively. T3S exploits spatiotemporal redundancy by generating multiple short and diverse subsequences of video tokens at inference time, packing them within a single forward pass, and aggregating their predictions. This multi-subsequence formulation broadens visual coverage while reducing the computational cost of self-attention from $O(L^2)$ to $O(\sum_{i=1}^m α_i^2L^2)$, where $\sum_{i=1}^m α_i^2 < 1$. Extensive experiments on long video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that T3S improves accuracy by up to 3.1% and reduces first token delay by $2.04\times$, all with minimal integration effort. Our approach operates entirely at inference time, requires no model modifications or fine-tuning, and is compatible with a wide range of pretrained MLLMs. T3S turns video redundancy into a computational advantage, offering a scalable solution for long-video understanding.

*Liangyang Ouyang,Yifei Huang,Mingfang Zhang,Caixin Kang,Ryosuke Furuta,Yoichi Sato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a multimodal multi-speaker attention alignment method that improves MLLMs' social reasoning by aligning visual and textual tokens with speakers in multi-party conversations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs show inconsistent gains on social tasks due to lack of speaker-consistent alignment between visual and textual tokens in multi-speaker scenes.

Method: Dynamic cross-modal head selection to identify grounding heads, plus adaptive social-aware attention bias computed from attention patterns and speaker locations, injected into attention mechanism without trainable parameters.

Result: Improves three MLLMs (LLaVA-NeXT-Video, Qwen2.5-VL, InternVL3) on three benchmarks (TVQA+, MMSI, OnlineMMSI), achieving state-of-the-art results across four social tasks.

Conclusion: The method successfully focuses models on speaker-relevant regions, enabling more robust multi-party social reasoning without architectural changes.

Abstract: Understanding social interaction in video requires reasoning over a dynamic interplay of verbal and non-verbal cues: who is speaking, to whom, and with what gaze or gestures. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are natural candidates, simply adding visual inputs yields surprisingly inconsistent gains on social tasks. Our quantitative analysis of cross-modal attention inside state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals a core failure mode: in multi-speaker scenes, visual and textual tokens lack speaker-consistent alignment, exhibiting substantially weaker cross-modal attention than in object-centric images. To address this, we propose a multimodal multi-speaker attention alignment method that can be integrated into existing MLLMs. First, we introduce dynamic cross-modal head selection to identify attention heads most responsible for grounding. Then, an adaptive social-aware attention bias, computed from existing attention patterns and speaker locations, is injected into the attention mechanism. This bias reinforces alignment between a speaker's visual representation and their utterances without introducing trainable parameters or architectural changes. We integrate our method into three distinct MLLMs (LLaVA-NeXT-Video, Qwen2.5-VL, and InternVL3) and evaluate on three benchmarks (TVQA+, MMSI, OnlineMMSI). Across four social tasks, results demonstrate that our approach improves the ability of MLLMs and achieves state-of-the-art results. Attention visualizations confirm our method successfully focuses the model on speaker-relevant regions, enabling more robust multi-party social reasoning. Our implementation and model will be available at https://github.com/ut-vision/SocialInteraction.

Motivation: Growing demands for clinical data privacy and storage constraints require adapting models to unseen target domains without accessing source data or target labels, which existing SFUDA methods struggle with.

Method: Proposes HEAL framework integrating hierarchical denoising, edge-guided selection, size-aware fusion, and learning-free characteristics to adapt models without source data or target supervision.

Result: Large-scale cross-modality experiments show HEAL outperforms existing SFUDA approaches and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: HEAL provides an effective solution for SFUDA challenges, demonstrating superior performance in adapting models across domains without accessing source data or target labels.

Abstract: Growing demands for clinical data privacy and storage constraints have spurred advances in Source Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SFUDA). SFUDA addresses the domain shift by adapting models from the source domain to the unseen target domain without accessing source data, even when target-domain labels are unavailable. However, SFUDA faces significant challenges: the absence of source domain data and label supervision in the target domain due to source free and unsupervised settings. To address these issues, we propose HEAL, a novel SFUDA framework that integrates Hierarchical denoising, Edge-guided selection, size-Aware fusion, and Learning-free characteristic. Large-scale cross-modality experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing SFUDA approaches, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

Conclusion: The work lays a cornerstone for advancing toward foundation LMM for visual quality assessment.

Abstract: Developing a robust visual quality assessment (VQualA) large multi-modal model (LMM) requires achieving versatility, powerfulness, and transferability.
  However, existing VQualA LMMs typically focus on a single task and rely on full-parameter fine-tuning, which makes them prone to overfitting on specific modalities or task types, thereby limiting their generalization capacity and transferability. To address this, we propose a vision-encoder-centered generative pre-training pipeline and develop the VITAL-Series LMMs. (1) We adopt a machine-executed annotation-scrutiny paradigm, constructing over 4.5M vision-language (VL) pairs-the largest VQualA training dataset to date. (2) We employ a multi-task training workflow that simultaneously enhances the model's quantitative scoring precision and strengthens its capability for quality interpretation across both image and video modalities. (3) Building upon the vision encoder, we realize an efficient model zoo extension: the model zoo exhibits strong zero-shot performance, and each paired decoder requires only a swift warm-up using less than 1/1000 of the pre-training data to achieve performance comparable to the fully trained counterpart. Overall, our work lays a cornerstone for advancing toward the foundation LMM for VQualA.

Conclusion: The proposed X-ReID framework effectively addresses modality gaps and leverages spatiotemporal information in video sequences, establishing new state-of-the-art performance for Video-based Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification.

Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have recently achieved remarkable performance in retrieval tasks, yet their potential for Video-based Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification (VVI-ReID) remains largely unexplored. The primary challenges are narrowing the modality gap and leveraging spatiotemporal information in video sequences. To address the above issues, in this paper, we propose a novel cross-modality feature learning framework named X-ReID for VVI-ReID. Specifically, we first propose a Cross-modality Prototype Collaboration (CPC) to align and integrate features from different modalities, guiding the network to reduce the modality discrepancy. Then, a Multi-granularity Information Interaction (MII) is designed, incorporating short-term interactions from adjacent frames, long-term cross-frame information fusion, and cross-modality feature alignment to enhance temporal modeling and further reduce modality gaps. Finally, by integrating multi-granularity information, a robust sequence-level representation is achieved. Extensive experiments on two large-scale VVI-ReID benchmarks (i.e., HITSZ-VCM and BUPTCampus) demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-modal ReID methods focus on feature fusion but neglect background interference and suffer from multi-modal consistency alignment problems.

Method: Uses Selective Interaction Module to select important patch tokens, Global Alignment Module to align multi-modal features via 3D polyhedra volume minimization, and Local Alignment Module for shift-aware local feature alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments on RGBNT201, RGBNT100, and MSVR310 benchmarks demonstrate effectiveness in extracting discriminative features for object ReID.

Conclusion: The proposed Signal framework successfully addresses background interference and multi-modal consistency issues, achieving improved performance in multi-modal object ReID tasks.

Abstract: Multi-modal object Re-IDentification (ReID) is devoted to retrieving specific objects through the exploitation of complementary multi-modal image information. Existing methods mainly concentrate on the fusion of multi-modal features, yet neglecting the background interference. Besides, current multi-modal fusion methods often focus on aligning modality pairs but suffer from multi-modal consistency alignment. To address these issues, we propose a novel selective interaction and global-local alignment framework called Signal for multi-modal object ReID. Specifically, we first propose a Selective Interaction Module (SIM) to select important patch tokens with intra-modal and inter-modal information. These important patch tokens engage in the interaction with class tokens, thereby yielding more discriminative features. Then, we propose a Global Alignment Module (GAM) to simultaneously align multi-modal features by minimizing the volume of 3D polyhedra in the gramian space. Meanwhile, we propose a Local Alignment Module (LAM) to align local features in a shift-aware manner. With these modules, our proposed framework could extract more discriminative features for object ReID. Extensive experiments on three multi-modal object ReID benchmarks (i.e., RGBNT201, RGBNT100, MSVR310) validate the effectiveness of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RGBT trackers struggle with modality discrepancies that hinder effective cross-modal information fusion, reducing tracking accuracy in all-weather conditions.

Method: Proposes three key components: Mamba-based Feature Interaction for efficient cross-modal interaction, Contextual Aggregation Module with Mixture-of-Experts for dynamic layer activation, and Deformable Alignment Module for spatial alignment and temporal propagation.

Result: Extensive experiments on five RGBT tracking benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in achieving robust and accurate tracking in complex scenarios.

Conclusion: CADTrack provides a comprehensive solution for RGBT tracking by addressing modality discrepancies through efficient feature interaction, contextual aggregation, and deformable alignment, achieving superior performance across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: RGB-Thermal (RGBT) tracking aims to exploit visible and thermal infrared modalities for robust all-weather object tracking. However, existing RGBT trackers struggle to resolve modality discrepancies, which poses great challenges for robust feature representation. This limitation hinders effective cross-modal information propagation and fusion, which significantly reduces the tracking accuracy. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Contextual Aggregation with Deformable Alignment framework called CADTrack for RGBT Tracking. To be specific, we first deploy the Mamba-based Feature Interaction (MFI) that establishes efficient feature interaction via state space models. This interaction module can operate with linear complexity, reducing computational cost and improving feature discrimination. Then, we propose the Contextual Aggregation Module (CAM) that dynamically activates backbone layers through sparse gating based on the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). This module can encode complementary contextual information from cross-layer features. Finally, we propose the Deformable Alignment Module (DAM) to integrate deformable sampling and temporal propagation, mitigating spatial misalignment and localization drift. With the above components, our CADTrack achieves robust and accurate tracking in complex scenarios. Extensive experiments on five RGBT tracking benchmarks verify the effectiveness of our proposed method. The source code is released at https://github.com/IdolLab/CADTrack.

TL;DR: APR introduces adversarial pseudo-replay to address catastrophic forgetting in exemplar-free class-incremental learning by perturbing new task images to create pseudo-replay samples without storing old data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EFCIL faces the plasticity-stability dilemma where learning new tasks causes forgetting of old knowledge, especially challenging without access to previous task images due to storage/privacy constraints.

Method: APR uses adversarial attacks on new task images with old class mean prototypes as targets to create pseudo-replay images, then applies knowledge distillation and covariance matrix calibration to prevent semantic drift.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging cold-start settings of standard EFCIL benchmarks, effectively reconciling stability and plasticity.

Conclusion: APR successfully addresses catastrophic forgetting in EFCIL through adversarial pseudo-replay and covariance calibration, enabling effective knowledge retention without storing exemplars.

Abstract: Exemplar-free class-incremental learning (EFCIL) aims to retain old knowledge acquired in the previous task while learning new classes, without storing the previous images due to storage constraints or privacy concerns. In EFCIL, the plasticity-stability dilemma, learning new tasks versus catastrophic forgetting, is a significant challenge, primarily due to the unavailability of images from earlier tasks. In this paper, we introduce adversarial pseudo-replay (APR), a method that perturbs the images of the new task with adversarial attack, to synthesize the pseudo-replay images online without storing any replay samples. During the new task training, the adversarial attack is conducted on the new task images with augmented old class mean prototypes as targets, and the resulting images are used for knowledge distillation to prevent semantic drift. Moreover, we calibrate the covariance matrices to compensate for the semantic drift after each task, by learning a transfer matrix on the pseudo-replay samples. Our method reconciles stability and plasticity, achieving state-of-the-art on challenging cold-start settings of the standard EFCIL benchmarks.

Motivation: To address the challenge of effectively adapting large pretrained diffusion models to new tasks by understanding and leveraging the underlying frequency energy mechanism that governs the denoising process.

Method: Proposes FeRA framework with three components: frequency energy indicator for latent bandwise energy distribution, soft frequency router that fuses multiple frequency-specific adapter experts, and frequency energy consistency regularization for stable optimization.

Result: FeRA integrates seamlessly with adapter-based tuning schemes, generalizes well across diffusion backbones and resolutions, and provides stable and coherent adaptation across frequency bands.

Conclusion: FeRA offers a simple, stable, and compatible paradigm for effective diffusion model adaptation by aligning the adaptation process with the intrinsic frequency energy mechanism of diffusion models.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generative modeling, yet how to effectively adapt large pretrained models to new tasks remains challenging. We revisit the reconstruction behavior of diffusion models during denoising to unveil the underlying frequency energy mechanism governing this process. Building upon this observation, we propose FeRA, a frequency driven fine tuning framework that aligns parameter updates with the intrinsic frequency energy progression of diffusion. FeRA establishes a comprehensive frequency energy framework for effective diffusion adaptation fine tuning, comprising three synergistic components: (i) a compact frequency energy indicator that characterizes the latent bandwise energy distribution, (ii) a soft frequency router that adaptively fuses multiple frequency specific adapter experts, and (iii) a frequency energy consistency regularization that stabilizes diffusion optimization and ensures coherent adaptation across bands. Routing operates in both training and inference, with inference time routing dynamically determined by the latent frequency energy. It integrates seamlessly with adapter based tuning schemes and generalizes well across diffusion backbones and resolutions. By aligning adaptation with the frequency energy mechanism, FeRA provides a simple, stable, and compatible paradigm for effective and robust diffusion model adaptation.

Motivation: Diffusion Transformers struggle with high-level semantic reasoning and long-horizon planning, leading to visual hallucinations and mis-alignments in complex scenarios like scene understanding, human-object interactions, and multi-stage actions.

Method: Uses a Semantic Planner (multimodal language model) to reason over user intent from text and visual context, generating autoregressive semantic tokens that serve as structured "semantic sketches" for video diffusion models.

Result: Substantially reduces visual hallucinations and enables fine-grained, instruction-aligned video generation consistent with multimodal context.

Conclusion: Plan-X effectively integrates language models' reasoning and planning capabilities with diffusion models' photorealistic synthesis strengths for improved video generation.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in visual synthesis, yet they often struggle with high-level semantic reasoning and long-horizon planning. This limitation frequently leads to visual hallucinations and mis-alignments with user instructions, especially in scenarios involving complex scene understanding, human-object interactions, multi-stage actions, and in-context motion reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose Plan-X, a framework that explicitly enforces high-level semantic planning to instruct video generation process. At its core lies a Semantic Planner, a learnable multimodal language model that reasons over the user's intent from both text prompts and visual context, and autoregressively generates a sequence of text-grounded spatio-temporal semantic tokens. These semantic tokens, complementary to high-level text prompt guidance, serve as structured "semantic sketches" over time for the video diffusion model, which has its strength at synthesizing high-fidelity visual details. Plan-X effectively integrates the strength of language models in multimodal in-context reasoning and planning, together with the strength of diffusion models in photorealistic video synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework substantially reduces visual hallucinations and enables fine-grained, instruction-aligned video generation consistent with multimodal context.

Conclusion: HyM-UNet effectively handles medical segmentation tasks with complex shapes and scale variations, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Accurate organ and lesion segmentation is a critical prerequisite for computer-aided diagnosis. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), constrained by their local receptive fields, often struggle to capture complex global anatomical structures. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a novel hybrid architecture, HyM-UNet, designed to synergize the local feature extraction capabilities of CNNs with the efficient global modeling capabilities of Mamba. Specifically, we design a Hierarchical Encoder that utilizes convolutional modules in the shallow stages to preserve high-frequency texture details, while introducing Visual Mamba modules in the deep stages to capture long-range semantic dependencies with linear complexity. To bridge the semantic gap between the encoder and the decoder, we propose a Mamba-Guided Fusion Skip Connection (MGF-Skip). This module leverages deep semantic features as gating signals to dynamically suppress background noise within shallow features, thereby enhancing the perception of ambiguous boundaries. We conduct extensive experiments on public benchmark dataset ISIC 2018. The results demonstrate that HyM-UNet significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of Dice coefficient and IoU, while maintaining lower parameter counts and inference latency. This validates the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method in handling medical segmentation tasks characterized by complex shapes and scale variations.

Method: Pairs and differences all 2D slices from baseline and follow-up 3D images, then iteratively selects the most informative pairs for labeling using DAL to train deep learning models with minimal manual annotation.

Result: Experimental results show LMI-AL achieves performance comparable to models trained on fully labeled datasets with less than 8% of data labeled.

Conclusion: LMI-AL provides an effective framework for longitudinal medical imaging change detection that significantly reduces labeling costs while maintaining performance, with code publicly available for future research.

Abstract: Detecting changes in longitudinal medical imaging using deep learning requires a substantial amount of accurately labeled data. However, labeling these images is notably more costly and time-consuming than labeling other image types, as it requires labeling across various time points, where new lesions can be minor, and subtle changes are easily missed. Deep Active Learning (DAL) has shown promise in minimizing labeling costs by selectively querying the most informative samples, but existing studies have primarily focused on static tasks like classification and segmentation. Consequently, the conventional DAL approach cannot be directly applied to change detection tasks, which involve identifying subtle differences across multiple images. In this study, we propose a novel DAL framework, named Longitudinal Medical Imaging Active Learning (LMI-AL), tailored specifically for longitudinal medical imaging. By pairing and differencing all 2D slices from baseline and follow-up 3D images, LMI-AL iteratively selects the most informative pairs for labeling using DAL, training a deep learning model with minimal manual annotation. Experimental results demonstrate that, with less than 8% of the data labeled, LMI-AL can achieve performance comparable to models trained on fully labeled datasets. We also provide a detailed analysis of the method's performance, as guidance for future research. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/HelenMa9998/Longitudinal_AL.

*Jun Zhang,Jie Feng,Long Chen,Junhui Wang,Zhicheng Liu,Depeng Jin,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RoadBench is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating multimodal large language models' fine-grained spatial understanding and reasoning capabilities in urban scenarios, focusing on road markings with 9,121 test cases across six tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of attention to MLLMs' fine-grained spatial understanding in complex urban scenarios, particularly focusing on road markings as essential elements of urban traffic networks.

Method: Proposed RoadBench benchmark with six systematic tasks using BEV (Bird's Eye View) and FPV (First Person View) image inputs, comprising 9,121 manually verified test cases that bridge local spatial understanding to global reasoning.

Result: Evaluation of 14 mainstream MLLMs revealed significant shortcomings in fine-grained spatial understanding and reasoning, with performance in some tasks falling below simple rule-based or random selection baselines.

Conclusion: RoadBench is a challenging benchmark that exposes critical limitations in current MLLMs' urban spatial capabilities, providing a foundation for advancing spatial understanding in multimodal models.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated powerful capabilities in general spatial understanding and reasoning. However, their fine-grained spatial understanding and reasoning capabilities in complex urban scenarios have not received significant attention in the fields of both research and industry. To fill this gap, we focus primarily on road markings as a typical example of fine-grained spatial elements under urban scenarios, given the essential role of the integrated road traffic network they form within cities. Around road markings and urban traffic systems, we propose RoadBench, a systematic benchmark that comprehensively evaluates MLLMs' fine-grained spatial understanding and reasoning capabilities using BEV and FPV image inputs. This benchmark comprises six tasks consisting of 9,121 strictly manually verified test cases. These tasks form a systematic evaluation framework that bridges understanding at local spatial scopes to global reasoning. They not only test MLLMs' capabilities in recognition, joint understanding, and reasoning but also assess their ability to integrate image information with domain knowledge. After evaluating 14 mainstream MLLMs, we confirm that RoadBench is a challenging benchmark for MLLMs while revealing significant shortcomings in existing MLLMs' fine-grained spatial understanding and reasoning capabilities within urban scenarios. In certain tasks, their performance even falls short of simple rule-based or random selection baselines. These findings, along with RoadBench itself, will contribute to the comprehensive advancement of spatial understanding capabilities for MLLMs. The benchmark code, example datasets, and raw evaluation results are available in the supplementary material.

### [72] [State and Scene Enhanced Prototypes for Weakly Supervised Open-Vocabulary Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18012)
*Jiaying Zhou,Qingchao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in Weakly Supervised Open-Vocabulary Object Detection by introducing two prototype enhancement strategies: State-Enhanced Semantic Prototypes (SESP) for capturing intra-class variations and Scene-Augmented Pseudo Prototypes (SAPP) for better visual-textual alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semantic prototypes in WS-OVOD are static and limited, failing to capture intra-class visual variations from different object states, and there's a semantic mismatch between visual region proposals and object-centric text embeddings.

Method: Two complementary strategies: SESP generates state-aware textual descriptions to capture diverse object appearances, and SAPP incorporates contextual semantics with soft alignment for consistent visual-textual representations.

Result: The integrated approach achieves notable improvements in WS-OVOD by enhancing both semantic prototype richness and visual-textual alignment.

Conclusion: The proposed SESP and SAPP methods effectively address key challenges in WS-OVOD, leading to improved performance in open-vocabulary object detection with weak supervision.

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVOD) aims to generalize object recognition to novel categories, while Weakly Supervised OVOD (WS-OVOD) extends this by combining box-level annotations with image-level labels. Despite recent progress, two critical challenges persist in this setting. First, existing semantic prototypes, even when enriched by LLMs, are static and limited, failing to capture the rich intra-class visual variations induced by different object states (e.g., a cat's pose). Second, the standard pseudo-box generation introduces a semantic mismatch between visual region proposals (which contain context) and object-centric text embeddings. To tackle these issues, we introduce two complementary prototype enhancement strategies. To capture intra-class variations in appearance and state, we propose the State-Enhanced Semantic Prototypes (SESP), which generates state-aware textual descriptions (e.g., "a sleeping cat") to capture diverse object appearances, yielding more discriminative prototypes. Building on this, we further introduce Scene-Augmented Pseudo Prototypes (SAPP) to address the semantic mismatch. SAPP incorporates contextual semantics (e.g., "cat lying on sofa") and utilizes a soft alignment mechanism to promote contextually consistent visual-textual representations. By integrating SESP and SAPP, our method effectively enhances both the richness of semantic prototypes and the visual-textual alignment, achieving notable improvements.

*Chenyu Li,Danfeng Hong,Bing Zhang,Zhaojie Pan,Naoto Yokoya,Jocelyn Chanussot*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MambaX is a nonlinear state predictive control model for image super-resolution that dynamically learns nonlinear state parameters to overcome limitations of existing approaches and fixed linear mappers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing super-resolution methods focus on final resolution enhancement but neglect error control in intermediate stages. Mamba's fixed linear mapper has limited receptive field and flexibility for fine-grained images.

Method: Maps consecutive spectral bands into latent state space, uses dynamic state predictive control learning to approximate nonlinear differential coefficients, introduces state cross-control for multimodal fusion, and employs progressive transitional learning to reduce heterogeneity.

Result: Superior performance in both single-image SR and multimodal fusion-based SR tasks compared to existing sequence models.

Conclusion: MambaX demonstrates substantial potential for advancing spectrally generalized modeling across arbitrary dimensions and modalities through its dynamic spectrum-state representation.

Abstract: Image super-resolution (SR) is a critical technology for overcoming the inherent hardware limitations of sensors. However, existing approaches mainly focus on directly enhancing the final resolution, often neglecting effective control over error propagation and accumulation during intermediate stages. Recently, Mamba has emerged as a promising approach that can represent the entire reconstruction process as a state sequence with multiple nodes, allowing for intermediate intervention. Nonetheless, its fixed linear mapper is limited by a narrow receptive field and restricted flexibility, which hampers its effectiveness in fine-grained images. To address this, we created a nonlinear state predictive control model \textbf{MambaX} that maps consecutive spectral bands into a latent state space and generalizes the SR task by dynamically learning the nonlinear state parameters of control equations. Compared to existing sequence models, MambaX 1) employs dynamic state predictive control learning to approximate the nonlinear differential coefficients of state-space models; 2) introduces a novel state cross-control paradigm for multimodal SR fusion; and 3) utilizes progressive transitional learning to mitigate heterogeneity caused by domain and modality shifts. Our evaluation demonstrates the superior performance of the dynamic spectrum-state representation model in both single-image SR and multimodal fusion-based SR tasks, highlighting its substantial potential to advance spectrally generalized modeling across arbitrary dimensions and modalities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First unified noise model for hybrid event frame sensors, combining APS and EVS noise characteristics with statistical calibration and simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hybrid sensors combine APS and EVS advantages but introduce complex noise patterns that are poorly understood and unmodeled.

Method: Developed unified statistics-based imaging noise model incorporating photon shot noise, dark current noise, fixed-pattern noise, and quantization noise; created calibration pipeline and HESIM simulator.

Result: Validated model on two hybrid sensors across multiple imaging tasks, demonstrating strong transfer from simulation to real data.

Conclusion: The proposed unified noise model and simulator effectively capture hybrid sensor noise behavior, enabling better simulation-to-real transfer for imaging applications.

Abstract: Event frame hybrid sensors integrate an Active Pixel Sensor (APS) and an Event Vision Sensor (EVS) within a single chip, combining the high dynamic range and low latency of the EVS with the rich spatial intensity information from the APS. While this tight integration offers compact, temporally precise imaging, the complex circuit architecture introduces non-trivial noise patterns that remain poorly understood and unmodeled. In this work, we present the first unified, statistics-based imaging noise model that jointly describes the noise behavior of APS and EVS pixels. Our formulation explicitly incorporates photon shot noise, dark current noise, fixed-pattern noise, and quantization noise, and links EVS noise to illumination level and dark current. Based on this formulation, we further develop a calibration pipeline to estimate noise parameters from real data and offer a detailed analysis of both APS and EVS noise behaviors. Finally, we propose HESIM, a statistically grounded simulator that generates RAW frames and events under realistic, jointly calibrated noise statistics. Experiments on two hybrid sensors validate our model across multiple imaging tasks (e.g., video frame interpolation and deblurring), demonstrating strong transfer from simulation to real data.

*Tian Ye,Song Fei,Lei Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UltraFlux is a 4K diffusion transformer that addresses coupled failure modes in positional encoding, VAE compression, and optimization through data-model co-design, achieving superior 4K image generation across diverse aspect ratios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending diffusion transformers to native 4K resolution across diverse aspect ratios reveals tightly coupled failure modes in positional encoding, VAE compression, and optimization that cannot be solved in isolation.

Method: Combines Resonance 2D RoPE with YaRN for positional encoding, VAE post-training for better reconstruction, SNR-Aware Huber Wavelet objective for gradient balancing, and Stage-wise Aesthetic Curriculum Learning for high-aesthetic supervision.

Result: UltraFlux outperforms strong open-source baselines across fidelity, aesthetic, and alignment metrics in 4K settings, and with LLM prompt refinement matches or surpasses proprietary Seedream 4.0.

Conclusion: The data-model co-design approach with integrated solutions for positional encoding, VAE compression, and optimization enables stable, detail-preserving 4K diffusion transformers that generalize across wide aspect ratios.

Abstract: Diffusion transformers have recently delivered strong text-to-image generation around 1K resolution, but we show that extending them to native 4K across diverse aspect ratios exposes a tightly coupled failure mode spanning positional encoding, VAE compression, and optimization. Tackling any of these factors in isolation leaves substantial quality on the table. We therefore take a data-model co-design view and introduce UltraFlux, a Flux-based DiT trained natively at 4K on MultiAspect-4K-1M, a 1M-image 4K corpus with controlled multi-AR coverage, bilingual captions, and rich VLM/IQA metadata for resolution- and AR-aware sampling. On the model side, UltraFlux couples (i) Resonance 2D RoPE with YaRN for training-window-, frequency-, and AR-aware positional encoding at 4K; (ii) a simple, non-adversarial VAE post-training scheme that improves 4K reconstruction fidelity; (iii) an SNR-Aware Huber Wavelet objective that rebalances gradients across timesteps and frequency bands; and (iv) a Stage-wise Aesthetic Curriculum Learning strategy that concentrates high-aesthetic supervision on high-noise steps governed by the model prior. Together, these components yield a stable, detail-preserving 4K DiT that generalizes across wide, square, and tall ARs. On the Aesthetic-Eval at 4096 benchmark and multi-AR 4K settings, UltraFlux consistently outperforms strong open-source baselines across fidelity, aesthetic, and alignment metrics, and-with a LLM prompt refiner-matches or surpasses the proprietary Seedream 4.0.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IE-Bench is a benchmark suite for evaluating text-driven image editing, featuring diverse source images, editing prompts, and human-rated samples. IE-Critic-R1 is a new evaluation metric using RLVR that better aligns with human perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods for text-driven image editing focus mainly on text-image alignment and don't well capture the unique challenges of editing tasks where images retain connections to source images while dynamically changing based on text semantics.

Method: Created IE-Bench with diverse source images, editing prompts, and 4,000 human-rated samples. Developed IE-Critic-R1 using Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for more comprehensive and explainable quality assessment.

Result: IE-Critic-R1 demonstrates superior alignment with human perception compared to previous metrics in text-driven image editing evaluation.

Conclusion: The proposed IE-Bench benchmark and IE-Critic-R1 metric provide more effective evaluation tools for text-driven image editing that better match human judgment.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-driven image editing have been significant, yet the task of accurately evaluating these edited images continues to pose a considerable challenge. Different from the assessment of text-driven image generation, text-driven image editing is characterized by simultaneously conditioning on both text and a source image. The edited images often retain an intrinsic connection to the original image, which dynamically change with the semantics of the text. However, previous methods tend to solely focus on text-image alignment or have not well aligned with human perception. In this work, we introduce the Text-driven Image Editing Benchmark suite (IE-Bench) to enhance the assessment of text-driven edited images. IE-Bench includes a database contains diverse source images, various editing prompts and the corresponding edited results from different editing methods, and nearly 4,000 samples with corresponding Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) provided by 15 human subjects. Furthermore, we introduce IE-Critic-R1, which, benefiting from Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), provides more comprehensive and explainable quality assessment for text-driven image editing that aligns with human perception. Extensive experiments demonstrate IE-Critic-R1's superior subjective-alignments on the text-driven image editing task compared with previous metrics. Related data and codes are available to the public.

TL;DR: Proposes HSSAL framework combining semi-supervised learning and hierarchical active learning to efficiently use limited labeled data in remote sensing scene classification, achieving near-fully-supervised performance with minimal labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of costly and time-consuming labeled data collection in remote sensing while vast amounts of unlabeled imagery remain underutilized.

Method: Hierarchical Semi-Supervised Active Learning (HSSAL) that integrates SSL with hierarchical active learning in iterative loop: SSL refines model using labeled and unlabeled data via self-training, then HAL selects most informative samples using progressive clustering based on scalability, diversity, and uncertainty.

Result: Outperforms SSL- or AL-only baselines on three RS datasets; achieves over 95% of fully-supervised accuracy with only 8%, 4%, and 2% labeled data on UCM, AID, and NWPU-RESISC45 respectively.

Conclusion: HSSAL demonstrates superior label efficiency by effectively exploiting informativeness of unlabeled data through the synergistic combination of semi-supervised learning and hierarchical active learning.

Abstract: The performance of deep learning models in remote sensing (RS) strongly depends on the availability of high-quality labeled data. However, collecting large-scale annotations is costly and time-consuming, while vast amounts of unlabeled imagery remain underutilized. To address this challenge, we propose a Hierarchical Semi-Supervised Active Learning (HSSAL) framework that integrates semi-supervised learning (SSL) and a novel hierarchical active learning (HAL) in a closed iterative loop. In each iteration, SSL refines the model using both labeled data through supervised learning and unlabeled data via weak-to-strong self-training, improving feature representation and uncertainty estimation. Guided by the refined representations and uncertainty cues of unlabeled samples, HAL then conducts sample querying through a progressive clustering strategy, selecting the most informative instances that jointly satisfy the criteria of scalability, diversity, and uncertainty. This hierarchical process ensures both efficiency and representativeness in sample selection. Extensive experiments on three benchmark RS scene classification datasets, including UCM, AID, and NWPU-RESISC45, demonstrate that HSSAL consistently outperforms SSL- or AL-only baselines. Remarkably, with only 8%, 4%, and 2% labeled training data on UCM, AID, and NWPU-RESISC45, respectively, HSSAL achieves over 95% of fully-supervised accuracy, highlighting its superior label efficiency through informativeness exploitation of unlabeled data. Our code will be released at https://github.com/zhu-xlab/RS-SSAL.

Motivation: Cervical AIS is a challenging premalignant lesion to diagnose histopathologically, and early detection is crucial to prevent progression to invasive adenocarcinoma.

Method: Used EfficientNet-B3 CNN trained on 2240 H&E images with Macenko stain normalization, patch-based preprocessing, class-balanced sampling, and focal loss to address dataset imbalance.

Result: Model achieved 73.23% overall accuracy with F1-scores of 0.75 (Abnormal) and 0.71 (Normal), with Grad-CAM showing biologically interpretable activation patterns.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of lightweight, interpretable AI systems for cervical gland pathology with applications in screening, education, and low-resource settings.

Abstract: Cervical adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) is a critical premalignant lesion whose accurate histopathological diagnosis is challenging. Early detection is essential to prevent progression to invasive cervical adenocarcinoma. In this study, we developed a deep learning-based virtual pathology assistant capable of distinguishing AIS from normal cervical gland histology using the CAISHI dataset, which contains 2240 expert-labeled H&E images (1010 normal and 1230 AIS). All images underwent Macenko stain normalization and patch-based preprocessing to enhance morphological feature representation. An EfficientNet-B3 convolutional neural network was trained using class-balanced sampling and focal loss to address dataset imbalance and emphasize difficult examples. The final model achieved an overall accuracy of 0.7323, with an F1-score of 0.75 for the Abnormal class and 0.71 for the Normal class. Grad-CAM heatmaps demonstrated biologically interpretable activation patterns, highlighting nuclear atypia and glandular crowding consistent with AIS morphology. The trained model was deployed in a Gradio-based virtual diagnostic assistant. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of lightweight, interpretable AI systems for cervical gland pathology, with potential applications in screening workflows, education, and low-resource settings.

TL;DR: VK-Det is a visual knowledge-guided open-vocabulary object detection framework that eliminates text dependence and achieves state-of-the-art performance on aerial datasets without extra supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing open-vocabulary detection methods rely on text supervision, which introduces semantic bias and restricts expansion to text-specified concepts rather than truly novel categories.

Method: Leverages vision encoder's inherent region perception for fine-grained localization, introduces prototype-aware pseudo-labeling through feature clustering and prototype matching to model inter-class boundaries and map detection regions to latent categories.

Result: Achieved 30.1 mAP^N on DIOR and 23.3 mAP^N on DOTA datasets, outperforming even methods with extra supervision.

Conclusion: VK-Det demonstrates that visual knowledge alone can effectively guide open-vocabulary detection, eliminating text dependence and achieving superior performance through adaptive distillation and prototype-aware pseudo-labeling.

Abstract: To identify objects beyond predefined categories, open-vocabulary aerial object detection (OVAD) leverages the zero-shot capabilities of visual-language models (VLMs) to generalize from base to novel categories. Existing approaches typically utilize self-learning mechanisms with weak text supervision to generate region-level pseudo-labels to align detectors with VLMs semantic spaces. However, text dependence induces semantic bias, restricting open-vocabulary expansion to text-specified concepts. We propose $\textbf{VK-Det}$, a $\textbf{V}$isual $\textbf{K}$nowledge-guided open-vocabulary object $\textbf{Det}$ection framework $\textit{without}$ extra supervision. First, we discover and leverage vision encoder's inherent informative region perception to attain fine-grained localization and adaptive distillation. Second, we introduce a novel prototype-aware pseudo-labeling strategy. It models inter-class decision boundaries through feature clustering and maps detection regions to latent categories via prototype matching. This enhances attention to novel objects while compensating for missing supervision. Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance, achieving 30.1 $\mathrm{mAP}^{N}$ on DIOR and 23.3 $\mathrm{mAP}^{N}$ on DOTA, outperforming even extra supervised methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models have heavy computational overhead and inference latency that limit their deployment in robotic manipulation, despite their impressive flexibility and generalization capabilities.

Method: Uses a teacher-student distillation framework with graph-structured encapsulation to model hierarchical action prediction evolution, and a dynamic router that adaptively selects computation paths based on action demands with hierarchical graph-informed supervision.

Result: Achieves comparable or superior performance to full-scale VLA models while reducing computation by over 50% with up to 1.67 times speedup on embodied benchmarks.

Conclusion: Establishes a general paradigm for efficient embodied intelligence by enabling lightweight VLA models that maintain high-precision action prediction with minimal computation and latency.

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown impressive flexibility and generalization, yet their deployment in robotic manipulation remains limited by heavy computational overhead and inference latency. In this work, we present ActDistill, a general action-guided self-derived distillation framework that transfers the action prediction capability of any existing VLA model to a lightweight counterpart. Unlike previous efficiency strategies that primarily emphasize vision-language correlations, ActDistill leverages action priors to guide knowledge transfer and model compression, achieving action-oriented efficiency for VLA models. Specifically, we employ a well-trained VLA model as the teacher and introduce a graph-structured encapsulation strategy to explicitly model the hierarchical evolution of action prediction. The student model, derived from the graph-encapsulated teacher, is further equipped with a dynamic router that adaptively selects computation paths based on action prediction demands, guided by hierarchical graph-informed supervision to ensure smooth and efficient evolution. During inference, graph-related auxiliary components are removed, allowing the student to execute only dynamically routed layers and predict high-precision actions with minimal computation and latency. Experiments on embodied benchmarks demonstrate that ActDistill achieves comparable or superior performance to full-scale VLA models while reducing computation by over 50% with up to 1.67 times speedup, thereby establishing a general paradigm toward efficient embodied intelligence.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if complex neural networks are necessary for simple binary classification tasks like malaria detection, and to develop a transparent, low-compute alternative for real-world deployment.

Method: EMFE pipeline extracts two morphological features from cell images (non-background pixels and holes), compares Logistic Regression and Random Forest against deep learning models, and creates an ensemble for improved accuracy.

Result: Single-variable Logistic Regression achieved 94.80% accuracy with 1.2 kB file size and 2.3 ms inference time. Ensemble improved to 97.15% accuracy, while deep learning models required 13.6-44.7 MB storage and 68 ms inference time.

Conclusion: Compact feature engineering provides clinically meaningful performance with superior transparency, reproducibility, speed, and deployment feasibility compared to deep learning, making it practical for resource-limited environments.

Abstract: Background and Objective: Deep learning models have high computational needs and lack interpretability but are often the first choice for medical image classification tasks. This study addresses whether complex neural networks are essential for the simple binary classification task of malaria. We introduce the Extracted Morphological Feature Engineered (EMFE) pipeline, a transparent, reproducible, and low compute machine learning approach tailored explicitly for simple cell morphology, designed to achieve deep learning performance levels on a simple CPU only setup with the practical aim of real world deployment.
  Methods: The study used the NIH Malaria Cell Images dataset, with two features extracted from each cell image: the number of non background pixels and the number of holes within the cell. Logistic Regression and Random Forest were compared against ResNet18, DenseNet121, MobileNetV2, and EfficientNet across accuracy, model size, and CPU inference time. An ensemble model was created by combining Logistic Regression and Random Forests to achieve higher accuracy while retaining efficiency.
  Results: The single variable Logistic Regression model achieved a test accuracy of 94.80 percent with a file size of 1.2 kB and negligible inference latency (2.3 ms). The two stage ensemble improved accuracy to 97.15 percent. In contrast, the deep learning methods require 13.6 MB to 44.7 MB of storage and show significantly higher inference times (68 ms).
  Conclusion: This study shows that a compact feature engineering approach can produce clinically meaningful classification performance while offering gains in transparency, reproducibility, speed, and deployment feasibility. The proposed pipeline demonstrates that simple interpretable features paired with lightweight models can serve as a practical diagnostic solution for environments with limited computational resources.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-modal survival analysis methods overemphasize cross-modal alignment through attention mechanisms, leading to representation collapse and reduced diversity by sacrificing modality-specific characteristics.

Method: Together-Then-Apart (TTA) framework with dual optimization: Together stage minimizes semantic discrepancies via shared prototypes and unbalanced optimal transport; Apart stage maximizes diversity through modality anchors and contrastive regularization.

Result: Extensive experiments on five TCGA benchmarks show TTA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in survival analysis.

Conclusion: TTA provides a new theoretical perspective for jointly achieving alignment and distinctiveness, enabling robust, interpretable, and biologically meaningful multi-modal survival analysis.

Abstract: Integrating heterogeneous modalities such as histopathology and genomics is central to advancing survival analysis, yet most existing methods prioritize cross-modal alignment through attention-based fusion mechanisms, often at the expense of modality-specific characteristics. This overemphasis on alignment leads to representation collapse and reduced diversity. In this work, we revisit multi-modal survival analysis via the dual lens of alignment and distinctiveness, positing that preserving modality-specific structure is as vital as achieving semantic coherence. In this paper, we introduce Together-Then-Apart (TTA), a unified min-max optimization framework that simultaneously models shared and modality-specific representations. The Together stage minimizes semantic discrepancies by aligning embeddings via shared prototypes, guided by an unbalanced optimal transport objective that adaptively highlights informative tokens. The Apart stage maximizes representational diversity through modality anchors and a contrastive regularizer that preserve unique modality information and prevent feature collapse. Extensive experiments on five TCGA benchmarks show that TTA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Beyond empirical gains, our formulation provides a new theoretical perspective of how alignment and distinctiveness can be jointly achieved in for robust, interpretable, and biologically meaningful multi-modal survival analysis.

Motivation: Current perceptual SR methods ignore that outputs are typically recompressed for storage/transmission, leading to suboptimal results as codecs add artifacts. Joint optimization is challenging due to non-differentiable codecs and varying configurations.

Method: Formulates compression as conditional text-to-image generation using pre-trained diffusion models to build a generalizable codec simulator. Uses training techniques including optimizing simulator with perceptual targets and adopting slightly compressed images as training targets.

Result: Saves more than 10% bitrate based on Real-ESRGAN and S3Diff under H.264/H.265/H.266 compression. Facilitates joint optimization of SR and post-processing after recompression.

Conclusion: VRPSR successfully addresses the recompression problem in perceptual SR, providing a versatile solution that improves compression efficiency while maintaining image quality.

Abstract: Perceptual image super-resolution (SR) methods restore degraded images and produce sharp outputs. In practice, those outputs are usually recompressed for storage and transmission. Ignoring recompression is suboptimal as the downstream codec might add additional artifacts to restored images. However, jointly optimizing SR and recompression is challenging, as the codecs are not differentiable and vary in configuration. In this paper, we present Versatile Recompression-Aware Perceptual Super-Resolution (VRPSR), which makes existing perceptual SR aware of versatile compression. First, we formulate compression as conditional text-to-image generation and utilize a pre-trained diffusion model to build a generalizable codec simulator. Next, we propose a set of training techniques tailored for perceptual SR, including optimizing the simulator using perceptual targets and adopting slightly compressed images as the training target. Empirically, our VRPSR saves more than 10\% bitrate based on Real-ESRGAN and S3Diff under H.264/H.265/H.266 compression. Besides, our VRPSR facilitates joint optimization of the SR and post-processing model after recompression.

*Aditya Chinchure,Sahithya Ravi,Pushkar Shukla,Vered Shwartz,Leonid Sigal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Spotlight is a novel task for localizing and explaining video-generation errors in text-to-video models, addressing the gap in current evaluation methods that assess videos holistically without identifying specific error types and their temporal locations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T2V models still produce nuanced local errors, but existing evaluation paradigms don't identify when specific errors occur or describe their nature, creating a need for fine-grained error analysis.

Method: Generated 600 videos using 200 diverse prompts and 3 state-of-the-art video generators (Veo 3, Seedance, LTX-2), annotated over 1600 fine-grained errors across six types including motion, physics, and prompt adherence.

Result: Adherence and physics errors are predominant and persist longer, while appearance-disappearance and body pose errors occur in shorter segments. VLMs significantly lag behind humans in error identification and localization, but inference-time strategies improved performance by nearly 2x.

Conclusion: Spotlight enables fine-grained evaluation of video-generation errors, paving the way for better evaluation tools and more sophisticated reward models for video generators.

Abstract: Current text-to-video models (T2V) can generate high-quality, temporally coherent, and visually realistic videos. Nonetheless, errors still often occur, and are more nuanced and local compared to the previous generation of T2V models. While current evaluation paradigms assess video models across diverse dimensions, they typically evaluate videos holistically without identifying when specific errors occur or describing their nature. We address this gap by introducing Spotlight, a novel task aimed at localizing and explaining video-generation errors. We generate 600 videos using 200 diverse textual prompts and three state-of-the-art video generators (Veo 3, Seedance, and LTX-2), and annotate over 1600 fine-grained errors across six types, including motion, physics, and prompt adherence. We observe that adherence and physics errors are predominant and persist across longer segments, whereas appearance-disappearance and body pose errors manifest in shorter segments. We then evaluate current VLMs on Spotlight and find that VLMs lag significantly behind humans in error identification and localization in videos. We propose inference-time strategies to probe the limits of current VLMs on our task, improving performance by nearly 2x. Our task paves a way forward to building fine-grained evaluation tools and more sophisticated reward models for video generators.

TL;DR: MM-Det++ is a multimodal detection algorithm for identifying diffusion-generated videos, using spatio-temporal analysis and multimodal reasoning with MLLMs, achieving superior performance on a new DVF dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The proliferation of diffusion-generated videos raises security concerns, but existing methods focus on image-level detection, leaving video-level forgery detection underexplored.

Method: Two-branch approach: ST branch uses Frame-Centric Vision Transformer for spatio-temporal analysis, MM branch uses MLLMs for multimodal forgery reasoning, unified by UML module for multimodal integration.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate MM-Det++'s superiority and effectiveness of unified multimodal forgery learning in detecting diffusion-generated videos.

Conclusion: MM-Det++ advances video forensics through unified multimodal learning and establishes a comprehensive DVF dataset for future research.

Abstract: The proliferation of videos generated by diffusion models has raised increasing concerns about information security, highlighting the urgent need for reliable detection of synthetic media. Existing methods primarily focus on image-level forgery detection, leaving generic video-level forgery detection largely underexplored. To advance video forensics, we propose a consolidated multimodal detection algorithm, named MM-Det++, specifically designed for detecting diffusion-generated videos. Our approach consists of two innovative branches and a Unified Multimodal Learning (UML) module. Specifically, the Spatio-Temporal (ST) branch employs a novel Frame-Centric Vision Transformer (FC-ViT) to aggregate spatio-temporal information for detecting diffusion-generated videos, where the FC-tokens enable the capture of holistic forgery traces from each video frame. In parallel, the Multimodal (MM) branch adopts a learnable reasoning paradigm to acquire Multimodal Forgery Representation (MFR) by harnessing the powerful comprehension and reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which discerns the forgery traces from a flexible semantic perspective. To integrate multimodal representations into a coherent space, a UML module is introduced to consolidate the generalization ability of MM-Det++. In addition, we also establish a large-scale and comprehensive Diffusion Video Forensics (DVF) dataset to advance research in video forgery detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of MM-Det++ and highlight the effectiveness of unified multimodal forgery learning in detecting diffusion-generated videos.

TL;DR: AdaPerceiver is a transformer architecture with unified adaptivity across depth, width, and tokens, enabling dynamic computation allocation to meet diverse hardware and latency constraints while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current transformer models are rigid in computation allocation at inference time, lacking the ability to adapt to varying hardware and latency requirements across different deployment scenarios.

Method: Proposed AdaPerceiver architecture with unified adaptivity across depth, width, and tokens, coupled with an efficient joint training regime to maintain performance across configurations.

Result: On image classification: achieves 85.4% accuracy with 36% higher throughput than FlexiViT-L. On dense prediction: matches ViT-H/14 with ~26x fewer encoder FLOPs on semantic segmentation and depth estimation. With policy: maintains ImageNet1K accuracy (±0.1%) while reducing FLOPs by 24-33%.

Conclusion: AdaPerceiver successfully expands the accuracy-throughput Pareto front and enables efficient dynamic computation allocation across multiple axes within a single model.

Abstract: Modern transformer architectures achieve remarkable performance across tasks and domains but remain rigid in how they allocate computation at inference time. Real-world deployment often requires models to adapt to diverse hardware and latency constraints, yet most approaches to dynamic computation focus on a single axis -- such as reducing the number of tokens. We present a novel capability: AdaPerceiver, the first transformer architecture with unified adaptivity across depth, width, and tokens within a single model. We propose an architecture that supports adaptivity along these axes. We couple this with an efficient joint training regime that ensures the model maintains performance across its various configurations. We evaluate AdaPerceiver on image classification, semantic segmentation, and depth estimation tasks. On image classification, AdaPerceiver expands the accuracy-throughput Pareto front. It achieves 85.4% accuracy while yielding 36% higher throughput than FlexiViT-L. On dense prediction, AdaPerceiver matches ViT-H/14 while having $\sim$26x fewer encoder FLOPs (floating-point operations) on semantic segmentation and depth estimation. Finally, we show how AdaPerceiver equipped with a policy can maintain ImageNet1K accuracy ($\pm0.1$ percentage points) while reducing FLOPs by $24-33$%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models are frame-wise with limited multi-view consistency, so the authors aim to create a backbone that can process multiple views simultaneously and enforce multi-view consistency during pre-training.

Method: Muskie is trained to reconstruct heavily masked content in one view by finding geometric correspondences from other views using an aggressive masking strategy, learning view-invariant features without 3D supervision.

Result: Muskie achieves higher multi-view correspondence accuracy than state-of-the-art frame-wise backbones like DINO and consistently enhances performance on downstream 3D tasks including camera pose estimation and pointmap reconstruction.

Conclusion: Muskie demonstrates that native multi-view processing with geometric correspondence learning during pre-training leads to better multi-view consistency and improved performance on 3D vision tasks compared to frame-wise approaches.

Abstract: We present Muskie, a native multi-view vision backbone designed for 3D vision tasks. Unlike existing models, which are frame-wise and exhibit limited multi-view consistency, Muskie is designed to process multiple views simultaneously and introduce multi-view consistency in pre-training stage. Muskie is trained to reconstruct heavily masked content in one view by finding and utilizing geometric correspondences from other views. Through this pretext task and our proposed aggressive masking strategy, the model implicitly to learn view-invariant features and develop strong geometric understanding without any 3D supervision. Compared with state-of-the-art frame-wise backbones such as DINO, Muskie achieves higher multi-view correspondence accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that using Muskie as a backbone consistently enhances performance on downstream 3D tasks, including camera pose estimation and pointmap reconstruction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PromptMoE addresses ZSAD limitations by learning a pool of expert prompts and using a visually-guided MoE mechanism to dynamically combine them, achieving state-of-the-art performance across 15 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ZSAD methods using vision-language models suffer from representational bottlenecks and overfitting due to fixed, learnable, or dense dynamic prompts, limiting generalization to diverse unseen anomalies.

Method: Proposes PromptMoE with compositional prompt learning: learns expert prompts as semantic primitives and uses Visually-Guided Mixture of Prompt (VGMoP) with image-gated sparse MoE to dynamically combine them per instance.

Result: Extensive experiments on 15 industrial and medical datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and effectiveness in handling complex unseen anomalies.

Conclusion: Compositional prompt learning with expert prompts and visual guidance overcomes limitations of existing methods, providing robust generalization for zero-shot anomaly detection.

Abstract: Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection (ZSAD) aims to identify and localize anomalous regions in images of unseen object classes. While recent methods based on vision-language models like CLIP show promise, their performance is constrained by existing prompt engineering strategies. Current approaches, whether relying on single fixed, learnable, or dense dynamic prompts, suffer from a representational bottleneck and are prone to overfitting on auxiliary data, failing to generalize to the complexity and diversity of unseen anomalies. To overcome these limitations, we propose $\mathtt{PromptMoE}$. Our core insight is that robust ZSAD requires a compositional approach to prompt learning. Instead of learning monolithic prompts, $\mathtt{PromptMoE}$ learns a pool of expert prompts, which serve as a basis set of composable semantic primitives, and a visually-guided Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism to dynamically combine them for each instance. Our framework materializes this concept through a Visually-Guided Mixture of Prompt (VGMoP) that employs an image-gated sparse MoE to aggregate diverse normal and abnormal expert state prompts, generating semantically rich textual representations with strong generalization. Extensive experiments across 15 datasets in industrial and medical domains demonstrate the effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance of $\mathtt{PromptMoE}$.

TL;DR: MVS-TTA is a test-time adaptation framework that enhances learning-based multi-view stereo methods by using meta-learning to enable scene-specific optimization during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning-based MVS methods have limited generalization due to fixed parameters trained on limited data, while optimization-based methods require costly per-scene optimization. MVS-TTA bridges these paradigms.

Method: Uses self-supervised cross-view consistency loss as auxiliary task for test-time adaptation, with meta-auxiliary learning to train models to benefit from auxiliary-task-based updates. Framework is model-agnostic.

Result: Extensive experiments on DTU, BlendedMVS and cross-dataset settings show consistent performance improvements even on state-of-the-art MVS models.

Conclusion: First integration of optimization-based test-time adaptation into learning-based MVS using meta-learning, providing efficient scene-specific adaptation without costly per-scene optimization.

Abstract: Recent learning-based multi-view stereo (MVS) methods are data-driven and have achieved remarkable progress due to large-scale training data and advanced architectures. However, their generalization remains sub-optimal due to fixed model parameters trained on limited training data distributions. In contrast, optimization-based methods enable scene-specific adaptation but lack scalability and require costly per-scene optimization. In this paper, we propose MVS-TTA, an efficient test-time adaptation (TTA) framework that enhances the adaptability of learning-based MVS methods by bridging these two paradigms. Specifically, MVS-TTA employs a self-supervised, cross-view consistency loss as an auxiliary task to guide inference-time adaptation. We introduce a meta-auxiliary learning strategy to train the model to benefit from auxiliary-task-based updates explicitly. Our framework is model-agnostic and can be applied to a wide range of MVS methods with minimal architectural changes. Extensive experiments on standard datasets (DTU, BlendedMVS) and a challenging cross-dataset generalization setting demonstrate that MVS-TTA consistently improves performance, even when applied to state-of-the-art MVS models. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to integrate optimization-based test-time adaptation into learning-based MVS using meta-learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VCU-Bridge introduces a human-like hierarchical framework for visual connotation understanding, progressing from perception to abstract reasoning with explicit evidence tracing. HVCU-Bench provides level-wise diagnostics showing performance declines at higher reasoning levels. MCTS-guided instruction tuning improves both hierarchical and general benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs process visual information differently from humans, treating details and concepts in isolation rather than integrating them. Existing evaluations decouple perception from reasoning, missing semantic dependencies and failing to identify performance bottlenecks.

Method: Developed VCU-Bridge framework with hierarchical visual connotation understanding (foundational perception → semantic bridging → abstract connotation). Created HVCU-Bench benchmark with explicit level-wise diagnostics. Used Monte Carlo Tree Search-guided data generation for instruction tuning.

Result: Performance consistently declines as reasoning progresses to higher levels. Strengthening low-level capabilities yields measurable gains at higher levels (+2.53% on general benchmarks, +7.26% on MMStar). The framework provides explicit evidence-to-inference tracing.

Conclusion: Hierarchical thinking pattern is significant for enhancing MLLM capabilities. Strengthening foundational perception directly benefits higher-level reasoning, demonstrating the importance of bridging low-level details to abstract concepts in multimodal understanding.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel on benchmarks, their processing paradigm differs from the human ability to integrate visual information. Unlike humans who naturally bridge details and high-level concepts, models tend to treat these elements in isolation. Prevailing evaluation protocols often decouple low-level perception from high-level reasoning, overlooking their semantic and causal dependencies, which yields non-diagnostic results and obscures performance bottlenecks. We present VCU-Bridge, a framework that operationalizes a human-like hierarchy of visual connotation understanding: multi-level reasoning that advances from foundational perception through semantic bridging to abstract connotation, with an explicit evidence-to-inference trace from concrete cues to abstract conclusions. Building on this framework, we construct HVCU-Bench, a benchmark for hierarchical visual connotation understanding with explicit, level-wise diagnostics. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate a consistent decline in performance as reasoning progresses to higher levels. We further develop a data generation pipeline for instruction tuning guided by Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and show that strengthening low-level capabilities yields measurable gains at higher levels. Interestingly, it not only improves on HVCU-Bench but also brings benefits on general benchmarks (average +2.53%), especially with substantial gains on MMStar (+7.26%), demonstrating the significance of the hierarchical thinking pattern and its effectiveness in enhancing MLLM capabilities.

*Dachuan Zhao,Weiyue Li,Zhenda Shen,Yushu Qiu,Bowen Xu,Haoyu Chen,Yongchao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPD is a subspace projection debiasing method that removes entire bias subspaces from VLMs while preserving semantic fidelity, achieving better fairness than coordinate-wise approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current coordinate-wise debiasing methods fail due to feature entanglement, poor generalization, and incomplete bias removal, as bias is distributed across linear subspaces rather than isolated coordinates.

Method: Proposes Subspace Projection Debiasing (SPD) that identifies and removes entire subspaces of linearly decodable bias while reinserting neutral mean components to maintain semantic information.

Result: SPD achieves 18.5% average improvement across four fairness metrics while maintaining minimal task performance loss in zero-shot classification, text-to-image retrieval, and image generation tasks.

Conclusion: SPD provides a geometrically principled solution that effectively debiases VLMs by addressing the distributed nature of bias across subspaces, outperforming existing coordinate-wise methods.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become indispensable for multimodal reasoning, yet their representations often encode and amplify demographic biases, resulting in biased associations and misaligned predictions in downstream tasks. Such behavior undermines fairness and distorts the intended alignment between vision and language. Recent post-hoc approaches attempt to mitigate bias by replacing the most attribute-correlated embedding coordinates with neutral values. However, our systematic analysis reveals three critical failures of this coordinate-wise approach: feature entanglement, poor cross-dataset generalization, and incomplete bias removal. We find that bias is not localized to a few coordinates but is instead distributed across a few linear subspaces. To address these limitations, we propose $\textbf{S}$ubspace $\textbf{P}$rojection $\textbf{D}$ebiasing ($\textbf{SPD}$), a geometrically principled framework that identifies and removes the entire subspace of linearly decodable bias while reinserting a neutral mean component to preserve semantic fidelity. Extensive experiments across zero-shot classification, text-to-image retrieval, and image generation validate the effectiveness of SPD: our method achieves more robust debiasing with an average improvement of $18.5\%$ across four fairness metrics, while maintaining minimal loss in task performance compared to the best debiasing baseline.

TL;DR: SFHand is the first streaming framework for real-time 3D hand forecasting that combines video streams with language instructions, achieving state-of-the-art performance and improving downstream task success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D hand forecasting are unsuitable for real-time applications like AR and robotics because they require offline video sequences and cannot incorporate language guidance that conveys task intent.

Method: SFHand uses a streaming autoregressive architecture with an ROI-enhanced memory layer to predict future 3D hand states from continuous video and language streams, capturing temporal context while focusing on hand-centric regions.

Result: SFHand achieves new state-of-the-art results in 3D hand forecasting, outperforming prior work by up to 35.8%, and improves downstream embodied manipulation task success rates by up to 13.4%.

Conclusion: SFHand enables real-time, language-guided 3D hand forecasting for interactive applications and demonstrates the practical utility of learned representations for downstream tasks.

Abstract: Real-time 3D hand forecasting is a critical component for fluid human-computer interaction in applications like AR and assistive robotics. However, existing methods are ill-suited for these scenarios, as they typically require offline access to accumulated video sequences and cannot incorporate language guidance that conveys task intent. To overcome these limitations, we introduce SFHand, the first streaming framework for language-guided 3D hand forecasting. SFHand autoregressively predicts a comprehensive set of future 3D hand states, including hand type, 2D bounding box, 3D pose, and trajectory, from a continuous stream of video and language instructions. Our framework combines a streaming autoregressive architecture with an ROI-enhanced memory layer, capturing temporal context while focusing on salient hand-centric regions. To enable this research, we also introduce EgoHaFL, the first large-scale dataset featuring synchronized 3D hand poses and language instructions. We demonstrate that SFHand achieves new state-of-the-art results in 3D hand forecasting, outperforming prior work by a significant margin of up to 35.8%. Furthermore, we show the practical utility of our learned representations by transferring them to downstream embodied manipulation tasks, improving task success rates by up to 13.4% on multiple benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a data-efficient image editing method by treating image editing as a temporal process and transferring priors from video pre-training, achieving comparable performance with only 1% of the supervision required by mainstream methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal foundation models enable instruction-driven image editing but require massive high-quality training triplets and precise semantic references, making them costly and fidelity-dependent.

Method: Treat image editing as a degenerate temporal process and transfer single-frame evolution priors from video pre-training to enable highly data-efficient fine-tuning.

Result: The approach matches performance of leading open-source baselines while using only about 1% of the supervision demanded by mainstream editing models.

Conclusion: Viewing image editing through temporal modeling enables significant data efficiency improvements while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: We observe that recent advances in multimodal foundation models have propelled instruction-driven image generation and editing into a genuinely cross-modal, cooperative regime. Nevertheless, state-of-the-art editing pipelines remain costly: beyond training large diffusion/flow models, they require curating massive high-quality triplets of \{instruction, source image, edited image\} to cover diverse user intents. Moreover, the fidelity of visual replacements hinges on how precisely the instruction references the target semantics. We revisit this challenge through the lens of temporal modeling: if video can be regarded as a full temporal process, then image editing can be seen as a degenerate temporal process. This perspective allows us to transfer single-frame evolution priors from video pre-training, enabling a highly data-efficient fine-tuning regime. Empirically, our approach matches the performance of leading open-source baselines while using only about one percent of the supervision demanded by mainstream editing models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCALER is a collaborative framework that jointly optimizes a mean-teacher segmenter and learnable SAM through reciprocal supervision for label-deficient concealed object segmentation, achieving performance gains across semi- and weakly-supervised tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for LDCOS have limited performance due to target concealment and annotation scarcity. The study investigates whether consistency constraints and SAM-based supervision can be jointly integrated, and whether the segmenter can guide SAM through reciprocal supervision for mutual improvement.

Method: SCALER operates in two alternating phases: Phase I optimizes the segmenter under fixed SAM supervision using entropy-based image-level and uncertainty-based pixel-level weighting; Phase II updates SAM via augmentation invariance and noise resistance losses leveraging its robustness to perturbations.

Result: Experiments demonstrate consistent performance gains across eight semi- and weakly-supervised COS tasks. SCALER serves as a general training paradigm to enhance both lightweight segmenters and large foundation models under label-scarce conditions.

Conclusion: SCALER successfully integrates consistency constraints and SAM-based supervision through reciprocal supervision, enabling mutual improvement between the segmenter and SAM, providing an effective solution for label-deficient concealed object segmentation.

Abstract: Existing methods for label-deficient concealed object segmentation (LDCOS) either rely on consistency constraints or Segment Anything Model (SAM)-based pseudo-labeling. However, their performance remains limited due to the intrinsic concealment of targets and the scarcity of annotations. This study investigates two key questions: (1) Can consistency constraints and SAM-based supervision be jointly integrated to better exploit complementary information and enhance the segmenter? and (2) beyond that, can the segmenter in turn guide SAM through reciprocal supervision, enabling mutual improvement? To answer these questions, we present SCALER, a unified collaborative framework toward LDCOS that jointly optimizes a mean-teacher segmenter and a learnable SAM. SCALER operates in two alternating phases. In \textbf{Phase \uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral1}}, the segmenter is optimized under fixed SAM supervision using entropy-based image-level and uncertainty-based pixel-level weighting to select reliable pseudo-label regions and emphasize harder examples. In \textbf{Phase \uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral2}}, SAM is updated via augmentation invariance and noise resistance losses, leveraging its inherent robustness to perturbations. Experiments demonstrate that SCALER yields consistent performance gains across eight semi- and weakly-supervised COS tasks. The results further suggest that SCALER can serve as a general training paradigm to enhance both lightweight segmenters and large foundation models under label-scarce conditions. Code will be released.

Abstract: Astronomical imaging confronts an efficiency-resolution tradeoff that limits large-scale morphological classification and redshift prediction. We introduce WaveletMamba, a theory-driven framework integrating wavelet decomposition with state-space modeling, mathematical regularization, and multi-level bias correction. WaveletMamba achieves 81.72% +/- 0.53% classification accuracy at 64x64 resolution with only 3.54M parameters, delivering high-resolution performance (80.93% +/- 0.27% at 244x244) at low-resolution inputs with 9.7x computational efficiency gains. The framework exhibits Resolution Multistability, where models trained on low-resolution data achieve consistent accuracy across different input scales despite divergent internal representations. The framework's multi-level bias correction synergizes HK distance (distribution-level optimal transport) with Color-Aware Weighting (sample-level fine-tuning), achieving 22.96% Log-MSE improvement and 26.10% outlier reduction without explicit selection function modeling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UnfoldLDM integrates deep unfolding networks with latent diffusion models to overcome limitations in blind image restoration, addressing degradation-specific dependency and over-smoothing bias through multi-granularity degradation-aware modules and degradation-resistant priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep unfolding networks suffer from degradation-specific dependency (being tied to known degradation models) and over-smoothing bias (suppressing fine textures), making them unsuitable for blind image restoration tasks where the degradation model is unknown.

Method: Proposes UnfoldLDM that combines DUNs with latent diffusion models. Uses multi-granularity degradation-aware module for gradient descent to estimate unknown degradations, and degradation-resistant LDM with over-smoothing correction transformer to recover high-frequency components and enhance textures.

Result: UnfoldLDM achieves leading performance on various blind image restoration tasks and benefits downstream tasks. The design is compatible with existing DUN-based methods as a plug-and-play framework.

Conclusion: The integration of deep unfolding networks with latent diffusion models effectively addresses the core limitations of existing methods for blind image restoration, providing both degradation removal and texture preservation capabilities.

Abstract: Deep unfolding networks (DUNs) combine the interpretability of model-based methods with the learning ability of deep networks, yet remain limited for blind image restoration (BIR). Existing DUNs suffer from: (1) \textbf{Degradation-specific dependency}, as their optimization frameworks are tied to a known degradation model, making them unsuitable for BIR tasks; and (2) \textbf{Over-smoothing bias}, resulting from the direct feeding of gradient descent outputs, dominated by low-frequency content, into the proximal term, suppressing fine textures. To overcome these issues, we propose UnfoldLDM to integrate DUNs with latent diffusion model (LDM) for BIR. In each stage, UnfoldLDM employs a multi-granularity degradation-aware (MGDA) module as the gradient descent step. MGDA models BIR as an unknown degradation estimation problem and estimates both the holistic degradation matrix and its decomposed forms, enabling robust degradation removal. For the proximal step, we design a degradation-resistant LDM (DR-LDM) to extract compact degradation-invariant priors from the MGDA output. Guided by this prior, an over-smoothing correction transformer (OCFormer) explicitly recovers high-frequency components and enhances texture details. This unique combination ensures the final result is degradation-free and visually rich. Experiments show that our UnfoldLDM achieves a leading place on various BIR tasks and benefits downstream tasks. Moreover, our design is compatible with existing DUN-based methods, serving as a plug-and-play framework. Code will be released.

### [98] [Matching-Based Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation Models Are Interpretable by Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18163)
*Pasquale De Marinis,Uzay Kaymak,Rogier Brussee,Gennaro Vessio,Giovanna Castellano*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First interpretability method for few-shot semantic segmentation that explains model decisions by identifying which support image pixels contribute most to query predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FSS models perform well but lack interpretability, which is crucial for understanding model behavior and guiding support set selection in data-scarce scenarios.

Method: Affinity Explainer extracts attribution maps using matching scores between support and query features at multiple levels to highlight influential support pixels.

Result: Significantly outperforms adapted standard attribution methods on FSS benchmarks, provides structured attention patterns aligned with model architectures, and enables effective model diagnosis.

Conclusion: Establishes foundation for interpretable FSS research, enabling better model understanding and more reliable few-shot segmentation systems.

Abstract: Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation (FSS) models achieve strong performance in segmenting novel classes with minimal labeled examples, yet their decision-making processes remain largely opaque. While explainable AI has advanced significantly in standard computer vision tasks, interpretability in FSS remains virtually unexplored despite its critical importance for understanding model behavior and guiding support set selection in data-scarce scenarios. This paper introduces the first dedicated method for interpreting matching-based FSS models by leveraging their inherent structural properties. Our Affinity Explainer approach extracts attribution maps that highlight which pixels in support images contribute most to query segmentation predictions, using matching scores computed between support and query features at multiple feature levels. We extend standard interpretability evaluation metrics to the FSS domain and propose additional metrics to better capture the practical utility of explanations in few-shot scenarios. Comprehensive experiments on FSS benchmark datasets, using different models, demonstrate that our Affinity Explainer significantly outperforms adapted standard attribution methods. Qualitative analysis reveals that our explanations provide structured, coherent attention patterns that align with model architectures and and enable effective model diagnosis. This work establishes the foundation for interpretable FSS research, enabling better model understanding and diagnostic for more reliable few-shot segmentation systems.

### [99] [Nested Unfolding Network for Real-World Concealed Object Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18164)
*Chunming He,Rihan Zhang,Dingming Zhang,Fengyang Xiao,Deng-Ping Fan,Sina Farsiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes NUN, a nested unfolding network that decouples image restoration from segmentation using a DUN-in-DUN design with vision-language guidance for robust concealed object segmentation in real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DUN-based methods couple background estimation with image restoration, creating conflicting objectives and requiring pre-defined degradation types that are unrealistic for real-world applications.

Method: Nested unfolding network (NUN) with DUN-in-DUN design: DeRUN (degradation-resistant unfolding network) embedded within SODUN (segmentation-oriented unfolding network), guided by vision-language model to dynamically infer degradation semantics and perform reversible foreground-background estimation.

Result: Achieves leading performance on both clean and degraded benchmarks, demonstrating robust concealed object segmentation without requiring explicit degradation priors.

Conclusion: NUN provides a unified framework for real-world COS that effectively decouples restoration from segmentation while enabling mutual refinement, offering superior performance and robustness compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Deep unfolding networks (DUNs) have recently advanced concealed object segmentation (COS) by modeling segmentation as iterative foreground-background separation. However, existing DUN-based methods (RUN) inherently couple background estimation with image restoration, leading to conflicting objectives and requiring pre-defined degradation types, which are unrealistic in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose the nested unfolding network (NUN), a unified framework for real-world COS. NUN adopts a DUN-in-DUN design, embedding a degradation-resistant unfolding network (DeRUN) within each stage of a segmentation-oriented unfolding network (SODUN). This design decouples restoration from segmentation while allowing mutual refinement. Guided by a vision-language model (VLM), DeRUN dynamically infers degradation semantics and restores high-quality images without explicit priors, whereas SODUN performs reversible estimation to refine foreground and background. Leveraging the multi-stage nature of unfolding, NUN employs image-quality assessment to select the best DeRUN outputs for subsequent stages, naturally introducing a self-consistency loss that enhances robustness. Extensive experiments show that NUN achieves a leading place on both clean and degraded benchmarks. Code will be released.

TL;DR: EgoControl is a pose-controllable video diffusion model that generates egocentric videos from 3D body pose sequences, enabling fine-grained motion control for embodied AI agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable embodied AI agents that can simulate, predict, and plan actions through fine-grained control of body motion in egocentric video generation.

Method: Proposes a novel pose representation capturing global camera dynamics and articulated body movements, integrated through a dedicated control mechanism within a video diffusion model trained on egocentric data.

Result: Generates temporally coherent and visually realistic future frames that align precisely with provided pose control sequences, producing high-quality pose-consistent egocentric videos.

Conclusion: EgoControl paves the way toward controllable embodied video simulation and understanding by achieving precise motion control in egocentric video generation.

Abstract: Egocentric video generation with fine-grained control through body motion is a key requirement towards embodied AI agents that can simulate, predict, and plan actions. In this work, we propose EgoControl, a pose-controllable video diffusion model trained on egocentric data. We train a video prediction model to condition future frame generation on explicit 3D body pose sequences. To achieve precise motion control, we introduce a novel pose representation that captures both global camera dynamics and articulated body movements, and integrate it through a dedicated control mechanism within the diffusion process. Given a short sequence of observed frames and a sequence of target poses, EgoControl generates temporally coherent and visually realistic future frames that align with the provided pose control. Experimental results demonstrate that EgoControl produces high-quality, pose-consistent egocentric videos, paving the way toward controllable embodied video simulation and understanding.

*Mukai Yu,Mosam Dabhi,Liuyue Xie,Sebastian Scherer,László A. Jeni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: USF is a lens-agnostic framework that transforms images from any calibrated camera into a unit-sphere representation and performs spherical operations directly in the spatial domain, avoiding costly spherical harmonic transforms while maintaining rotation-equivariance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern perception systems use wide FoV cameras but apply planar CNNs designed for pinhole imagery, causing image-space neighborhoods to misrepresent physical adjacency and making models sensitive to global rotations. Frequency-domain spherical CNNs address this but require expensive spherical harmonic transforms that limit resolution and efficiency.

Method: USF transforms images from any calibrated camera into unit-sphere representation via ray-direction correspondences, performs spherical resampling, convolution, and pooling directly in spatial domain. Uses distance-only spherical kernels for configurable rotation-equivariance without harmonic transforms. Modular design decouples projection, location sampling, interpolation, and resolution control.

Result: USF processes high-resolution spherical imagery efficiently, maintains <1% performance drop under random test-time rotations without rotational augmentation, enables zero-shot generalization from one lens type to unseen wide-FoV lenses with minimal degradation. Outperforms standard planar backbones on classification, detection, and segmentation tasks across synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: USF provides an efficient, rotation-robust alternative to planar CNNs for wide-FoV imagery, avoiding computational bottlenecks of frequency-domain approaches while maintaining strong equivariance properties and enabling cross-lens generalization.

Abstract: Modern perception increasingly relies on fisheye, panoramic, and other wide field-of-view (FoV) cameras, yet most pipelines still apply planar CNNs designed for pinhole imagery on 2D grids, where image-space neighborhoods misrepresent physical adjacency and models are sensitive to global rotations. Frequency-domain spherical CNNs partially address this mismatch but require costly spherical harmonic transforms that constrain resolution and efficiency. We introduce the Unified Spherical Frontend (USF), a lens-agnostic framework that transforms images from any calibrated camera into a unit-sphere representation via ray-direction correspondences, and performs spherical resampling, convolution, and pooling directly in the spatial domain. USF is modular: projection, location sampling, interpolation, and resolution control are fully decoupled. Its distance-only spherical kernels offer configurable rotation-equivariance (mirroring translation-equivariance in planar CNNs) while avoiding harmonic transforms entirely. We compare standard planar backbones with their spherical counterparts across classification, detection, and segmentation tasks on synthetic (Spherical MNIST) and real-world datasets (PANDORA, Stanford 2D-3D-S), and stress-test robustness to extreme lens distortions, varying FoV, and arbitrary rotations. USF processes high-resolution spherical imagery efficiently and maintains less than 1% performance drop under random test-time rotations, even without rotational augmentation, and even enables zero-shot generalization from one lens type to unseen wide-FoV lenses with minimal performance degradation.

### [102] [Early Lung Cancer Diagnosis from Virtual Follow-up LDCT Generation via Correlational Autoencoder and Latent Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18185)
*Yutong Wu,Yifan Wang,Qining Zhang,Chuan Zhou,Lei Ying*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes CorrFlowNet, a generative AI method that creates virtual one-year follow-up CT scans from baseline scans to enable early lung cancer diagnosis without waiting for actual clinical follow-ups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early lung cancer diagnosis is critical but challenging due to difficulty distinguishing subtle early malignancy signals from benign conditions. Current AI methods focus on single CT scans, while patients often need multiple follow-ups over time for definitive diagnosis.

Method: Uses a correlational autoencoder to encode baseline and follow-up CT images into latent space capturing nodule progression dynamics, followed by flow matching with neural ODEs. Includes auxiliary classifier to enhance diagnostic accuracy.

Result: Evaluations on clinical dataset show significant improvement in lung nodule risk assessment compared to baseline models. Diagnostic accuracy comparable to real clinical CT follow-ups.

Conclusion: CorrFlowNet has potential to improve cancer diagnosis by providing virtual follow-ups that reduce waiting time for definitive diagnosis while maintaining accuracy comparable to real clinical follow-ups.

Abstract: Lung cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers, and early diagnosis is critical because the survival rate declines sharply once the disease progresses to advanced stages. However, achieving an early diagnosis remains challenging, particularly in distinguishing subtle early signals of malignancy from those of benign conditions. In clinical practice, a patient with a high risk may need to undergo an initial baseline and several annual follow-up examinations (e.g., CT scans) before receiving a definitive diagnosis, which can result in missing the optimal treatment. Recently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods have been increasingly used for early diagnosis of lung cancer, but most existing algorithms focus on radiomic features extraction from single early-stage CT scans. Inspired by recent advances in diffusion models for image generation, this paper proposes a generative method, named CorrFlowNet, which creates a virtual, one-year follow-up CT scan after the initial baseline scan. This virtual follow-up would allow for an early detection of malignant/benign nodules, reducing the need to wait for clinical follow-ups. During training, our approach employs a correlational autoencoder to encode both early baseline and follow-up CT images into a latent space that captures the dynamics of nodule progression as well as the correlations between them, followed by a flow matching algorithm on the latent space with a neural ordinary differential equation. An auxiliary classifier is used to further enhance the diagnostic accuracy. Evaluations on a real clinical dataset show our method can significantly improve downstream lung nodule risk assessment compared with existing baseline models. Moreover, its diagnostic accuracy is comparable with real clinical CT follow-ups, highlighting its potential to improve cancer diagnosis.

*Ahmad Mohammadshirazi,Pinaki Prasad Guha Neogi,Dheeraj Kulshrestha,Rajiv Ramnath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ARIAL is a modular framework that uses LLM-based planning to orchestrate specialized tools for Document VQA, achieving both high textual accuracy and reliable spatial grounding through transparent reasoning traces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Document VQA systems either achieve strong textual accuracy with unreliable spatial grounding or sacrifice performance for interpretability, creating a need for solutions that provide both precise answer extraction and reliable localization for high-stakes applications.

Method: ARIAL decomposes Document VQA into structured subtasks using specialized tools: OCR-based text extraction with TrOCR, retrieval-augmented context selection via semantic search, answer generation with fine-tuned Gemma 3-27B, and explicit bounding-box localization through text-to-region alignment, all orchestrated by an LLM-based planning agent.

Result: ARIAL achieves state-of-the-art results across four benchmarks: 88.7 ANLS and 50.1 mAP on DocVQA, 90.0 ANLS and 50.3 mAP on FUNSD, 85.5 ANLS and 60.2 mAP on CORD, and 93.1 ANLS on SROIE, surpassing previous best method (DLaVA) by +2.8 ANLS and +3.9 mAP on DocVQA.

Conclusion: Agentic orchestration of specialized tools can simultaneously improve performance and interpretability in Document VQA, providing a pathway toward trustworthy, explainable document AI systems with transparent reasoning traces and tool-level auditability.

Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (VQA) requires models to not only extract accurate textual answers but also precisely localize them within document images, a capability critical for interpretability in high-stakes applications. However, existing systems achieve strong textual accuracy while producing unreliable spatial grounding, or sacrifice performance for interpretability. We present ARIAL (Agentic Reasoning for Interpretable Answer Localization), a modular framework that orchestrates specialized tools through an LLM-based planning agent to achieve both precise answer extraction and reliable spatial grounding. ARIAL decomposes Document VQA into structured subtasks: OCR-based text extraction with TrOCR, retrieval-augmented context selection using semantic search, answer generation via a fine-tuned Gemma 3-27B model, and explicit bounding-box localization through text-to-region alignment. This modular architecture produces transparent reasoning traces, enabling tool-level auditability and independent component optimization. We evaluate ARIAL on four benchmarks (DocVQA, FUNSD, CORD, and SROIE) using both textual accuracy (ANLS) and spatial precision (mAP at IoU 0.50 to 0.95). ARIAL achieves state-of-the-art results across all datasets: 88.7 ANLS and 50.1 mAP on DocVQA, 90.0 ANLS and 50.3 mAP on FUNSD, 85.5 ANLS and 60.2 mAP on CORD, and 93.1 ANLS on SROIE, surpassing the previous best method (DLaVA) by +2.8 ANLS and +3.9 mAP on DocVQA. Our work demonstrates how agentic orchestration of specialized tools can simultaneously improve performance and interpretability, providing a pathway toward trustworthy, explainable document AI systems.

*Haoming Wang,Qiyao Xue,Wei Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfiniBench is a fully automated benchmark generator that creates diverse 3D scenes for evaluating vision-language models' spatial reasoning abilities with customizable scene complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for evaluating VLMs' spatial reasoning lack customizability over scene complexity and cannot isolate specific failure modes under different spatial conditions.

Method: Uses three innovations: 1) LLM-based agentic framework for refining procedural scene constraints, 2) cluster-based layout optimizer for dense cluttered scenes, 3) task-aware camera trajectory optimization for full object coverage in videos.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art procedural and LLM-based 3D generation methods in prompt fidelity and physical plausibility, especially in high-complexity scenarios.

Conclusion: InfiniBench enables generation of theoretically infinite 3D scenes for comprehensive evaluation of VLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities across various tasks like measurement, perspective-taking, and spatiotemporal tracking.

Abstract: Modern vision-language models (VLMs) are expected to have abilities of spatial reasoning with diverse scene complexities, but evaluating such abilities is difficult due to the lack of benchmarks that are not only diverse and scalable but also fully customizable. Existing benchmarks offer limited customizability over the scene complexity and are incapable of isolating and analyzing specific VLM failure modes under distinct spatial conditions. To address this gap, instead of individually presenting benchmarks for different scene complexities, in this paper we present InfiniBench, a fully automated, customizable and user-friendly benchmark generator that can synthesize a theoretically infinite variety of 3D scenes with parameterized control on scene complexity. InfiniBench uniquely translates scene descriptions in natural language into photo-realistic videos with complex and physically plausible 3D layouts. This is achieved through three key innovations: 1) a LLM-based agentic framework that iteratively refines procedural scene constraints from scene descriptions; 2) a flexible cluster-based layout optimizer that generates dense and cluttered scenes previously intractable for procedural methods; and 3) a task-aware camera trajectory optimization method that renders scenes into videos with full object coverage as VLM input. Experiments demonstrate that InfiniBench outperforms state-of-the-art procedural and LLM-based 3D generation methods in prompt fidelity and physical plausibility, especially in high-complexity scenarios. We further showcased the usefulness of InfiniBench, by generating benchmarks for representative spatial reasoning tasks including measurement, perspective-taking and spatiotemporal tracking.

TL;DR: DIA framework uses latent diffusion models to generate high-quality synthetic day 5 blastocyst images with granular control over morphological categories and focal depth, addressing data scarcity and class imbalance in IVF embryo assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current IVF blastocyst assessment is subjective and inconsistent, while AI models require large, diverse datasets that are unavailable due to data scarcity, class imbalance, and privacy constraints. Existing generative models have limitations in image quality, training data size, and clinical relevance.

Method: Developed Diffusion Based Imaging Model for Artificial Blastocysts (DIA) - latent diffusion models conditioned on Gardner-based morphological categories and z-axis focal depth. Evaluated using FID, memorization metrics, embryologist Turing test, and downstream classification tasks.

Result: Generated realistic images indistinguishable from real images by embryologists. Synthetic data augmentation significantly improved classification accuracy on imbalanced datasets (p < 0.05). Synthetic data could replace up to 40% of real data without significant accuracy loss, and improved performance even on large, balanced datasets.

Conclusion: DIA provides a robust solution for mitigating data scarcity and class imbalance in embryo datasets, enabling improved performance, fairness, and standardization of AI embryo assessment tools through novel, high-fidelity synthetic image generation.

Abstract: The success of in vitro fertilization (IVF) at many clinics relies on the accurate morphological assessment of day 5 blastocysts, a process that is often subjective and inconsistent. While artificial intelligence can help standardize this evaluation, models require large, diverse, and balanced datasets, which are often unavailable due to data scarcity, natural class imbalance, and privacy constraints. Existing generative embryo models can mitigate these issues but face several limitations, such as poor image quality, small training datasets, non-robust evaluation, and lack of clinically relevant image generation for effective data augmentation. Here, we present the Diffusion Based Imaging Model for Artificial Blastocysts (DIA) framework, a set of latent diffusion models trained to generate high-fidelity, novel day 5 blastocyst images. Our models provide granular control by conditioning on Gardner-based morphological categories and z-axis focal depth. We rigorously evaluated the models using FID, a memorization metric, an embryologist Turing test, and three downstream classification tasks. Our results show that DIA models generate realistic images that embryologists could not reliably distinguish from real images. Most importantly, we demonstrated clear clinical value. Augmenting an imbalanced dataset with synthetic images significantly improved classification accuracy (p < 0.05). Also, adding synthetic images to an already large, balanced dataset yielded statistically significant performance gains, and synthetic data could replace up to 40% of real data in some cases without a statistically significant loss in accuracy. DIA provides a robust solution for mitigating data scarcity and class imbalance in embryo datasets. By generating novel, high-fidelity, and controllable synthetic images, our models can improve the performance, fairness, and standardization of AI embryo assessment tools.

TL;DR: Self-supervised learning on unlabeled brain MRI data combined with multimodal fine-tuning achieves high accuracy in differentiating radiation necrosis from tumor progression, outperforming supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Differentiating radiation necrosis from tumor progression after stereotactic radiosurgery is clinically critical but challenging. Histopathology is invasive, and supervised deep learning is limited by scarce biopsy-confirmed training data.

Method: Two-phase deep learning: 1) Vision Transformer pre-trained via self-supervised learning on 10,167 unlabeled T1CE MRI sub-volumes, 2) Fine-tuned for RN classification using two-channel input (T1CE MRI + segmentation masks) on MOLAB dataset with internal and external validation.

Result: Self-supervised model achieved AUC 0.916 (same-center) and 0.764 (external), significantly outperforming supervised ViT (AUC 0.624/0.496) and radiomics (AUC 0.807/0.691). Multimodal integration further improved performance (AUC 0.947/0.821).

Conclusion: Large-scale pre-training on unlabeled brain metastases datasets substantially improves AI performance. The two-phase multimodal strategy provides an interpretable, clinically accessible solution for differentiating radiation necrosis from tumor progression.

Abstract: Background: Differentiating radiation necrosis (RN) from tumor progression after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) remains a critical challenge in brain metastases. While histopathology represents the gold standard, its invasiveness limits feasibility. Conventional supervised deep learning approaches are constrained by scarce biopsy-confirmed training data. Self-supervised learning (SSL) overcomes this by leveraging the growing availability of large-scale unlabeled brain metastases imaging datasets. Methods: In a two-phase deep learning strategy inspired by the foundation model paradigm, a Vision Transformer (ViT) was pre-trained via SSL on 10,167 unlabeled multi-source T1CE MRI sub-volumes. The pre-trained ViT was then fine-tuned for RN classification using a two-channel input (T1CE MRI and segmentation masks) on the public MOLAB dataset (n=109) using 20% of datasets as same-center held-out test set. External validation was performed on a second-center test cohort (n=28). Results: The self-supervised model achieved an AUC of 0.916 on the same-center test set and 0.764 on the second center test set, surpassing the fully supervised ViT (AUC 0.624/0.496; p=0.001/0.008) and radiomics (AUC 0.807/0.691; p=0.005/0.014). Multimodal integration further improved performance (AUC 0.947/0.821; p=0.073/0.001). Attention map visualizations enabled interpretability showing the model focused on clinically relevant lesion subregions. Conclusion: Large-scale pre-training on increasingly available unlabeled brain metastases datasets substantially improves AI model performance. A two-phase multimodal deep learning strategy achieved high accuracy in differentiating radiation necrosis from tumor progression using only routine T1CE MRI and standard clinical data, providing an interpretable, clinically accessible solution that warrants further validation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a structured and reusable approach for optimizing 2D convolutions within MLIR's compilation infrastructure, combining static shape analysis with tiling and packing strategies.

Method: Uses SConvOp to lower Linalg convolutions into tiled and packed generic operations through a declarative pipeline guided by Convolution Slicing Analysis, which determines tile sizes and layouts based on input shapes and target architecture parameters.

Result: Achieves up to 60% of peak performance on ARM SME and 67% on Intel AVX512 for standard convolution configurations, demonstrating effective combination of static analysis with structured optimization strategies.

Conclusion: The approach validates the benefits of combining static shape analysis with structured tiling and packing in MLIR, with modular design enabling future extensions and continued optimization of convolution workloads.

Abstract: This paper proposes SConvTransform, a Transform dialect extension that provides operations for optimizing 2D convolutions in MLIR. Its main operation, SConvOp, lowers Linalg convolutions into tiled and packed generic operations through a fully declarative transformation pipeline. The process is guided by a Convolution Slicing Analysis that determines tile sizes and data layout strategies based on input and filter shapes, as well as target architecture parameters. SConvOp handles edge cases by splitting irregular regions and adjusting affine maps where needed. All packing and tiling operations are derived from a parametric set of affine equations, enabling reusable and analyzable transformations. Although functional correctness was the primary goal of this work, the experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of SConvTransform, achieving good enough performance across different target architectures. Future work will focus on optimizing performance and porting to other target devices. When applied to standard convolution configurations, the generated code achieves up to 60% of peak performance on ARM SME and 67% on Intel AVX512. These results validate the benefit of combining static shape analysis with structured tiling and packing strategies within the MLIR Transform dialect. Furthermore, the modular design of SConvTransform facilitates integration with future extensions, enabling continued optimization of convolution workloads through MLIR's extensible compilation infrastructure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI acquisitions require long scan times, limiting patient throughput and increasing motion artifacts. Traditional methods like SENSE require both undersampled data and pre-computed coil sensitivity maps.

Method: Two-module architecture: Coil Sensitivity Map estimation module and U-Net-based MRI reconstruction module, trained on multi-coil brain MRI data from 10 subjects with 8 echoes each.

Result: Produces visually smoother reconstructions compared to conventional SENSE, achieving comparable visual quality despite lower PSNR/SSIM metrics. Identifies challenges with spatial misalignment between acceleration factors.

Conclusion: Proposed framework successfully reconstructs MRI images from only undersampled k-space measurements, with promising visual results and identified areas for future improvement in reconstruction quality.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) acquisitions require extensive scan times, limiting patient throughput and increasing susceptibility to motion artifacts. Accelerated parallel MRI techniques reduce acquisition time by undersampling k-space data, but require robust reconstruction methods to recover high-quality images. Traditional approaches like SENSE require both undersampled k-space data and pre-computed coil sensitivity maps. We propose an end-to-end deep learning framework that jointly estimates coil sensitivity maps and reconstructs images from only undersampled k-space measurements at 4x acceleration. Our two-module architecture consists of a Coil Sensitivity Map (CSM) estimation module and a U-Net-based MRI reconstruction module. We evaluate our method on multi-coil brain MRI data from 10 subjects with 8 echoes each, using 2x SENSE reconstructions as ground truth. Our approach produces visually smoother reconstructions compared to conventional SENSE output, achieving comparable visual quality despite lower PSNR/SSIM metrics. We identify key challenges including spatial misalignment between different acceleration factors and propose future directions for improved reconstruction quality.

TL;DR: EgoVITA is a reinforcement learning framework that enables multimodal LLMs to reason about intentions and actions from first-person perspectives by alternating between egocentric planning and exocentric verification phases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reasoning about intentions and actions from first-person (egocentric) perspective is challenging for MLLMs due to partial observability, limited field of view, and self-referenced motion in egocentric videos.

Method: Built on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), EgoVITA alternates between: (1) egocentric planning phase - reasoning from first-person viewpoint to predict step-by-step future actions, and (2) exocentric verification phase - switching to third-person perspective to check visual and logical consistency of plans.

Result: EgoVITA achieves significant gains on egocentric reasoning tasks, outperforming baseline Qwen2.5-VL-7B by +7.7 on EgoBlind and +4.4 on EgoOrient, while maintaining strong generalization on exocentric video tasks.

Conclusion: The framework enables MLLMs to make plans that are causally predictive of upcoming visual observations, leading to more coherent and visually grounded reasoning for egocentric perspectives.

Abstract: Reasoning about intentions and actions from a first-person (egocentric) perspective remains a fundamental challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Unlike third-person (exocentric) videos that capture scenes from an outside observer, egocentric videos reflect the actor's continuously changing viewpoint, introducing partial observability, limited field of view, and self-referenced motion. We introduce $\textbf{EgoVITA}$, a reinforcement learning framework that enables MLLMs to reason through structured planning and verification. Built on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), EgoVITA alternates between two stages: (1) an $\textbf{egocentric planning phase}$, where the model reasons from a first-person viewpoint to predict a step-by-step plan of future actions, and (2) an $\textbf{exocentric verification phase}$, where it switches to a third-person perspective to check the visual and logical consistency of that plan. Through GRPO, the model learns to make plans that are causally predictive of upcoming visual observations, leading to more coherent and visually grounded reasoning. EgoVITA achieves significant gains on egocentric reasoning tasks, outperforming the baseline Qwen2.5-VL-7B by $\mathbf{+7.7}$ on EgoBlind and $\mathbf{+4.4}$ on EgoOrient, while maintaining strong generalization on exocentric video tasks.

Result: Establishes new SOTA on Waymo (+5.1%) and nuScenes (+35.2%), and achieves SOTA on unseen datasets like TruckScenes (+30.1% over prior models).

Conclusion: Motion estimation is less sensitive to sensor configuration than other LiDAR tasks, and cross-dataset training significantly improves scene flow performance across diverse sensors.

Abstract: LiDAR scene flow is the task of estimating per-point 3D motion between consecutive point clouds. Recent methods achieve centimeter-level accuracy on popular autonomous vehicle (AV) datasets, but are typically only trained and evaluated on a single sensor. In this paper, we aim to learn general motion priors that transfer to diverse and unseen LiDAR sensors. However, prior work in LiDAR semantic segmentation and 3D object detection demonstrate that naively training on multiple datasets yields worse performance than single dataset models. Interestingly, we find that this conventional wisdom does not hold for motion estimation, and that state-of-the-art scene flow methods greatly benefit from cross-dataset training. We posit that low-level tasks such as motion estimation may be less sensitive to sensor configuration; indeed, our analysis shows that models trained on fast-moving objects (e.g., from highway datasets) perform well on fast-moving objects, even across different datasets. Informed by our analysis, we propose UniFlow, a family of feedforward models that unifies and trains on multiple large-scale LiDAR scene flow datasets with diverse sensor placements and point cloud densities. Our frustratingly simple solution establishes a new state-of-the-art on Waymo and nuScenes, improving over prior work by 5.1% and 35.2% respectively. Moreover, UniFlow achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on unseen datasets like TruckScenes, outperforming prior TruckScenes-specific models by 30.1%.

TL;DR: SAVi-DNO adapts diffusion-based video prediction models to continuous video streams by optimizing diffusion noise during inference instead of fine-tuning model parameters, improving performance on long videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage continuously arriving training samples in video streams to improve prediction performance without expensive model fine-tuning.

Method: Refines diffusion noise during inference while keeping model parameters frozen, allowing adaptive determination of suitable sampling noise for video prediction.

Result: Shows improved performance on FVD, SSIM, and PSNR metrics across Ego4D, OpenDV-YouTube, UCF-101, and SkyTimelapse datasets.

Conclusion: SAVi-DNO effectively adapts diffusion models to continuous video streams through noise optimization, demonstrating enhanced prediction quality on long videos.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate diffusion-based video prediction models, which forecast future video frames, for continuous video streams. In this context, the models observe continuously new training samples, and we aim to leverage this to improve their predictions. We thus propose an approach that continuously adapts a pre-trained diffusion model to a video stream. Since fine-tuning the parameters of a large diffusion model is too expensive, we refine the diffusion noise during inference while keeping the model parameters frozen, allowing the model to adaptively determine suitable sampling noise. We term the approach Sequence Adaptive Video Prediction with Diffusion Noise Optimization (SAVi-DNO). To validate our approach, we introduce a new evaluation setting on the Ego4D dataset, focusing on simultaneous adaptation and evaluation on long continuous videos. Empirical results demonstrate improved performance based on FVD, SSIM, and PSNR metrics on long videos of Ego4D and OpenDV-YouTube, as well as videos of UCF-101 and SkyTimelapse, showcasing SAVi-DNO's effectiveness.

TL;DR: Mammoth2 is a unified AR-Diffusion framework that combines autoregressive semantic planning with diffusion-based generation for multimodal understanding and synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between discrete semantic reasoning and high-fidelity visual synthesis in unified multimodal models.

Method: Serial design with AR path for semantic modeling and DiT decoder for image synthesis, using AR-Diffusion feature alignment and trained with joint objectives plus supervised fine-tuning and RL.

Result: Achieves strong performance on generation and editing benchmarks (0.87 GenEval, 87.2 DPGBench, 4.06 ImgEdit) while maintaining competitive multimodal understanding.

Conclusion: Carefully coupled AR-Diffusion architecture enables high-fidelity generation/editing with strong multimodal comprehension in a single parameter-efficient model.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models aim to integrate understanding and generation within a single framework, yet bridging the gap between discrete semantic reasoning and high-fidelity visual synthesis remains challenging. We present MammothModa2 (Mammoth2), a unified autoregressive-diffusion (AR-Diffusion) framework designed to effectively couple autoregressive semantic planning with diffusion-based generation. Mammoth2 adopts a serial design: an AR path equipped with generation experts performs global semantic modeling over discrete tokens, while a single-stream Diffusion Transformer (DiT) decoder handles high-fidelity image synthesis. A carefully designed AR-Diffusion feature alignment module combines multi-layer feature aggregation, unified condition encoding, and in-context conditioning to stably align AR's representations with the diffusion decoder's continuous latents. Mammoth2 is trained end-to-end with joint Next-Token Prediction and Flow Matching objectives, followed by supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning over both generation and editing. With roughly 60M supervised generation samples and no reliance on pre-trained generators, Mammoth2 delivers strong text-to-image and instruction-based editing performance on public benchmarks, achieving 0.87 on GenEval, 87.2 on DPGBench, and 4.06 on ImgEdit, while remaining competitive with understanding-only backbones (e.g., Qwen3-VL-8B) on multimodal understanding tasks. These results suggest that a carefully coupled AR-Diffusion architecture can provide high-fidelity generation and editing while maintaining strong multimodal comprehension within a single, parameter- and data-efficient model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing satellite video tracking methods require scenario-specific training and struggle with generalization and occlusion, limiting their practical application in remote sensing.

Method: Built on SAM2 foundation model, SatSAM2 introduces Kalman Filter-based Constrained Motion Module (KFCMM) for temporal motion cues and Motion-Constrained State Machine (MCSM) for tracking state regulation. Also creates MVOT benchmark with 1,500+ sequences.

Result: Outperforms traditional and foundation model-based trackers including SAM2 variants. Achieves 5.84% AUC improvement on OOTB dataset compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SatSAM2 demonstrates effective adaptation of foundation models to satellite video tracking with superior performance, and the MVOT benchmark enables large-scale evaluation for future research.

Abstract: Existing satellite video tracking methods often struggle with generalization, requiring scenario-specific training to achieve satisfactory performance, and are prone to track loss in the presence of occlusion. To address these challenges, we propose SatSAM2, a zero-shot satellite video tracker built on SAM2, designed to adapt foundation models to the remote sensing domain. SatSAM2 introduces two core modules: a Kalman Filter-based Constrained Motion Module (KFCMM) to exploit temporal motion cues and suppress drift, and a Motion-Constrained State Machine (MCSM) to regulate tracking states based on motion dynamics and reliability. To support large-scale evaluation, we propose MatrixCity Video Object Tracking (MVOT), a synthetic benchmark containing 1,500+ sequences and 157K annotated frames with diverse viewpoints, illumination, and occlusion conditions. Extensive experiments on two satellite tracking benchmarks and MVOT show that SatSAM2 outperforms both traditional and foundation model-based trackers, including SAM2 and its variants. Notably, on the OOTB dataset, SatSAM2 achieves a 5.84% AUC improvement over state-of-the-art methods. Our code and dataset will be publicly released to encourage further research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing T2I evaluation protocols focus on compositional alignment or single-round VQA scoring, leaving knowledge grounding, multi-physics interactions, and auditable evidence substantially undertested.

Method: Proposed PicWorld benchmark with 1,100 prompts across three categories, and PW-Agent - an evidence-grounded multi-agent evaluator that hierarchically assesses images by decomposing prompts into verifiable visual evidence.

Result: Analysis of 17 mainstream T2I models shows they universally exhibit fundamental limitations in implicit world knowledge and physical causal reasoning to varying degrees.

Conclusion: There is a need for reasoning-aware, knowledge-integrative architectures in future T2I systems to address these limitations.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models today are capable of producing photorealistic, instruction-following images, yet they still frequently fail on prompts that require implicit world knowledge. Existing evaluation protocols either emphasize compositional alignment or rely on single-round VQA-based scoring, leaving critical dimensions such as knowledge grounding, multi-physics interactions, and auditable evidence-substantially undertested. To address these limitations, we introduce PicWorld, the first comprehensive benchmark that assesses the grasp of implicit world knowledge and physical causal reasoning of T2I models. This benchmark consists of 1,100 prompts across three core categories. To facilitate fine-grained evaluation, we propose PW-Agent, an evidence-grounded multi-agent evaluator to hierarchically assess images on their physical realism and logical consistency by decomposing prompts into verifiable visual evidence. We conduct a thorough analysis of 17 mainstream T2I models on PicWorld, illustrating that they universally exhibit a fundamental limitation in their capacity for implicit world knowledge and physical causal reasoning to varying degrees. The findings highlight the need for reasoning-aware, knowledge-integrative architectures in future T2I systems.

*Richard J. Young*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision token masking in VLMs achieves 42.9% PHI reduction for medical OCR but fails on structured identifiers, showing limits of vision-only privacy and need for hybrid approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy concerns about protected health information (PHI) exposure when using large vision-language models for optical character recognition in healthcare settings.

Method: Systematic evaluation of seven vision token masking strategies targeting different architectural layers (SAM encoder blocks, compression layers, dual vision encoders, projector fusion) using DeepSeek-OCR on synthetic medical documents.

Result: All masking strategies converged to 42.9% PHI reduction - effective for long-form spatially-distributed identifiers (100% success) but failed for short structured identifiers (0% success). Hybrid vision masking + NLP achieved 88.6% reduction.

Conclusion: Vision-only privacy interventions have fundamental limits due to language model contextual inference; future work should focus on decoder-level fine-tuning and hybrid defense-in-depth architectures for HIPAA compliance.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed for optical character recognition (OCR) in healthcare settings, raising critical concerns about protected health information (PHI) exposure during document processing. This work presents the first systematic evaluation of inference-time vision token masking as a privacy-preserving mechanism for medical document OCR using DeepSeek-OCR. We introduce seven masking strategies (V3-V9) targeting different architectural layers (SAM encoder blocks, compression layers, dual vision encoders, projector fusion) and evaluate PHI reduction across HIPAA-defined categories using 100 synthetic medical billing statements (drawn from a corpus of 38,517 annotated documents) with perfect ground-truth annotations. All masking strategies converge to 42.9% PHI reduction, successfully suppressing long-form spatially-distributed identifiers (patient names, dates of birth, physical addresses at 100% effectiveness) while failing to prevent short structured identifiers (medical record numbers, social security numbers, email addresses, account numbers at 0% effectiveness). Ablation studies varying mask expansion radius (r=1,2,3) demonstrate that increased spatial coverage does not improve reduction beyond this ceiling, indicating that language model contextual inference - not insufficient visual masking - drives structured identifier leakage. A simulated hybrid architecture combining vision masking with NLP post-processing achieves 88.6% total PHI reduction (assuming 80% NLP accuracy on remaining identifiers). This negative result establishes boundaries for vision-only privacy interventions in VLMs, provides guidance distinguishing PHI types amenable to vision-level versus language-level redaction, and redirects future research toward decoder-level fine-tuning and hybrid defense-in-depth architectures for HIPAA-compliant medical document processing.

TL;DR: Proposes Point-to-Point method using anchor tokens for better motion preservation in video editing, achieving superior edit and motion fidelity across diverse scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video editing methods struggle with balancing edit quality and motion preservation, often relying on motion representations that are either overfitted or implicitly defined.

Method: Introduces anchor tokens - a novel motion representation that captures essential motion patterns using informative point trajectories from video diffusion model priors, allowing flexible relocation to align with new subjects.

Result: Extensive experiments show anchor tokens enable more controllable and semantically aligned video edits with superior performance in both edit and motion fidelity.

Conclusion: Anchor tokens provide an effective motion representation that overcomes limitations of existing methods, enabling high-quality video editing while preserving motion across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Accurately preserving motion while editing a subject remains a core challenge in video editing tasks. Existing methods often face a trade-off between edit and motion fidelity, as they rely on motion representations that are either overfitted to the layout or only implicitly defined. To overcome this limitation, we revisit point-based motion representation. However, identifying meaningful points remains challenging without human input, especially across diverse video scenarios. To address this, we propose a novel motion representation, anchor tokens, that capture the most essential motion patterns by leveraging the rich prior of a video diffusion model. Anchor tokens encode video dynamics compactly through a small number of informative point trajectories and can be flexibly relocated to align with new subjects. This allows our method, Point-to-Point, to generalize across diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that anchor tokens lead to more controllable and semantically aligned video edits, achieving superior performance in terms of edit and motion fidelity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Uni-DAD is a single-stage pipeline that unifies distillation and adaptation of diffusion models, enabling fast and high-quality generation for novel domains without the complexity of two-stage approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches for fast generation in new domains require two-stage training (Adapt-then-Distill or Distill-then-Adapt), which adds complexity and suffers from degraded quality or diversity.

Method: Combines dual-domain distribution-matching distillation (guiding student toward source and target teacher distributions) with multi-head GAN loss for target realism across multiple feature scales.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art adaptation methods with less than 4 sampling steps, and beats two-stage pipelines in both quality and diversity across few-shot image generation and subject-driven personalization tasks.

Conclusion: Uni-DAD provides an effective single-stage solution for fast domain adaptation of diffusion models, preserving source knowledge while enabling high-quality generation in target domains.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) produce high-quality images, yet their sampling remains costly when adapted to new domains. Distilled DMs are faster but typically remain confined within their teacher's domain. Thus, fast and high-quality generation for novel domains relies on two-stage training pipelines: Adapt-then-Distill or Distill-then-Adapt. However, both add design complexity and suffer from degraded quality or diversity. We introduce Uni-DAD, a single-stage pipeline that unifies distillation and adaptation of DMs. It couples two signals during training: (i) a dual-domain distribution-matching distillation objective that guides the student toward the distributions of the source teacher and a target teacher, and (ii) a multi-head generative adversarial network (GAN) loss that encourages target realism across multiple feature scales. The source domain distillation preserves diverse source knowledge, while the multi-head GAN stabilizes training and reduces overfitting, especially in few-shot regimes. The inclusion of a target teacher facilitates adaptation to more structurally distant domains. We perform evaluations on a variety of datasets for few-shot image generation (FSIG) and subject-driven personalization (SDP). Uni-DAD delivers higher quality than state-of-the-art (SoTA) adaptation methods even with less than 4 sampling steps, and outperforms two-stage training pipelines in both quality and diversity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current roadside perception systems lack natural language interaction capabilities and cannot reason about traffic behaviors in context, limiting their practical utility for intelligent transportation systems.

Method: Proposed RoadSceneVQA dataset with 34,736 QA pairs, CogniAnchor Fusion (CAF) for vision-language fusion inspired by human scene anchoring, and Assisted Decoupled Chain-of-Thought (AD-CoT) for enhanced reasoning via CoT prompting and multi-task learning.

Result: The proposed RoadMind pipeline consistently improves reasoning accuracy and computational efficiency, achieving state-of-the-art performance on RoadSceneVQA and CODA-LM benchmarks for structural traffic perception and reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: RoadSceneVQA bridges the gap between instance-level perception and contextual reasoning in roadside scenarios, while the proposed methods enable MLLMs to effectively perform both explicit recognition and implicit commonsense reasoning grounded in real-world traffic rules.

Abstract: Current roadside perception systems mainly focus on instance-level perception, which fall short in enabling interaction via natural language and reasoning about traffic behaviors in context. To bridge this gap, we introduce RoadSceneVQA, a large-scale and richly annotated visual question answering (VQA) dataset specifically tailored for roadside scenarios. The dataset comprises 34,736 diverse QA pairs collected under varying weather, illumination, and traffic conditions, targeting not only object attributes but also the intent, legality, and interaction patterns of traffic participants. RoadSceneVQA challenges models to perform both explicit recognition and implicit commonsense reasoning, grounded in real-world traffic rules and contextual dependencies. To fully exploit the reasoning potential of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), we further propose CogniAnchor Fusion (CAF), a vision-language fusion module inspired by human-like scene anchoring mechanisms. Moreover, we propose the Assisted Decoupled Chain-of-Thought (AD-CoT) to enhance the reasoned thinking via CoT prompting and multi-task learning. Based on the above, we propose the baseline model RoadMind. Experiments on RoadSceneVQA and CODA-LM benchmark show that the pipeline consistently improves both reasoning accuracy and computational efficiency, allowing the MLLM to achieve state-of-the-art performance in structural traffic perception and reasoning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency in large-scale 3D reconstruction, where existing methods either sacrifice quality for speed or vice versa.

Method: Proposes training-free approach with loop closure without VPR models, and uses Sim(3)-based SVD for point sampling instead of IRLS optimization to align neighboring chunks.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality while requiring only 33% of the inference time compared to recent VGGT-based approaches, enabling accurate reconstruction over kilometer-scale environments.

Conclusion: SwiftVGGT successfully bridges the accuracy-efficiency gap in large-scale 3D reconstruction through its training-free design and optimized computational methods.

Abstract: 3D reconstruction in large-scale scenes is a fundamental task in 3D perception, but the inherent trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency remains a significant challenge. Existing methods either prioritize speed and produce low-quality results, or achieve high-quality reconstruction at the cost of slow inference times. In this paper, we propose SwiftVGGT, a training-free method that significantly reduce inference time while preserving high-quality dense 3D reconstruction. To maintain global consistency in large-scale scenes, SwiftVGGT performs loop closure without relying on the external Visual Place Recognition (VPR) model. This removes redundant computation and enables accurate reconstruction over kilometer-scale environments. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective point sampling method to align neighboring chunks using a single Sim(3)-based Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) step. This eliminates the need for the Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS) optimization commonly used in prior work, leading to substantial speed-ups. We evaluate SwiftVGGT on multiple datasets and show that it achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality while requiring only 33% of the inference time of recent VGGT-based large-scale reconstruction approaches.

TL;DR: DiVE-k is a framework that uses top-k predictions to create multiple-choice questions for training LVLMs, enabling fine-grained differential reasoning and improving generalization to unseen classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs struggle with fine-grained image recognition and existing RL methods encourage memorization rather than differential reasoning needed for generalization.

Method: Uses model's top-k predictions to create multiple-choice questions, then applies RL to train the model to select the correct answer among plausible options.

Result: Outperforms existing approaches by 10.04% and 6.16% on Harmonic Mean metric, with gains in mixed-domain and few-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: DiVE-k effectively improves fine-grained recognition by leveraging differential reasoning among plausible options, reducing memorization and enhancing generalization.

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) possess extensive text knowledge but struggles to utilize this knowledge for fine-grained image recognition, often failing to differentiate between visually similar categories. Existing fine-tuning methods using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with exact-match reward signals are often brittle, encourage memorization of training categories, and fail to elicit differential reasoning needed for generalization to unseen classes. To address this, we propose $\textbf{DiVE-k}$, $\textbf{Di}$fferential $\textbf{V}$isual r$\textbf{E}$asoning using top-$\textbf{k}$ generations, framework that leverages model's own top-k predictions as a training signal. For each training image, DiVE-k creates a multiple-choice question from the model's top-k outputs and uses RL to train the model to select the correct answer. This approach requires the model to perform fine-grained differential reasoning among plausible options and provides a simple, verifiable reward signal that mitigates memorization and improves generalization. Experiments on five standard fine-grained datasets show that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches. In the standard base-to-novel generalization setting, DiVE-k surpasses the QWEN2.5-VL-7B and ViRFT by 10.04% and 6.16% on the Harmonic Mean metric, respectively. Further experiments show similar gains in mixed-domain and few-shot scenarios.

TL;DR: A unified framework for styled handwriting generation using Vision Transformer-based style encoder and cross-attention mechanism to capture global stylistic patterns and produce more coherent handwriting synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches struggle to capture full spectrum of writer-specific attributes, particularly global stylistic patterns with long-range spatial dependencies, making it difficult to maintain consistent writer-specific traits while keeping text accurate.

Method: Vision Transformer-based style encoder learns global stylistic patterns from multiple reference images, integrated with target text using cross-attention mechanism, with Salient Stroke Attention Analysis for interpretability.

Result: The framework produces handwritten images that more faithfully reflect intended style with better stylistic coherence and interpretability through stroke-level feature analysis.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enables more stylistically coherent handwriting synthesis that is easier to understand and analyze, addressing limitations in capturing writer-specific global patterns.

Abstract: Styled handwriting generation aims to synthesize handwritten text that looks both realistic and aligned with a specific writer's style. While recent approaches involving GAN, transformer and diffusion-based models have made progress, they often struggle to capture the full spectrum of writer-specific attributes, particularly global stylistic patterns that span long-range spatial dependencies. As a result, capturing subtle writer-specific traits such as consistent slant, curvature or stroke pressure, while keeping the generated text accurate is still an open problem. In this work, we present a unified framework designed to address these limitations. We introduce a Vision Transformer-based style encoder that learns global stylistic patterns from multiple reference images, allowing the model to better represent long-range structural characteristics of handwriting. We then integrate these style cues with the target text using a cross-attention mechanism, enabling the system to produce handwritten images that more faithfully reflect the intended style. To make the process more interpretable, we utilize Salient Stroke Attention Analysis (SSAA), which reveals the stroke-level features the model focuses on during style transfer. Together, these components lead to handwriting synthesis that is not only more stylistically coherent, but also easier to understand and analyze.

Motivation: Current stereo calibration methods lack intuitive optimal pose guidance, leading to inefficiency and suboptimal accuracy in deformation measurements.

Method: Pose optimization method with joint optimization of relative and absolute extrinsic parameters, using minimization of covariance matrix trace as loss function, integrated with user-friendly graphical interface.

Result: Superior efficiency (fewer images required) and accuracy (lower measurement errors) compared to random pose methods, with robustness across varying FOVs. High agreement with FEA simulations in thermal deformation tests.

Conclusion: The proposed pose guidance method demonstrates significant application potential in 3D deformation measurement through simulation, real-world experiments, and thermal deformation applications.

Abstract: Stereo optical measurement techniques, such as digital image correlation (DIC), are widely used in 3D deformation measurement as non-contact, full-field measurement methods, in which stereo calibration is a crucial step. However, current stereo calibration methods lack intuitive optimal pose guidance, leading to inefficiency and suboptimal accuracy in deformation measurements. The aim of this study is to develop an interactive calibration framework that automatically generates the next optimal pose, enabling high-accuracy stereo calibration for 3D deformation measurement. We propose a pose optimization method that introduces joint optimization of relative and absolute extrinsic parameters, with the minimization of the covariance matrix trace adopted as the loss function to solve for the next optimal pose. Integrated with this method is a user-friendly graphical interface, which guides even non-expert users to capture qualified calibration images. Our proposed method demonstrates superior efficiency (requiring fewer images) and accuracy (demonstrating lower measurement errors) compared to random pose, while maintaining robustness across varying FOVs. In the thermal deformation measurement tests on an S-shaped specimen, the results exhibit high agreement with finite element analysis (FEA) simulations in both deformation magnitude and evolutionary trends. We present a pose guidance method for high-precision stereo calibration in 3D deformation measurement. The simulation experiments, real-world experiments, and thermal deformation measurement applications all demonstrate the significant application potential of our proposed method in the field of 3D deformation measurement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether domain-specific medical pretraining or general-purpose pretraining performs better for brain tumor detection from MRI scans when limited data is available.

Method: Systematically evaluated three CNN architectures under identical conditions: RadImageNet DenseNet121 (medical-domain pretrained), EfficientNetV2S, and ConvNeXt-Tiny (general-purpose pretrained), using a limited-size brain MRI dataset.

Result: ConvNeXt-Tiny achieved the highest accuracy, followed by EfficientNetV2S, while RadImageNet DenseNet121 showed poor generalization with lower accuracy and higher loss despite domain-specific pretraining.

Conclusion: Domain-specific pretraining may not generalize well under small-data conditions, while modern general-purpose CNNs pretrained on large-scale datasets offer superior transfer learning performance for medical imaging tasks.

Abstract: Brain tumor detection from MRI scans plays a crucial role in early diagnosis and treatment planning. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated strong performance in medical imaging tasks, particularly when pretrained on large datasets. However, it remains unclear which type of pretrained model performs better when only a small dataset is available: those trained on domain-specific medical data or those pretrained on large general datasets. In this study, we systematically evaluate three pretrained CNN architectures for brain tumor classification: RadImageNet DenseNet121 with medical-domain pretraining, EfficientNetV2S, and ConvNeXt-Tiny, which are modern general-purpose CNNs. All models were trained and fine-tuned under identical conditions using a limited-size brain MRI dataset to ensure a fair comparison. Our results reveal that ConvNeXt-Tiny achieved the highest accuracy, followed by EfficientNetV2S, while RadImageNet DenseNet121, despite being pretrained on domain-specific medical data, exhibited poor generalization with lower accuracy and higher loss. These findings suggest that domain-specific pretraining may not generalize well under small-data conditions. In contrast, modern, deeper general-purpose CNNs pretrained on large-scale datasets can offer superior transfer learning performance in specialized medical imaging tasks.

*Shohei Tanaka,Atsushi Hashimoto,Yoshitaka Ushiku*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new dataset called SciPostLayoutTree with 8,000 annotated scientific posters for reading order and parent-child relations analysis, plus a Layout Tree Decoder model that improves prediction of spatially challenging relations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientific posters are widely used in academic communication but underexplored in structural analysis research, which has mainly focused on papers. There's a need for structure-aware interfaces to facilitate better understanding of poster content.

Method: Created SciPostLayoutTree dataset with 8,000 posters annotated for reading order and parent-child relations. Developed Layout Tree Decoder model that incorporates visual features, bounding box features (position and category), and uses beam search to predict relations while capturing sequence-level plausibility.

Result: The model improves prediction accuracy for spatially challenging relations (upward, horizontal, long-distance) compared to existing datasets. Establishes a solid baseline for poster structure analysis.

Conclusion: SciPostLayoutTree addresses the gap in poster structural analysis research and provides a valuable resource for developing structure-aware interfaces for academic posters. The dataset and code are publicly available.

Abstract: Scientific posters play a vital role in academic communication by presenting ideas through visual summaries. Analyzing reading order and parent-child relations of posters is essential for building structure-aware interfaces that facilitate clear and accurate understanding of research content. Despite their prevalence in academic communication, posters remain underexplored in structural analysis research, which has primarily focused on papers. To address this gap, we constructed SciPostLayoutTree, a dataset of approximately 8,000 posters annotated with reading order and parent-child relations. Compared to an existing structural analysis dataset, SciPostLayoutTree contains more instances of spatially challenging relations, including upward, horizontal, and long-distance relations. As a solution to these challenges, we develop Layout Tree Decoder, which incorporates visual features as well as bounding box features including position and category information. The model also uses beam search to predict relations while capturing sequence-level plausibility. Experimental results demonstrate that our model improves the prediction accuracy for spatially challenging relations and establishes a solid baseline for poster structure analysis. The dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/omron-sinicx/scipostlayouttree. The code is also publicly available at https://github.com/omron-sinicx/scipostlayouttree.

*Xuanke Shi,Boxuan Li,Xiaoyang Han,Zhongang Cai,Lei Yang,Dahua Lin,Quan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ConsistCompose is a unified multimodal framework that embeds layout coordinates into language prompts for layout-controlled multi-instance image generation, addressing the underexplored area of linguistic-embedded layout-grounded generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most unified multimodal models focus on visual grounding (aligning language with image regions) while neglecting their generative counterpart - layout-controllable multi-instance generation, which limits precise compositional control in image generation.

Method: The framework embeds layout coordinates directly into language prompts using instance-coordinate binding prompts and coordinate-aware classifier-free guidance. It also constructs ConsistCompose3M, a 3.4M multi-instance generation dataset with layout and identity annotations for large-scale supervision.

Result: Experiments on COCO-Position and MS-Bench show that ConsistCompose substantially improves spatial accuracy over layout-controlled baselines while preserving identity fidelity and maintaining competitive general multimodal understanding.

Conclusion: ConsistCompose establishes a unified paradigm for layout-controllable multimodal image generation by translating linguistic layout cues into precise spatial control without requiring task-specific branches.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models that couple visual understanding with image generation have advanced rapidly, yet most systems still focus on visual grounding-aligning language with image regions-while their generative counterpart, linguistic-embedded layout-grounded generation (LELG) for layout-controllable multi-instance generation, remains underexplored and limits precise compositional control. We present ConsistCompose, a unified multimodal framework that embeds layout coordinates directly into language prompts, enabling layout-controlled multi-instance image generation from Interleaved Image-Text within a single generative interface. We further construct ConsistCompose3M, a 3.4M multi-instance generation dataset with layout and identity annotations (2.6M text-guided and 0.8M image-guided data pairs) that provides large-scale supervision for layout-conditioned generation. Within this framework, LELG is instantiated through instance-coordinate binding prompts and coordinate-aware classifier-free guidance, which translate linguistic layout cues into precise spatial control without task-specific branches. Experiments on COCO-Position and MS-Bench show that ConsistCompose substantially improves spatial accuracy over layout-controlled baselines while preserving identity fidelity and competitive general multimodal understanding, establishing a unified paradigm for layout-controllable multimodal image generation.

*Tianyang Xu,Jinjie Gu,Xuefeng Zhu,XiaoJun Wu,Josef Kittler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MM-UAV is the first large-scale multi-modal benchmark for UAV tracking, integrating RGB, IR, and event signals with 1,321 synchronized sequences across 30 scenarios. The paper also introduces a novel tracking framework with adaptive alignment and fusion modules, plus event-enhanced association for improved identity maintenance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single visual modality tracking often fails in challenging UAV scenarios like low illumination and cluttered backgrounds. The lack of dedicated public multi-modal datasets has hindered development of robust UAV tracking solutions.

Method: Proposed framework includes: 1) offset-guided adaptive alignment module for spatio mismatches, 2) adaptive dynamic fusion module for modality balancing, and 3) event-enhanced association mechanism using motion cues from event modality for identity maintenance.

Result: Comprehensive experiments show the proposed framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in multi-modal UAV tracking.

Conclusion: MM-UAV dataset and the proposed framework provide a foundation for future multi-modal UAV tracking research, with both resources being made publicly available.

Abstract: With the proliferation of low altitude unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), visual multi-object tracking is becoming a critical security technology, demanding significant robustness even in complex environmental conditions. However, tracking UAVs using a single visual modality often fails in challenging scenarios, such as low illumination, cluttered backgrounds, and rapid motion. Although multi-modal multi-object UAV tracking is more resilient, the development of effective solutions has been hindered by the absence of dedicated public datasets. To bridge this gap, we release MM-UAV, the first large-scale benchmark for Multi-Modal UAV Tracking, integrating three key sensing modalities, e.g. RGB, infrared (IR), and event signals. The dataset spans over 30 challenging scenarios, with 1,321 synchronised multi-modal sequences, and more than 2.8 million annotated frames. Accompanying the dataset, we provide a novel multi-modal multi-UAV tracking framework, designed specifically for UAV tracking applications and serving as a baseline for future research. Our framework incorporates two key technical innovations, e.g. an offset-guided adaptive alignment module to resolve spatio mismatches across sensors, and an adaptive dynamic fusion module to balance complementary information conveyed by different modalities. Furthermore, to overcome the limitations of conventional appearance modelling in multi-object tracking, we introduce an event-enhanced association mechanism that leverages motion cues from the event modality for more reliable identity maintenance. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. To foster further research in multi-modal UAV tracking, both the dataset and source code will be made publicly available at https://xuefeng-zhu5.github.io/MM-UAV/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video relighting methods struggle to balance temporal consistency, spatial fidelity, and illumination naturalness, which is critical for film production and creative media applications.

Method: Uses Residual-Corrected Flow mechanism to transform standard flow-based models into editing models, Decoupled Condition Design for precise lighting control, High-Frequency Transfer for detail preservation, and masking strategy for foreground-background separation.

Result: Achieves superior performance in temporal coherence, structural preservation, and lighting realism while maintaining high efficiency compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: FlowPortal provides an effective training-free solution for video relighting with background replacement that addresses key challenges in temporal consistency and illumination quality.

Abstract: Video relighting with background replacement is a challenging task critical for applications in film production and creative media. Existing methods struggle to balance temporal consistency, spatial fidelity, and illumination naturalness. To address these issues, we introduce FlowPortal, a novel training-free flow-based video relighting framework. Our core innovation is a Residual-Corrected Flow mechanism that transforms a standard flow-based model into an editing model, guaranteeing perfect reconstruction when input conditions are identical and enabling faithful relighting when they differ, resulting in high structural consistency. This is further enhanced by a Decoupled Condition Design for precise lighting control and a High-Frequency Transfer mechanism for detail preservation. Additionally, a masking strategy isolates foreground relighting from background pure generation process. Experiments demonstrate that FlowPortal achieves superior performance in temporal coherence, structural preservation, and lighting realism, while maintaining high efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MagicWand is a universal AIGC agent that enhances prompt generation and content evaluation based on user preferences, trained on the UniPrefer-100K dataset and evaluated on UniPreferBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Users struggle to obtain AIGC content that aligns with their preferences due to difficulty in crafting detailed prompts and lack of preference retention mechanisms.

Method: Construct UniPrefer-100K dataset with images, videos and preference text; develop MagicWand agent for preference-based prompt enhancement, content generation, and evaluation refinement.

Result: MagicWand consistently generates preference-aligned content and evaluations across diverse scenarios, as demonstrated on UniPreferBench with 120K+ annotations.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses user preference alignment in AIGC through dataset construction, universal agent development, and comprehensive benchmarking.

Abstract: Recent advances in AIGC (Artificial Intelligence Generated Content) models have enabled significant progress in image and video generation. However, users still struggle to obtain content that aligns with their preferences due to the difficulty of crafting detailed prompts and the lack of mechanisms to retain their preferences. To address these challenges, we construct \textbf{UniPrefer-100K}, a large-scale dataset comprising images, videos, and associated text that describes the styles users tend to prefer. Based on UniPrefer-100K, we propose \textbf{MagicWand}, a universal generation and evaluation agent that enhances prompts based on user preferences, leverages advanced generation models for high-quality content, and applies preference-aligned evaluation and refinement. In addition, we introduce \textbf{UniPreferBench}, the first large-scale benchmark with over 120K annotations for assessing user preference alignment across diverse AIGC tasks. Experiments on UniPreferBench demonstrate that MagicWand consistently generates content and evaluations that are well aligned with user preferences across a wide range of scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces TRANSPORTER, a model-independent approach for logits-to-video (L2V) generation that visualizes Vision Language Models' internal reasoning processes by creating videos that reflect caption changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and control how video understanding models acquire their answers, as current VLMs reason over complex scenes but their internal processes remain poorly understood.

Method: TRANSPORTER learns an optimal transport coupling to VLM's semantic embedding spaces and uses logit scores to define embedding directions for conditional video generation, leveraging text-to-video models.

Result: TRANSPORTER successfully generates videos that reflect caption changes across diverse object attributes, action adverbs, and scene context, providing fidelity-rich interpretability.

Conclusion: The L2V task offers a novel direction for model interpretability that has not been previously explored, enabling better understanding of VLMs' internal reasoning processes.

Abstract: How do video understanding models acquire their answers? Although current Vision Language Models (VLMs) reason over complex scenes with diverse objects, action performances, and scene dynamics, understanding and controlling their internal processes remains an open challenge. Motivated by recent advancements in text-to-video (T2V) generative models, this paper introduces a logits-to-video (L2V) task alongside a model-independent approach, TRANSPORTER, to generate videos that capture the underlying rules behind VLMs' predictions. Given the high-visual-fidelity produced by T2V models, TRANSPORTER learns an optimal transport coupling to VLM's high-semantic embedding spaces. In turn, logit scores define embedding directions for conditional video generation. TRANSPORTER generates videos that reflect caption changes over diverse object attributes, action adverbs, and scene context. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations across VLMs demonstrate that L2V can provide a fidelity-rich, novel direction for model interpretability that has not been previously explored.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a frequency-aware 4D Gaussian Splatting method that eliminates aliasing artifacts when adjusting camera parameters, using a 4D scale-adaptive filter and scale loss to regulate sampling frequency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dynamic scene reconstruction methods using Gaussian Splatting suffer from strong artifacts when changing camera focal length or distance due to frequency constraints of 4D Gaussians and Gaussian scale mismatch from 2D dilated filters.

Method: Derived maximum sampling frequency formulation for 4D Gaussian Splatting, introduced 4D scale-adaptive filter and scale loss to flexibly regulate sampling frequency of 4D Gaussian Splatting.

Result: Eliminates high-frequency artifacts under increased rendering frequencies while reducing redundant Gaussians in multi-view video reconstruction, validated through monocular and multi-view video experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed frequency-aware approach successfully addresses aliasing issues in dynamic scene reconstruction while maintaining efficient Gaussian representation.

Abstract: Existing dynamic scene reconstruction methods based on Gaussian Splatting enable real-time rendering and generate realistic images. However, adjusting the camera's focal length or the distance between Gaussian primitives and the camera to modify rendering resolution often introduces strong artifacts, stemming from the frequency constraints of 4D Gaussians and Gaussian scale mismatch induced by the 2D dilated filter. To address this, we derive a maximum sampling frequency formulation for 4D Gaussian Splatting and introduce a 4D scale-adaptive filter and scale loss, which flexibly regulates the sampling frequency of 4D Gaussian Splatting. Our approach eliminates high-frequency artifacts under increased rendering frequencies while effectively reducing redundant Gaussians in multi-view video reconstruction. We validate the proposed method through monocular and multi-view video reconstruction experiments.Ours project page: https://4d-alias-free.github.io/4D-Alias-free/

### [132] [MimiCAT: Mimic with Correspondence-Aware Cascade-Transformer for Category-Free 3D Pose Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18370)
*Zenghao Chai,Chen Tang,Yongkang Wong,Xulei Yang,Mohan Kankanhalli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MimiCAT enables category-free 3D pose transfer across structurally diverse characters using semantic keypoints and cascade-transformer architecture, overcoming limitations of existing methods restricted to similar character types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D pose transfer methods fail to generalize across different character categories (e.g., humanoid to quadruped) due to structural and transformation diversity, leading to mismatched regions and poor transfer quality.

Method: Constructed million-scale pose dataset across hundreds of characters; proposed MimiCAT cascade-transformer model using semantic keypoint labels to learn soft correspondence for flexible many-to-many matching; formulated pose transfer as conditional generation with projection and refinement stages.

Result: Extensive experiments show MimiCAT transfers plausible poses across different characters, significantly outperforming prior methods limited to narrow category transfer.

Conclusion: MimiCAT successfully addresses category-free 3D pose transfer through soft correspondence learning and cascade-transformer architecture, enabling robust pose transfer across structurally diverse characters.

Abstract: 3D pose transfer aims to transfer the pose-style of a source mesh to a target character while preserving both the target's geometry and the source's pose characteristic. Existing methods are largely restricted to characters with similar structures and fail to generalize to category-free settings (e.g., transferring a humanoid's pose to a quadruped). The key challenge lies in the structural and transformation diversity inherent in distinct character types, which often leads to mismatched regions and poor transfer quality. To address these issues, we first construct a million-scale pose dataset across hundreds of distinct characters. We further propose MimiCAT, a cascade-transformer model designed for category-free 3D pose transfer. Instead of relying on strict one-to-one correspondence mappings, MimiCAT leverages semantic keypoint labels to learn a novel soft correspondence that enables flexible many-to-many matching across characters. The pose transfer is then formulated as a conditional generation process, in which the source transformations are first projected onto the target through soft correspondence matching and subsequently refined using shape-conditioned representations. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that MimiCAT transfers plausible poses across different characters, significantly outperforming prior methods that are limited to narrow category transfer (e.g., humanoid-to-humanoid).

Result: Refined VLMs outperform comparable and larger baselines by 8.7% and 6.0%, achieving performance comparable to closed-source SoTA VLMs like Gemini-2.5-Flash on physics reasoning and comprehension.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses VLMs' limitations in physics reasoning by translating physical-world context into interpretable representations, validated through comprehensive benchmarking and superior performance.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) perform well on standard video tasks but struggle with physics-driven reasoning involving motion dynamics and spatial interactions. This limitation reduces their ability to interpret real or AI-generated content (AIGC) videos and to generate physically consistent content. We present an approach that addresses this gap by translating physical-world context cues into interpretable representations aligned with VLMs' perception, comprehension, and reasoning. We introduce MASS-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark consisting of 4,350 real-world and AIGC videos and 8,361 free-form video question-answering pairs focused on physics-related comprehension tasks, with detailed annotations including visual detections, sub-segment grounding, and full-sequence 3D motion tracking of entities. We further present MASS, a model-agnostic method that injects spatial-temporal signals into the VLM language space via depth-based 3D encoding and visual grounding, coupled with a motion tracker for object dynamics. To strengthen cross-modal alignment and reasoning, we apply reinforcement fine-tuning. Experiments and ablations show that our refined VLMs outperform comparable and larger baselines, as well as prior state-of-the-art models, by 8.7% and 6.0%, achieving performance comparable to close-source SoTA VLMs such as Gemini-2.5-Flash on physics reasoning and comprehension. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach.

Result: CompGen exhibits distinct scaling curves with easy-to-hard and Gaussian sampling strategies performing best, and significantly enhances compositional generation capabilities for both diffusion-based and auto-regressive T2I models.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively improves compositional T2I generation systems by progressively optimizing models through difficulty-aware curriculum learning.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generation has long been an open problem, with compositional synthesis remaining particularly challenging. This task requires accurate rendering of complex scenes containing multiple objects that exhibit diverse attributes as well as intricate spatial and semantic relationships, demanding both precise object placement and coherent inter-object interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel compositional curriculum reinforcement learning framework named CompGen that addresses compositional weakness in existing T2I models. Specifically, we leverage scene graphs to establish a novel difficulty criterion for compositional ability and develop a corresponding adaptive Markov Chain Monte Carlo graph sampling algorithm. This difficulty-aware approach enables the synthesis of training curriculum data that progressively optimize T2I models through reinforcement learning. We integrate our curriculum learning approach into Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and investigate different curriculum scheduling strategies. Our experiments reveal that CompGen exhibits distinct scaling curves under different curriculum scheduling strategies, with easy-to-hard and Gaussian sampling strategies yielding superior scaling performance compared to random sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CompGen significantly enhances compositional generation capabilities for both diffusion-based and auto-regressive T2I models, highlighting its effectiveness in improving the compositional T2I generation systems.

Conclusion: The work provides valuable insights into Mamba's representational properties in vision, bridging gaps between attention mechanisms and highlighting its potential for interpretability and strong performance in vision architectures.

Abstract: Mamba has recently garnered attention as an effective backbone for vision tasks. However, its underlying mechanism in visual domains remains poorly understood. In this work, we systematically investigate Mamba's representational properties and make three primary contributions. First, we theoretically analyze Mamba's relationship to Softmax and Linear Attention, confirming that it can be viewed as a low-rank approximation of Softmax Attention and thereby bridging the representational gap between Softmax and Linear forms. Second, we introduce a novel binary segmentation metric for activation map evaluation, extending qualitative assessments to a quantitative measure that demonstrates Mamba's capacity to model long-range dependencies. Third, by leveraging DINO for self-supervised pretraining, we obtain clearer activation maps than those produced by standard supervised approaches, highlighting Mamba's potential for interpretability. Notably, our model also achieves a 78.5 percent linear probing accuracy on ImageNet, underscoring its strong performance. We hope this work can provide valuable insights for future investigations of Mamba-based vision architectures.

Motivation: Open-source text-to-video models face data scarcity due to limited high-quality video-text corpora, manual YouTube crawling challenges (link rot, access limits, licensing issues), and the need for easily obtainable training data.

Method: Built by merging diverse open video sources, applying unified de-duplication and quality filtering, and implementing a multi-granularity ground-truth-guided re-captioning pipeline to refine descriptions for better action, scene, and temporal alignment.

Result: Consistent improvements observed in multimodal retrieval, text-to-video generation, and video question answering tasks compared to counterpart datasets.

Conclusion: ViMix-14M removes key barriers for training open-source video foundation models and provides insights for building high-quality, generalizable video-text datasets.

Abstract: Text-to-video generation has surged in interest since Sora, yet open-source models still face a data bottleneck: there is no large, high-quality, easily obtainable video-text corpus. Existing public datasets typically require manual YouTube crawling, which yields low usable volume due to link rot and access limits, and raises licensing uncertainty. This work addresses this challenge by introducing ViMix-14M, a curated multi-source video-text dataset of around 14 million pairs that provides crawl-free, download-ready access and long-form, high-quality captions tightly aligned to video. ViMix-14M is built by merging diverse open video sources, followed by unified de-duplication and quality filtering, and a multi-granularity, ground-truth-guided re-captioning pipeline that refines descriptions to better match actions, scenes, and temporal structure. We evaluate the dataset by multimodal retrieval, text-to-video generation, and video question answering tasks, observing consistent improvements over counterpart datasets. We hope this work can help removing the key barrier to training and fine-tuning open-source video foundation models, and provide insights of building high-quality and generalizable video-text datasets.

Motivation: Traditional X-ray detection relies on single-view visual modality, but human inspectors use dual-view images. The research explores whether the second view can provide constraints similar to language modality.

Method: Proposes Geometric-Semantic Reasoner (GSR) that jointly learns cross-view geometry and cross-modal semantics correspondences, treating second-view images as language-like modality. Uses structured Chain-of-Thought sequences: <top>, <side>, <conclusion>.

Result: GSR achieves significant improvements across all eight X-ray tasks in the DualXrayBench benchmark, demonstrating superior performance in cross-view reasoning.

Conclusion: The approach offers a new perspective for real-world X-ray inspection by effectively leveraging dual-view images as a language-like modality, enabling better cross-view reasoning and threat detection.

Abstract: Automatic X-ray prohibited items detection is vital for security inspection and has been widely studied. Traditional methods rely on visual modality, often struggling with complex threats. While recent studies incorporate language to guide single-view images, human inspectors typically use dual-view images in practice. This raises the question: can the second view provide constraints similar to a language modality? In this work, we introduce DualXrayBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for X-ray inspection that includes multiple views and modalities. It supports eight tasks designed to test cross-view reasoning. In DualXrayBench, we introduce a caption corpus consisting of 45,613 dual-view image pairs across 12 categories with corresponding captions. Building upon these data, we propose the Geometric (cross-view)-Semantic (cross-modality) Reasoner (GSR), a multimodal model that jointly learns correspondences between cross-view geometry and cross-modal semantics, treating the second-view images as a "language-like modality". To enable this, we construct the GSXray dataset, with structured Chain-of-Thought sequences: <top>, <side>, <conclusion>. Comprehensive evaluations on DualXrayBench demonstrate that GSR achieves significant improvements across all X-ray tasks, offering a new perspective for real-world X-ray inspection.

Abstract: We have introduced SegSplat, a novel framework designed to bridge the gap between rapid, feed-forward 3D reconstruction and rich, open-vocabulary semantic understanding. By constructing a compact semantic memory bank from multi-view 2D foundation model features and predicting discrete semantic indices alongside geometric and appearance attributes for each 3D Gaussian in a single pass, SegSplat efficiently imbues scenes with queryable semantics. Our experiments demonstrate that SegSplat achieves geometric fidelity comparable to state-of-the-art feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting methods while simultaneously enabling robust open-set semantic segmentation, crucially \textit{without} requiring any per-scene optimization for semantic feature integration. This work represents a significant step towards practical, on-the-fly generation of semantically aware 3D environments, vital for advancing robotic interaction, augmented reality, and other intelligent systems.

*Jinhao Li,Sarah M. Erfani,Lei Feng,James Bailey,Feng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Weak-to-strong generalization for CLIP-based classification using class prototype learning (CPL) improves performance by 3.67% over baselines, especially when pretraining is limited.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aligning large models with user intent is crucial but human supervision becomes impractical as models surpass human knowledge. Using weaker models to supervise stronger ones reduces human workload.

Method: Proposed class prototype learning (CPL) that learns more representative prototypes for each category in CLIP-based classification, using a simple loss function under weak supervision.

Result: CPL achieves 3.67% improvement over strong baseline methods, with robust improvements in targeted scenarios especially when pretraining is limited.

Conclusion: Weak-to-strong generalization is effective for vision-language models, and CPL provides a practical solution to enhance classification capabilities with limited supervision.

Abstract: Aligning large-scale commercial models with user intent is crucial to preventing harmful outputs. Current methods rely on human supervision but become impractical as model complexity increases. When models surpass human knowledge, providing accurate feedback becomes challenging and inefficient. A novel solution proposed recently is using a weaker model to supervise a stronger model. This concept leverages the ability of weaker models to perform evaluations, thereby reducing the workload on human supervisors. Previous work has shown the effectiveness of weak-to-strong generalization in the context of language-only models. Extending this concept to vision-language models leverages these insights, adapting the proven benefits to a multi-modal context. In our study, we explore weak-to-strong generalization for CLIP-based classification. We propose a method, class prototype learning (CPL), which aims to enhance the classification capabilities of the CLIP model, by learning more representative prototypes for each category. Our findings indicate that, despite using a simple loss function under weak supervision, CPL yields robust improvements in targeted scenarios, particularly when pretraining is limited. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach is effective under these settings, achieving a 3.67% improvement over strong baseline methods.

*Haonan Wang,Hanyu Zhou,Haoyue Liu,Luxin Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 4D-VGGT is a foundation model for dynamic scene geometry estimation that uses divide-and-conquer spatiotemporal representation to address mismatched features between spatial and temporal domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods align spatial and temporal features into unified latent space, but suffer from potential mismatched representation due to the heterogeneous nature between these features.

Method: Proposes 4D-VGGT with three key components: 1) Multi-setting input with adaptive visual grid for arbitrary views/time steps, 2) Multi-level representation with cross-view global fusion (spatial) and cross-time local fusion (temporal), 3) Multi-task prediction with task-specific heads.

Result: The model enhances feature discriminability and application universality for dynamic scenes, verified through extensive experiments on multiple dynamic scene geometry benchmarks.

Conclusion: 4D-VGGT provides an effective unified framework for comprehensive visual geometry estimation in dynamic scenes by addressing the heterogeneous nature of spatiotemporal features.

Abstract: We investigate a challenging task of dynamic scene geometry estimation, which requires representing both spatial and temporal features. Typically, existing methods align the two features into a unified latent space to model scene geometry. However, this unified paradigm suffers from potential mismatched representation due to the heterogeneous nature between spatial and temporal features. In this work, we propose 4D-VGGT, a general foundation model with divide-and-conquer spatiotemporal representation for dynamic scene geometry. Our model is divided into three aspects: 1) Multi-setting input. We design an adaptive visual grid that supports input sequences with arbitrary numbers of views and time steps. 2) Multi-level representation. We propose a cross-view global fusion for spatial representation and a cross-time local fusion for temporal representation. 3) Multi-task prediction. We append multiple task-specific heads to spatiotemporal representations, enabling a comprehensive visual geometry estimation for dynamic scenes. Under this unified framework, these components enhance the feature discriminability and application universality of our model for dynamic scenes. In addition, we integrate multiple geometry datasets to train our model and conduct extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of our method across various tasks on multiple dynamic scene geometry benchmarks.

TL;DR: NeuroVascU-Net is a deep learning model for precise 3D cerebrovascular segmentation from T1CE MRI, achieving high accuracy with low computational cost for neurosurgical planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual 3D segmentation of cerebral vasculature is time-consuming and variable, while current automated methods sacrifice accuracy for efficiency, limiting clinical adoption. There's a gap in T1CE MRI-based approaches compared to TOF-MRA methods.

Method: Based on dilated U-Net with two specialized modules: MSC²F (Multi-Scale Contextual Feature Fusion) at bottleneck for local/global information, and CDA²F (Cross-Domain Adaptive Feature Fusion) at deeper layers for domain-specific feature integration.

Result: Achieved Dice score of 0.8609 and precision of 0.8841 on 137 brain tumor biopsy patients' T1CE scans, accurately segmenting both major and fine vessels with only 12.4M parameters.

Conclusion: NeuroVascU-Net provides an accurate and computationally efficient solution for cerebrovascular segmentation in neurosurgical planning, outperforming transformer-based models in parameter efficiency.

Abstract: Precise 3D segmentation of cerebral vasculature from T1-weighted contrast-enhanced (T1CE) MRI is crucial for safe neurosurgical planning. Manual delineation is time-consuming and prone to inter-observer variability, while current automated methods often trade accuracy for computational cost, limiting clinical use. We present NeuroVascU-Net, the first deep learning architecture specifically designed to segment cerebrovascular structures directly from clinically standard T1CE MRI in neuro-oncology patients, addressing a gap in prior work dominated by TOF-MRA-based approaches. NeuroVascU-Net builds on a dilated U-Net and integrates two specialized modules: a Multi-Scale Contextual Feature Fusion ($MSC^2F$) module at the bottleneck and a Cross-Domain Adaptive Feature Fusion ($CDA^2F$) module at deeper hierarchical layers. $MSC^2F$ captures both local and global information via multi-scale dilated convolutions, while $CDA^2F$ dynamically integrates domain-specific features, enhancing representation while keeping computation low. The model was trained and validated on a curated dataset of T1CE scans from 137 brain tumor biopsy patients, annotated by a board-certified functional neurosurgeon. NeuroVascU-Net achieved a Dice score of 0.8609 and precision of 0.8841, accurately segmenting both major and fine vascular structures. Notably, it requires only 12.4M parameters, significantly fewer than transformer-based models such as Swin U-NetR. This balance of accuracy and efficiency positions NeuroVascU-Net as a practical solution for computer-assisted neurosurgical planning.

TL;DR: CrossJEPA is a cross-modal joint embedding predictive architecture that uses 2D image foundation models to supervise 3D point cloud learning, achieving SOTA results with high efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational expense and deployment challenges of current 2D-to-3D cross-modal learning methods, and to explore JEPA-style pretraining beyond masking in cross-modal settings.

Method: Proposes CrossJEPA that trains a predictor to infer 2D view embeddings from 3D point clouds, uses cross-domain projection to purify supervision signals, and employs frozen teacher design with one-time target embedding caching.

Result: Achieves 94.2% on ModelNet40 and 88.3% on ScanObjectNN with linear probing, using only 14.1M parameters (8.5M in point encoder) and ~6 hours pretraining on single GPU.

Conclusion: CrossJEPA is a performant, memory-efficient, and fast-to-train framework for 3D representation learning via knowledge distillation, demonstrating JEPA's effectiveness beyond masking in cross-modal settings.

Abstract: Image-to-point cross-modal learning has emerged to address the scarcity of large-scale 3D datasets in 3D representation learning. However, current methods that leverage 2D data often result in large, slow-to-train models, making them computationally expensive and difficult to deploy in resource-constrained environments. The architecture design of such models is therefore critical, determining their performance, memory footprint, and compute efficiency. The Joint-embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) has gained wide popularity in self-supervised learning for its simplicity and efficiency, but has been under-explored in cross-modal settings, partly due to the misconception that masking is intrinsic to JEPA. In this light, we propose CrossJEPA, a simple Cross-modal Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture that harnesses the knowledge of an image foundation model and trains a predictor to infer embeddings of specific rendered 2D views from corresponding 3D point clouds, thereby introducing a JEPA-style pretraining strategy beyond masking. By conditioning the predictor on cross-domain projection information, CrossJEPA purifies the supervision signal from semantics exclusive to the target domain. We further exploit the frozen teacher design with a one-time target embedding caching mechanism, yielding amortized efficiency. CrossJEPA achieves a new state-of-the-art in linear probing on the synthetic ModelNet40 (94.2%) and the real-world ScanObjectNN (88.3%) benchmarks, using only 14.1M pretraining parameters (8.5M in the point encoder), and about 6 pretraining hours on a standard single GPU. These results position CrossJEPA as a performant, memory-efficient, and fast-to-train framework for 3D representation learning via knowledge distillation. We analyze CrossJEPA intuitively, theoretically, and empirically, and extensively ablate our design choices. Code will be made available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DocPTBench is a new benchmark for photographed document parsing and translation that reveals significant performance drops in existing models when dealing with real-world document capture conditions compared to pristine digital documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks like OmniDocBench and DITrans focus on pristine scanned/digital documents and fail to address the challenges of real-world capture conditions with geometric distortions and photometric variations.

Method: Created DocPTBench with over 1,300 high-resolution photographed documents from multiple domains, including eight translation scenarios, with human-verified annotations for parsing and translation.

Result: Transitioning from digital-born to photographed documents causes substantial performance decline: MLLMs show 18% drop in parsing and 12% in translation accuracy, while specialized parsing models show 25% average decrease.

Conclusion: The performance gap highlights the unique challenges of real-world document capture conditions and reveals limited robustness of existing models, emphasizing the need for better handling of photographed documents.

Abstract: The advent of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has unlocked the potential for end-to-end document parsing and translation. However, prevailing benchmarks such as OmniDocBench and DITrans are dominated by pristine scanned or digital-born documents, and thus fail to adequately represent the intricate challenges of real-world capture conditions, such as geometric distortions and photometric variations. To fill this gap, we introduce DocPTBench, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for Photographed Document Parsing and Translation. DocPTBench comprises over 1,300 high-resolution photographed documents from multiple domains, includes eight translation scenarios, and provides meticulously human-verified annotations for both parsing and translation. Our experiments demonstrate that transitioning from digital-born to photographed documents results in a substantial performance decline: popular MLLMs exhibit an average accuracy drop of 18% in end-to-end parsing and 12% in translation, while specialized document parsing models show significant average decrease of 25%. This substantial performance gap underscores the unique challenges posed by documents captured in real-world conditions and reveals the limited robustness of existing models.

### [146] [When Generative Replay Meets Evolving Deepfakes: Domain-Aware Relative Weighting for Incremental Face Forgery Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18436)
*Hao Shen,Jikang Cheng,Renye Yan,Zhongyuan Wang,Wei Peng,Baojin Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Domain-Aware Relative Weighting (DARW) strategy for incremental face forgery detection using generative replay, addressing domain boundary issues between real and fake samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current sample replay methods for incremental forgery detection have low diversity and privacy issues. Generative replay offers potential but faces challenges with domain boundaries when replay generators resemble new forgery models.

Method: DARW strategy with two approaches: direct supervision for domain-safe samples, and Relative Separation Loss for domain-risky samples. Uses Domain Confusion Score to dynamically adjust supervision based on sample reliability.

Result: Extensive experiments show DARW consistently improves incremental learning performance for forgery detection under various generative replay settings and reduces adverse effects of domain overlap.

Conclusion: DARW effectively exploits generative replay for incremental forgery detection by handling domain boundary issues through adaptive supervision strategies.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of face generation techniques has led to a growing variety of forgery methods. Incremental forgery detection aims to gradually update existing models with new forgery data, yet current sample replay-based methods are limited by low diversity and privacy concerns. Generative replay offers a potential solution by synthesizing past data, but its feasibility for forgery detection remains unclear. In this work, we systematically investigate generative replay and identify two scenarios: when the replay generator closely resembles the new forgery model, generated real samples blur the domain boundary, creating domain-risky samples; when the replay generator differs significantly, generated samples can be safely supervised, forming domain-safe samples. To exploit generative replay effectively, we propose a novel Domain-Aware Relative Weighting (DARW) strategy. DARW directly supervises domain-safe samples while applying a Relative Separation Loss to balance supervision and potential confusion for domain-risky samples. A Domain Confusion Score dynamically adjusts this tradeoff according to sample reliability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DARW consistently improves incremental learning performance for forgery detection under different generative replay settings and alleviates the adverse impact of domain overlap.

TL;DR: PEARL addresses visual hallucinations in VLMs by anchoring reasoning to verified visual evidence through perception checklists and dual-branch reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vanilla RLVR for VLMs only verifies final textual outputs, neglecting visual perception, leading to visual hallucinations and reward hacking from flawed perception.

Method: PEARL uses dual-branch perception-reasoning synergy with perception checklists - sub-questions that probe visual evidence understanding. It generates perceptual rewards that act as fidelity gates for reasoning updates.

Result: PEARL achieves substantial gains on multimodal reasoning benchmarks, with +9.7% improvement over baseline and +6.6% over GRPO on MathVerse.

Conclusion: Explicitly anchoring reasoning to verified visual evidence through perception checklists effectively mitigates visual hallucinations and enhances multimodal reasoning in VLMs.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and is now being applied to Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, vanilla RLVR for VLMs verifies only the final textual output, critically neglecting the foundational step of visual perception. This oversight leads to visual hallucinations and reward hacking, as reasoning built upon flawed perception is inherently unreliable. To address this, we propose PEARL (Perceptual-Evidence Anchored Reinforced Learning), a dual-branch, perception-reasoning synergistic that strengthens multimodal reasoning by explicitly anchoring it to verified visual evidence. For each reasoning-oriented QA instance, PEARL first derive a perception checklist -- a set of perception-oriented sub-questions with verifiable answers that probe the model's understanding of key visual evidence. During training, auxiliary rollouts on this checklist yield a perceptual reward that both directly reinforces the model's perception ability and acts as a fidelity gate for reasoning. If the model passes the perception check, its policy update is biased towards evidence-anchored reasoning. Otherwise, the process is halted to prevent reasoning from flawed premises. PEARL can be seamlessly integrated with popular RL methods like GRPO and DAPO. Comprehensive experiments show PEARL achieves substantial gains on multimodal reasoning benchmarks, e.g., a +9.7% improvement over the baseline and +6.6% over GRPO on MathVerse.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D editing using Gaussian Splatting often suffer from view inconsistencies, lack of fine-grained control, and high computational demands when using 2D diffusion models for multi-view training.

Method: Developed a pipeline that enables precise selection and recoloring of regions within pre-trained Gaussian Splatting scenes, accompanied by an interactive tool for real-time experimentation.

Result: The method achieves real-time performance for recoloring tasks in Gaussian Splatting scenes while maintaining precision and user-friendliness.

Conclusion: The introduced pipeline provides an effective solution for recoloring in Gaussian Splatting with practical real-time interactive capabilities, addressing limitations of previous approaches.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a leading method for novel view synthesis, offering superior training efficiency and real-time inference compared to NeRF approaches, while still delivering high-quality reconstructions. Beyond view synthesis, this 3D representation has also been explored for editing tasks. Many existing methods leverage 2D diffusion models to generate multi-view datasets for training, but they often suffer from limitations such as view inconsistencies, lack of fine-grained control, and high computational demand. In this work, we focus specifically on the editing task of recoloring. We introduce a user-friendly pipeline that enables precise selection and recoloring of regions within a pre-trained Gaussian Splatting scene. To demonstrate the real-time performance of our method, we also present an interactive tool that allows users to experiment with the pipeline in practice.

TL;DR: SineProject improves multimodal LLM unlearning by stabilizing vision-language alignment through sinusoidal parameter modulation, reducing benign query refusals while effectively forgetting targeted unsafe/private information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unlearning methods disrupt vision-language alignment in MLLMs, causing models to reject both harmful and benign queries due to projector network instability during unlearning.

Method: Augments frozen projector with sinusoidally modulated trainable parameters to improve Jacobian's spectral conditioning and stabilize cross-modal embeddings during unlearning.

Result: Across safety and privacy benchmarks using LLaVA v1.5 7B/13B, achieves complete forgetting of targeted information while reducing benign query refusals, with state-of-the-art forget-retain trade-offs and negligible computational overhead.

Conclusion: SineProject effectively addresses the alignment disruption problem in MLLM unlearning through stable projector optimization, enabling selective forgetting without compromising general model capabilities.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) increasingly need to forget specific knowledge such as unsafe or private information without requiring full retraining. However, existing unlearning methods often disrupt vision language alignment, causing models to reject both harmful and benign queries. We trace this failure to the projector network during unlearning, its Jacobian becomes severely illconditioned, leading to unstable optimization and drift in cross modal embeddings. We introduce SineProject, a simple method that augments the frozen projector with sinusoidally modulated trainable parameters, improving the Jacobian's spectral conditioning and stabilizing alignment throughout unlearning. Across standard safety and privacy unlearning benchmarks using LLaVA v1.5 7B and 13B, SineProject reduces benign query refusals while achieving complete forgetting of targeted information, yielding state of the art forget retain trade offs with negligible computational overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite significant advancements in MLLMs for event-based vision, there is a lack of unified benchmarks to comprehensively evaluate their capabilities across diverse tasks.

Method: Developed EventBench benchmark with eight task metrics, large-scale event stream dataset (over 1M event-text pairs), and introduced 3D spatial reasoning tasks specifically designed for event-based MLLMs.

Result: Evaluation of state-of-the-art models (GPT-5, Gemini-2.5 Pro, Qwen2.5-VL, InternVL3, EventGPT) shows that while event-based MLLMs perform well in event stream understanding, they struggle with fine-grained recognition and spatial reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Current event-based MLLMs have limitations in fine-grained recognition and spatial reasoning capabilities, highlighting the need for further model development and the utility of EventBench as a comprehensive evaluation framework.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant advancements in event-based vision, yet the comprehensive evaluation of their capabilities within a unified benchmark remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce EventBench, a benchmark that offers eight diverse task metrics together with a large-scale event stream dataset. EventBench differs from existing event-based benchmarks in four key aspects: (1) openness in accessibility, releasing all raw event streams and task instructions across eight evaluation metrics; (2) diversity in task coverage, spanning understanding, recognition, and spatial reasoning tasks for comprehensive capability assessment; (3) integration in spatial dimensions, pioneering the design of 3D spatial reasoning tasks for event-based MLLMs; and (4) scale in data volume, with an accompanying training set of over one million event-text pairs supporting large-scale training and evaluation. Using EventBench, we evaluate state-of-the-art closed-source models such as GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5 Pro, leading open-source models including Qwen2.5-VL and InternVL3, and event-based MLLMs such as EventGPT that directly process raw event streams. Extensive evaluation reveals that while current event-based MLLMs demonstrate strong performance in event stream understanding, they continue to struggle with fine-grained recognition and spatial reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NAF is a zero-shot feature upsampling method that uses cross-scale neighborhood attention and RoPE to adaptively upsample VFM features without retraining, achieving SOTA performance across multiple tasks while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Foundation Models produce spatially downsampled representations that are suboptimal for pixel-level tasks, creating a trade-off between fast but fixed classical filters and accurate but VFM-specific learnable upsamplers that require retraining.

Method: Neighborhood Attention Filtering (NAF) learns adaptive spatial-and-content weights through Cross-Scale Neighborhood Attention and Rotary Position Embeddings, guided solely by high-resolution input images, enabling zero-shot upsampling of any VFM features.

Result: NAF outperforms VFM-specific upsamplers across multiple downstream tasks, achieves state-of-the-art performance, maintains high efficiency (18 FPS for 2K feature maps), and shows strong performance on image restoration tasks.

Conclusion: NAF successfully bridges the gap between classical filters and modern upsamplers by providing adaptive, VFM-agnostic upsampling without retraining, demonstrating versatility across feature upsampling and image restoration tasks.

Abstract: Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) extract spatially downsampled representations, posing challenges for pixel-level tasks. Existing upsampling approaches face a fundamental trade-off: classical filters are fast and broadly applicable but rely on fixed forms, while modern upsamplers achieve superior accuracy through learnable, VFM-specific forms at the cost of retraining for each VFM. We introduce Neighborhood Attention Filtering (NAF), which bridges this gap by learning adaptive spatial-and-content weights through Cross-Scale Neighborhood Attention and Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE), guided solely by the high-resolution input image. NAF operates zero-shot: it upsamples features from any VFM without retraining, making it the first VFM-agnostic architecture to outperform VFM-specific upsamplers and achieve state-of-the-art performance across multiple downstream tasks. It maintains high efficiency, scaling to 2K feature maps and reconstructing intermediate-resolution maps at 18 FPS. Beyond feature upsampling, NAF demonstrates strong performance on image restoration, highlighting its versatility. Code and checkpoints are available at https://github.com/valeoai/NAF.

*Ming-Jhe Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RegDeepLab is a dual-branch multi-task learning framework that combines semantic segmentation with multi-scale regression to automate embryo fragmentation grading in IVF, addressing explainability and accuracy challenges through a two-stage decoupled training strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current manual embryo fragmentation grading in IVF is time-consuming, subjective, and inefficient. Deep learning solutions face trade-offs between regression models lacking explainability and segmentation models struggling to translate pixel-level masks to clinical grades.

Method: Proposes RegDeepLab with dual-branch MTL integrating DeepLabV3+ segmentation and multi-scale regression head. Uses two-stage decoupled training strategy to address gradient conflict and negative transfer, with feature injection and range loss for semi-supervised learning.

Result: Standard MTL achieves minimal grading error (MAE=0.046) but compromises segmentation boundaries. Decoupled strategy maintains SOTA segmentation accuracy (Dice=0.729) while providing robust grading predictions. Range loss enables effective semi-supervised learning.

Conclusion: Presents a clinical auxiliary solution combining high accuracy with visual explainability for embryo fragmentation assessment in IVF, successfully balancing grading precision and segmentation quality through innovative training strategies.

Abstract: The degree of embryo fragmentation serves as a critical morphological indicator for assessing embryo developmental potential in In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) clinical decision-making. However, current manual grading processes are not only time-consuming but also limited by significant inter-observer variability and efficiency bottlenecks. Although deep learning has demonstrated potential in automated grading in recent years, existing solutions face a significant challenge: pure regression models lack the visual explainability required for clinical practice, while pure segmentation models struggle to directly translate pixel-level masks into precise clinical grades. This study proposes RegDeepLab, a dual-branch Multi-Task Learning (MTL) framework that integrates State-of-the-Art (SOTA) semantic segmentation (DeepLabV3+) with a multi-scale regression head. Addressing the common issues of "Gradient Conflict" and "Negative Transfer" in multi-task training, we propose a "Two-Stage Decoupled Training Strategy." Experimental results demonstrate that while standard end-to-end MTL training can minimize grading error (MAE=0.046) through our designed "Feature Injection" mechanism, it compromises the integrity of segmentation boundaries. In contrast, our decoupled strategy successfully provides robust and high-precision grading predictions while preserving SOTA-level segmentation accuracy (Dice=0.729). Furthermore, we introduce a "Range Loss" to effectively utilize large-scale discrete grading data for semi-supervised learning. This study ultimately presents a dual-module clinical auxiliary solution that combines high accuracy with visual explainability.

TL;DR: Video-PLR introduces a loop-based perception paradigm with anti-hallucination rewards to address perception shortcuts and hallucinations in video reasoning LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Video Reasoning LLMs suffer from perception shortcuts and hallucinations due to flawed single-step perception paradigms that risk insufficient evidence and emergent hallucinations.

Method: Proposes Perception Loop Reasoning (PLR) paradigm with iterative video segment analysis and Factual-Aware Evaluator (FAE) with anti-hallucination rewards trained on AnetHallu-117K dataset.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in both 3B and 7B parameter scales with best data efficiency, with FAE performing comparably to GPT-4o.

Conclusion: The loop-based paradigm with anti-hallucination rewards effectively addresses perception shortcuts and hallucinations in video reasoning, providing more reliable video evidence.

Abstract: Sufficient visual perception is the foundation of video reasoning. Nevertheless, existing Video Reasoning LLMs suffer from perception shortcuts, relying on a flawed single-step perception paradigm. This paradigm describes the video and then conducts reasoning, which runs the risk of insufficient evidence and emergent hallucinations. To address these issues, we introduce a new framework that integrates a loop-based paradigm with an anti-hallucination reward. First, to address the insufficient evidence, we introduce the Perception Loop Reasoning (PLR) paradigm. Instead of describing the video at once, each loop requires the model to describe a video segment with precise timestamps, analyze this segment, and decide the next action. Second, for the risk of hallucinations, the Factual-Aware Evaluator (FAE) evaluates each perception result as a reliable anti-hallucination reward. This reward encourages the model to provide sufficient and precise video evidence. Our FAE, which performs comparably to GPT-4o, is tuned on our AnetHallu-117K, a large-scale hallucination judgment preference dataset. Extensive experiments show that our Video-PLR achieves the state-of-the-art in both 3B and 7B parameter scales and has the best data efficiency. Our code, models, and datasets are released on: https://github.com/BoweiPu/VideoPLR.

TL;DR: EgoSpanLift transforms egocentric visual span forecasting from 2D to 3D scenes, outperforming 2D gaze anticipation and 3D localization baselines without 2D-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Forecasting human visual perception is fundamental for guiding actions and has implications for AR/VR and assistive technologies, but remains less explored compared to motion and contact-based interaction research.

Method: EgoSpanLift converts SLAM-derived keypoints into gaze-compatible geometry, extracts volumetric visual span regions, and combines with 3D U-Net and unidirectional transformers for spatio-temporal fusion in 3D grids.

Result: Outperforms competitive baselines for egocentric 2D gaze anticipation and 3D localization, achieving comparable results when projected back to 2D without additional training. Created benchmark with 364.6K samples.

Conclusion: The proposed 3D visual span forecasting approach effectively predicts where a person's visual perception will focus next in their 3D environment, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: People continuously perceive and interact with their surroundings based on underlying intentions that drive their exploration and behaviors. While research in egocentric user and scene understanding has focused primarily on motion and contact-based interaction, forecasting human visual perception itself remains less explored despite its fundamental role in guiding human actions and its implications for AR/VR and assistive technologies. We address the challenge of egocentric 3D visual span forecasting, predicting where a person's visual perception will focus next within their three-dimensional environment. To this end, we propose EgoSpanLift, a novel method that transforms egocentric visual span forecasting from 2D image planes to 3D scenes. EgoSpanLift converts SLAM-derived keypoints into gaze-compatible geometry and extracts volumetric visual span regions. We further combine EgoSpanLift with 3D U-Net and unidirectional transformers, enabling spatio-temporal fusion to efficiently predict future visual span in the 3D grid. In addition, we curate a comprehensive benchmark from raw egocentric multisensory data, creating a testbed with 364.6K samples for 3D visual span forecasting. Our approach outperforms competitive baselines for egocentric 2D gaze anticipation and 3D localization while achieving comparable results even when projected back onto 2D image planes without additional 2D-specific training.

TL;DR: AdaPS is an adaptive likelihood step-size strategy for diffusion-based inverse problem solving that improves reconstruction quality across various imaging tasks without task-specific tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Balancing prior contribution with data fidelity in diffusion models for inverse problems is challenging - aggressive updates cause artifacts while conservative updates slow convergence.

Method: Developed an observation-dependent weighting scheme based on agreement between two approximations of intractable intermediate likelihood gradients, adapting to diffusion schedule, time respacing, and stochasticity.

Result: AdaPS consistently surpasses existing diffusion baselines in perceptual quality with minimal/no distortion loss across super-resolution, Gaussian deblurring, and motion deblurring on CelebA-HQ and ImageNet-256.

Conclusion: AdaPS is a hyperparameter-free approach that demonstrates robustness to diffusion steps, noise levels, and stochasticity while improving reconstruction quality across diverse imaging tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful generative priors for solving inverse problems, achieving state-of-the-art results across various imaging tasks. A central challenge in this setting lies in balancing the contribution of the prior with the data fidelity term: overly aggressive likelihood updates may introduce artifacts, while conservative updates can slow convergence or yield suboptimal reconstructions. In this work, we propose an adaptive likelihood step-size strategy to guide the diffusion process for inverse-problem formulations. Specifically, we develop an observation-dependent weighting scheme based on the agreement between two different approximations of the intractable intermediate likelihood gradients, that adapts naturally to the diffusion schedule, time re-spacing, and injected stochasticity. The resulting approach, Adaptive Posterior diffusion Sampling (AdaPS), is hyperparameter-free and improves reconstruction quality across diverse imaging tasks - including super-resolution, Gaussian deblurring, and motion deblurring - on CelebA-HQ and ImageNet-256 validation sets. AdaPS consistently surpasses existing diffusion-based baselines in perceptual quality with minimal or no loss in distortion, without any task-specific tuning. Extensive ablation studies further demonstrate its robustness to the number of diffusion steps, observation noise levels, and varying stochasticity.

TL;DR: HSDiff is a Bayesian framework for hyperspectral image reconstruction that uses diffusion models to generate diverse samples consistent with measurements, with enhanced metameric augmentation for better uncertainty calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current data-driven methods for hyperspectral image reconstruction suffer from hallucination due to limited spectral diversity in datasets, especially for metamerism phenomena.

Method: Formulates HSI reconstruction as Bayesian inference using unconditionally trained pixel-level diffusion prior and posterior diffusion sampling, with enhanced metameric augmentation using region-based metameric black and partition-of-union spectral upsampling.

Result: HSDiff provides calibrated informative uncertainty and demonstrates that effective spectral encoding shapes posterior distribution, offering high-performance uncertainty-aware reconstruction.

Conclusion: HSDiff offers a complete Bayesian framework for uncertainty-aware HSI reconstruction and highlights the importance of effective spectral encoding in snapshot hyperspectral imaging.

Abstract: Hyperspectral image reconstruction from a compressed measurement is a highly ill-posed inverse problem. Current data-driven methods suffer from hallucination due to the lack of spectral diversity in existing hyperspectral image datasets, particularly when they are evaluated for the metamerism phenomenon. In this work, we formulate hyperspectral image (HSI) reconstruction as a Bayesian inference problem and propose a framework, HSDiff, that utilizes an unconditionally trained, pixel-level diffusion prior and posterior diffusion sampling to generate diverse HSI samples consistent with the measurements of various hyperspectral image formation models. We propose an enhanced metameric augmentation technique using region-based metameric black and partition-of-union spectral upsampling to expand training with physically valid metameric spectra, strengthening the prior diversity and improving uncertainty calibration. We utilize HSDiff to investigate how the studied forward models shape the posterior distribution and demonstrate that guiding with effective spectral encoding provides calibrated informative uncertainty compared to non-encoded models. Through the lens of the Bayesian framework, HSDiff offers a complete, high-performance method for uncertainty-aware HSI reconstruction. Our results also reiterate the significance of effective spectral encoding in snapshot hyperspectral imaging.

Result: TinyGPT-STTF (3B params) achieves CIDEr 131.2, surpassing LLaVA-1.5 7B by 17.6 points with 2.3x fewer params and 62x fewer FLOPs. STTF reduces tokens by 84% while preserving 95.6% accuracy; ANC cuts FLOPs by up to 90% in low-motion scenes.

Conclusion: The proposed techniques enable efficient deployment of capable vision-language models on real-world edge devices with significant improvements in accuracy and latency reduction.

Abstract: The demand for edge AI in vision-language tasks requires models that achieve real-time performance on resource-constrained devices with limited power and memory. This paper proposes two adaptive compression techniques -- Sparse Temporal Token Fusion (STTF) and Adaptive Neural Compression (ANC) -- that integrate algorithmic innovations with hardware-aware optimizations. Unlike previous approaches relying on static pruning or uniform scaling, STTF dynamically reuses visual tokens through event-driven change detection, while ANC conditionally activates encoder branches via a learned router, enabling fine-grained adaptation to scene complexity. Our 3B-parameter TinyGPT-STTF achieves CIDEr 131.2, BLEU-4 0.38, METEOR 0.31, and ROUGE-L 0.56 on the COCO 2017 test set, surpassing LLaVA-1.5 7B by 17.6 CIDEr points while using 2.3x fewer parameters and 62x fewer on-device FLOPs. TinyGPT-ANC reaches CIDEr 128.5. On event-based vision tasks, STTF reduces average token count by 84% (from 196 to 31 tokens) while preserving 95.6% accuracy on the DVS128 Gesture dataset, and ANC cuts FLOPs by up to 90% in low-motion scenes. Compared to strong baselines, our models improve accuracy by up to 4.4% and reduce latency by up to 13x. These results enable efficient deployment of capable vision-language models on real-world edge devices.

TL;DR: UNIFIER is a multimodal continual learning method that addresses catastrophic forgetting in MLLMs by decoupling visual information from different scenarios into separate branches and projecting them into the same feature space with consistency constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs deployed on devices need to continuously adapt to dynamic scenarios in downstream tasks (background/perspective variations) to perform complex visual tasks effectively, but suffer from catastrophic forgetting when dealing with real-world data streams with scenario shifts.

Method: UNIFIER decouples visual information from different scenarios into distinct branches within each vision block and projects them into the same feature space. It imposes consistency constraints on features of each branch to maintain visual representation stability across scenarios.

Result: Extensive experiments on the MSVQA dataset (containing high altitude, underwater, low altitude, and indoor scenarios) show UNIFIER effectively alleviates forgetting of cross-scenario tasks and achieves knowledge accumulation within the same scenario.

Conclusion: UNIFIER successfully addresses visual discrepancies while learning different scenarios in multimodal continual learning, demonstrating effective mitigation of catastrophic forgetting in MLLMs under dynamic scenario shifts.

Abstract: Continual learning in visual understanding aims to deal with catastrophic forgetting in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). MLLMs deployed on devices have to continuously adapt to dynamic scenarios in downstream tasks, such as variations in background and perspective, to effectively perform complex visual tasks. To this end, we construct a multimodal visual understanding dataset (MSVQA) encompassing four different scenarios and perspectives including high altitude, underwater, low altitude and indoor, to investigate the catastrophic forgetting in MLLMs under the dynamics of scenario shifts in real-world data streams. Furthermore, we propose mUltimodal coNtInual learning with MLLMs From multi-scenarIo pERspectives (UNIFIER) to address visual discrepancies while learning different scenarios. Specifically, it decouples the visual information from different scenarios into distinct branches within each vision block and projects them into the same feature space. A consistency constraint is imposed on the features of each branch to maintain the stability of visual representations across scenarios. Extensive experiments on the MSVQA dataset demonstrate that UNIFIER effectively alleviates forgetting of cross-scenario tasks and achieves knowledge accumulation within the same scenario.

TL;DR: LRDUN introduces low-rank decomposition into deep unfolding networks for spectral compressive imaging, using novel imaging models for spectral basis and subspace images to reduce computational redundancy and ill-posedness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DUNs operate on full high-dimensional HSIs, leading to computational redundancy and ill-posed mapping from 2D residuals to 3D HSI space. The paper aims to address these limitations by explicitly integrating low-rank decomposition.

Method: Proposes two novel imaging models with low-rank decomposition, develops LRDUN using unfolded proximal gradient descent framework, and introduces Generalized Feature Unfolding Mechanism to decouple physical rank from feature dimensionality.

Result: Extensive experiments show LRDUN achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality with significantly reduced computational cost on both simulated and real datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed low-rank deep unfolding approach effectively mitigates ill-posedness in spectral compressive imaging while maintaining high reconstruction quality with improved computational efficiency.

Abstract: Deep unfolding networks (DUNs) have achieved remarkable success and become the mainstream paradigm for spectral compressive imaging (SCI) reconstruction. Existing DUNs are derived from full-HSI imaging models, where each stage operates directly on the high-dimensional HSI, refining the entire data cube based on the single 2D coded measurement. However, this paradigm leads to computational redundancy and suffers from the ill-posed nature of mapping 2D residuals back to 3D space of HSI. In this paper, we propose two novel imaging models corresponding to the spectral basis and subspace image by explicitly integrating low-rank (LR) decomposition with the sensing model. Compared to recovering the full HSI, estimating these compact low-dimensional components significantly mitigates the ill-posedness. Building upon these novel models, we develop the Low-Rank Deep Unfolding Network (LRDUN), which jointly solves the two subproblems within an unfolded proximal gradient descent (PGD) framework. Furthermore, we introduce a Generalized Feature Unfolding Mechanism (GFUM) that decouples the physical rank in the data-fidelity term from the feature dimensionality in the prior module, enhancing the representational capacity and flexibility of the network. Extensive experiments on simulated and real datasets demonstrate that the proposed LRDUN achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) reconstruction quality with significantly reduced computational cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Solar panel output varies due to factors like dust, dirt, temperature, and faults, requiring efficient detection methods for maintenance and optimal performance.

Method: Uses image preprocessing (gamma removal, Gaussian filtering, normalization) and deep learning models (CNN, ResNet with self-attention mechanisms) to detect dust and faults based on power output, I-V components, and thermal imaging.

Result: The model shows better efficiency and accuracy compared to existing models in detecting dust and faults on solar panels.

Conclusion: The centralized multi-application model is efficient and optimized for detecting dust and faults, suitable for both small-scale and large-scale solar installations.

Abstract: Solar energy is one of the most abundant and tapped sources of renewable energies with enormous future potential. Solar panel output can vary widely with factors like intensity, temperature, dirt, debris and so on affecting it. We have implemented a model on detecting dust and fault on solar panels. These two applications are centralized as a single-platform and can be utilized for routine-maintenance and any other checks. These are checked against various parameters such as power output, sinusoidal wave (I-V component of solar cell), voltage across each solar cell and others. Firstly, we filter and preprocess the obtained images using gamma removal and Gaussian filtering methods alongside some predefined processes like normalization. The first application is to detect whether a solar cell is dusty or not based on various pre-determined metrics like shadowing, leaf, droppings, air pollution and from other human activities to extent of fine-granular solar modules. The other one is detecting faults and other such occurrences on solar panels like faults, cracks, cell malfunction using thermal imaging application. This centralized platform can be vital since solar panels have different efficiency across different geography (air and heat affect) and can also be utilized for small-scale house requirements to large-scale solar farm sustentation effectively. It incorporates CNN, ResNet models that with self-attention mechanisms-KerNet model which are used for classification and results in a fine-tuned system that detects dust or any fault occurring. Thus, this multi-application model proves to be efficient and optimized in detecting dust and faults on solar panels. We have performed various comparisons and findings that demonstrates that our model has better efficiency and accuracy results overall than existing models.

TL;DR: Proposes CD-FSCIL, a training-free FSCIL framework that replaces gradient optimization with conditional diffusion processes and multimodal learning to overcome catastrophic forgetting and computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address catastrophic forgetting and training cost explosion in FSCIL caused by gradient-based optimization under extreme data scarcity, which hinders adaptation to novel classes.

Method: Uses conditional diffusion process instead of gradient updates, integrates visual features with LLM-generated language descriptions for multimodal learning to enhance representation under few-shot constraints.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on FSCIL benchmarks while drastically reducing computational and memory overhead compared to gradient-based methods.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a paradigm shift toward training-free continual adaptation that effectively mitigates forgetting and handles sample scarcity through diffusion-based generative transitions and multimodal learning.

Abstract: Efforts to overcome catastrophic forgetting in Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) have primarily focused on developing more effective gradient-based optimization strategies. In contrast, little attention has been paid to the training cost explosion that inevitably arises as the number of novel classes increases, a consequence of relying on gradient learning even under extreme data scarcity. More critically, since FSCIL typically provides only a few samples for each new class, gradient-based updates not only induce severe catastrophic forgetting on base classes but also hinder adaptation to novel ones. This paper seeks to break this long-standing limitation by asking: Can we design a training-free FSCIL paradigm that entirely removes gradient optimization? We provide an affirmative answer by uncovering an intriguing connection between gradient-based optimization and the Conditional Diffusion process. Building on this observation, we propose a Conditional Diffusion-driven FSCIL (CD-FSCIL) framework that substitutes the conventional gradient update process with a diffusion-based generative transition, enabling training-free incremental adaptation while effectively mitigating forgetting. Furthermore, to enhance representation under few-shot constraints, we introduce a multimodal learning strategy that integrates visual features with natural language descriptions automatically generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). This synergy substantially alleviates the sample scarcity issue and improves generalization across novel classes. Extensive experiments on mainstream FSCIL benchmarks demonstrate that our method not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also drastically reduces computational and memory overhead, marking a paradigm shift toward training-free continual adaptation.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of individual teeth from panoramic radiographs remains a challenging task due to anatomical variations, irregular tooth shapes, and overlapping structures. These complexities often limit the performance of conventional deep learning models. To address this, we propose DE-KAN, a novel Dual Encoder Kolmogorov Arnold Network, which enhances feature representation and segmentation precision. The framework employs a ResNet-18 encoder for augmented inputs and a customized CNN encoder for original inputs, enabling the complementary extraction of global and local spatial features.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reconstructing high-fidelity MR images from undersampled k-space data requires recovering high-frequency details while maintaining anatomical coherence, which existing methods struggle to achieve effectively.

Method: Uses hierarchical shared-routed Mixture-of-Experts Mamba with separable frequency-consistent Laplacian pyramid for alias-resistant frequency streams and per-pixel sparse dispatch to shared experts, fused with global context path in data-consistency-regularized backbone.

Result: Outperforms CNN-, Transformer-, and prior Mamba-based baselines in PSNR, SSIM, and NMSE across multiple datasets and acceleration factors, with consistent improvements in high-frequency detail and structural fidelity.

Conclusion: HiFi-MambaV2 enables reliable and robust MRI reconstruction by effectively coupling frequency decomposition with content-adaptive computation.

Abstract: Reconstructing high-fidelity MR images from undersampled k-space data requires recovering high-frequency details while maintaining anatomical coherence. We present HiFi-MambaV2, a hierarchical shared-routed Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Mamba architecture that couples frequency decomposition with content-adaptive computation. The model comprises two core components: (i) a separable frequency-consistent Laplacian pyramid (SF-Lap) that delivers alias-resistant, stable low- and high-frequency streams; and (ii) a hierarchical shared-routed MoE that performs per-pixel top-1 sparse dispatch to shared experts and local routers, enabling effective specialization with stable cross-depth behavior. A lightweight global context path is fused into an unrolled, data-consistency-regularized backbone to reinforce long-range reasoning and preserve anatomical coherence. Evaluated on fastMRI, CC359, ACDC, M4Raw, and Prostate158, HiFi-MambaV2 consistently outperforms CNN-, Transformer-, and prior Mamba-based baselines in PSNR, SSIM, and NMSE across single- and multi-coil settings and multiple acceleration factors, consistently surpassing consistent improvements in high-frequency detail and overall structural fidelity. These results demonstrate that HiFi-MambaV2 enables reliable and robust MRI reconstruction.

TL;DR: First zero-shot video deraining method for dynamic scenes using pretrained text-to-video diffusion models without synthetic data or fine-tuning, leveraging negative prompting and attention switching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on paired synthetic datasets (poor real-world generalization) or static cameras (ineffective for dynamic scenes), while diffusion model fine-tuning weakens generative priors.

Method: Invert input video into diffusion model's latent space, use negative prompting to push reconstruction away from rain concepts, and employ attention switching mechanism to maintain background dynamics and structural consistency.

Result: Substantial improvements over prior methods on real-world rain datasets, demonstrating robust generalization without supervised training.

Conclusion: Proposed zero-shot approach effectively removes rain from dynamic videos while preserving background motion and structural consistency, outperforming existing methods without requiring training data or model fine-tuning.

Abstract: Existing video deraining methods are often trained on paired datasets, either synthetic, which limits their ability to generalize to real-world rain, or captured by static cameras, which restricts their effectiveness in dynamic scenes with background and camera motion. Furthermore, recent works in fine-tuning diffusion models have shown promising results, but the fine-tuning tends to weaken the generative prior, limiting generalization to unseen cases. In this paper, we introduce the first zero-shot video deraining method for complex dynamic scenes that does not require synthetic data nor model fine-tuning, by leveraging a pretrained text-to-video diffusion model that demonstrates strong generalization capabilities. By inverting an input video into the latent space of diffusion models, its reconstruction process can be intervened and pushed away from the model's concept of rain using negative prompting. At the core of our approach is an attention switching mechanism that we found is crucial for maintaining dynamic backgrounds as well as structural consistency between the input and the derained video, mitigating artifacts introduced by naive negative prompting. Our approach is validated through extensive experiments on real-world rain datasets, demonstrating substantial improvements over prior methods and showcasing robust generalization without the need for supervised training.

TL;DR: This paper introduces C3, a new dataset for cross-modal geometric reasoning between ground-level photos and floor plans, addressing limitations in existing datasets and improving correspondence prediction by 34% in RMSE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing geometric models fail when inputs are from vastly different viewpoints or modalities compared to training data. Current datasets for photo-floor plan reasoning are limited in either varying modalities (VIGOR) or correspondences (WAFFLE).

Method: Created C3 dataset by reconstructing scenes in 3D from Internet photos via structure-from-motion, then manually registering reconstructions to floor plans from the Internet to derive correspondences between images and floor plans.

Result: C3 contains 90K paired floor plans and photos across 597 scenes with 153M pixel-level correspondences and 85K camera poses. Training on this data improved the best performing method by 34% in RMSE.

Conclusion: The paper identifies open challenges in cross-modal geometric reasoning that the C3 dataset aims to help address, as state-of-the-art correspondence models struggle with this task.

Abstract: Geometric models like DUSt3R have shown great advances in understanding the geometry of a scene from pairs of photos. However, they fail when the inputs are from vastly different viewpoints (e.g., aerial vs. ground) or modalities (e.g., photos vs. abstract drawings) compared to what was observed during training. This paper addresses a challenging version of this problem: predicting correspondences between ground-level photos and floor plans. Current datasets for joint photo--floor plan reasoning are limited, either lacking in varying modalities (VIGOR) or lacking in correspondences (WAFFLE). To address these limitations, we introduce a new dataset, C3, created by first reconstructing a number of scenes in 3D from Internet photo collections via structure-from-motion, then manually registering the reconstructions to floor plans gathered from the Internet, from which we can derive correspondence between images and floor plans. C3 contains 90K paired floor plans and photos across 597 scenes with 153M pixel-level correspondences and 85K camera poses. We find that state-of-the-art correspondence models struggle on this task. By training on our new data, we can improve on the best performing method by 34% in RMSE. We also identify open challenges in cross-modal geometric reasoning that our dataset aims to help address.

Motivation: Existing 3D reconstruction methods focus only on geometry and appearance, lacking the ability to infer essential physical properties needed for safe and effective robot interaction with the environment.

Method: Extends 3D Gaussian Splatting with Bayesian inference to estimate per-point physical properties, iteratively refining material beliefs with new observations while modeling both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties.

Result: Improves mass estimation accuracy by up to 22.8%, reduces Shore hardness error by up to 61.2%, and lowers kinetic friction error by up to 18.1% compared to deterministic baselines across object-scale, indoor, and outdoor datasets.

Conclusion: PhysGS successfully unifies 3D reconstruction, uncertainty modeling, and physical reasoning in a single spatially continuous framework for dense physical property estimation.

Abstract: Understanding physical properties such as friction, stiffness, hardness, and material composition is essential for enabling robots to interact safely and effectively with their surroundings. However, existing 3D reconstruction methods focus on geometry and appearance and cannot infer these underlying physical properties. We present PhysGS, a Bayesian-inferred extension of 3D Gaussian Splatting that estimates dense, per-point physical properties from visual cues and vision--language priors. We formulate property estimation as Bayesian inference over Gaussian splats, where material and property beliefs are iteratively refined as new observations arrive. PhysGS also models aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, enabling uncertainty-aware object and scene interpretation. Across object-scale (ABO-500), indoor, and outdoor real-world datasets, PhysGS improves accuracy of the mass estimation by up to 22.8%, reduces Shore hardness error by up to 61.2%, and lowers kinetic friction error by up to 18.1% compared to deterministic baselines. Our results demonstrate that PhysGS unifies 3D reconstruction, uncertainty modeling, and physical reasoning in a single, spatially continuous framework for dense physical property estimation.

*Wei Dong,Han Zhou,Junwei Lin,Jun Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A generative framework using visual autoregressive modeling with vision-language model guidance for unsupervised dark image restoration, addressing complex noise, blur, and illumination issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world dark images suffer from low visibility, contrast, complex noise, and blur, while existing methods rely on paired data or fail to model dynamic illumination and blur characteristics, leading to poor generalization.

Method: Proposes a VAR-based generative framework guided by VLM perceptual priors, including adaptive curve estimation for illumination modulation, dynamic spatial-frequency-aware RoPE for blur modeling, and recursive phase-domain modulation for artifact reduction.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed unsupervised framework effectively restores dark images by leveraging VLM guidance and advanced modeling techniques for illumination and blur challenges.

Abstract: Real-world dark images commonly exhibit not only low visibility and contrast but also complex noise and blur, posing significant restoration challenges. Existing methods often rely on paired data or fail to model dynamic illumination and blur characteristics, leading to poor generalization. To tackle this, we propose a generative framework based on visual autoregressive (VAR) modeling, guided by perceptual priors from the vision-language model (VLM). Specifically, to supply informative conditioning cues for VAR models, we deploy an adaptive curve estimation scheme to modulate the diverse illumination based on VLM-derived visibility scores. In addition, we integrate dynamic and spatial-frequency-aware Rotary Positional Encodings (SF-RoPE) into VAR to enhance its ability to model structures degraded by blur. Furthermore, we propose a recursive phase-domain modulation strategy that mitigates blur-induced artifacts in the phase domain via bounded iterative refinement guided by VLM-assessed blur scores. Our framework is fully unsupervised and achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.

### [168] [Stage-Specific Benchmarking of Deep Learning Models for Glioblastoma Follow-Up MRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18595)
*Wenhao Guo,Golrokh Mirzaei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper benchmarks deep learning models for differentiating true tumor progression from pseudoprogression in glioblastoma using follow-up MRI scans, finding that model performance varies by time-point and identifies Mamba+CNN hybrid as the best accuracy-efficiency trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Differentiating true tumor progression from treatment-related pseudoprogression in glioblastoma is challenging, especially at early follow-up, necessitating better diagnostic tools.

Method: Eleven deep learning model families were trained on the Burdenko GBM Progression cohort (n=180) using a unified pipeline with patient-level cross-validation, analyzing different post-radiation therapy scans independently.

Result: Model accuracies were comparable (~0.70-0.74) across stages, but discrimination improved at second follow-up. Mamba+CNN hybrid offered best accuracy-efficiency trade-off, while transformers had competitive AUCs but higher computational cost.

Conclusion: The study establishes a stage-aware benchmark and motivates future work with longitudinal modeling, multi-sequence MRI, and larger multi-center cohorts to improve discrimination of tumor progression vs pseudoprogression.

Abstract: Differentiating true tumor progression (TP) from treatment-related pseudoprogression (PsP) in glioblastoma remains challenging, especially at early follow-up. We present the first stage-specific, cross-sectional benchmarking of deep learning models for follow-up MRI using the Burdenko GBM Progression cohort (n = 180). We analyze different post-RT scans independently to test whether architecture performance depends on time-point. Eleven representative DL families (CNNs, LSTMs, hybrids, transformers, and selective state-space models) were trained under a unified, QC-driven pipeline with patient-level cross-validation. Across both stages, accuracies were comparable (~0.70-0.74), but discrimination improved at the second follow-up, with F1 and AUC increasing for several models, indicating richer separability later in the care pathway. A Mamba+CNN hybrid consistently offered the best accuracy-efficiency trade-off, while transformer variants delivered competitive AUCs at substantially higher computational cost and lightweight CNNs were efficient but less reliable. Performance also showed sensitivity to batch size, underscoring the need for standardized training protocols. Notably, absolute discrimination remained modest overall, reflecting the intrinsic difficulty of TP vs. PsP and the dataset's size imbalance. These results establish a stage-aware benchmark and motivate future work incorporating longitudinal modeling, multi-sequence MRI, and larger multi-center cohorts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeAR introduces a coupled neural asset-renderer stack that jointly designs asset representation and neural renderer, enabling end-to-end learnable graphics with improved fidelity, consistency, and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural asset authoring and neural rendering are disjoint fields, limiting potential benefits from their joint design. Coupling them could unlock end-to-end learnable graphics stacks.

Method: Uses Trellis-style Structured 3D Latents with a rectified-flow backbone to create lighting-homogenized neural assets, combined with a lighting-aware neural renderer that uses explicit view embeddings and HDR environment maps for real-time relightable rendering.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in quantitative metrics and perceptual quality across four tasks: G-buffer-based forward rendering, random-lit single-image reconstruction, unknown-lit single-image relighting, and novel-view relighting.

Conclusion: The coupled asset-renderer perspective should inspire future graphics stacks to view neural assets and renderers as co-designed components rather than independent entities.

Abstract: Neural asset authoring and neural rendering have emerged as fundamentally disjoint threads: one generates digital assets using neural networks for traditional graphics pipelines, while the other develops neural renderers that map conventional assets to images. However, the potential of jointly designing the asset representation and renderer remains largely unexplored. We argue that coupling them can unlock an end-to-end learnable graphics stack with benefits in fidelity, consistency, and efficiency. In this paper, we explore this possibility with NeAR: a Coupled Neural Asset-Renderer Stack. On the asset side, we build on Trellis-style Structured 3D Latents and introduce a lighting-homogenized neural asset: from a casually lit input, a rectified-flow backbone predicts a Lighting-Homogenized SLAT that encodes geometry and intrinsic material cues in a compact, view-agnostic latent. On the renderer side, we design a lighting-aware neural renderer that uses this neural asset, along with explicit view embeddings and HDR environment maps, to achieve real-time, relightable rendering. We validate NeAR on four tasks: (1) G-buffer-based forward rendering, (2) random-lit single-image reconstruction, (3) unknown-lit single-image relighting, and (4) novel-view relighting. Our coupled stack surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in both quantitative metrics and perceptual quality. We hope this coupled asset-renderer perspective inspires future graphics stacks that view neural assets and renderers as co-designed components instead of independent entities.

*Wenchao Ma,Dario Kneubuehler,Maurice Chu,Ian Sachs,Haomiao Jiang,Sharon Xiaolei Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RigAnyFace (RAF) is a neural auto-rigging framework that deforms static facial meshes into FACS poses, supporting diverse topologies including disconnected components like eyeballs, using both 3D ground truth and 2D supervision for enhanced generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a scalable facial rigging solution that handles diverse mesh topologies, including disconnected components, while overcoming the limitation of small manually-rigged datasets through additional 2D supervision.

Method: Uses a triangulation-agnostic surface learning network conditioned on FACS parameters, with tailored architecture for disconnected components. Combines 3D supervision from artist-rigged data with 2D supervision for unlabeled neutral meshes.

Result: RAF outperforms previous works in accuracy and generalizability, successfully rigging diverse topologies including artist-crafted assets and in-the-wild samples, while supporting multiple disconnected components for detailed animation.

Conclusion: RAF provides a robust and scalable solution for facial auto-rigging that generalizes well across diverse mesh topologies and enables more detailed expression animation through support for disconnected components.

Abstract: In this paper, we present RigAnyFace (RAF), a scalable neural auto-rigging framework for facial meshes of diverse topologies, including those with multiple disconnected components. RAF deforms a static neutral facial mesh into industry-standard FACS poses to form an expressive blendshape rig. Deformations are predicted by a triangulation-agnostic surface learning network augmented with our tailored architecture design to condition on FACS parameters and efficiently process disconnected components. For training, we curated a dataset of facial meshes, with a subset meticulously rigged by professional artists to serve as accurate 3D ground truth for deformation supervision. Due to the high cost of manual rigging, this subset is limited in size, constraining the generalization ability of models trained exclusively on it. To address this, we design a 2D supervision strategy for unlabeled neutral meshes without rigs. This strategy increases data diversity and allows for scaled training, thereby enhancing the generalization ability of models trained on this augmented data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAF is able to rig meshes of diverse topologies on not only our artist-crafted assets but also in-the-wild samples, outperforming previous works in accuracy and generalizability. Moreover, our method advances beyond prior work by supporting multiple disconnected components, such as eyeballs, for more detailed expression animation.

Developed GANomaly-based anomaly detector with probabilistic calibration using GUESS.

Result: ViT achieved accuracies 0.789-0.843 across datasets, with geometric augmentation achieving AUC 0.91 on Papila dataset (outperforming CNN ensemble AUC 0.87).

Conclusion: Transformer architectures with multi-dataset training and appropriate augmentations provide robust retinal disease detection. Geometric and color augmentations most beneficial, while Laplacian enhancement reduced performance. Combined classifier and anomaly detector approach enables threshold-independent clinical decision support.

Abstract: Reliable detection of retinal diseases from fundus images is challenged by the variability in imaging quality, subtle early-stage manifestations, and domain shift across datasets. In this study, we systematically evaluated a Vision Transformer (ViT) classifier under multiple augmentation and enhancement strategies across several heterogeneous public datasets, as well as the AEyeDB dataset, a high-quality fundus dataset created in-house and made available for the research community. The ViT demonstrated consistently strong performance, with accuracies ranging from 0.789 to 0.843 across datasets and diseases. Diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration were detected reliably, whereas glaucoma remained the most frequently misclassified disease. Geometric and color augmentations provided the most stable improvements, while histogram equalization benefited datasets dominated by structural subtlety. Laplacian enhancement reduced performance across different settings.
  On the Papila dataset, the ViT with geometric augmentation achieved an AUC of 0.91, outperforming previously reported convolutional ensemble baselines (AUC of 0.87), underscoring the advantages of transformer architectures and multi-dataset training. To complement the classifier, we developed a GANomaly-based anomaly detector, achieving an AUC of 0.76 while providing inherent reconstruction-based explainability and robust generalization to unseen data. Probabilistic calibration using GUESS enabled threshold-independent decision support for future clinical implementation.

TL;DR: NeuroVFM is a visual foundation model trained on 5.24 million clinical MRI/CT scans that outperforms frontier AI models in neuroimaging tasks through health system learning from routine clinical data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Frontier AI models underperform on neuroimaging tasks due to lack of access to private clinical data, as neuroimaging data is underrepresented in public domains due to privacy concerns with identifiable facial features.

Method: Used health system learning paradigm with 5.24M clinical MRI/CT volumes, employing scalable volumetric joint-embedding predictive architecture to train NeuroVFM visual foundation model.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance across multiple clinical tasks including radiologic diagnosis and report generation, with emergent neuroanatomic understanding and interpretable visual grounding. When paired with language models, generated reports surpassed frontier models in accuracy, clinical triage, and expert preference.

Conclusion: Health system learning establishes a paradigm for building generalist medical AI, providing a scalable framework for clinical foundation models that reduces hallucinated findings and critical errors for safer clinical decision support.

Abstract: Frontier artificial intelligence (AI) models, such as OpenAI's GPT-5 and Meta's DINOv3, have advanced rapidly through training on internet-scale public data, yet such systems lack access to private clinical data. Neuroimaging, in particular, is underrepresented in the public domain due to identifiable facial features within MRI and CT scans, fundamentally restricting model performance in clinical medicine. Here, we show that frontier models underperform on neuroimaging tasks and that learning directly from uncurated data generated during routine clinical care at health systems, a paradigm we call health system learning, yields high-performance, generalist neuroimaging models. We introduce NeuroVFM, a visual foundation model trained on 5.24 million clinical MRI and CT volumes using a scalable volumetric joint-embedding predictive architecture. NeuroVFM learns comprehensive representations of brain anatomy and pathology, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple clinical tasks, including radiologic diagnosis and report generation. The model exhibits emergent neuroanatomic understanding and interpretable visual grounding of diagnostic findings. When paired with open-source language models through lightweight visual instruction tuning, NeuroVFM generates radiology reports that surpass frontier models in accuracy, clinical triage, and expert preference. Through clinically grounded visual understanding, NeuroVFM reduces hallucinated findings and critical errors, offering safer clinical decision support. These results establish health system learning as a paradigm for building generalist medical AI and provide a scalable framework for clinical foundation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the scarcity of annotated MRI tumor data and limitations of existing methods (manual modeling is labor-intensive, deep generative models require large training pairs).

Method: Two-stage framework: coarse tumor synthesis followed by refinement using generative model, leveraging only healthy scans and limited real annotated data.

Result: Synthetic image-label pairs significantly improve performance on downstream tumor segmentation tasks in low-data regimes.

Conclusion: TF offers a scalable and reliable solution for medical image enrichment, addressing critical challenges in data scarcity for clinical AI applications.

Abstract: The scarcity of annotated Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) tumor data presents a major obstacle to accurate and automated tumor segmentation. While existing data synthesis methods offer promising solutions, they often suffer from key limitations: manual modeling is labor intensive and requires expert knowledge. Deep generative models may be used to augment data and annotation, but they typically demand large amounts of training pairs in the first place, which is impractical in data limited clinical settings. In this work, we propose Tumor Fabrication (TF), a novel two-stage framework for unpaired 3D brain tumor synthesis. The framework comprises a coarse tumor synthesis process followed by a refinement process powered by a generative model. TF is fully automated and leverages only healthy image scans along with a limited amount of real annotated data to synthesize large volumes of paired synthetic data for enriching downstream supervised segmentation training. We demonstrate that our synthetic image-label pairs used as data enrichment can significantly improve performance on downstream tumor segmentation tasks in low-data regimes, offering a scalable and reliable solution for medical image enrichment and addressing critical challenges in data scarcity for clinical AI applications.

*Harrison Bagley,Will Meakin,Simon Lucey,Yee Wei Law,Tat-Jun Chin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A superpixel-based regularization method for creating scale-resilient adversarial patches that maintain effectiveness when rescaled digitally or physically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physical adversarial attacks are easily deployable but vulnerable to scale changes, where interpolation during rescaling smooths out high-frequency patterns and degrades adversarial performance.

Method: Uses SLIC algorithm to cluster pixels into superpixels during patch optimization, with gradient backpropagation through SLIC using Implicit Function Theorem to update superpixel boundaries and colors for scale resilience.

Result: Method achieves better digital performance and preserves these gains in physical realization, with improved performance under real-world conditions tested using screens and cardboard cut-outs.

Conclusion: Superpixel-based regularization produces adversarial patches that maintain structure over scale changes and are less susceptible to interpolation losses, enhancing physical attack robustness.

Abstract: Physical adversarial attacks on deep learning systems is concerning due to the ease of deploying such attacks, usually by placing an adversarial patch in a scene to manipulate the outcomes of a deep learning model. Training such patches typically requires regularization that improves physical realizability (e.g., printability, smoothness) and/or robustness to real-world variability (e.g. deformations, viewing angle, noise). One type of variability that has received little attention is scale variability. When a patch is rescaled, either digitally through downsampling/upsampling or physically through changing imaging distances, interpolation-induced color mixing occurs. This smooths out pixel values, resulting in a loss of high-frequency patterns and degrading the adversarial signal. To address this, we present a novel superpixel-based regularization method that guides patch optimization to scale-resilient structures. Our ap proach employs the Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) algorithm to dynamically cluster pixels in an adversarial patch during optimization. The Implicit Function Theorem is used to backpropagate gradients through SLIC to update the superpixel boundaries and color. This produces patches that maintain their structure over scale and are less susceptible to interpolation losses. Our method achieves greater performance in the digital domain, and when realized physically, these performance gains are preserved, leading to improved physical performance. Real-world performance was objectively assessed using a novel physical evaluation protocol that utilizes screens and cardboard cut-outs to systematically vary real-world conditions.

Motivation: Lane detection models trained on public datasets fail to generalize across different camera viewpoints, particularly for side-mounted cameras used in lane-wheel monitoring.

Method: Combines geometric perspective transformation, AI-driven inpainting, and vehicle body overlays to simulate deployment-specific viewpoints while preserving lane continuity.

Result: Both SCNN and UFLDv2 models show improved robustness to different conditions including shadows, with gains in precision, recall, and F1 score compared to pre-trained models.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable and practical framework to bridge the gap between widely available datasets and deployment-specific scenarios, improving lane detection reliability in pilot deployments.

Abstract: Robust lane detection is essential for advanced driver assistance and autonomous driving, yet models trained on public datasets such as CULane often fail to generalise across different camera viewpoints. This paper addresses the challenge of domain shift for side-mounted cameras used in lane-wheel monitoring by introducing a generative AI-based data enhancement pipeline. The approach combines geometric perspective transformation, AI-driven inpainting, and vehicle body overlays to simulate deployment-specific viewpoints while preserving lane continuity. We evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed augmentation in two state-of-the-art models, SCNN and UFLDv2. With the augmented data trained, both models show improved robustness to different conditions, including shadows. The experimental results demonstrate gains in precision, recall, and F1 score compared to the pre-trained model.
  By bridging the gap between widely available datasets and deployment-specific scenarios, our method provides a scalable and practical framework to improve the reliability of lane detection in a pilot deployment scenario.

TL;DR: Sphinx is a training-free hybrid inference framework for Novel View Synthesis that combines regression-based initialization with diffusion models to achieve high-quality results with significantly reduced computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based NVS methods produce high-quality images but are computationally expensive, while regression-based methods are fast but have poor quality. There's a need for a solution that bridges this gap.

Method: Uses regression-based fast initialization to guide diffusion denoising, integrates selective refinement with adaptive noise scheduling, and allows flexible trade-off navigation between performance and quality.

Result: Achieves 1.8x speedup over diffusion model inference with less than 5% perceptual degradation, establishing a new Pareto frontier between quality and latency.

Conclusion: Sphinx successfully bridges the gap between diffusion-level quality and regression-level efficiency in NVS, providing an adaptable solution for varying inference requirements.

Abstract: Novel View Synthesis (NVS) is the task of generating new images of a scene from viewpoints that were not part of the original input. Diffusion-based NVS can generate high-quality, temporally consistent images, however, remains computationally prohibitive. Conversely, regression-based NVS offers suboptimal generation quality despite requiring significantly lower compute; leaving the design objective of a high-quality, inference-efficient NVS framework an open challenge. To close this critical gap, we present Sphinx, a training-free hybrid inference framework that achieves diffusion-level fidelity at a significantly lower compute. Sphinx proposes to use regression-based fast initialization to guide and reduce the denoising workload for the diffusion model. Additionally, it integrates selective refinement with adaptive noise scheduling, allowing more compute to uncertain regions and frames. This enables Sphinx to provide flexible navigation of the performance-quality trade-off, allowing adaptation to latency and fidelity requirements for dynamically changing inference scenarios. Our evaluation shows that Sphinx achieves an average 1.8x speedup over diffusion model inference with negligible perceptual degradation of less than 5%, establishing a new Pareto frontier between quality and latency in NVS serving.

Conclusion: Image editing-oriented diffusion transformers show strong potential for geometry-aware perception tasks, providing a more suitable foundation than traditional text-to-image generators.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion transformers have shown remarkable generalization in visual synthesis, yet most dense perception methods still rely on text-to-image (T2I) generators designed for stochastic generation. We revisit this paradigm and show that image editing diffusion models are inherently image-to-image consistent, providing a more suitable foundation for dense perception task. We introduce Edit2Perceive, a unified diffusion framework that adapts editing models for depth, normal, and matting. Built upon the FLUX.1 Kontext architecture, our approach employs full-parameter fine-tuning and a pixel-space consistency loss to enforce structure-preserving refinement across intermediate denoising states. Moreover, our single-step deterministic inference yields up to faster runtime while training on relatively small datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate comprehensive state-of-the-art results across all three tasks, revealing the strong potential of editing-oriented diffusion transformers for geometry-aware perception.

TL;DR: MedVision introduces a large-scale dataset and benchmark for evaluating VLMs on quantitative medical image analysis, showing current models perform poorly but can be significantly improved with supervised fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs in medicine focus on categorical QA and qualitative tasks, but clinical decision-making requires quantitative assessments like measuring tumor sizes or joint angles, which remain underexplored.

Method: Created MedVision dataset spanning 22 public datasets with 30.8M image-annotation pairs, focusing on three quantitative tasks: anatomical detection, tumor/lesion size estimation, and angle/distance measurement.

Result: Off-the-shelf VLMs perform poorly on quantitative tasks, but supervised fine-tuning on MedVision significantly enhances performance across all three tasks with reduced error rates and improved precision.

Conclusion: This work provides a foundation for developing VLMs with robust quantitative reasoning capabilities in medical imaging, addressing a critical gap in current medical AI systems.

Abstract: Current vision-language models (VLMs) in medicine are primarily designed for categorical question answering (e.g., "Is this normal or abnormal?") or qualitative descriptive tasks. However, clinical decision-making often relies on quantitative assessments, such as measuring the size of a tumor or the angle of a joint, from which physicians draw their own diagnostic conclusions. This quantitative reasoning capability remains underexplored and poorly supported in existing VLMs. In this work, we introduce MedVision, a large-scale dataset and benchmark specifically designed to evaluate and improve VLMs on quantitative medical image analysis. MedVision spans 22 public datasets covering diverse anatomies and modalities, with 30.8 million image-annotation pairs. We focus on three representative quantitative tasks: (1) detection of anatomical structures and abnormalities, (2) tumor/lesion (T/L) size estimation, and (3) angle/distance (A/D) measurement. Our benchmarks show that current off-the-shelf VLMs perform poorly on these tasks. However, with supervised fine-tuning on MedVision, we significantly enhance their performance across detection, T/L estimation, and A/D measurement, demonstrating reduced error rates and improved precision. This work provides a foundation for developing VLMs with robust quantitative reasoning capabilities in medical imaging. Code and data are available at https://medvision-vlm.github.io.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sketch-based person re-identification faces challenges due to significant modality gaps between hand-drawn sketches and RGB surveillance images, and limited annotated data.

Method: Proposes two components: Alignment Augmentation (applies sketch-style transformations) and Knowledge Transfer Catalyst (enhances invariance through worst-case perturbations). Uses meta-learning to transfer alignment knowledge from RGB to sketch domains.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, particularly in data-scarce conditions.

Conclusion: KTCAA effectively addresses modality gaps in sketch-based re-identification through theoretically grounded alignment and invariance mechanisms.

Abstract: Sketch based person re-identification aims to match hand-drawn sketches with RGB surveillance images, but remains challenging due to significant modality gaps and limited annotated data. To address this, we introduce KTCAA, a theoretically grounded framework for few-shot cross-modal generalization. Motivated by generalization theory, we identify two key factors influencing target domain risk: (1) domain discrepancy, which quantifies the alignment difficulty between source and target distributions; and (2) perturbation invariance, which evaluates the model's robustness to modality shifts. Based on these insights, we propose two components: (1) Alignment Augmentation (AA), which applies localized sketch-style transformations to simulate target distributions and facilitate progressive alignment; and (2) Knowledge Transfer Catalyst (KTC), which enhances invariance by introducing worst-case perturbations and enforcing consistency. These modules are jointly optimized under a meta-learning paradigm that transfers alignment knowledge from data-rich RGB domains to sketch-based scenarios. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that KTCAA achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in data-scarce conditions.

TL;DR: A decoder-free neural representation for 3D meshes using geometry images and Optimal Transport, enabling efficient storage and single-pass restoration with continuous LoD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural mesh representations rely on computationally expensive successive decoding passes due to irregular mesh connectivity, while image-based methods offer efficient processing but are difficult to apply to meshes.

Method: Transform irregular meshes into regular geometry images using Optimal Transport to resolve sampling issues, then apply efficient image-based neural processing with geometry-image mipmapping for continuous LoD.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art storage efficiency and restoration accuracy, measured by compression ratio, Chamfer distance, and Hausdorff distance metrics.

Conclusion: Geometry image-based representation with Optimal Transport enables decoder-free, storage-efficient neural processing of 3D meshes with superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Neural representations for 3D meshes are emerging as an effective solution for compact storage and efficient processing. Existing methods often rely on neural overfitting, where a coarse mesh is stored and progressively refined through multiple decoder networks. While this can restore high-quality surfaces, it is computationally expensive due to successive decoding passes and the irregular structure of mesh data. In contrast, images have a regular structure that enables powerful super-resolution and restoration frameworks, but applying these advantages to meshes is difficult because their irregular connectivity demands complex encoder-decoder architectures. Our key insight is that a geometry image-based representation transforms irregular meshes into a regular image grid, making efficient image-based neural processing directly applicable. Building on this idea, we introduce our neural geometry image-based representation, which is decoder-free, storage-efficient, and naturally suited for neural processing. It stores a low-resolution geometry-image mipmap of the surface, from which high-quality meshes are restored in a single forward pass. To construct geometry images, we leverage Optimal Transport (OT), which resolves oversampling in flat regions and undersampling in feature-rich regions, and enables continuous levels of detail (LoD) through geometry-image mipmapping. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art storage efficiency and restoration accuracy, measured by compression ratio (CR), Chamfer distance (CD), and Hausdorff distance (HD).

### [181] [Hierarchical GraphCut Phase Unwrapping based on Invariance of Diffeomorphisms Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18682)
*Xiang Gao,Xinmu Wang,Zhou Zhao,Junqi Huang,Xianfeng David Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a phase unwrapping framework using diffeomorphisms and hierarchical GraphCut for real-time 3D scanning applications, achieving 45.5x speedup with lower error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing phase unwrapping methods trade speed for accuracy - fast approaches lack precision while accurate algorithms are too slow for real-time use in applications like VR/AR and digital human creation.

Method: Reformulates GraphCut-based unwrapping as pixel-labeling problem using diffeomorphisms (conformal and optimal transport maps) applied in image space. Uses odd number of precomputed diffeomorphisms with hierarchical GraphCut in each domain, then fuses results via majority voting.

Result: Achieves 45.5x speedup with lower L2 error in both real experiments and simulations compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables real-time phase unwrapping with high accuracy, showing potential for applications requiring fast and precise 3D scanning.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed rapid advancements in 3D scanning technologies, with applications spanning VR/AR, digital human creation, and medical imaging. Structured-light scanning with phase-shifting techniques is preferred for its use of low-intensity visible light and high accuracy, making it well suited for capturing 4D facial dynamics. A key step is phase unwrapping, which recovers continuous phase values from measurements wrapped modulo 2pi. The goal is to estimate the unwrapped phase count k in the equation Phi = phi + 2pi k, where phi is the wrapped phase and Phi is the true phase. Noise, occlusions, and complex 3D geometry make recovering the true phase challenging because phase unwrapping is ill-posed: measurements only provide modulo 2pi values, and estimating k requires assumptions about surface continuity. Existing methods trade speed for accuracy: fast approaches lack precision, while accurate algorithms are too slow for real-time use. To overcome these limitations, this work proposes a phase unwrapping framework that reformulates GraphCut-based unwrapping as a pixel-labeling problem. This framework improves the estimation of the unwrapped phase count k through the invariance property of diffeomorphisms applied in image space via conformal and optimal transport (OT) maps. An odd number of diffeomorphisms are precomputed from the input phase data, and a hierarchical GraphCut algorithm is applied in each domain. The resulting label maps are fused via majority voting to robustly estimate k at each pixel. Experimental results demonstrate a 45.5x speedup and lower L2 error in real experiments and simulations, showing potential for real-time applications.

*Shristi Das Biswas,Arani Roy,Kaushik Roy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ICE is a training-free, modality-agnostic method for precise concept removal in text-to-image and text-to-video models without retraining or inference overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing concept removal methods suffer from costly retraining, inference overhead, vulnerability to attacks, and collateral damage due to latent semantic overlap between target concepts and surrounding content.

Method: Defines erase and preserve subspaces using anisotropic energy-weighted scaling, uses a closed-form overlap projector to regularize against intersection, and applies a convex Spectral Unlearning Objective with analytical solution translated to text-conditioning layers.

Result: Achieves strong erasure of artistic styles, objects, identities, and explicit content with improved robustness to red-teaming, while causing minimal degradation of original generative abilities in both T2I and T2V models.

Conclusion: ICE provides an efficient, permanent, and runtime-free solution for precise concept removal across multiple modalities with zero overhead.

Abstract: Robust concept removal for text-to-image (T2I) and text-to-video (T2V) models is essential for their safe deployment. Existing methods, however, suffer from costly retraining, inference overhead, or vulnerability to adversarial attacks. Crucially, they rarely model the latent semantic overlap between the target erase concept and surrounding content -- causing collateral damage post-erasure -- and even fewer methods work reliably across both T2I and T2V domains. We introduce Instant Concept Erasure (ICE), a training-free, modality-agnostic, one-shot weight modification approach that achieves precise, persistent unlearning with zero overhead. ICE defines erase and preserve subspaces using anisotropic energy-weighted scaling, then explicitly regularises against their intersection using a unique, closed-form overlap projector. We pose a convex and Lipschitz-bounded Spectral Unlearning Objective, balancing erasure fidelity and intersection preservation, that admits a stable and unique analytical solution. This solution defines a dissociation operator that is translated to the model's text-conditioning layers, making the edit permanent and runtime-free. Across targeted removals of artistic styles, objects, identities, and explicit content, ICE efficiently achieves strong erasure with improved robustness to red-teaming, all while causing only minimal degradation of original generative abilities in both T2I and T2V models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CFG-Bench is a new benchmark with 1,368 videos and 19,562 multimodal Q&A pairs to evaluate MLLMs' fine-grained action intelligence for embodied physical interaction, covering four cognitive abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on high-level planning or spatial reasoning but neglect fine-grained action intelligence needed for embodied physical interaction in complex environments.

Method: Created CFG-Bench with curated videos and multimodal questions targeting four cognitive abilities: Physical Interaction, Temporal-Causal Relation, Intentional Understanding, and Evaluative Judgment.

Result: Leading MLLMs struggle with detailed physical interaction instructions and show limitations in higher-order reasoning. Supervised fine-tuning on CFG-Bench data significantly improves performance on established embodied benchmarks.

Conclusion: CFG-Bench reveals critical gaps in MLLMs' fine-grained action intelligence and provides a framework for developing more capable embodied agents through targeted training.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show promising results as decision-making engines for embodied agents operating in complex, physical environments. However, existing benchmarks often prioritize high-level planning or spatial reasoning, leaving the fine-grained action intelligence required for embodied physical interaction underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce CFG-Bench, a new benchmark designed to systematically evaluate this crucial capability. CFG-Bench consists of 1,368 curated videos paired with 19,562 three-modalities question-answer pairs targeting four cognitive abilities: 1) Physical Interaction, 2) Temporal-Causal Relation, 3) Intentional Understanding, and 4) Evaluative Judgment. Together, these dimensions provide a systematic framework for assessing a model's ability to translate visual observations into actionable knowledge, moving beyond mere surface-level recognition. Our comprehensive evaluation on CFG-Bench reveals that leading MLLMs struggle to produce detailed instructions for physical interactions and exhibit profound limitations in the higher-order reasoning of intention and evaluation. Moreover, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on our data demonstrates that teaching an MLLMs to articulate fine-grained actions directly translates to significant performance gains on established embodied benchmarks. Our analysis highlights these limitations and offers insights for developing more capable and grounded embodied agents.

TL;DR: This paper explores end-to-end 3D object detection using fisheye cameras, develops two fisheye-compatible methods (FisheyeBEVDet and FisheyePETR), and releases a new dataset called Fisheye3DOD, achieving up to 6.2% accuracy improvement over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the performance drop when applying standard pinhole-based 3D object detectors to fisheye imagery, and to leverage the unique geometry of fisheye cameras for surround-view perception systems.

Method: Developed two methods: FisheyeBEVDet (based on bird's-eye-view paradigm) and FisheyePETR (based on query-based paradigm), both using spherical spatial representations to capture fisheye geometry. Also created Fisheye3DOD dataset using CARLA simulator.

Result: Experiments on the Fisheye3DOD dataset show that the fisheye-compatible modeling improves 3D object detection accuracy by up to 6.2% compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The proposed fisheye-compatible 3D object detection methods effectively address the geometric challenges of fisheye imagery and demonstrate significant performance improvements, with the released dataset providing a valuable benchmark for future research.

Abstract: In this work, we explore the technical feasibility of implementing end-to-end 3D object detection (3DOD) with surround-view fisheye camera system. Specifically, we first investigate the performance drop incurred when transferring classic pinhole-based 3D object detectors to fisheye imagery. To mitigate this, we then develop two methods that incorporate the unique geometry of fisheye images into mainstream detection frameworks: one based on the bird's-eye-view (BEV) paradigm, named FisheyeBEVDet, and the other on the query-based paradigm, named FisheyePETR. Both methods adopt spherical spatial representations to effectively capture fisheye geometry. In light of the lack of dedicated evaluation benchmarks, we release Fisheye3DOD, a new open dataset synthesized using CARLA and featuring both standard pinhole and fisheye camera arrays. Experiments on Fisheye3DOD show that our fisheye-compatible modeling improves accuracy by up to 6.2% over baseline methods.

### [186] [Dendritic Convolution for Noise Image Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18699)
*Jiarui Xue,Dongjian Yang,Ye Sun,Gang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel anti-noise dendritic convolution (DDC) that mimics biological neuron dendrites to improve robustness against noise in image recognition tasks, achieving significant performance gains over traditional convolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing anti-noise methods in image recognition have reached performance bottlenecks by focusing on network adjustments and training strategies. The paper explores anti-interference solutions from a neuronal perspective to fundamentally address noise interference.

Method: Proposes dendritic convolution that mimics neuronal dendrite structure, integrates neighborhood interaction computation, and simulates biological dendrites' XOR logic preprocessing through nonlinear feature interactions, reconstructing the mathematical paradigm of feature extraction.

Result: In image classification (YOLOv11-cls, VGG16, EfficientNet-B0) and object detection (YOLOv11, YOLOv8, YOLOv5), replacing traditional convolution with DDC improved EfficientNet-B0 accuracy on noisy datasets by 11.23% and YOLOv8 mAP by 19.80%.

Conclusion: The dendritic convolution's computational method aligns with biological neuron dendrites, enabling significantly better performance than traditional convolution in complex noisy environments by mitigating noise influence through neighborhood information interactions.

Abstract: In real-world scenarios of image recognition, there exists substantial noise interference. Existing works primarily focus on methods such as adjusting networks or training strategies to address noisy image recognition, and the anti-noise performance has reached a bottleneck. However, little is known about the exploration of anti-interference solutions from a neuronal perspective.This paper proposes an anti-noise neuronal convolution. This convolution mimics the dendritic structure of neurons, integrates the neighborhood interaction computation logic of dendrites into the underlying design of convolutional operations, and simulates the XOR logic preprocessing function of biological dendrites through nonlinear interactions between input features, thereby fundamentally reconstructing the mathematical paradigm of feature extraction. Unlike traditional convolution where noise directly interferes with feature extraction and exerts a significant impact, DDC mitigates the influence of noise by focusing on the interaction of neighborhood information. Experimental results demonstrate that in image classification tasks (using YOLOv11-cls, VGG16, and EfficientNet-B0) and object detection tasks (using YOLOv11, YOLOv8, and YOLOv5), after replacing traditional convolution with the dendritic convolution, the accuracy of the EfficientNet-B0 model on noisy datasets is relatively improved by 11.23%, and the mean Average Precision (mAP) of YOLOv8 is increased by 19.80%. The consistency between the computation method of this convolution and the dendrites of biological neurons enables it to perform significantly better than traditional convolution in complex noisy environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ObjectAlign is a framework that combines perceptual metrics with symbolic reasoning to detect and fix object inconsistencies in edited videos, improving video quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video editing often causes object inconsistencies like flicker and identity drift that reduce perceptual quality, which needs to be addressed systematically.

Method: Uses learnable thresholds for consistency metrics, neuro-symbolic verification with SMT-based identity checks and temporal logic verification, and neural network interpolation for frame repair.

Result: Achieves up to 1.4 point improvement in CLIP Score and 6.1 point improvement in warp error compared to state-of-the-art methods on DAVIS and Pexels datasets.

Conclusion: ObjectAlign effectively combines perceptual and symbolic approaches to ensure both low-level stability and high-level temporal correctness in video editing.

Abstract: Video editing and synthesis often introduce object inconsistencies, such as frame flicker and identity drift that degrade perceptual quality. To address these issues, we introduce ObjectAlign, a novel framework that seamlessly blends perceptual metrics with symbolic reasoning to detect, verify, and correct object-level and temporal inconsistencies in edited video sequences. The novel contributions of ObjectAlign are as follows: First, we propose learnable thresholds for metrics characterizing object consistency (i.e. CLIP-based semantic similarity, LPIPS perceptual distance, histogram correlation, and SAM-derived object-mask IoU). Second, we introduce a neuro-symbolic verifier that combines two components: (a) a formal, SMT-based check that operates on masked object embeddings to provably guarantee that object identity does not drift, and (b) a temporal fidelity check that uses a probabilistic model checker to verify the video's formal representation against a temporal logic specification. A frame transition is subsequently deemed "consistent" based on a single logical assertion that requires satisfying both the learned metric thresholds and this unified neuro-symbolic constraint, ensuring both low-level stability and high-level temporal correctness. Finally, for each contiguous block of flagged frames, we propose a neural network based interpolation for adaptive frame repair, dynamically choosing the interpolation depth based on the number of frames to be corrected. This enables reconstruction of the corrupted frames from the last valid and next valid keyframes. Our results show up to 1.4 point improvement in CLIP Score and up to 6.1 point improvement in warp error compared to SOTA baselines on the DAVIS and Pexels video datasets.

Motivation: Existing diffusion codecs based on text-to-image models like Stable Diffusion have suboptimal text conditioning for compression, limiting their potential especially at ultra-low bitrates.

Method: Developed CoD - a compression-oriented diffusion foundation model trained from scratch on open image-only datasets, enabling end-to-end optimization of compression and generation.

Result: CoD achieves SOTA compression efficiency (e.g., 0.0039 bpp), 300x faster training than Stable Diffusion (~20 vs ~6,250 A100 GPU days), and can achieve VTM-level PSNR with high perceptual quality while outperforming GAN-based codecs with fewer parameters.

Conclusion: CoD lays the foundation for future diffusion codec research by providing a specialized compression-oriented model that addresses limitations of text-conditioned diffusion models.

Abstract: Existing diffusion codecs typically build on text-to-image diffusion foundation models like Stable Diffusion. However, text conditioning is suboptimal from a compression perspective, hindering the potential of downstream diffusion codecs, particularly at ultra-low bitrates. To address it, we introduce \textbf{CoD}, the first \textbf{Co}mpression-oriented \textbf{D}iffusion foundation model, trained from scratch to enable end-to-end optimization of both compression and generation. CoD is not a fixed codec but a general foundation model designed for various diffusion-based codecs. It offers several advantages: \textbf{High compression efficiency}, replacing Stable Diffusion with CoD in downstream codecs like DiffC achieves SOTA results, especially at ultra-low bitrates (e.g., 0.0039 bpp); \textbf{Low-cost and reproducible training}, 300$\times$ faster training than Stable Diffusion ($\sim$ 20 vs. $\sim$ 6,250 A100 GPU days) on entirely open image-only datasets; \textbf{Providing new insights}, e.g., We find pixel-space diffusion can achieve VTM-level PSNR with high perceptual quality and can outperform GAN-based codecs using fewer parameters. We hope CoD lays the foundation for future diffusion codec research. Codes will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in FSVDA where domain shifts affect both individual modalities and multimodal feature fusion, requiring simultaneous domain alignment and modality collaboration.

Method: Introduces Modality-Collaborative LowRank Decomposers (MC-LRD) with Multimodal Decomposition Routers to decompose modality-unique and shared features, using orthogonal constraints and cross-domain activation consistency loss.

Result: Extensive experiments on three benchmarks show significant improvements over existing methods.

Conclusion: MC-LRD effectively handles domain shifts in multimodal video data through collaborative decomposition and cross-domain consistency, achieving superior performance in few-shot video domain adaptation.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the challenging task of Few-Shot Video Domain Adaptation (FSVDA). The multimodal nature of videos introduces unique challenges, necessitating the simultaneous consideration of both domain alignment and modality collaboration in a few-shot scenario, which is ignored in previous literature. We observe that, under the influence of domain shift, the generalization performance on the target domain of each individual modality, as well as that of fused multimodal features, is constrained. Because each modality is comprised of coupled features with multiple components that exhibit different domain shifts. This variability increases the complexity of domain adaptation, thereby reducing the effectiveness of multimodal feature integration. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework of Modality-Collaborative LowRank Decomposers (MC-LRD) to decompose modality-unique and modality-shared features with different domain shift levels from each modality that are more friendly for domain alignment. The MC-LRD comprises multiple decomposers for each modality and Multimodal Decomposition Routers (MDR). Each decomposer has progressively shared parameters across different modalities. The MDR is leveraged to selectively activate the decomposers to produce modality-unique and modality-shared features. To ensure efficient decomposition, we apply orthogonal decorrelation constraints separately to decomposers and subrouters, enhancing their diversity. Furthermore, we propose a cross-domain activation consistency loss to guarantee that target and source samples of the same category exhibit consistent activation preferences of the decomposers, thereby facilitating domain alignment. Extensive experimental results on three public benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves significant improvements over existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the out-of-distribution (OOD) issue in vision-centric 3D object detection for autonomous driving, where training data fails to cover all test scenarios due to high annotation costs and diverse outdoor scenes.

Method: Proposes DriveFlow based on pre-trained Text-to-Image flow models with frequency decomposition: 1) High-Frequency Foreground Preservation using alignment loss to maintain 3D object geometry, 2) Dual-Frequency Background Optimization to balance editing flexibility and semantic consistency.

Result: Comprehensive experiments show effectiveness and efficiency, with performance improvements across all categories in OOD scenarios.

Conclusion: DriveFlow successfully enhances training data for autonomous driving through frequency-based adaptation of noise-free editing paths, improving model robustness without modifying pre-trained diffusion models.

Abstract: In autonomous driving, vision-centric 3D object detection recognizes and localizes 3D objects from RGB images. However, due to high annotation costs and diverse outdoor scenes, training data often fails to cover all possible test scenarios, known as the out-of-distribution (OOD) issue. Training-free image editing offers a promising solution for improving model robustness by training data enhancement without any modifications to pre-trained diffusion models. Nevertheless, inversion-based methods often suffer from limited effectiveness and inherent inaccuracies, while recent rectified-flow-based approaches struggle to preserve objects with accurate 3D geometry. In this paper, we propose DriveFlow, a Rectified Flow Adaptation method for training data enhancement in autonomous driving based on pre-trained Text-to-Image flow models. Based on frequency decomposition, DriveFlow introduces two strategies to adapt noise-free editing paths derived from text-conditioned velocities. 1) High-Frequency Foreground Preservation: DriveFlow incorporates a high-frequency alignment loss for foreground to maintain precise 3D object geometry. 2) Dual-Frequency Background Optimization: DriveFlow also conducts dual-frequency optimization for background, balancing editing flexibility and semantic consistency. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness and efficiency of DriveFlow, demonstrating comprehensive performance improvements on all categories across OOD scenarios.

TL;DR: ViPO improves GRPO for visual generative models by converting scalar rewards into pixel-level advantage maps using pretrained vision backbones, enabling fine-grained optimization of spatial and temporal regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GRPO pipelines use single scalar rewards per sample, ignoring spatial/temporal structure and hindering correction of localized artifacts and fine-grained perceptual modeling.

Method: ViPO employs a Perceptual Structuring Module with pretrained vision backbones to create spatially and temporally aware advantage maps, redistributing optimization pressure to perceptually important regions while maintaining GRPO stability.

Result: ViPO consistently outperforms vanilla GRPO across image and video benchmarks, improving in-domain alignment with human preferences and enhancing out-of-domain generalization.

Conclusion: ViPO provides a more expressive and informative learning signal for visual generation, is architecture-agnostic, lightweight, and fully compatible with existing GRPO pipelines.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a powerful tool for post-training visual generative models, with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) increasingly used to align generators with human preferences. However, existing GRPO pipelines rely on a single scalar reward per sample, treating each image or video as a holistic entity and ignoring the rich spatial and temporal structure of visual content. This coarse supervision hinders the correction of localized artifacts and the modeling of fine-grained perceptual cues. We introduce Visual Preference Policy Optimization (ViPO), a GRPO variant that lifts scalar feedback into structured, pixel-level advantages. ViPO employs a Perceptual Structuring Module that uses pretrained vision backbones to construct spatially and temporally aware advantage maps, redistributing optimization pressure toward perceptually important regions while preserving the stability of standard GRPO. Across both image and video benchmarks, ViPO consistently outperforms vanilla GRPO, improving in-domain alignment with human-preference rewards and enhancing generalization on out-of-domain evaluations. The method is architecture-agnostic, lightweight, and fully compatible with existing GRPO training pipelines, providing a more expressive and informative learning signal for visual generation.

TL;DR: GuideFlow is a novel autonomous driving planning framework that uses Constrained Flow Matching to address multimodal trajectory mode collapse and directly enforce safety/physical constraints during generation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on major benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing E2E planners have limitations - Imitative planners suffer from multimodal trajectory mode collapse, while Generative planners cannot directly incorporate safety/physical constraints and require additional optimization stages.

Method: Uses Constrained Flow Matching to explicitly model the flow matching process, directly enforces explicit constraints within generation, unifies flow matching with Energy-Based Model training for autonomous constraint optimization, and parameterizes driving aggressiveness as a control signal.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on major benchmarks including Bench2Drive, NuScenes, NavSim and ADV-NuScenes. On NavSim test hard split, achieved EPDMS score of 43.0.

Conclusion: GuideFlow effectively addresses key limitations in existing E2E planners by directly incorporating constraints during generation and enabling flexible trajectory style control, demonstrating superior performance across multiple driving benchmarks.

Abstract: Driving planning is a critical component of end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving. However, prevailing Imitative E2E Planners often suffer from multimodal trajectory mode collapse, failing to produce diverse trajectory proposals. Meanwhile, Generative E2E Planners struggle to incorporate crucial safety and physical constraints directly into the generative process, necessitating an additional optimization stage to refine their outputs. In this paper, we propose \textit{\textbf{GuideFlow}}, a novel planning framework that leverages Constrained Flow Matching. Concretely, \textit{\textbf{GuideFlow}} explicitly models the flow matching process, which inherently mitigates mode collapse and allows for flexible guidance from various conditioning signals. Our core contribution lies in directly enforcing explicit constraints within the flow matching generation process, rather than relying on implicit constraint encoding. Crucially, \textit{\textbf{GuideFlow}} unifies the training of the flow matching with the Energy-Based Model (EBM) to enhance the model's autonomous optimization capability to robustly satisfy physical constraints. Secondly, \textit{\textbf{GuideFlow}} parameterizes driving aggressiveness as a control signal during generation, enabling precise manipulation of trajectory style. Extensive evaluations on major driving benchmarks (Bench2Drive, NuScenes, NavSim and ADV-NuScenes) validate the effectiveness of \textit{\textbf{GuideFlow}}. Notably, on the NavSim test hard split (Navhard), \textit{\textbf{GuideFlow}} achieved SOTA with an EPDMS score of 43.0. The code will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on single diffusion models, limiting personalized and boundless city-scale scene generation capabilities.

Method: Hierarchical 'City-District-Grid' planning with global and local agents, iterative 'produce-refine-evaluate' isometric image synthesis, and relationship-guided expansion with scene graph-based optimization.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all evaluation aspects including semantics, geometry, texture, and layout on a comprehensive benchmark.

Conclusion: Yo'City enables user-customized and infinitely expandable 3D city generation through agentic framework design and demonstrates superior performance over existing approaches.

Abstract: Realistic 3D city generation is fundamental to a wide range of applications, including virtual reality and digital twins. However, most existing methods rely on training a single diffusion model, which limits their ability to generate personalized and boundless city-scale scenes. In this paper, we present Yo'City, a novel agentic framework that enables user-customized and infinitely expandable 3D city generation by leveraging the reasoning and compositional capabilities of off-the-shelf large models. Specifically, Yo'City first conceptualize the city through a top-down planning strategy that defines a hierarchical "City-District-Grid" structure. The Global Planner determines the overall layout and potential functional districts, while the Local Designer further refines each district with detailed grid-level descriptions. Subsequently, the grid-level 3D generation is achieved through a "produce-refine-evaluate" isometric image synthesis loop, followed by image-to-3D generation. To simulate continuous city evolution, Yo'City further introduces a user-interactive, relationship-guided expansion mechanism, which performs scene graph-based distance- and semantics-aware layout optimization, ensuring spatially coherent city growth. To comprehensively evaluate our method, we construct a diverse benchmark dataset and design six multi-dimensional metrics that assess generation quality from the perspectives of semantics, geometry, texture, and layout. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Yo'City consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across all evaluation aspects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foresight Intelligence (anticipating future events) is essential for applications like autonomous driving but overlooked by existing research. Need a principled way to evaluate and develop this capability.

Method: Created FSU-QA dataset specifically designed for foresight-oriented VQA tasks. Evaluated state-of-the-art VLMs on foresight reasoning and assessed world models by measuring semantic coherence of generated predictions.

Result: Current VLMs struggle with foresight reasoning. Small VLMs fine-tuned on FSU-QA outperform much larger advanced models by substantial margins. FSU-QA effectively enhances foresight reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: FSU-QA provides a principled foundation for developing next-generation models capable of anticipating and understanding future events, addressing a critical gap in AI capabilities.

Abstract: In this work, we define Foresight Intelligence as the capability to anticipate and interpret future events-an ability essential for applications such as autonomous driving, yet largely overlooked by existing research. To bridge this gap, we introduce FSU-QA, a new Visual Question-Answering (VQA) dataset specifically designed to elicit and evaluate Foresight Intelligence. Using FSU-QA, we conduct the first comprehensive study of state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs) under foresight-oriented tasks, revealing that current models still struggle to reason about future situations. Beyond serving as a benchmark, FSU-QA also enables the assessment of world models by measuring the semantic coherence of their generated predictions, quantified through performance gains when VLMs are augmented with such outputs. Our experiments further demonstrate that FSU-QA can effectively enhance foresight reasoning: even small VLMs fine-tuned on FSU-QA surpass much larger, advanced models by a substantial margin. Together, these findings position FSU-QA as a principled foundation for developing next-generation models capable of truly anticipating and understanding future events.

*Zhenghan Fang,Jian Zheng,Qiaozi Gao,Xiaofeng Gao,Jeremias Sulam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProxT2I is a text-to-image diffusion model that uses backward discretization with learned proximal operators instead of score functions, optimized for efficiency and human preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional diffusion models use forward discretization which is slow and unstable, requiring many sampling steps. The authors aim to improve sampling efficiency and stability.

Method: Developed ProxT2I using backward discretizations with learned conditional proximal operators, optimized with reinforcement learning for task-specific rewards. Created LAION-Face-T2I-15M dataset with 15M human images for training.

Result: Enhanced sampling efficiency and human-preference alignment compared to score-based baselines. Achieved state-of-the-art performance with lower compute and smaller model size.

Conclusion: ProxT2I offers a lightweight yet performant solution for human text-to-image generation, achieving competitive results with improved efficiency.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a dominant paradigm for generative modeling across a wide range of domains, including prompt-conditional generation. The vast majority of samplers, however, rely on forward discretization of the reverse diffusion process and use score functions that are learned from data. Such forward and explicit discretizations can be slow and unstable, requiring a large number of sampling steps to produce good-quality samples. In this work we develop a text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model based on backward discretizations, dubbed ProxT2I, relying on learned and conditional proximal operators instead of score functions. We further leverage recent advances in reinforcement learning and policy optimization to optimize our samplers for task-specific rewards. Additionally, we develop a new large-scale and open-source dataset comprising 15 million high-quality human images with fine-grained captions, called LAION-Face-T2I-15M, for training and evaluation. Our approach consistently enhances sampling efficiency and human-preference alignment compared to score-based baselines, and achieves results on par with existing state-of-the-art and open-source text-to-image models while requiring lower compute and smaller model size, offering a lightweight yet performant solution for human text-to-image generation.

TL;DR: PEWM proposes primitive embodied world models that restrict video generation to shorter horizons to enable fine-grained language-action alignment, reduce complexity, improve data efficiency, and decrease latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video-generation-based embodied world models face bottlenecks due to reliance on large-scale embodied interaction data, which is scarce, difficult to collect, and high-dimensional, limiting language-action alignment and long-horizon video generation.

Method: PEWM restricts video generation to fixed shorter horizons and incorporates a modular Vision-Language Model planner with Start-Goal heatmap Guidance mechanism for flexible closed-loop control and compositional generalization of primitive-level policies.

Result: The approach enables fine-grained alignment between linguistic concepts and visual representations of robotic actions, reduces learning complexity, improves data efficiency, and decreases inference latency.

Conclusion: PEWM bridges the gap between fine-grained physical interaction and high-level reasoning by leveraging spatiotemporal vision priors and semantic awareness, paving the way toward scalable, interpretable, and general-purpose embodied intelligence.

Abstract: While video-generation-based embodied world models have gained increasing attention, their reliance on large-scale embodied interaction data remains a key bottleneck. The scarcity, difficulty of collection, and high dimensionality of embodied data fundamentally limit the alignment granularity between language and actions and exacerbate the challenge of long-horizon video generation--hindering generative models from achieving a \textit{"GPT moment"} in the embodied domain. There is a naive observation: \textit{the diversity of embodied data far exceeds the relatively small space of possible primitive motions}. Based on this insight, we propose \textbf{Primitive Embodied World Models} (PEWM), which restricts video generation to fixed shorter horizons, our approach \textit{1) enables} fine-grained alignment between linguistic concepts and visual representations of robotic actions, \textit{2) reduces} learning complexity, \textit{3) improves} data efficiency in embodied data collection, and \textit{4) decreases} inference latency. By equipping with a modular Vision-Language Model (VLM) planner and a Start-Goal heatmap Guidance mechanism (SGG), PEWM further enables flexible closed-loop control and supports compositional generalization of primitive-level policies over extended, complex tasks. Our framework leverages the spatiotemporal vision priors in video models and the semantic awareness of VLMs to bridge the gap between fine-grained physical interaction and high-level reasoning, paving the way toward scalable, interpretable, and general-purpose embodied intelligence.

*Yongqi Zhu,Morui Zhu,Qi Chen,Deyuan Qu,Song Fu,Qing Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RefPtsFusion is a lightweight cooperative autonomous driving framework that exchanges compact reference points instead of large feature maps, reducing communication bandwidth by 5 orders of magnitude while maintaining perception performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional cooperative driving methods share large feature maps or query embeddings, which creates high communication overhead and limits scalability. There's a need for a more efficient, sensor- and model-independent approach that works across heterogeneous vehicles.

Method: Vehicles exchange compact reference points (object positions, velocities, size info) instead of feature maps. Uses selective Top-K query fusion to add high-confidence queries from senders, balancing accuracy and communication cost.

Result: Reduces communication overhead from hundreds of MB/s to just a few KB/s at 5 FPS (5 orders of magnitude reduction) while maintaining stable perception performance on M3CAD dataset. Shows strong robustness and consistent transmission behavior.

Conclusion: RefPtsFusion provides a scalable, real-time cooperative driving solution with minimal communication requirements, making it practical for heterogeneous vehicle fleets with different sensors and perception models.

Abstract: We present RefPtsFusion, a lightweight and interpretable framework for cooperative autonomous driving. Instead of sharing large feature maps or query embeddings, vehicles exchange compact reference points, e.g., objects' positions, velocities, and size information. This approach shifts the focus from "what is seen" to "where to see", creating a sensor- and model-independent interface that works well across vehicles with heterogeneous perception models while greatly reducing communication bandwidth. To enhance the richness of shared information, we further develop a selective Top-K query fusion that selectively adds high-confidence queries from the sender. It thus achieves a strong balance between accuracy and communication cost. Experiments on the M3CAD dataset show that RefPtsFusion maintains stable perception performance while reducing communication overhead by five orders of magnitude, dropping from hundreds of MB/s to only a few KB/s at 5 FPS (frame per second), compared to traditional feature-level fusion methods. Extensive experiments also demonstrate RefPtsFusion's strong robustness and consistent transmission behavior, highlighting its potential for scalable, real-time cooperative driving systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VAOT is an unpaired image enhancement framework for color fundus photography that uses optimal transport with vessel structure-preserving regularizers to maintain vascular connectivity and endpoint integrity while reducing noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GAN-based unpaired enhancement methods often distort clinically critical vasculature by altering vessel topology and endpoint integrity, which can affect diagnostic accuracy in retinal disease monitoring.

Method: Combines optimal-transport objective with two structure-preserving regularizers: skeleton-based loss for global vascular connectivity and endpoint-aware loss for local termini stabilization.

Result: Superior performance on synthetic degradation benchmarks and downstream evaluations in vessel and lesion segmentation compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: VAOT effectively reduces noise while preserving vessel structure, making it suitable for clinical applications where vascular integrity is crucial for diagnosis.

Abstract: Color fundus photography (CFP) is central to diagnosing and monitoring retinal disease, yet its acquisition variability (e.g., illumination changes) often degrades image quality, which motivates robust enhancement methods. Unpaired enhancement pipelines are typically GAN-based, however, they can distort clinically critical vasculature, altering vessel topology and endpoint integrity. Motivated by these structural alterations, we propose Vessel-Aware Optimal Transport (\textbf{VAOT}), a framework that combines an optimal-transport objective with two structure-preserving regularizers: (i) a skeleton-based loss to maintain global vascular connectivity and (ii) an endpoint-aware loss to stabilize local termini. These constraints guide learning in the unpaired setting, reducing noise while preserving vessel structure. Experimental results on synthetic degradation benchmark and downstream evaluations in vessel and lesion segmentation demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods against several state-of-the art baselines.

*Hui Shan,Ming Li,Haitao Yang,Kai Zheng,Sizhe Zheng,Yanwei Fu,Xiangru Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method for generating diverse PBR textures for 3D garment meshes from non-isometric images, overcoming topological constraints through physically simulated datasets and uncertainty-guided baking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing industrial 3D garment meshes have limited texture diversity, and current generative methods require strict topological consistency or accurate mesh deformation, constraining texture generation quality and flexibility.

Method: Constructed 3D Garment Videos dataset with consistent geometry/material supervision across deformations; used Nano Banana for non-isometric image editing; proposed iterative baking with uncertainty-guided view selection and reweighting to fuse multi-view predictions.

Result: The feedforward dual-branch architecture generates versatile, spatially aligned PBR materials suitable for industry-level 3D garment design, enabling reliable cross-topology texture generation between non-isometric image-geometry pairs.

Conclusion: The approach successfully addresses the challenging problem of non-isometric image-based garment texture generation, providing production-ready PBR textures without requiring strict topological consistency or pose matching.

Abstract: Existing industrial 3D garment meshes already cover most real-world clothing geometries, yet their texture diversity remains limited. To acquire more realistic textures, generative methods are often used to extract Physically-based Rendering (PBR) textures and materials from large collections of wild images and project them back onto garment meshes. However, most image-conditioned texture generation approaches require strict topological consistency between the input image and the input 3D mesh, or rely on accurate mesh deformation to match to the image poses, which significantly constrains the texture generation quality and flexibility. To address the challenging problem of non-isometric image-based garment texture generation, we construct 3D Garment Videos, a physically simulated, garment-centric dataset that provides consistent geometry and material supervision across diverse deformations, enabling robust cross-pose texture learning. We further employ Nano Banana for high-quality non-isometric image editing, achieving reliable cross-topology texture generation between non-isometric image-geometry pairs. Finally, we propose an iterative baking method via uncertainty-guided view selection and reweighting that fuses multi-view predictions into seamless, production-ready PBR textures. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our feedforward dual-branch architecture generates versatile and spatially aligned PBR materials suitable for industry-level 3D garment design.

TL;DR: VSAD is a novel framework for unsupervised multi-view anomaly detection that learns viewpoint-invariant representations by modeling geometric consistency across views, achieving state-of-the-art performance on challenging datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods treat multiple views as disconnected images, leading to inconsistent feature representations and high false-positive rates when distinguishing genuine defects from benign appearance variations caused by viewpoint changes.

Method: Introduces ViewSense-AD with Multi-View Alignment Module (MVAM) using homography to align features between views, integrated into View-Align Latent Diffusion Model (VALDM) for progressive multi-stage alignment, plus Fusion Refiner Module (FRM) for global consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments on RealIAD and MANTA datasets show VSAD sets new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming existing methods in pixel, view, and sample-level anomaly detection with robustness to large viewpoint shifts and complex textures.

Conclusion: VSAD successfully addresses the challenge of multi-view anomaly detection by learning viewpoint-invariant representations through geometric consistency modeling, demonstrating superior performance and robustness compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Unsupervised visual anomaly detection from multi-view images presents a significant challenge: distinguishing genuine defects from benign appearance variations caused by viewpoint changes. Existing methods, often designed for single-view inputs, treat multiple views as a disconnected set of images, leading to inconsistent feature representations and a high false-positive rate. To address this, we introduce ViewSense-AD (VSAD), a novel framework that learns viewpoint-invariant representations by explicitly modeling geometric consistency across views. At its core is our Multi-View Alignment Module (MVAM), which leverages homography to project and align corresponding feature regions between neighboring views. We integrate MVAM into a View-Align Latent Diffusion Model (VALDM), enabling progressive and multi-stage alignment during the denoising process. This allows the model to build a coherent and holistic understanding of the object's surface from coarse to fine scales. Furthermore, a lightweight Fusion Refiner Module (FRM) enhances the global consistency of the aligned features, suppressing noise and improving discriminative power. Anomaly detection is performed by comparing multi-level features from the diffusion model against a learned memory bank of normal prototypes. Extensive experiments on the challenging RealIAD and MANTA datasets demonstrate that VSAD sets a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming existing methods in pixel, view, and sample-level visual anomaly proving its robustness to large viewpoint shifts and complex textures.

TL;DR: Re-CatVTON is an efficient single UNet Virtual Try-On model that achieves high performance with reduced computational overhead compared to Dual UNet models, using improved conditioning strategies and direct garment latent injection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dual UNet VTON models provide superior fidelity but incur substantial computational and memory overhead due to their heavy structure. There's a need for more efficient models that maintain high performance.

Method: Developed Re-CatVTON as an efficient single UNet model with three hypotheses about context feature learning. Introduced modified classifier-free guidance for spatial concatenation conditioning and direct injection of ground-truth garment latent to prevent error accumulation.

Result: Significantly improved performance over predecessor CatVTON with better FID, KID, and LPIPS scores, and only marginal SSIM decrease. Requires less computation and memory than high-performance Dual UNet model Leffa.

Conclusion: Re-CatVTON establishes a new efficiency-performance trade-off for single UNet VTON models, demonstrating that high performance can be achieved with reduced computational requirements through improved conditioning strategies.

Abstract: Virtual Try-On (VTON) is the task of synthesizing an image of a person wearing a target garment, conditioned on a person image and a garment image. While diffusion-based VTON models featuring a Dual UNet architecture demonstrate superior fidelity compared to single UNet models, they incur substantial computational and memory overhead due to their heavy structure. In this study, through visualization analysis and theoretical analysis, we derived three hypotheses regarding the learning of context features to condition the denoising process. Based on these hypotheses, we developed Re-CatVTON, an efficient single UNet model that achieves high performance. We further enhance the model by introducing a modified classifier-free guidance strategy tailored for VTON's spatial concatenation conditioning, and by directly injecting the ground-truth garment latent derived from the clean garment latent to prevent the accumulation of prediction error. The proposed Re-CatVTON significantly improves performance compared to its predecessor (CatVTON) and requires less computation and memory than the high-performance Dual UNet model, Leffa. Our results demonstrate improved FID, KID, and LPIPS scores, with only a marginal decrease in SSIM, establishing a new efficiency-performance trade-off for single UNet VTON models.

TL;DR: ConceptGuard is a unified safeguard framework that proactively detects and mitigates unsafe semantics in multimodal video generation by identifying latent safety risks and steering the generative process away from unsafe concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety methods for video generation are often text-only, require prior knowledge of risk categories, or operate as post-generation auditors, struggling to proactively mitigate compositional, multimodal risks that emerge from the interaction of text and images.

Method: ConceptGuard operates in two stages: 1) A contrastive detection module identifies latent safety risks by projecting fused image-text inputs into a structured concept space; 2) A semantic suppression mechanism steers the generative process away from unsafe concepts by intervening in the prompt's multimodal conditioning.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on ConceptRisk and T2VSafetyBench-TI2V benchmarks show that ConceptGuard consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art results in both risk detection and safe video generation.

Conclusion: ConceptGuard provides an effective unified framework for proactively addressing safety risks in multimodal video generation, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods through rigorous evaluation on novel benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent progress in video generative models has enabled the creation of high-quality videos from multimodal prompts that combine text and images. While these systems offer enhanced controllability, they also introduce new safety risks, as harmful content can emerge from individual modalities or their interaction. Existing safety methods are often text-only, require prior knowledge of the risk category, or operate as post-generation auditors, struggling to proactively mitigate such compositional, multimodal risks. To address this challenge, we present ConceptGuard, a unified safeguard framework for proactively detecting and mitigating unsafe semantics in multimodal video generation. ConceptGuard operates in two stages: First, a contrastive detection module identifies latent safety risks by projecting fused image-text inputs into a structured concept space; Second, a semantic suppression mechanism steers the generative process away from unsafe concepts by intervening in the prompt's multimodal conditioning. To support the development and rigorous evaluation of this framework, we introduce two novel benchmarks: ConceptRisk, a large-scale dataset for training on multimodal risks, and T2VSafetyBench-TI2V, the first benchmark adapted from T2VSafetyBench for the Text-and-Image-to-Video (TI2V) safety setting. Comprehensive experiments on both benchmarks show that ConceptGuard consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art results in both risk detection and safe video generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current streamline classification methods rely only on geometric features and fail to distinguish functionally distinct fiber tracts with similar pathways.

Method: Dual-stream network with pretrained backbone for full streamline trajectories and auxiliary network processing fMRI signals from fiber endpoint regions.

Result: Superior performance in parcellating corticospinal tract into four somatotopic subdivisions compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Joint analysis of dMRI and fMRI data enhances functional coherence of tract parcellation for more meaningful white matter tract identification.

Abstract: Streamline classification is essential to identify anatomically meaningful white matter tracts from diffusion MRI (dMRI) tractography. However, current streamline classification methods rely primarily on the geometric features of the streamline trajectory, failing to distinguish between functionally distinct fiber tracts with similar pathways. To address this, we introduce a novel dual-stream streamline classification framework that jointly analyzes dMRI and functional MRI (fMRI) data to enhance the functional coherence of tract parcellation. We design a novel network that performs streamline classification using a pretrained backbone model for full streamline trajectories, while augmenting with an auxiliary network that processes fMRI signals from fiber endpoint regions. We demonstrate our method by parcellating the corticospinal tract (CST) into its four somatotopic subdivisions. Experimental results from ablation studies and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate our approach's superior performance.

TL;DR: STCDiT is a video super-resolution framework that uses a pre-trained video diffusion model to restore structurally faithful and temporally stable videos from degraded inputs, even with complex camera motions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in maintaining temporal stability during reconstruction and preserving structural fidelity during generation in video super-resolution, particularly for videos with complex camera motions.

Method: Develops motion-aware VAE reconstruction with segment-wise processing for uniform motion characteristics, and anchor-frame guidance that leverages structural information from first-frame latents to constrain generation.

Result: Extensive experiments show STCDiT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in structural fidelity and temporal consistency.

Conclusion: The combination of motion-aware VAE reconstruction and anchor-frame guidance enables high-quality video super-resolution with improved structural fidelity and temporal stability.

Abstract: We present STCDiT, a video super-resolution framework built upon a pre-trained video diffusion model, aiming to restore structurally faithful and temporally stable videos from degraded inputs, even under complex camera motions. The main challenges lie in maintaining temporal stability during reconstruction and preserving structural fidelity during generation. To address these challenges, we first develop a motion-aware VAE reconstruction method that performs segment-wise reconstruction, with each segment clip exhibiting uniform motion characteristic, thereby effectively handling videos with complex camera motions. Moreover, we observe that the first-frame latent extracted by the VAE encoder in each clip, termed the anchor-frame latent, remains unaffected by temporal compression and retains richer spatial structural information than subsequent frame latents. We further develop an anchor-frame guidance approach that leverages structural information from anchor frames to constrain the generation process and improve structural fidelity of video features. Coupling these two designs enables the video diffusion model to achieve high-quality video super-resolution. Extensive experiments show that STCDiT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of structural fidelity and temporal consistency.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Perfection Gap Factor (PGF) to measure how finetuning VLMs on one visual perception task affects zero-shot performance on other tasks, revealing task relationships and transfer patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs underperform on specialized visual perception tasks compared to humans and specialized models, and task-specific finetuning unpredictably affects performance on other tasks, making efficient training challenging.

Method: Systematically study task transferability by finetuning three open-weight VLMs on 13 perception tasks, using PGF metric to quantify transfer effects and construct task-transfer graphs.

Result: Revealed patterns of positive/negative transfer, identified task groups that mutually influence each other, organized tasks into personas based on transfer behavior, and showed PGF can guide efficient data selection.

Conclusion: The findings provide actionable guidance for advancing VLMs by highlighting opportunities for positive transfer and risks of negative interference, enabling more efficient training strategies.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) perform well on multimodal benchmarks but lag behind humans and specialized models on visual perception tasks like depth estimation or object counting. Finetuning on one task can unpredictably affect performance on others, making task-specific finetuning challenging. In this paper, we address this challenge through a systematic study of task transferability. We examine how finetuning a VLM on one perception task affects its zero-shot performance on others. To quantify these effects, we introduce Perfection Gap Factor (PGF), a metric that captures both the breadth and magnitude of transfer. Using three open-weight VLMs evaluated across 13 perception tasks, we construct a task-transfer graph that reveals previously unobserved relationships among perception tasks. Our analysis uncovers patterns of positive and negative transfer, identifies groups of tasks that mutually influence each other, organizes tasks into personas based on their transfer behavior and demonstrates how PGF can guide data selection for more efficient training. These findings highlight both opportunities for positive transfer and risks of negative interference, offering actionable guidance for advancing VLMs.

TL;DR: StereoDETR is an efficient stereo 3D object detection framework that achieves real-time inference while maintaining competitive accuracy, outperforming monocular methods in speed for the first time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stereo-based 3D detection methods offer higher accuracy than monocular approaches but suffer from high computational overhead and latency, with current state-of-the-art stereo methods being only half as fast as monocular ones despite having twice the accuracy.

Method: StereoDETR uses a dual-branch architecture: a monocular DETR branch for predicting object scale, orientation, and sampling points, and a stereo branch that leverages low-cost multi-scale disparity features to predict object-level depth maps. The branches are coupled through a differentiable depth sampling strategy, with constrained supervision for handling occlusion without extra annotations.

Result: The method achieves real-time inference and is the first stereo-based approach to surpass monocular methods in speed. It achieves competitive accuracy on the KITTI benchmark and sets new state-of-the-art results on pedestrian and cyclist subsets.

Conclusion: StereoDETR successfully addresses the speed limitations of stereo 3D detection while maintaining high accuracy, making stereo-based approaches practical for real-time applications.

Abstract: Compared to monocular 3D object detection, stereo-based 3D methods offer significantly higher accuracy but still suffer from high computational overhead and latency. The state-of-the-art stereo 3D detection method achieves twice the accuracy of monocular approaches, yet its inference speed is only half as fast. In this paper, we propose StereoDETR, an efficient stereo 3D object detection framework based on DETR. StereoDETR consists of two branches: a monocular DETR branch and a stereo branch. The DETR branch is built upon 2D DETR with additional channels for predicting object scale, orientation, and sampling points. The stereo branch leverages low-cost multi-scale disparity features to predict object-level depth maps. These two branches are coupled solely through a differentiable depth sampling strategy. To handle occlusion, we introduce a constrained supervision strategy for sampling points without requiring extra annotations. StereoDETR achieves real-time inference and is the first stereo-based method to surpass monocular approaches in speed. It also achieves competitive accuracy on the public KITTI benchmark, setting new state-of-the-art results on pedestrian and cyclist subsets.

### [207] [Scale What Counts, Mask What Matters: Evaluating Foundation Models for Zero-Shot Cross-Domain Wi-Fi Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18792)
*Cheng Jiang,Yihe Yan,Yanxiang Wang,Chun Tung Chou,Wen Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a foundation model approach using Masked Autoencoding (MAE) pretraining on large-scale Wi-Fi CSI datasets to address domain shift problems in Wi-Fi sensing, showing that data scale and diversity are more critical than model capacity for cross-domain generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wi-Fi sensing faces critical domain shift problems where models trained in one setup fail to generalize to new environments, hardware, or users, limiting practical utility despite being privacy-preserving compared to cameras.

Method: Applied foundation model approach with Masked Autoencoding (MAE) pretraining on the largest Wi-Fi CSI dataset collection (1.3M+ samples from 14 datasets, 4 devices, 2.4/5/6 GHz bands, 20-160 MHz bandwidths) and conducted systematic evaluation of data diversity vs model capacity impacts.

Result: Showed log-linear improvements in unseen domain performance with increasing pretraining data; larger models provide only marginal gains; cross-domain accuracy improved by 2.2% to 15.7% on human activity recognition, gesture recognition, and user identification tasks compared to supervised baselines.

Conclusion: Data scale and diversity, rather than model capacity, are the current bottleneck for Wi-Fi sensing generalization, providing insightful direction for designing robust real-world Wi-Fi sensing systems.

Abstract: While Wi-Fi sensing offers a compelling, privacy-preserving alternative to cameras, its practical utility has been fundamentally undermined by a lack of robustness across domains. Models trained in one setup fail to generalize to new environments, hardware, or users, a critical "domain shift" problem exacerbated by modest, fragmented public datasets. We shift from this limited paradigm and apply a foundation model approach, leveraging Masked Autoencoding (MAE) style pretraining on the largest and most heterogeneous Wi-Fi CSI datasets collection assembled to date. Our study pretrains and evaluates models on over 1.3 million samples extracted from 14 datasets, collected using 4 distinct devices across the 2.4/5/6 GHz bands and bandwidths from 20 to 160 MHz. Our large-scale evaluation is the first to systematically disentangle the impacts of data diversity versus model capacity on cross-domain performance. The results establish scaling trends on Wi-Fi CSI sensing. First, our experiments show log-linear improvements in unseen domain performance as the amount of pretraining data increases, suggesting that data scale and diversity are key to domain generalization. Second, based on the current data volume, larger model can only provide marginal gains for cross-domain performance, indicating that data, rather than model capacity, is the current bottleneck for Wi-Fi sensing generalization. Finally, we conduct a series of cross-domain evaluations on human activity recognition, human gesture recognition and user identification tasks. The results show that the large-scale pretraining improves cross-domain accuracy ranging from 2.2% to 15.7%, compared to the supervised learning baseline. Overall, our findings provide insightful direction for designing future Wi-Fi sensing systems that can eventually be robust enough for real-world deployment.

### [208] [PartDiffuser: Part-wise 3D Mesh Generation via Discrete Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18801)
*Yichen Yang,Hong Li,Haodong Zhu,Linin Yang,Guojun Lei,Sheng Xu,Baochang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PartDiffuser is a semi-autoregressive diffusion framework for point-cloud-to-mesh generation that balances global structural consistency with high-fidelity local details by using autoregression between parts and parallel diffusion within parts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autoregressive methods for generating artist-designed meshes struggle to balance global structural consistency with high-fidelity local details and are susceptible to error accumulation.

Method: The method performs semantic segmentation on the mesh, then uses autoregression between parts for global topology and parallel discrete diffusion within each semantic part for high-frequency geometric features. It's based on DiT architecture with part-aware cross-attention using point clouds as hierarchical geometric conditioning.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that PartDiffuser significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in generating 3D meshes with rich detail, exhibiting exceptional detail representation suitable for real-world applications.

Conclusion: PartDiffuser effectively decouples global and local generation tasks, achieving superior mesh generation with both structural consistency and high-fidelity details.

Abstract: Existing autoregressive (AR) methods for generating artist-designed meshes struggle to balance global structural consistency with high-fidelity local details, and are susceptible to error accumulation. To address this, we propose PartDiffuser, a novel semi-autoregressive diffusion framework for point-cloud-to-mesh generation. The method first performs semantic segmentation on the mesh and then operates in a "part-wise" manner: it employs autoregression between parts to ensure global topology, while utilizing a parallel discrete diffusion process within each semantic part to precisely reconstruct high-frequency geometric features. PartDiffuser is based on the DiT architecture and introduces a part-aware cross-attention mechanism, using point clouds as hierarchical geometric conditioning to dynamically control the generation process, thereby effectively decoupling the global and local generation tasks. Experiments demonstrate that this method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in generating 3D meshes with rich detail, exhibiting exceptional detail representation suitable for real-world applications.

*Qinglei Cao,Ziyao Tang,Xiaoqin Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel 3D CT reconstruction framework that uses target priors from projection data to enhance implicit learning, achieving 10x faster learning and significant PSNR improvements over state-of-the-art methods in ultra-sparse view scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing implicit 3D reconstruction methods for CT neglect anatomical priors, limiting reconstruction precision and learning efficiency, especially in ultra-sparse view scenarios.

Method: Proposes a framework using target priors derived from projection data, integrating positional and structural encoding for voxel-wise implicit reconstruction. Includes a CUDA-based algorithm for rapid 3D target prior estimation from sparse-view projections.

Result: Achieves 10x faster learning efficiency than NAF and PSNR improvements of 3.57 dB, 5.42 dB, and 5.70 dB over NeRP with 10, 20, and 30 projections respectively on abdominal dataset.

Conclusion: The target prior-guided approach significantly enhances both learning efficiency and reconstruction quality in ultra-sparse view CT reconstruction, demonstrating superior performance over current state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: X-ray imaging, based on penetration, enables detailed visualization of internal structures. Building on this capability, existing implicit 3D reconstruction methods have adapted the NeRF model and its variants for internal CT reconstruction. However, these approaches often neglect the significance of objects' anatomical priors for implicit learning, limiting both reconstruction precision and learning efficiency, particularly in ultra-sparse view scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel 3D CT reconstruction framework that employs a 'target prior' derived from the object's projection data to enhance implicit learning. Our approach integrates positional and structural encoding to facilitate voxel-wise implicit reconstruction, utilizing the target prior to guide voxel sampling and enrich structural encoding. This dual strategy significantly boosts both learning efficiency and reconstruction quality. Additionally, we introduce a CUDA-based algorithm for rapid estimation of high-quality 3D target priors from sparse-view projections. Experiments utilizing projection data from a complex abdominal dataset demonstrate that the proposed model substantially enhances learning efficiency, outperforming the current leading model, NAF, by a factor of ten. In terms of reconstruction quality, it also exceeds the most accurate model, NeRP, achieving PSNR improvements of 3.57 dB, 5.42 dB, and 5.70 dB with 10, 20, and 30 projections, respectively.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLM-based HOI detection methods require additional training or prompt tuning, causing computational overhead and poor performance in long-tailed scenarios where rare interactions are underrepresented.

Conclusion: ADC effectively mitigates long-tail bias in HOI detection while preserving overall performance, offering a training-free solution that enhances scalability and reduces computational overhead.

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection is a fundamental task in computer vision, empowering machines to comprehend human-object relationships in diverse real-world scenarios. Recent advances in VLMs have significantly improved HOI detection by leveraging rich cross-modal representations. However, most existing VLM-based approaches rely heavily on additional training or prompt tuning, resulting in substantial computational overhead and limited scalability, particularly in long-tailed scenarios where rare interactions are severely underrepresented. In this paper, we propose the Adaptive Diversity Cache (ADC) module, a novel training-free and plug-and-play mechanism designed to mitigate long-tail bias in HOI detection. ADC constructs class-specific caches that accumulate high-confidence and diverse feature representations during inference. The method incorporates frequency-aware cache adaptation that favors rare categories and is designed to enable robust prediction calibration without requiring additional training or fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets show that ADC consistently improves existing HOI detectors, achieving up to +8.57\% mAP gain on rare categories and +4.39\% on the full dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating long-tail bias while preserving overall performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 4D object detection methods lack temporal consistency modeling or use complex multi-stage pipelines prone to error propagation, and there's a shortage of large-scale datasets with continuous 3D bounding box annotations.

Method: Proposes DetAny4D framework that fuses multi-modal features from pre-trained models, uses geometry-aware spatiotemporal decoder, and employs multi-task learning with dedicated training strategy for global consistency across variable-length sequences.

Result: Extensive experiments show competitive detection accuracy and significantly improved temporal stability, effectively addressing jitter and inconsistency issues in 4D object detection.

Conclusion: DetAny4D provides an effective solution for reliable 4D object detection with improved temporal consistency, enabled by the new DA4D dataset and the proposed end-to-end framework.

Abstract: Reliable 4D object detection, which refers to 3D object detection in streaming video, is crucial for perceiving and understanding the real world. Existing open-set 4D object detection methods typically make predictions on a frame-by-frame basis without modeling temporal consistency, or rely on complex multi-stage pipelines that are prone to error propagation across cascaded stages. Progress in this area has been hindered by the lack of large-scale datasets that capture continuous reliable 3D bounding box (b-box) annotations. To overcome these challenges, we first introduce DA4D, a large-scale 4D detection dataset containing over 280k sequences with high-quality b-box annotations collected under diverse conditions. Building on DA4D, we propose DetAny4D, an open-set end-to-end framework that predicts 3D b-boxes directly from sequential inputs. DetAny4D fuses multi-modal features from pre-trained foundational models and designs a geometry-aware spatiotemporal decoder to effectively capture both spatial and temporal dynamics. Furthermore, it adopts a multi-task learning architecture coupled with a dedicated training strategy to maintain global consistency across sequences of varying lengths. Extensive experiments show that DetAny4D achieves competitive detection accuracy and significantly improves temporal stability, effectively addressing long-standing issues of jitter and inconsistency in 4D object detection. Data and code will be released upon acceptance.

*Nimeshika Udayangani,Sarah Erfani,Christopher Leckie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SupLID is a novel framework for pixel-level Out-of-Distribution detection in semantic segmentation that enhances classifier-based OOD scores using Linear Intrinsic Dimensionality and superpixel-level analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional image-level OOD methods adapted for semantic segmentation inherit limitations like vulnerability to overconfidence, and there's a need for better pixel-precise anomaly detection for real-world applications like autonomous driving.

Method: SupLID constructs a geometrical coreset capturing the intrinsic structure of in-distribution data using Linear Intrinsic Dimensionality, then computes OOD scores at superpixel level for efficient inference and improved spatial smoothness.

Result: SupLID significantly enhances existing classifier-based OOD scores, achieving state-of-the-art performance across key metrics including AUR, FPR, and AUP.

Conclusion: Geometrical cues from SupLID serve as complementary signals to traditional classifier confidence, enabling better detection of diverse OOD scenarios while maintaining seamless integration with any semantic segmentation classifier.

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection in semantic segmentation aims to localize anomalous regions at the pixel level, advancing beyond traditional image-level OOD techniques to better suit real-world applications such as autonomous driving. Recent literature has successfully explored the adaptation of commonly used image-level OOD methods--primarily based on classifier-derived confidence scores (e.g., energy or entropy)--for this pixel-precise task. However, these methods inherit a set of limitations, including vulnerability to overconfidence. In this work, we introduce SupLID, a novel framework that effectively guides classifier-derived OOD scores by exploiting the geometrical structure of the underlying semantic space, particularly using Linear Intrinsic Dimensionality (LID). While LID effectively characterizes the local structure of high-dimensional data by analyzing distance distributions, its direct application at the pixel level remains challenging. To overcome this, SupLID constructs a geometrical coreset that captures the intrinsic structure of the in-distribution (ID) subspace. It then computes OOD scores at the superpixel level, enabling both efficient real-time inference and improved spatial smoothness. We demonstrate that geometrical cues derived from SupLID serve as a complementary signal to traditional classifier confidence, enhancing the model's ability to detect diverse OOD scenarios. Designed as a post-hoc scoring method, SupLID can be seamlessly integrated with any semantic segmentation classifier at deployment time. Our results demonstrate that SupLID significantly enhances existing classifier-based OOD scores, achieving state-of-the-art performance across key evaluation metrics, including AUR, FPR, and AUP.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A fully automated pipeline that converts raw 3D scans into high-quality dialogue data to address the scarcity of 3D scene-dialogue datasets, resolving viewpoint and object referring ambiguities at low cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D MLLMs lag behind 2D peers due to scarce high-quality 3D scene-dialogue datasets, with prior methods relying on expensive human annotation and leaving viewpoint and object referring ambiguities unresolved.

Method: Four-stage automated pipeline: (1) meta-annotation collection, (2) scene graph construction with relation correction, (3) discriminative object referring for exclusive descriptions, (4) multi-task data generation synthesizing diverse dialogues.

Result: Produced Disc3D dataset with over 2 million samples in 25K hybrid 3D scenes, spanning multiple tasks including captioning, visual grounding, and object-centric QA. Training with Disc3D yields consistent significant improvements on benchmarks.

Conclusion: The automated pipeline successfully generates high-quality 3D dialogue data at low cost, systematically mitigating dataset flaws and enabling significant performance improvements for 3D MLLMs.

Abstract: 3D Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) still lag behind their 2D peers, largely because large-scale, high-quality 3D scene-dialogue datasets remain scarce. Prior efforts hinge on expensive human annotation and leave two key ambiguities unresolved: viewpoint ambiguity, where spatial language presumes unknown camera poses, and object referring ambiguity, where non-exclusive descriptions blur the line between targets and distractors. We therefore present a fully automated pipeline that converts raw 3D scans into unambiguous, high-quality dialogue data at a fraction of the previous cost. By synergizing rule-based constraints with 2D MLLMs and LLMs, the pipeline enables controllable, scalable generation without human intervention. The pipeline comprises four stages: (1) meta-annotation collection harvesting object-, frame-, and scene-level captions, (2) scene graph construction with relation correction to capture proximal object relations, (3) discriminative object referring that generates exclusive and compact descriptions, and (4) multi-task data generation synthesizing diverse dialogues. Our pipeline systematically mitigates inherent flaws in source datasets and produces the final Disc3D dataset, over 2 million samples in 25K hybrid 3D scenes, spanning scene, view, and object captioning, visual grounding, and five object-centric QA tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that training with Disc3D yields consistent, significant improvements on both public benchmarks and our multifaceted Disc3D-QA tasks. Code, data, and models will be publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the fundamental trade-off between generation quality and computational efficiency in diffusion models, addressing the limitations of Latent Diffusion Models (information loss, non-end-to-end training) and pixel space models (computational prohibitive for high-resolution synthesis).

Method: Decouples generation into two stages: global stage using Diffusion Transformer backbone on large patches for efficient structure construction, and local stage using co-trained lightweight Patch Detailer Head that leverages contextual features to restore fine-grained details.

Result: Achieves computational efficiency comparable to LDMs without VAE reliance, with up to 10x faster inference speeds than previous methods while increasing parameters by only 0.3%, and achieves 1.90 FID score on ImageNet 256x256.

Conclusion: DiP successfully resolves the efficiency-quality dilemma in diffusion models through its synergistic two-stage design, enabling efficient pixel space generation without compromising quality.

Abstract: Diffusion models face a fundamental trade-off between generation quality and computational efficiency. Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) offer an efficient solution but suffer from potential information loss and non-end-to-end training. In contrast, existing pixel space models bypass VAEs but are computationally prohibitive for high-resolution synthesis. To resolve this dilemma, we propose DiP, an efficient pixel space diffusion framework. DiP decouples generation into a global and a local stage: a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) backbone operates on large patches for efficient global structure construction, while a co-trained lightweight Patch Detailer Head leverages contextual features to restore fine-grained local details. This synergistic design achieves computational efficiency comparable to LDMs without relying on a VAE. DiP is accomplished with up to 10$\times$ faster inference speeds than previous method while increasing the total number of parameters by only 0.3%, and achieves an 1.90 FID score on ImageNet 256$\times$256.

TL;DR: VideoPerceiver is a video multimodal large language model that enhances fine-grained perception through a two-stage training framework with key-information-missing videos and relative rewards, achieving state-of-the-art performance on fine-grained action understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address VMLLMs' limited ability to reason about brief actions in short clips and rare transient events in long videos by improving fine-grained perception in video understanding.

Method: Two-stage training: 1) SFT with key-information-missing videos created by replacing key frames with adjacent frames, using auxiliary contrastive loss; 2) RL with relative rewards comparing responses from complete vs degraded videos to recover precise action details.

Result: Substantially outperforms state-of-the-art VMLLMs on fine-grained action understanding and rare event captioning benchmarks while maintaining strong performance on standard tasks.

Conclusion: VideoPerceiver redefines video-language model training by prioritizing task-relevant visual features for enhanced fine-grained perception.

Abstract: We propose VideoPerceiver, a novel video multimodal large language model (VMLLM) that enhances fine-grained perception in video understanding, addressing VMLLMs' limited ability to reason about brief actions in short clips or rare transient events in long videos. VideoPerceiver adopts a two-stage training framework. During supervised fine-tuning (SFT), we construct "key-information-missing" videos by extracting event-action keywords from captions, identifying corresponding key frames, and replacing them with adjacent frames. We jointly encode original and modified video tokens with text tokens, aligning intermediate visual representations with keywords via an auxiliary contrastive loss to enhance sensitivity to fine-grained motion cues. In reinforcement learning (RL), both video variants are fed into the model to generate descriptions, and a novel relative reward ensures responses from complete videos outperform those from degraded inputs, explicitly training the model to recover temporally precise action details. We also curate a dataset of 80,000 videos with fine-grained actions and transient events. Experiments show VideoPerceiver substantially outperforms state-of-the-art VMLLMs on fine-grained action understanding and rare event captioning benchmarks, while maintaining strong performance on standard tasks. By prioritizing task-relevant visual features, our work redefines video-language model training for fine-grained perception.

TL;DR: CLIP models can automatically detect vision-language alignment in infant-perspective videos, revealing that ideal learning moments (words matching visible objects) are rare in children's everyday experiences compared to ML datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how aligned children's visual and linguistic experiences are during everyday learning, overcoming limitations of manual annotation methods.

Method: Used contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) models to automatically characterize vision-language alignment in egocentric videos from infant perspective in home environments, validated with human judgments.

Result: Idealized aligned moments for learning (e.g., "look at the ball" with ball visible) are relatively rare in children's everyday experiences, with variability both within and across children.

Conclusion: Infrequent alignment is a constraint for early word learning models, and CLIP offers a new method for investigating children's multimodal environment.

Abstract: Figuring out which objects or concepts words refer to is a central language learning challenge for young children. Most models of this process posit that children learn early object labels from co-occurrences of words and their referents that occur when someone around them talks about an object in the immediate physical environment. But how aligned in time are children's visual and linguistic experiences during everyday learning? To date, answers to this question have been limited by the need for labor-intensive manual annotations of vision-language co-occurrences. Here, we evaluate the use of contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) models to automatically characterize vision-language alignment in egocentric videos taken from the infant perspective in home environments. After validating CLIP alignment scores using human alignment judgments, we apply this metric to a large corpus of infant-perspective videos. We show that idealized aligned moments for learning (e.g., "look at the ball" with a ball present in the child's view) are relatively rare in children's everyday experiences compared to modern machine learning datasets, and highlight variability in alignment both within and across children. These findings suggest that infrequent alignment is a constraint for models describing early word learning and offer a new method for investigating children's multimodal environment.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art performance in video quality prediction while providing human-aligned, interpretable justifications for quality scores.

Conclusion: Q-Save establishes a strong foundation for explainable evaluation in generative video research, contributing to multimodal generation and trustworthy AI development.

Abstract: We present Q-Save, a new benchmark dataset and model for holistic and explainable evaluation of AI-generated video (AIGV) quality. The dataset contains near 10000 videos, each annotated with a scalar mean opinion score (MOS) and fine-grained attribution labels along three core dimensions: visual quality, dynamic quality, and text-video alignment. These multi-aspect annotations enable both accurate quality assessment and interpretable reasoning behind the scores. To leverage this data, we propose a unified evaluation model that jointly performs quality scoring and attribution-based explanation. The model adopts the SlowFast framework to distinguish between fast frames and slow frames - slow frames are processed with high resolution while fast frames use low resolution, balancing evaluation accuracy and computational efficiency. For training, we use data formatted in Chain-of-Thought (COT) style and employ a multi-stage strategy: we first conduct Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), then further enhance the model with Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), and finally perform SFT again to improve model stability. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in video quality prediction while also providing human-aligned, interpretable justifications. Our dataset and model establish a strong foundation for explainable evaluation in generative video research, contributing to the development of multimodal generation and trustworthy AI. Code and dataset will be released upon publication.

Result: Achieved 83.84% top-1 accuracy with ResNet-18 and 81.46% with MobileNetV2 on ImageNet-100, improving by 2.04% and 0.92% respectively over single-student distillation.

Conclusion: The uncertainty-aware dual-student approach effectively leverages teacher uncertainty and peer learning to enhance knowledge distillation performance.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation has emerged as a powerful technique for model compression, enabling the transfer of knowledge from large teacher networks to compact student models. However, traditional knowledge distillation methods treat all teacher predictions equally, regardless of the teacher's confidence in those predictions. This paper proposes an uncertainty-aware dual-student knowledge distillation framework that leverages teacher prediction uncertainty to selectively guide student learning. We introduce a peer-learning mechanism where two heterogeneous student architectures, specifically ResNet-18 and MobileNetV2, learn collaboratively from both the teacher network and each other. Experimental results on ImageNet-100 demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance compared to baseline knowledge distillation methods, with ResNet-18 achieving 83.84\% top-1 accuracy and MobileNetV2 achieving 81.46\% top-1 accuracy, representing improvements of 2.04\% and 0.92\% respectively over traditional single-student distillation approaches.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional anxiety assessment methods are subjective, time-consuming, and evaluator-dependent. The study aims to develop more consistent and automated detection using AI techniques.

Method: Integrates deep learning architectures with swarm intelligence optimization (genetic algorithms and particle swarm optimization) to analyze physiological, emotional, and behavioral signals from multimodal wearable-sensor datasets.

Result: The hybrid model significantly enhances detection performance compared to deep networks alone, achieving notable improvements in accuracy and demonstrating stronger generalization across various individuals.

Conclusion: Combining metaheuristic optimization with deep learning shows potential for developing scalable, objective, and clinically meaningful solutions for anxiety disorder assessment.

Abstract: Despite being among the most common psychological disorders, anxiety-related conditions are still primarily identified through subjective assessments, such as clinical interviews and self-evaluation questionnaires. These conventional methods often require significant time and may vary depending on the evaluator. However, the emergence of advanced artificial intelligence techniques has created new opportunities for detecting anxiety in a more consistent and automated manner. To address the limitations of traditional approaches, this study introduces a comprehensive model that integrates deep learning architectures with optimization strategies inspired by swarm intelligence. Using multimodal and wearable-sensor datasets, the framework analyzes physiological, emotional, and behavioral signals. Swarm intelligence techniques including genetic algorithms and particle swarm optimization are incorporated to refine the feature space and optimize hyperparameters. Meanwhile, deep learning components are tasked with deriving layered and discriminative representations from sequential, multi-source inputs. Our evaluation shows that the fusion of these two computational paradigms significantly enhances detection performance compared with using deep networks alone. The hybrid model achieves notable improvements in accuracy and demonstrates stronger generalization across various individuals. Overall, the results highlight the potential of combining metaheuristic optimization with deep learning to develop scalable, objective, and clinically meaningful solutions for assessing anxiety disorders

TL;DR: VideoCompressa is a novel video data synthesis framework that addresses video dataset inefficiency through dynamic latent compression, achieving unprecedented data efficiency by identifying and compressing only the most informative frames.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video understanding models face scalability limitations due to high storage and computational costs of large-scale video datasets. Current data synthesis methods struggle with video's temporal redundancy and complex spatiotemporal dynamics.

Method: Jointly optimizes a differentiable keyframe selector (lightweight ConvNet with Gumbel-Softmax) to identify informative frames and a frozen VAE to compress frames into compact latent codes. Uses compression network for end-to-end backpropagation with co-optimized keyframe selector and synthetic latent codes.

Result: Achieves 2.34% improvement over full-data training using only 0.13% of UCF101 data with 5800x speedup. Matches full-data performance on HMDB51 using just 0.41% of training data, outperforming zero-shot baseline by 10.61%.

Conclusion: VideoCompressa effectively addresses video data inefficiency by focusing on intra-sample frame-level redundancy rather than inter-sample redundancy, enabling highly efficient video understanding with minimal data requirements.

Abstract: The scalability of video understanding models is increasingly limited by the prohibitive storage and computational costs of large-scale video datasets. While data synthesis has improved data efficiency in the image domain, its extension to video remains challenging due to pervasive temporal redundancy and complex spatiotemporal dynamics. In this work, we uncover a critical insight: the primary source of inefficiency in video datasets is not inter-sample redundancy, but intra-sample frame-level redundancy. To leverage this insight, we introduce VideoCompressa, a novel framework for video data synthesis that reframes the problem as dynamic latent compression. Specifically, VideoCompressa jointly optimizes a differentiable keyframe selector-implemented as a lightweight ConvNet with Gumbel-Softmax sampling-to identify the most informative frames, and a pretrained, frozen Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to compress these frames into compact, semantically rich latent codes. These latent representations are then fed into a compression network, enabling end-to-end backpropagation. Crucially, the keyframe selector and synthetic latent codes are co-optimized to maximize retention of task-relevant information. Experiments show that our method achieves unprecedented data efficiency: on UCF101 with ConvNets, VideoCompressa surpasses full-data training by 2.34\% points using only 0.13\% of the original data, with over 5800x speedup compared to traditional synthesis method. Moreover, when fine-tuning Qwen2.5-7B-VL on HMDB51, VideoCompressa matches full-data performance using just 0.41\% of the training data-outperforming zero-shot baseline by 10.61\%.

Method: Proposes FlowSteer with Online Trajectory Alignment to fix distribution mismatch, adversarial distillation on ODE trajectory, and fixes FlowMatchEulerDiscreteScheduler flaws.

Result: Experiments on SD3 demonstrate improved performance, unlocking ReFlow's potential for practical applications.

Conclusion: FlowSteer successfully addresses ReFlow's practical limitations through trajectory alignment and scheduler improvements, making it competitive with other distillation methods.

Abstract: With the success of flow matching in visual generation, sampling efficiency remains a critical bottleneck for its practical application. Among flow models' accelerating methods, ReFlow has been somehow overlooked although it has theoretical consistency with flow matching. This is primarily due to its suboptimal performance in practical scenarios compared to consistency distillation and score distillation. In this work, we investigate this issue within the ReFlow framework and propose FlowSteer, a method unlocks the potential of ReFlow-based distillation by guiding the student along teacher's authentic generation trajectories. We first identify that Piecewised ReFlow's performance is hampered by a critical distribution mismatch during the training and propose Online Trajectory Alignment(OTA) to resolve it. Then, we introduce a adversarial distillation objective applied directly on the ODE trajectory, improving the student's adherence to the teacher's generation trajectory. Furthermore, we find and fix a previously undiscovered flaw in the widely-used FlowMatchEulerDiscreteScheduler that largely degrades few-step inference quality. Our experiment result on SD3 demonstrates our method's efficacy.

TL;DR: FVAR introduces a next-focus prediction paradigm that replaces uniform downsampling with progressive refocusing using defocus kernels, eliminating aliasing artifacts in visual autoregressive models while maintaining compatibility with existing frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional visual autoregressive models use uniform scale downsampling which causes aliasing artifacts, compromising fine details and introducing jaggies and moiré patterns in generated images.

Method: Three key innovations: 1) Next-focus prediction paradigm replacing next-scale prediction, 2) Progressive refocusing pyramid construction using physics-consistent defocus kernels, 3) High-frequency residual learning with a specialized teacher network to incorporate alias information during training.

Result: FVAR substantially reduces aliasing artifacts, improves fine detail preservation, enhances text readability, and achieves superior performance on ImageNet while maintaining perfect compatibility with existing VAR frameworks.

Conclusion: The next-focus prediction paradigm with progressive refocusing and high-frequency residual learning effectively eliminates aliasing at its source and enhances detail generation in visual autoregressive models.

Abstract: Visual autoregressive models achieve remarkable generation quality through next-scale predictions across multi-scale token pyramids. However, the conventional method uses uniform scale downsampling to build these pyramids, leading to aliasing artifacts that compromise fine details and introduce unwanted jaggies and moiré patterns. To tackle this issue, we present \textbf{FVAR}, which reframes the paradigm from \emph{next-scale prediction} to \emph{next-focus prediction}, mimicking the natural process of camera focusing from blur to clarity. Our approach introduces three key innovations: \textbf{1) Next-Focus Prediction Paradigm} that transforms multi-scale autoregression by progressively reducing blur rather than simply downsampling; \textbf{2) Progressive Refocusing Pyramid Construction} that uses physics-consistent defocus kernels to build clean, alias-free multi-scale representations; and \textbf{3) High-Frequency Residual Learning} that employs a specialized residual teacher network to effectively incorporate alias information during training while maintaining deployment simplicity. Specifically, we construct optical low-pass views using defocus point spread function (PSF) kernels with decreasing radius, creating smooth blur-to-clarity transitions that eliminate aliasing at its source. To further enhance detail generation, we introduce a High-Frequency Residual Teacher that learns from both clean structure and alias residuals, distilling this knowledge to a vanilla VAR deployment network for seamless inference. Extensive experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that FVAR substantially reduces aliasing artifacts, improves fine detail preservation, and enhances text readability, achieving superior performance with perfect compatibility to existing VAR frameworks.

*Yasiru Laksara,Uthayasanker Thayasivam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep Ensembles outperform Monte Carlo Dropout for uncertainty quantification in chest X-ray diagnosis, achieving superior calibration and reliable uncertainty decomposition into aleatoric and epistemic components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models like CheXNet lack reliable uncertainty measures, limiting their clinical utility in high-stakes medical settings where predictive confidence is crucial.

Method: Developed a 9-member Deep Ensemble after Monte Carlo Dropout failed, enabling robust uncertainty quantification and decomposition of total uncertainty into aleatoric and epistemic components.

Result: Achieved SOTA performance with AUROC of 0.8559 and F1 score of 0.3857, with excellent calibration (ECE 0.0728, NLL 0.1916) and mean epistemic uncertainty of 0.0240.

Conclusion: Deep Ensembles provide a trustworthy clinical decision support system by transforming probabilistic models into reliable tools with explainable uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: The utility of deep learning models, such as CheXNet, in high stakes clinical settings is fundamentally constrained by their purely deterministic nature, failing to provide reliable measures of predictive confidence. This project addresses this critical gap by integrating robust Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) into a high performance diagnostic platform for 14 common thoracic diseases on the NIH ChestX-ray14 dataset. Initial architectural development failed to stabilize performance and calibration using Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD), yielding an unacceptable Expected Calibration Error (ECE) of 0.7588. This technical failure necessitated a rigorous architectural pivot to a high diversity, 9-member Deep Ensemble (DE). This resulting DE successfully stabilized performance and delivered superior reliability, achieving a State-of-the-Art (SOTA) average Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) of 0.8559 and an average F1 Score of 0.3857. Crucially, the DE demonstrated superior calibration (Mean ECE of 0.0728 and Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) of 0.1916) and enabled the reliable decomposition of total uncertainty into its Aleatoric (irreducible data noise) and Epistemic (reducible model knowledge) components, with a mean Epistemic Uncertainty (EU) of 0.0240. These results establish the Deep Ensemble as a trustworthy and explainable platform, transforming the model from a probabilistic tool into a reliable clinical decision support system.

*Ishmam Tashdeed,Md. Atiqur Rahman,Sabrina Islam,Md. Azam Hossain*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedOAP introduces a personalized federated learning approach for organ-agnostic tumor segmentation using decoupled cross-attention to model inter-organ feature dependencies and perturbed boundary loss to improve segmentation consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PFL approaches overlook the benefits of leveraging shared features across clients, particularly in medical image segmentation where each client has data from different organs.

Method: Uses decoupled cross-attention (DCA) to retain local queries while attending to globally shared key-value pairs, and perturbed boundary loss (PBL) to focus on segmentation boundary inconsistencies.

Result: Extensive experiments show FedOAP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art federated and personalized segmentation methods across diverse tumor segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: FedOAP effectively addresses data heterogeneity in federated learning while leveraging shared organ features and improving boundary precision in tumor segmentation.

Abstract: Personalized federated learning (PFL) possesses the unique capability of preserving data confidentiality among clients while tackling the data heterogeneity problem of non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) data. Its advantages have led to widespread adoption in domains such as medical image segmentation. However, the existing approaches mostly overlook the potential benefits of leveraging shared features across clients, where each client contains segmentation data of different organs. In this work, we introduce a novel personalized federated approach for organ agnostic tumor segmentation (FedOAP), that utilizes cross-attention to model long-range dependencies among the shared features of different clients and a boundary-aware loss to improve segmentation consistency. FedOAP employs a decoupled cross-attention (DCA), which enables each client to retain local queries while attending to globally shared key-value pairs aggregated from all clients, thereby capturing long-range inter-organ feature dependencies. Additionally, we introduce perturbed boundary loss (PBL) which focuses on the inconsistencies of the predicted mask's boundary for each client, forcing the model to localize the margins more precisely. We evaluate FedOAP on diverse tumor segmentation tasks spanning different organs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedOAP consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art federated and personalized segmentation methods.

*Yilin Wen,Kechuan Dong,Yusuke Sugano*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes motion discretization and soft-reset mechanisms for online test-time adaptation in 3D human pose estimation to mitigate error accumulation from imperfect self-supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online adaptation for 3D human pose estimation suffers from error accumulation when relying on self-supervision with imperfect predictions, leading to degraded performance over time.

Method: Uses unsupervised clustering in latent motion space to derive anchor motions for supervision, implements self-replay, and introduces soft-reset mechanism by reverting to exponential moving average during continuous adaptation.

Result: Outperforms previous online test-time adaptation methods and enables robust exploitation of personal shape and motion traits for enhanced accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed solution effectively mitigates error accumulation in online test-time adaptation for 3D human pose estimation through motion discretization and soft-reset mechanisms.

Abstract: Online test-time adaptation addresses the train-test domain gap by adapting the model on unlabeled streaming test inputs before making the final prediction. However, online adaptation for 3D human pose estimation suffers from error accumulation when relying on self-supervision with imperfect predictions, leading to degraded performance over time. To mitigate this fundamental challenge, we propose a novel solution that highlights the use of motion discretization. Specifically, we employ unsupervised clustering in the latent motion representation space to derive a set of anchor motions, whose regularity aids in supervising the human pose estimator and enables efficient self-replay. Additionally, we introduce an effective and efficient soft-reset mechanism by reverting the pose estimator to its exponential moving average during continuous adaptation. We examine long-term online adaptation by continuously adapting to out-of-domain streaming test videos of the same individual, which allows for the capture of consistent personal shape and motion traits throughout the streaming observation. By mitigating error accumulation, our solution enables robust exploitation of these personal traits for enhanced accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that our solution outperforms previous online test-time adaptation methods and validate our design choices.

TL;DR: A hybrid saliency model is proposed to predict regions of interest in 360° videos for improved streaming efficiency and viewing experience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ROI prediction is crucial for 360° video streaming to reduce bandwidth usage, predict view-ports for head-mounted devices, and enable intelligent video cuts for better streaming efficiency.

Method: Preprocess video frames, develop a hybrid saliency model to predict ROIs, and post-process predictions to obtain final ROI outputs for each frame.

Result: The proposed method's performance is compared with subjective annotations from the 360RAT dataset.

Conclusion: The hybrid saliency model effectively identifies regions of interest in 360° videos, supporting applications like view-port prediction and intelligent video streaming.

Abstract: The main goal of the project is to design a new model that predicts regions of interest in 360$^{\circ}$ videos. The region of interest (ROI) plays an important role in 360$^{\circ}$ video streaming. For example, ROIs are used to predict view-ports, intelligently cut the videos for live streaming, etc so that less bandwidth is used. Detecting view-ports in advance helps reduce the movement of the head while streaming and watching a video via the head-mounted device. Whereas, intelligent cuts of the videos help improve the efficiency of streaming the video to users and enhance the quality of their viewing experience. This report illustrates the secondary task to identify ROIs, in which, we design, train, and test a hybrid saliency model. In this work, we refer to saliency regions to represent the regions of interest. The method includes the processes as follows: preprocessing the video to obtain frames, developing a hybrid saliency model for predicting the region of interest, and finally post-processing the output predictions of the hybrid saliency model to obtain the output region of interest for each frame. Then, we compare the performance of the proposed method with the subjective annotations of the 360RAT dataset.

*Xiao Cui,Yulei Qin,Xinyue Li,Wengang Zhou,Hongsheng Li,Houqiang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new dataset distillation method for long-tailed datasets that addresses model bias and statistical corruption through expert model enhancement, BN recalibration, and incremental image initialization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dataset distillation methods fail on long-tailed distributions where imbalanced class frequencies cause biased model representations and corrupt statistical estimates like Batch Normalization statistics.

Method: Three components: (1) enhance expert models for reliable statistics and soft-label generation, (2) recalibrate BN statistics with dynamic momentum adjustment, (3) initialize synthetic images via multi-round selection of high-confidence diverse augmentations.

Result: Consistent improvements on four long-tailed benchmarks, with 15.6% top-1 accuracy improvement on CIFAR-100-LT and 11.8% on Tiny-ImageNet-LT under IPC=10 and IF=10.

Conclusion: The proposed statistical alignment approach effectively mitigates model bias and restores fair supervision in long-tailed dataset distillation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Dataset distillation creates a small distilled set that enables efficient training by capturing key information from the full dataset. While existing dataset distillation methods perform well on balanced datasets, they struggle under long-tailed distributions, where imbalanced class frequencies induce biased model representations and corrupt statistical estimates such as Batch Normalization (BN) statistics. In this paper, we rethink long-tailed dataset distillation by revisiting the limitations of trajectory-based methods, and instead adopt the statistical alignment perspective to jointly mitigate model bias and restore fair supervision. To this end, we introduce three dedicated components that enable unbiased recovery of distilled images and soft relabeling: (1) enhancing expert models (an observer model for recovery and a teacher model for relabeling) to enable reliable statistics estimation and soft-label generation; (2) recalibrating BN statistics via a full forward pass with dynamically adjusted momentum to reduce representation skew; (3) initializing synthetic images by incrementally selecting high-confidence and diverse augmentations via a multi-round mechanism that promotes coverage and diversity. Extensive experiments on four long-tailed benchmarks show consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods across varying degrees of class imbalance.Notably, our approach improves top-1 accuracy by 15.6% on CIFAR-100-LT and 11.8% on Tiny-ImageNet-LT under IPC=10 and IF=10.

TL;DR: DualGazeNet is a biologically inspired Transformer framework that achieves state-of-the-art salient object detection by modeling human visual system principles, outperforming 25 existing methods with significantly higher speed and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SOD methods have become overly complex with multi-stage pipelines and specialized modules, introducing feature redundancy and performance bottlenecks. Inspired by human vision's efficient salient object identification without architectural complexity, the authors aim to design a biologically grounded yet simple SOD framework.

Method: DualGazeNet models dual biological principles: robust representation learning and magnocellular-parvocellular dual-pathway processing with cortical attention modulation from the human visual system, using a pure Transformer framework.

Result: Extensive experiments on five RGB SOD benchmarks show DualGazeNet consistently surpasses 25 state-of-the-art methods. It achieves 60% higher inference speed and 53.4% fewer FLOPs than similar-capacity Transformer baselines, with strong cross-domain generalization on camouflaged and underwater SOD.

Conclusion: DualGazeNet demonstrates that biologically inspired yet architecturally simple frameworks can achieve superior SOD performance while being computationally efficient and interpretable, challenging the trend of increasing complexity in SOD methods.

Abstract: Recent salient object detection (SOD) methods aim to improve performance in four key directions: semantic enhancement, boundary refinement, auxiliary task supervision, and multi-modal fusion. In pursuit of continuous gains, these approaches have evolved toward increasingly sophisticated architectures with multi-stage pipelines, specialized fusion modules, edge-guided learning, and elaborate attention mechanisms. However, this complexity paradoxically introduces feature redundancy and cross-component interference that obscure salient cues, ultimately reaching performance bottlenecks. In contrast, human vision achieves efficient salient object identification without such architectural complexity. This contrast raises a fundamental question: can we design a biologically grounded yet architecturally simple SOD framework that dispenses with most of this engineering complexity, while achieving state-of-the-art accuracy, computational efficiency, and interpretability? In this work, we answer this question affirmatively by introducing DualGazeNet, a biologically inspired pure Transformer framework that models the dual biological principles of robust representation learning and magnocellular-parvocellular dual-pathway processing with cortical attention modulation in the human visual system. Extensive experiments on five RGB SOD benchmarks show that DualGazeNet consistently surpasses 25 state-of-the-art CNN- and Transformer-based methods. On average, DualGazeNet achieves about 60\% higher inference speed and 53.4\% fewer FLOPs than four Transformer-based baselines of similar capacity (VST++, MDSAM, Sam2unet, and BiRefNet). Moreover, DualGazeNet exhibits strong cross-domain generalization, achieving leading or highly competitive performance on camouflaged and underwater SOD benchmarks without relying on additional modalities.

TL;DR: Neural Texture Splatting (NTS) enhances 3DGS by using a global neural field to predict local appearance and geometry for each primitive, improving performance across various reconstruction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limited representational capacity of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and achieve better performance across diverse reconstruction scenarios including sparse and dense inputs.

Method: Introduces a global neural field (hybrid of tri-plane and neural decoder) that predicts local appearance and geometric fields for each primitive, enabling shared representation and efficient information exchange.

Result: Consistently improves models and achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks for novel view synthesis, geometry and dynamic reconstruction.

Conclusion: NTS successfully enhances 3DGS with expressive view- and time-dependent effects while reducing model size and improving generalization across tasks.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a leading approach for high-quality novel view synthesis, with numerous variants extending its applicability to a broad spectrum of 3D and 4D scene reconstruction tasks. Despite its success, the representational capacity of 3DGS remains limited by the use of 3D Gaussian kernels to model local variations. Recent works have proposed to augment 3DGS with additional per-primitive capacity, such as per-splat textures, to enhance its expressiveness. However, these per-splat texture approaches primarily target dense novel view synthesis with a reduced number of Gaussian primitives, and their effectiveness tends to diminish when applied to more general reconstruction scenarios. In this paper, we aim to achieve concrete performance improvement over state-of-the-art 3DGS variants across a wide range of reconstruction tasks, including novel view synthesis, geometry and dynamic reconstruction, under both sparse and dense input settings. To this end, we introduce Neural Texture Splatting (NTS). At the core of our approach is a global neural field (represented as a hybrid of a tri-plane and a neural decoder) that predicts local appearance and geometric fields for each primitive. By leveraging this shared global representation that models local texture fields across primitives, we significantly reduce model size and facilitate efficient global information exchange, demonstrating strong generalization across tasks. Furthermore, our neural modeling of local texture fields introduces expressive view- and time-dependent effects, a critical aspect that existing methods fail to account for. Extensive experiments show that Neural Texture Splatting consistently improves models and achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs suffer from high inference latency due to quadratic scaling of self-attention with sequence length, particularly from thousands of visual tokens in high-resolution images. Naive token pruning can remove essential contextual cues.

Method: Partition visual tokens into subject and non-subject groups, process them in parallel to transfer semantics into question tokens, then discard the non-subject path during inference to reduce computation.

Result: Prunes up to 88.9% of visual tokens with minimal performance drop, achieving 1.77x speedup and 70% FLOPs reduction across multiple MLLM backbones.

Conclusion: ParVTS effectively reduces computational complexity without requiring training, heuristics, or additional modules, and is compatible with diverse MLLM architectures.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) deliver impressive vision-language reasoning but suffer steep inference latency because self-attention scales quadratically with sequence length and thousands of visual tokens contributed by high-resolution images. Naively pruning less-informative visual tokens reduces this burden, yet indiscriminate removal can strip away contextual cues essential for background or fine-grained questions, undermining accuracy. In this paper, we present ParVTS (Parallel Vision Token Scheduling), a training-free scheduling framework that partitions visual tokens into subject and non-subject groups, processes them in parallel to transfer their semantics into question tokens, and discards the non-subject path mid-inference to reduce computation. This scheduling reduces computational complexity, requires no heuristics or additional modules, and is compatible with diverse existing MLLM architectures. Experiments across multiple MLLM backbones show that ParVTS prunes up to 88.9% of visual tokens with minimal performance drop, achieving 1.77x speedup and 70% FLOPs reduction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BIPV facades offer urban decarbonization potential where roof space is limited, but automated approaches for facade PV planning remain scarce and oversimplified compared to well-researched rooftop methods.

Method: Fine-tunes SegFormer-B5 on CMP Facades dataset, converts semantic predictions into facade-level PV suitability masks and panel layouts considering module sizes and clearances.

Result: Applied to 373 facades from 10 cities, results show installable BIPV potential is significantly lower than theoretical potential, providing valuable insights for urban energy planning.

Conclusion: The pipeline can be scaled worldwide with growing facade imagery availability to support reliable BIPV planning in cities.

Abstract: Building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) facades represent a promising pathway towards urban decarbonization, especially where roof areas are insufficient and ground-mounted arrays are infeasible. Although machine learning-based approaches to support photovoltaic (PV) planning on rooftops are well researched, automated approaches for facades still remain scarce and oversimplified. This paper therefore presents a pipeline that integrates detailed information on the architectural composition of the facade to automatically identify suitable surfaces for PV application and estimate the solar energy potential. The pipeline fine-tunes SegFormer-B5 on the CMP Facades dataset and converts semantic predictions into facade-level PV suitability masks and PV panel layouts considering module sizes and clearances. Applied to a dataset of 373 facades with known dimensions from ten cities, the results show that installable BIPV potential is significantly lower than theoretical potential, thus providing valuable insights for reliable urban energy planning. With the growing availability of facade imagery, the proposed pipeline can be scaled to support BIPV planning in cities worldwide.

TL;DR: MagicWorld is an interactive video world model that addresses structural instability and historical forgetting by integrating 3D geometric priors and historical retrieval mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing interactive video world models fail to exploit the correspondence between instruction-driven scene motion and 3D geometry, causing structural instability under viewpoint changes, and easily forget historical information during multi-step interactions, leading to error accumulation.

Method: Proposes MagicWorld with two key components: Action-Guided 3D Geometry Module (AG3D) that constructs point clouds from first frames and actions for geometric constraints, and History Cache Retrieval (HCR) that retrieves relevant historical frames as conditioning signals to mitigate error accumulation.

Result: Experimental results show MagicWorld achieves notable improvements in scene stability and continuity across interaction iterations compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: MagicWorld successfully addresses key limitations in interactive video world models by integrating 3D geometric priors and historical retrieval, improving structural consistency and reducing error accumulation in multi-step interactions.

Abstract: Recent interactive video world model methods generate scene evolution conditioned on user instructions. Although they achieve impressive results, two key limitations remain. First, they fail to fully exploit the correspondence between instruction-driven scene motion and the underlying 3D geometry, which results in structural instability under viewpoint changes. Second, they easily forget historical information during multi-step interaction, resulting in error accumulation and progressive drift in scene semantics and structure. To address these issues, we propose MagicWorld, an interactive video world model that integrates 3D geometric priors and historical retrieval. MagicWorld starts from a single scene image, employs user actions to drive dynamic scene evolution, and autoregressively synthesizes continuous scenes. We introduce the Action-Guided 3D Geometry Module (AG3D), which constructs a point cloud from the first frame of each interaction and the corresponding action, providing explicit geometric constraints for viewpoint transitions and thereby improving structural consistency. We further propose History Cache Retrieval (HCR) mechanism, which retrieves relevant historical frames during generation and injects them as conditioning signals, helping the model utilize past scene information and mitigate error accumulation. Experimental results demonstrate that MagicWorld achieves notable improvements in scene stability and continuity across interaction iterations.

TL;DR: MFmamba is a multi-function model that performs super-resolution, spectral recovery, and joint SR+spectral recovery using only PAN images as input, achieving competitive results across all three tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of existing methods - SR can't improve spectral resolution, colorization can't improve spatial resolution, and pansharpening requires two registered inputs and can't achieve super-resolution.

Method: Uses UNet++ backbone with Mamba Upsample Block, replaces skip connections with Dual Pool Attention, and employs Multi-scale Hybrid Cross Block for initial feature extraction.

Result: MFmamba achieves competitive performance in evaluation metrics and visual results across all three tasks using only PAN image input.

Conclusion: The proposed MFmamba model successfully integrates multiple functions and performs well in SR, spectral recovery, and joint tasks with single PAN image input.

Abstract: Remote sensing images are becoming increasingly widespread in military, earth resource exploration. Because of the limitation of a single sensor, we can obtain high spatial resolution grayscale panchromatic (PAN) images and low spatial resolution color multispectral (MS) images. Therefore, an important issue is to obtain a color image with high spatial resolution when there is only a PAN image at the input. The existing methods improve spatial resolution using super-resolution (SR) technology and spectral recovery using colorization technology. However, the SR technique cannot improve the spectral resolution, and the colorization technique cannot improve the spatial resolution. Moreover, the pansharpening method needs two registered inputs and can not achieve SR. As a result, an integrated approach is expected. To solve the above problems, we designed a novel multi-function model (MFmamba) to realize the tasks of SR, spectral recovery, joint SR and spectral recovery through three different inputs. Firstly, MFmamba utilizes UNet++ as the backbone, and a Mamba Upsample Block (MUB) is combined with UNet++. Secondly, a Dual Pool Attention (DPA) is designed to replace the skip connection in UNet++. Finally, a Multi-scale Hybrid Cross Block (MHCB) is proposed for initial feature extraction.

*Chenyu Mu,Guihai Chen,Xun Yang,Erkun Yang,Cheng Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MetaDCSeg is a robust medical image segmentation framework that dynamically learns pixel-wise weights to handle noisy annotations and ambiguous boundaries through a Dynamic Center Distance mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image segmentation suffers from noisy annotations and ambiguous anatomical boundaries that cause training instability. Existing methods using global noise assumptions or confidence-based selection inadequately address boundary noise issues.

Method: Proposes MetaDCSeg with Dynamic Center Distance mechanism that learns optimal pixel-wise weights to suppress noisy labels while preserving reliable annotations. Uses weighted feature distances for foreground, background, and boundary centers to focus on hard-to-segment boundary pixels.

Result: Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets with varying noise levels show MetaDCSeg consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in segmentation performance.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively handles annotation noise and boundary ambiguity in medical image segmentation, achieving superior performance by focusing on challenging boundary regions.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for clinical applications, but it is frequently disrupted by noisy annotations and ambiguous anatomical boundaries, which lead to instability in model training. Existing methods typically rely on global noise assumptions or confidence-based sample selection, which inadequately mitigate the performance degradation caused by annotation noise, especially in challenging boundary regions. To address this issue, we propose MetaDCSeg, a robust framework that dynamically learns optimal pixel-wise weights to suppress the influence of noisy ground-truth labels while preserving reliable annotations. By explicitly modeling boundary uncertainty through a Dynamic Center Distance (DCD) mechanism, our approach utilizes weighted feature distances for foreground, background, and boundary centers, directing the model's attention toward hard-to-segment pixels near ambiguous boundaries. This strategy enables more precise handling of structural boundaries, which are often overlooked by existing methods, and significantly enhances segmentation performance. Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets with varying noise levels demonstrate that MetaDCSeg consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

*Ruiying Liu,Yuanzhi Liang,Haibin Huang,Tianshu Yu,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BPGO improves GRPO by modeling reward uncertainty with a semantic prior anchor, enabling adaptive trust allocation and sharper sample distinctions for better visual generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO's performance is limited by textual-visual correspondence ambiguity, where many-to-many relationships cause reward models to generate uncertain signals, leading to underutilization of reliable feedback and overfitting to noise.

Method: BPGO extends GRPO by modeling reward uncertainty through a semantic prior anchor, using inter-group Bayesian trust allocation to emphasize consistent groups and intra-group prior-anchored renormalization to sharpen sample distinctions.

Result: BPGO achieves stronger semantic alignment, enhanced perceptual fidelity, and faster convergence than standard GRPO and recent variants across both image and video generation tasks.

Conclusion: BPGO effectively addresses reward uncertainty in visual generative model optimization through Bayesian prior guidance, delivering superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has emerged as an effective and lightweight framework for post-training visual generative models. However, its performance is fundamentally limited by the ambiguity of textual visual correspondence: a single prompt may validly describe diverse visual outputs, and a single image or video may support multiple equally correct interpretations. This many to many relationship leads reward models to generate uncertain and weakly discriminative signals, causing GRPO to underutilize reliable feedback and overfit noisy ones. We introduce Bayesian Prior-Guided Optimization (BPGO), a novel extension of GRPO that explicitly models reward uncertainty through a semantic prior anchor. BPGO adaptively modulates optimization trust at two levels: inter-group Bayesian trust allocation emphasizes updates from groups consistent with the prior while down-weighting ambiguous ones, and intra-group prior-anchored renormalization sharpens sample distinctions by expanding confident deviations and compressing uncertain scores. Across both image and video generation tasks, BPGO delivers consistently stronger semantic alignment, enhanced perceptual fidelity, and faster convergence than standard GRPO and recent variants.

TL;DR: EventSTU is a training-free framework that uses event-based vision principles for efficient video understanding, achieving 3x FLOPs reduction and speedup while improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video LLMs suffer from high inference costs due to massive tokens in long videos, so an efficient spatio-temporal understanding method is needed.

Method: Uses event-guided approach with coarse-to-fine keyframe sampling and adaptive token pruning, leveraging event saliency as zero-cost prior for spatial reduction.

Result: Achieves 3.01x FLOPs reduction and 3.10x prefilling speedup over strongest baseline while still improving performance.

Conclusion: EventSTU provides efficient video understanding using event-based principles, supporting both physical event cameras and simulated events for general video tasks.

Abstract: Video large language models have demonstrated strong video understanding capabilities but suffer from high inference costs due to the massive number of tokens in long videos. Inspired by event-based vision, we propose an event-guided, training-free framework for efficient spatio-temporal understanding, named EventSTU. In the temporal domain, we design a coarse-to-fine keyframe sampling algorithm that exploits the change-triggered property of event cameras to eliminate redundant frames. In the spatial domain, we design an adaptive token pruning algorithm that leverages the visual saliency of events as a zero-cost prior to guide spatial reduction. From a holistic spatio-temporal perspective, we further integrate question relevance from keyframe sampling to adaptively allocate token pruning budgets. To facilitate evaluation, we construct EventBench, the first event-inclusive, human-annotated multimodal benchmark that covers diverse real-world scenarios. Beyond physical event cameras, EventSTU also supports general video understanding using simulated events. Comprehensive experiments show that EventSTU achieves 3.01x FLOPs reduction and 3.10x prefilling speedup over the strongest baseline while still improving performance.

*Juncheng Li,Yige Li,Hanxun Huang,Yunhao Chen,Xin Wang,Yixu Wang,Xingjun Ma,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BackdoorVLM is the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating backdoor attacks on vision-language models (VLMs), organizing multimodal threats into 5 categories and testing 12 attack methods across 2 VLMs and 3 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Backdoor attacks have been well-studied in unimodal settings but remain underexplored in multimodal foundation models like VLMs, which have significant security implications for real-world applications.

Method: Developed a unified benchmark that injects and analyzes backdoors across core VLM tasks (image captioning, VQA), categorizing threats into 5 types and evaluating 12 attack methods using text, image, and bimodal triggers.

Result: VLMs show strong sensitivity to textual instructions; in bimodal backdoors, text triggers dominate image triggers; backdoors with textual modality remain highly potent (1% poisoning rate yields >90% success); revealing significant vulnerabilities in current VLMs.

Conclusion: BackdoorVLM serves as a valuable benchmark for analyzing and mitigating multimodal backdoor threats, highlighting the urgent need for improved security measures in vision-language models.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks undermine the reliability and trustworthiness of machine learning systems by injecting hidden behaviors that can be maliciously activated at inference time. While such threats have been extensively studied in unimodal settings, their impact on multimodal foundation models, particularly vision-language models (VLMs), remains largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce \textbf{BackdoorVLM}, the first comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating backdoor attacks on VLMs across a broad range of settings. It adopts a unified perspective that injects and analyzes backdoors across core vision-language tasks, including image captioning and visual question answering. BackdoorVLM organizes multimodal backdoor threats into 5 representative categories: targeted refusal, malicious injection, jailbreak, concept substitution, and perceptual hijack. Each category captures a distinct pathway through which an adversary can manipulate a model's behavior. We evaluate these threats using 12 representative attack methods spanning text, image, and bimodal triggers, tested on 2 open-source VLMs and 3 multimodal datasets. Our analysis reveals that VLMs exhibit strong sensitivity to textual instructions, and in bimodal backdoors the text trigger typically overwhelms the image trigger when forming the backdoor mapping. Notably, backdoors involving the textual modality remain highly potent, with poisoning rates as low as 1\% yielding over 90\% success across most tasks. These findings highlight significant, previously underexplored vulnerabilities in current VLMs. We hope that BackdoorVLM can serve as a useful benchmark for analyzing and mitigating multimodal backdoor threats.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: One4D is a unified framework for 4D generation and reconstruction that produces synchronized RGB frames and pointmaps, handling varying sparsities of input frames through Unified Masked Conditioning and using Decoupled LoRA Control to maintain joint RGB and pointmap generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a general framework that can handle both 4D generation from sparse inputs and reconstruction from full videos, while maintaining high-quality joint RGB and pointmap generation without degrading the base video model.

Method: Uses Unified Masked Conditioning for varying input sparsities, adapts video generation model for joint RGB and pointmap generation, and introduces Decoupled LoRA Control with modality-specific adapters connected by zero-initialized control links for mutual consistency.

Result: Produces high-quality RGB frames and accurate pointmaps across both generation and reconstruction tasks, trained on mixed synthetic and real 4D datasets with modest computational budgets.

Conclusion: Represents progress toward general, high-quality geometry-based 4D world modeling using video diffusion models, enabling seamless transitions between generation and reconstruction tasks.

Abstract: We present One4D, a unified framework for 4D generation and reconstruction that produces dynamic 4D content as synchronized RGB frames and pointmaps. By consistently handling varying sparsities of conditioning frames through a Unified Masked Conditioning (UMC) mechanism, One4D can seamlessly transition between 4D generation from a single image, 4D reconstruction from a full video, and mixed generation and reconstruction from sparse frames. Our framework adapts a powerful video generation model for joint RGB and pointmap generation, with carefully designed network architectures. The commonly used diffusion finetuning strategies for depthmap or pointmap reconstruction often fail on joint RGB and pointmap generation, quickly degrading the base video model. To address this challenge, we introduce Decoupled LoRA Control (DLC), which employs two modality-specific LoRA adapters to form decoupled computation branches for RGB frames and pointmaps, connected by lightweight, zero-initialized control links that gradually learn mutual pixel-level consistency. Trained on a mixture of synthetic and real 4D datasets under modest computational budgets, One4D produces high-quality RGB frames and accurate pointmaps across both generation and reconstruction tasks. This work represents a step toward general, high-quality geometry-based 4D world modeling using video diffusion models. Project page: https://mizhenxing.github.io/One4D

TL;DR: Proposes minimizing attention entropy from CLS token to image patches as a novel test-time adaptation objective for transformers, improving robustness to distribution shifts even with single test images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers provide additional unsupervised learning signals through attention mechanisms beyond output entropy minimization, which can be leveraged for more effective test-time adaptation.

Method: Minimize entropy of attention distributions from CLS token to image patches during test-time adaptation, encouraging confident attention to relevant regions under distribution shift.

Result: Improves robustness across diverse corruption types without hurting clean data performance, effective even with single test image streams.

Conclusion: Attention entropy minimization is a novel and effective TTA objective that leverages transformer attention mechanisms for improved adaptation to distribution shifts.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) enables models to adapt to distribution shifts at inference time. While entropy minimization over the output distribution has proven effective for TTA, transformers offer an additional unsupervised learning signal through their attention mechanisms. We propose minimizing the entropy of attention distributions from the CLS token to image patches as a novel TTA objective.This approach encourages the model to attend more confidently to relevant image regions under distribution shift and is effective even when only a single test image is available. We demonstrate that attention entropy minimization improves robustness across diverse corruption types while not hurting performance on clean data on a single sample stream of images at test time.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FineXtrol is a novel control framework for text-driven motion generation that uses temporally-aware fine-grained textual control signals to direct specific body part movements, addressing issues of misalignment and computational cost in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for controllable motion generation either use LLMs that introduce misaligned details and lack temporal cues, or use 3D coordinate sequences that are computationally expensive to convert to standard motion representations.

Method: Proposes FineXtrol framework with hierarchical contrastive learning module that trains text encoder to produce discriminative embeddings for fine-grained control signals describing specific body part movements over time.

Result: Quantitative results show strong performance in controllable motion generation, while qualitative analysis demonstrates flexibility in directing specific body part movements.

Conclusion: FineXtrol provides an efficient and effective solution for precise motion control using user-friendly fine-grained textual signals, overcoming limitations of previous methods.

Abstract: Recent works have sought to enhance the controllability and precision of text-driven motion generation. Some approaches leverage large language models (LLMs) to produce more detailed texts, while others incorporate global 3D coordinate sequences as additional control signals. However, the former often introduces misaligned details and lacks explicit temporal cues, and the latter incurs significant computational cost when converting coordinates to standard motion representations. To address these issues, we propose FineXtrol, a novel control framework for efficient motion generation guided by temporally-aware, precise, user-friendly, and fine-grained textual control signals that describe specific body part movements over time. In support of this framework, we design a hierarchical contrastive learning module that encourages the text encoder to produce more discriminative embeddings for our novel control signals, thereby improving motion controllability. Quantitative results show that FineXtrol achieves strong performance in controllable motion generation, while qualitative analysis demonstrates its flexibility in directing specific body part movements.

Conclusion: The CMAST framework effectively addresses the HOTD problem and demonstrates superior performance in discovering human-assisting tasks in open-future scenarios.

Abstract: Recent progress in robotics and embodied AI is largely driven by Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). However, a key challenge remains underexplored: how can we advance LMMs to discover tasks that directly assist humans in open-future scenarios, where human intentions are highly concurrent and dynamic. In this work, we formalize the problem of Human-centric Open-future Task Discovery (HOTD), focusing particularly on identifying tasks that reduce human effort across multiple plausible futures. To facilitate this study, we propose an HOTD-Bench, which features over 2K real-world videos, a semi-automated annotation pipeline, and a simulation-based protocol tailored for open-set future evaluation. Additionally, we propose the Collaborative Multi-Agent Search Tree (CMAST) framework, which decomposes the complex reasoning through a multi-agent system and structures the reasoning process through a scalable search tree module. In our experiments, CMAST achieves the best performance on the HOTD-Bench, significantly surpassing existing LMMs. It also integrates well with existing LMMs, consistently improving performance.

### [243] [VeCoR - Velocity Contrastive Regularization for Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18942)
*Zong-Wei Hong,Jing-lun Li,Lin-Ze Li,Shen Zhang,Yao Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VeCoR enhances Flow Matching by adding contrastive regularization that provides both positive (where to go) and negative (where not to go) supervision, improving stability and image quality especially in low-step and lightweight settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Flow Matching may accumulate errors along trajectories and drive samples off the data manifold, causing perceptual degradation in lightweight or low-step configurations.

Method: Velocity Contrastive Regularization (VeCoR) augments standard FM with two-sided supervision: aligning velocity with stable reference directions (positive) while pushing away from inconsistent, off-manifold directions (negative).

Result: On ImageNet-1K 256×256, VeCoR achieves 22% and 35% relative FID reductions on SiT-XL/2 and REPA-SiT-XL/2 backbones, and 32% relative FID gain on MS-COCO text-to-image generation.

Conclusion: VeCoR transforms FM into a two-sided training signal that consistently improves stability, convergence, and image quality across datasets and backbones, particularly in low-step and lightweight settings.

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) has recently emerged as a principled and efficient alternative to diffusion models. Standard FM encourages the learned velocity field to follow a target direction; however, it may accumulate errors along the trajectory and drive samples off the data manifold, leading to perceptual degradation, especially in lightweight or low-step configurations.
  To enhance stability and generalization, we extend FM into a balanced attract-repel scheme that provides explicit guidance on both "where to go" and "where not to go." To be formal, we propose \textbf{Velocity Contrastive Regularization (VeCoR)}, a complementary training scheme for flow-based generative modeling that augments the standard FM objective with contrastive, two-sided supervision. VeCoR not only aligns the predicted velocity with a stable reference direction (positive supervision) but also pushes it away from inconsistent, off-manifold directions (negative supervision). This contrastive formulation transforms FM from a purely attractive, one-sided objective into a two-sided training signal, regularizing trajectory evolution and improving perceptual fidelity across datasets and backbones.
  On ImageNet-1K 256$\times$256, VeCoR yields 22\% and 35\% relative FID reductions on SiT-XL/2 and REPA-SiT-XL/2 backbones, respectively, and achieves further FID gains (32\% relative) on MS-COCO text-to-image generation, demonstrating consistent improvements in stability, convergence, and image quality, particularly in low-step and lightweight settings.

TL;DR: CSSP2P GAN achieves superior virtual IHC staining with high pathological fidelity through adversarial loss optimization and expert validation, outperforming current methods while highlighting limitations of standard evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IHC staining is costly and labor-intensive, creating need for virtual staining alternatives. Current methods overlook adversarial loss impact and rely on inadequate evaluation metrics like SSIM/PSNR.

Method: Developed CSSP2P GAN model using conditional Generative Adversarial Networks, specifically studying the impact of adversarial loss on virtual staining quality through iterative development.

Result: Achieved heightened pathological fidelity validated by blind pathological expert evaluation, demonstrating superior performance compared to reference works in the field.

Conclusion: Adversarial loss is crucial for virtual staining quality, current evaluation metrics are insufficient, and CSSP2P GAN provides superior virtual IHC staining performance.

Abstract: In addition to evaluating tumor morphology using H&E staining, immunohistochemistry is used to assess the presence of specific proteins within the tissue. However, this is a costly and labor-intensive technique, for which virtual staining, as an image-to-image translation task, offers a promising alternative. Although recent, this is an emerging field of research with 64% of published studies just in 2024. Most studies use publicly available datasets of H&E-IHC pairs from consecutive tissue sections. Recognizing the training challenges, many authors develop complex virtual staining models based on conditional Generative Adversarial Networks, but ignore the impact of adversarial loss on the quality of virtual staining. Furthermore, overlooking the issues of model evaluation, they claim improved performance based on metrics such as SSIM and PSNR, which are not sufficiently robust to evaluate the quality of virtually stained images. In this paper, we developed CSSP2P GAN, which we demonstrate to achieve heightened pathological fidelity through a blind pathological expert evaluation. Furthermore, while iteratively developing our model, we study the impact of the adversarial loss and demonstrate its crucial role in the quality of virtually stained images. Finally, while comparing our model with reference works in the field, we underscore the limitations of the currently used evaluation metrics and demonstrate the superior performance of CSSP2P GAN.

TL;DR: Introduces a high-resolution dataset for video virtual try-on with detailed garment images and close-up videos, plus a new VGID metric for evaluating garment consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current virtual try-on methods have two limitations: reliance on single garment images that miss texture details, and focus only on full-shot videos while ignoring business need for close-ups.

Method: Created a high-resolution dataset with detailed garment images (close-ups + text descriptions) and both full-shot/close-up try-on videos. Proposed VGID metric to evaluate texture and structure preservation.

Result: Using detailed images from the dataset improved texture feature extraction, enhancing realism and detail fidelity. Benchmark revealed texture/structure preservation problems in current methods.

Conclusion: The dataset and VGID metric address key limitations in video virtual try-on, enabling better texture preservation and supporting both full-shot and close-up video generation for practical e-commerce applications.

Abstract: Video virtual try-on technology provides a cost-effective solution for creating marketing videos in fashion e-commerce. However, its practical adoption is hindered by two critical limitations. First, the reliance on a single garment image as input in current virtual try-on datasets limits the accurate capture of realistic texture details. Second, most existing methods focus solely on generating full-shot virtual try-on videos, neglecting the business's demand for videos that also provide detailed close-ups. To address these challenges, we introduce a high-resolution dataset for video-based virtual try-on. This dataset offers two key features. First, it provides more detailed information on the garments, which includes high-fidelity images with detailed close-ups and textual descriptions; Second, it uniquely includes full-shot and close-up try-on videos of real human models. Furthermore, accurately assessing consistency becomes significantly more critical for the close-up videos, which demand high-fidelity preservation of garment details. To facilitate such fine-grained evaluation, we propose a new garment consistency metric VGID (Video Garment Inception Distance) that quantifies the preservation of both texture and structure. Our experiments validate these contributions. We demonstrate that by utilizing the detailed images from our dataset, existing video generation models can extract and incorporate texture features, significantly enhancing the realism and detail fidelity of virtual try-on results. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive benchmark of recent models. The benchmark effectively identifies the texture and structural preservation problems among current methods.

Abstract: Cataract surgery is one of the most commonly performed surgeries worldwide, yet intraoperative complications such as iris prolapse, posterior capsule rupture (PCR), and vitreous loss remain major causes of adverse outcomes. Automated detection of such events could enable early warning systems and objective training feedback. In this work, we propose CataractCompDetect, a complication detection framework that combines phase-aware localization, SAM 2-based tracking, complication-specific risk scoring, and vision-language reasoning for final classification. To validate CataractCompDetect, we curate CataComp, the first cataract surgery video dataset annotated for intraoperative complications, comprising 53 surgeries, including 23 with clinical complications. On CataComp, CataractCompDetect achieves an average F1 score of 70.63%, with per-complication performance of 81.8% (Iris Prolapse), 60.87% (PCR), and 69.23% (Vitreous Loss). These results highlight the value of combining structured surgical priors with vision-language reasoning for recognizing rare but high-impact intraoperative events.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient FHE-based inference for deep CNNs by addressing two key challenges: approximating non-linear activations with low-degree polynomials without significant accuracy loss, and overcoming ciphertext capacity barriers that limit high-resolution image processing.

Method: Proposes single-stage fine-tuning (SFT) to convert pre-trained CNNs into FHE-friendly forms using low-degree polynomials, and a generalized interleaved packing (GIP) scheme with specialized homomorphic operators to handle feature maps of arbitrary spatial resolutions.

Result: Achieved competitive accuracy on CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and MS COCO datasets compared to baselines using ReLU or SiLU activations, and demonstrated the first FHE-based inference for YOLO architectures in object detection.

Conclusion: The proposed methods enable efficient end-to-end FHE inference across diverse CNN architectures while maintaining accuracy comparable to standard non-encrypted implementations.

Abstract: We address two fundamental challenges in adapting general deep CNNs for FHE-based inference: approximating non-linear activations such as ReLU with low-degree polynomials while minimizing accuracy degradation, and overcoming the ciphertext capacity barrier that constrains high-resolution image processing on FHE inference. Our contributions are twofold: (1) a single-stage fine-tuning (SFT) strategy that directly converts pre-trained CNNs into FHE-friendly forms using low-degree polynomials, achieving competitive accuracy with minimal training overhead; and (2) a generalized interleaved packing (GIP) scheme that is compatible with feature maps of virtually arbitrary spatial resolutions, accompanied by a suite of carefully designed homomorphic operators that preserve the GIP-form encryption throughout computation. These advances enable efficient, end-to-end FHE inference across diverse CNN architectures. Experiments on CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and MS COCO demonstrate that the FHE-friendly CNNs obtained via our SFT strategy achieve accuracy comparable to baselines using ReLU or SiLU activations. Moreover, this work presents the first demonstration of FHE-based inference for YOLO architectures in object detection leveraging low-degree polynomial activations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ZEUS is a zero-shot visual-language segmentation framework that uses frozen VLM encoders and class-specific textual prompt ensembles to automatically generate high-resolution tumor masks in whole-slide images without pixel-level labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLM applications in histopathology are limited to slide-level tasks or coarse prompts, struggling with fine-grained segmentation across gigapixel WSIs due to morphological variability and subtle distinctions between benign/malignant lesions.

Method: Partition WSIs into overlapping patches, extract visual embeddings using frozen VLM encoders, compute cosine similarities against class-specific textual prompt ensembles, and generate final segmentation masks.

Result: Competitive performance on two in-house datasets (primary spindle cell neoplasms and cutaneous metastases), demonstrating the influence of prompt design, domain shifts, and institutional variability.

Conclusion: ZEUS significantly reduces annotation burden while providing scalable, explainable tumor delineation for downstream diagnostic workflows in histopathology.

Abstract: Accurate annotation of cutaneous neoplasm biopsies represents a major challenge due to their wide morphological variability, overlapping histological patterns, and the subtle distinctions between benign and malignant lesions. Vision-language foundation models (VLMs), pre-trained on paired image-text corpora, learn joint representations that bridge visual features and diagnostic terminology, enabling zero-shot localization and classification of tissue regions without pixel-level labels. However, most existing VLM applications in histopathology remain limited to slide-level tasks or rely on coarse interactive prompts, and they struggle to produce fine-grained segmentations across gigapixel whole-slide images (WSIs). In this work, we introduce a zero-shot visual-language segmentation pipeline for whole-slide images (ZEUS), a fully automated, zero-shot segmentation framework that leverages class-specific textual prompt ensembles and frozen VLM encoders to generate high-resolution tumor masks in WSIs. By partitioning each WSI into overlapping patches, extracting visual embeddings, and computing cosine similarities against text prompts, we generate a final segmentation mask. We demonstrate competitive performance on two in-house datasets, primary spindle cell neoplasms and cutaneous metastases, highlighting the influence of prompt design, domain shifts, and institutional variability in VLMs for histopathology. ZEUS markedly reduces annotation burden while offering scalable, explainable tumor delineation for downstream diagnostic workflows.

TL;DR: Proposes UMCL framework for robust cross-compression-rate deepfake detection by transforming single visual modality into three complementary features and aligning them through contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing methods: single-modal approaches struggle with feature degradation under compression, while multimodal methods require expensive data collection and suffer from inconsistent modal quality in real-world scenarios.

Method: UMCL transforms single visual modality into three features: compression-robust rPPG signals, temporal landmark dynamics, and semantic embeddings. Uses affinity-driven semantic alignment and cross-quality similarity learning for feature alignment and robustness.

Result: Achieves superior performance across various compression rates and manipulation types, maintains high accuracy even when individual features degrade, and provides interpretable insights into feature relationships.

Conclusion: Establishes new benchmark for robust deepfake detection with explicit feature alignment that enhances model generalization and reliability across compression variations.

Abstract: In deepfake detection, the varying degrees of compression employed by social media platforms pose significant challenges for model generalization and reliability. Although existing methods have progressed from single-modal to multimodal approaches, they face critical limitations: single-modal methods struggle with feature degradation under data compression in social media streaming, while multimodal approaches require expensive data collection and labeling and suffer from inconsistent modal quality or accessibility in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Unimodal-generated Multimodal Contrastive Learning (UMCL) framework for robust cross-compression-rate (CCR) deepfake detection. In the training stage, our approach transforms a single visual modality into three complementary features: compression-robust rPPG signals, temporal landmark dynamics, and semantic embeddings from pre-trained vision-language models. These features are explicitly aligned through an affinity-driven semantic alignment (ASA) strategy, which models inter-modal relationships through affinity matrices and optimizes their consistency through contrastive learning. Subsequently, our cross-quality similarity learning (CQSL) strategy enhances feature robustness across compression rates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance across various compression rates and manipulation types, establishing a new benchmark for robust deepfake detection. Notably, our approach maintains high detection accuracy even when individual features degrade, while providing interpretable insights into feature relationships through explicit alignment.

*Wassim Benabbas,Mohammed Brahimi,Samir Akhrouf,Bilal Fortas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether attention-based architectures and zero-shot learning can bridge the gap between curated academic datasets and real-world plant disease classification, finding that CLIP models show strong potential for practical field applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models trained on clean datasets like PlantVillage fail to generalize to real-world field images, creating a significant gap between academic research and practical agricultural applications.

Method: Evaluated three model categories: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers, and CLIP-based zero-shot models for plant disease classification under domain shift conditions.

Result: CNNs showed limited robustness to domain shift, Vision Transformers demonstrated better generalization through global contextual features, and CLIP models successfully classified diseases from natural language descriptions without task-specific training.

Conclusion: Zero-shot learning, particularly CLIP models, offers a practical and scalable domain adaptation strategy for plant health diagnosis in diverse field environments, with strong adaptability and interpretability.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have enabled significant progress in plant disease classification using leaf images. Much of the existing research in this field has relied on the PlantVillage dataset, which consists of well-centered plant images captured against uniform, uncluttered backgrounds. Although models trained on this dataset achieve high accuracy, they often fail to generalize to real-world field images, such as those submitted by farmers to plant diagnostic systems. This has created a significant gap between published studies and practical application requirements, highlighting the necessity of investigating and addressing this issue. In this study, we investigate whether attention-based architectures and zero-shot learning approaches can bridge the gap between curated academic datasets and real-world agricultural conditions in plant disease classification. We evaluate three model categories: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers, and Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)-based zero-shot models. While CNNs exhibit limited robustness under domain shift, Vision Transformers demonstrate stronger generalization by capturing global contextual features. Most notably, CLIP models classify diseases directly from natural language descriptions without any task-specific training, offering strong adaptability and interpretability. These findings highlight the potential of zero-shot learning as a practical and scalable domain adaptation strategy for plant health diagnosis in diverse field environments.

TL;DR: ViCoDR improves 3D consistency in video generation by learning multi-view consistent diffusion representations, addressing visual artifacts from 3D inconsistencies in current video diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation models suffer from 3D inconsistencies that cause visual artifacts when camera pose changes, undermining user experience and simulation fidelity.

Method: ViCoDR learns multi-view consistent diffusion representations through representation alignment to improve 3D consistency in video diffusion models.

Result: Significant improvements in 3D consistency across camera-controlled image-to-video, text-to-video, and multi-view generation models.

Conclusion: Improving multi-view consistency of video diffusion representations effectively yields more 3D-consistent video generation.

Abstract: Video generation models have made significant progress in generating realistic content, enabling applications in simulation, gaming, and film making. However, current generated videos still contain visual artifacts arising from 3D inconsistencies, e.g., objects and structures deforming under changes in camera pose, which can undermine user experience and simulation fidelity. Motivated by recent findings on representation alignment for diffusion models, we hypothesize that improving the multi-view consistency of video diffusion representations will yield more 3D-consistent video generation. Through detailed analysis on multiple recent camera-controlled video diffusion models we reveal strong correlations between 3D-consistent representations and videos. We also propose ViCoDR, a new approach for improving the 3D consistency of video models by learning multi-view consistent diffusion representations. We evaluate ViCoDR on camera controlled image-to-video, text-to-video, and multi-view generation models, demonstrating significant improvements in the 3D consistency of the generated videos.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the rapid advancement of sophisticated synthetic audio-visual content for malicious manipulations, ensuring digital media integrity has become paramount.

Method: Audio-Visual Speech Representation Reconstruction (AuViRe) reconstructs speech representations from one modality based on the other, leveraging that cross-modal reconstruction is more challenging in manipulated segments, creating amplified discrepancies.

Conclusion: The approach provides robust discriminative cues for precise temporal forgery localization in deepfake videos.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of sophisticated synthetic audio-visual content, e.g., for subtle malicious manipulations, ensuring the integrity of digital media has become paramount. This work presents a novel approach to temporal localization of deepfakes by leveraging Audio-Visual Speech Representation Reconstruction (AuViRe). Specifically, our approach reconstructs speech representations from one modality (e.g., lip movements) based on the other (e.g., audio waveform). Cross-modal reconstruction is significantly more challenging in manipulated video segments, leading to amplified discrepancies, thereby providing robust discriminative cues for precise temporal forgery localization. AuViRe outperforms the state of the art by +8.9 AP@0.95 on LAV-DF, +9.6 AP@0.5 on AV-Deepfake1M, and +5.1 AUC on an in-the-wild experiment. Code available at https://github.com/mever-team/auvire.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: T2LDM is a Text-to-LiDAR diffusion model with Self-Conditioned Representation Guidance that generates detailed 3D scenes from text, addressing data scarcity and poor text quality issues while supporting multiple conditional generation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-LiDAR generation faces challenges due to scarce Text-LiDAR pairs causing smooth 3D scenes and low-quality text descriptions degrading generation quality and controllability.

Method: Proposes T2LDM with Self-Conditioned Representation Guidance (SCRG) that aligns to real representations for soft supervision during training, directional position prior to reduce street distortion, and conditional encoder for multiple tasks.

Result: T2LDM outperforms existing methods in both unconditional and conditional generation, achieving state-of-the-art scene generation with improved fidelity and detailed object generation.

Conclusion: The proposed T2LDM framework effectively addresses Text-to-LiDAR generation challenges through SCRG guidance and position priors, enabling high-quality scene generation and supporting multiple conditional tasks with practical prompt paradigms.

Abstract: Text-to-LiDAR generation can customize 3D data with rich structures and diverse scenes for downstream tasks. However, the scarcity of Text-LiDAR pairs often causes insufficient training priors, generating overly smooth 3D scenes. Moreover, low-quality text descriptions may degrade generation quality and controllability. In this paper, we propose a Text-to-LiDAR Diffusion Model for scene generation, named T2LDM, with a Self-Conditioned Representation Guidance (SCRG). Specifically, SCRG, by aligning to the real representations, provides the soft supervision with reconstruction details for the Denoising Network (DN) in training, while decoupled in inference. In this way, T2LDM can perceive rich geometric structures from data distribution, generating detailed objects in scenes. Meanwhile, we construct a content-composable Text-LiDAR benchmark, T2nuScenes, along with a controllability metric. Based on this, we analyze the effects of different text prompts for LiDAR generation quality and controllability, providing practical prompt paradigms and insights. Furthermore, a directional position prior is designed to mitigate street distortion, further improving scene fidelity. Additionally, by learning a conditional encoder via frozen DN, T2LDM can support multiple conditional tasks, including Sparse-to-Dense, Dense-to-Sparse, and Semantic-to-LiDAR generation. Extensive experiments in unconditional and conditional generation demonstrate that T2LDM outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art scene generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Grc-ViT is a dynamic coarse-to-fine Vision Transformer that adaptively adjusts visual granularity based on image complexity to enhance fine-grained discrimination while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers struggle with fine-grained local details, and existing multi-scale approaches use fixed patch sizes and introduce redundant computation.

Method: Two-stage framework: (1) Coarse Granularity Evaluation module assesses visual complexity using edge density, entropy, and frequency-domain cues to determine patch/window sizes; (2) Fine-grained Refinement module adapts attention computation based on selected granularity. Uses learnable parameters α and β for global-local balance.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations show Grc-ViT enhances fine-grained discrimination while achieving superior accuracy-computation trade-off.

Conclusion: Grc-ViT provides an effective solution for dynamic granularity adaptation in Vision Transformers, improving fine-grained perception without computational overhead.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in capturing global dependencies but often struggle to efficiently represent fine-grained local details. Existing multi-scale approaches alleviate this issue by integrating hierarchical or hybrid features; however, they rely on fixed patch sizes and introduce redundant computation. To address these limitations, we propose Granularity-driven Vision Transformer (Grc-ViT), a dynamic coarse-to-fine framework that adaptively adjusts visual granularity based on image complexity. It comprises two key stages: (1) Coarse Granularity Evaluation module, which assesses visual complexity using edge density, entropy, and frequency-domain cues to estimate suitable patch and window sizes; (2) Fine-grained Refinement module, which refines attention computation according to the selected granularity, enabling efficient and precise feature learning. Two learnable parameters, α and \b{eta}, are optimized end-to-end to balance global reasoning and local perception. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that Grc-ViT enhances fine-grained discrimination while achieving a superior trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency.

TL;DR: Life-IQA is a blind image quality assessment method that uses GCN-enhanced layer interaction and MoE-based feature decoupling to improve quality prediction accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing BIQA methods fuse shallow and deep features without considering their unequal contributions to quality prediction, and lack effective quality decoding architectures despite using various vision encoder backbones.

Method: Proposes GCN-enhanced layer interaction module using cross-attention between deepest-layer and penultimate-layer features, and MoE-based feature decoupling module with specialized experts for different distortion types or quality dimensions.

Result: Life-IQA achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple BIQA benchmarks with better balance between accuracy and computational cost compared to vanilla Transformer decoder.

Conclusion: The proposed Life-IQA framework effectively addresses feature contribution imbalance and decoding architecture limitations in BIQA, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Blind image quality assessment (BIQA) plays a crucial role in evaluating and optimizing visual experience. Most existing BIQA approaches fuse shallow and deep features extracted from backbone networks, while overlooking the unequal contributions to quality prediction. Moreover, while various vision encoder backbones are widely adopted in BIQA, the effective quality decoding architectures remain underexplored. To address these limitations, this paper investigates the contributions of shallow and deep features to BIQA, and proposes a effective quality feature decoding framework via GCN-enhanced \underline{l}ayer\underline{i}nteraction and MoE-based \underline{f}eature d\underline{e}coupling, termed \textbf{(Life-IQA)}. Specifically, the GCN-enhanced layer interaction module utilizes the GCN-enhanced deepest-layer features as query and the penultimate-layer features as key, value, then performs cross-attention to achieve feature interaction. Moreover, a MoE-based feature decoupling module is proposed to decouple fused representations though different experts specialized for specific distortion types or quality dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Life-IQA shows more favorable balance between accuracy and cost than a vanilla Transformer decoder and achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple BIQA benchmarks.The code is available at: \href{https://github.com/TANGLONG2/Life-IQA/tree/main}{\texttt{Life-IQA}}.

*Xiangjie Sui,Songyang Li,Hanwei Zhu,Baoliang Chen,Yuming Fang,Xin Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Bench-C benchmark and RAS metric introduced to evaluate LVLM robustness under visual corruptions, addressing limitations of existing datasets and accuracy-based metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation paradigms have limitations: low-discriminative samples mask real robustness gaps, and accuracy metrics fail to capture prediction structure degradation under visual corruptions.

Method: Proposed Bench-C benchmark with discriminative sample selection strategy considering prediction inconsistency and semantic diversity, and Robustness Alignment Score (RAS) metric measuring logit-level prediction structure degradation through uncertainty shifts and calibration alignment.

Result: Experiments revealed distinct model behavior patterns under corruptions (erroneous confidence, hesitation), subtle corruptions can cause accuracy gain but still degrade prediction structure, and corruption robustness can be decomposed into destructive/corrective components showing different failure/recovery patterns.

Conclusion: The proposed benchmark and metric provide comprehensive evaluation of LVLM robustness under visual corruptions, revealing important insights about model behavior and prediction structure degradation that conventional methods miss.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable reasoning abilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs), their robustness under visual corruptions remains insufficiently studied. Existing evaluation paradigms exhibit two major limitations: 1) the dominance of low-discriminative samples in current datasets masks the real robustness gap between models; and 2) conventional accuracy-based metric fail to capture the degradation of the underlying prediction structure. To bridge these gaps, we introduce Bench-C, a comprehensive benchmark emphasizing discriminative samples for assessing corruption robustness, where a selection strategy is proposed to jointly consider the prediction inconsistency under corruption and the semantic diversity. Furthermore, we propose the Robustness Alignment Score (RAS), a unified metric that measures degradation in logit-level prediction structure by considering the shifts in prediction uncertainty and calibration alignment. Comprehensive experiments and analysis reveal several interesting findings: 1) model behaviors exhibit distinguish patterns under corruptions, such as erroneous confidence and hesitation; 2) despite subtle corruption may lead to a slight accuracy gain, the overall prediction structure still degrades; 3) by decomposing corruption robustness into destructive and corrective components, the distinct failure and recovery patterns across models can be revealed.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReEXplore is a training-free framework that improves embodied exploration by using retrospective experience replay and hierarchical frontier selection to address limitations of MLLM-based agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLM-based embodied agents struggle with exploration due to reliance on stale pre-trained knowledge, expensive training requirements for long-horizon tasks, and difficulty handling large, nuanced action spaces in frontier-based exploration.

Method: Uses retrospective experience replay to inject distilled abstract experience at inference time and hierarchical frontier selection that decomposes frontier ranking into coarse-to-fine decisions.

Result: Achieves up to 3x higher performance in success rate and navigation efficiency across multiple embodied exploration benchmarks compared to strong MLLM baselines.

Conclusion: ReEXplore enables robust, traceable, and efficient exploration without requiring expensive training, making it a practical solution for embodied AI tasks.

Abstract: Embodied exploration is a target-driven process that requires embodied agents to possess fine-grained perception and knowledge-enhanced decision making. While recent attempts leverage MLLMs for exploration due to their strong perceptual and reasoning abilities, we find that MLLM-based embodied agents remain suboptimal in exploring new environments: (i) they rely on profound but stale pre-trained knowledge, (ii) training-based approaches such as imitation learning or reinforcement learning are expensive for long-horizon tasks with sparse outcome rewards, and (iii) frontier-based exploration yields a large, visually nuanced action space that is difficult for MLLMs to make reliable decisions. We address these challenges with ReEXplore, a training-free framework that performs retrospective experience replay to inject distilled, abstract experience at inference time, and hierarchical frontier selection to decompose frontier ranking into coarse-to-fine decisions. Our approach enables robust, traceable, and efficient exploration. Across multiple embodied exploration benchmarks, ReEXplore yields great improvements over strong MLLM baselines, up to 3x higher performance in both success rate and in navigation efficiency under open-source backbones.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new task called Change Semantic Detection (CSD) for conflict zone damage assessment, proposes MC-DiSNet with DINOv3 backbone, and releases a Gaza-change dataset with pixel-level semantic change annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate and rapid damage assessment in conflict zones is crucial for humanitarian aid and regional stability, but faces challenges like limited data, annotation difficulties, high intra-class similarity, and ambiguous semantic changes.

Method: Proposes a multi-scale cross-attention difference siamese network (MC-DiSNet) with pre-trained DINOv3 backbone for robust feature extraction from bi-temporal remote sensing images, focusing only on changed regions without large-scale semantic annotations.

Result: The method was evaluated on Gaza-Change and SECOND datasets under CSD framework, demonstrating effective performance in addressing the CSD task and enabling practical applications for rapid damage assessment in conflict zones.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses the challenging CSD task, which extends binary change detection by focusing only on semantic pixels of changed areas, paving the way for practical conflict zone damage assessment applications.

Abstract: Accurately and swiftly assessing damage from conflicts is crucial for humanitarian aid and regional stability. In conflict zones, damaged zones often share similar architectural styles, with damage typically covering small areas and exhibiting blurred boundaries. These characteristics lead to limited data, annotation difficulties, and significant recognition challenges, including high intra-class similarity and ambiguous semantic changes. To address these issues, we introduce a pre-trained DINOv3 model and propose a multi-scale cross-attention difference siamese network (MC-DiSNet). The powerful visual representation capability of the DINOv3 backbone enables robust and rich feature extraction from bi-temporal remote sensing images. We also release a new Gaza-change dataset containing high-resolution satellite image pairs from 2023-2024 with pixel-level semantic change annotations. It is worth emphasizing that our annotations only include semantic pixels of changed areas. Unlike conventional semantic change detection (SCD), our approach eliminates the need for large-scale semantic annotations of bi-temporal images, instead focusing directly on the changed regions. We term this new task change semantic detection (CSD). The CSD task represents a direct extension of binary change detection (BCD). Due to the limited spatial extent of semantic regions, it presents greater challenges than traditional SCD tasks. We evaluated our method under the CSD framework on both the Gaza-Change and SECOND datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach effectively addresses the CSD task, and its outstanding performance paves the way for practical applications in rapid damage assessment across conflict zones.

TL;DR: PG-DPO addresses likelihood displacement in DPO for diffusion models by combining Adaptive Rejection Scaling and Implicit Preference Regularization to improve preference alignment in video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DPO suffers from likelihood displacement where chosen sample probabilities decrease during training, particularly problematic in diffusion-based models for video generation tasks.

Method: Formal analysis of DPO loss in diffusion framework, identification of failure modes (Optimization Conflict and Suboptimal Maximization), and development of PG-DPO with Adaptive Rejection Scaling and Implicit Preference Regularization.

Result: PG-DPO outperforms existing methods in both quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations for video generation tasks.

Conclusion: PG-DPO provides a robust solution for mitigating likelihood displacement and improving preference alignment in diffusion-based models, especially for video generation.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has shown promising results in aligning generative outputs with human preferences by distinguishing between chosen and rejected samples. However, a critical limitation of DPO is likelihood displacement, where the probabilities of chosen samples paradoxically decrease during training, undermining the quality of generation. Although this issue has been investigated in autoregressive models, its impact within diffusion-based models remains largely unexplored. This gap leads to suboptimal performance in tasks involving video generation. To address this, we conduct a formal analysis of DPO loss through updating policy within the diffusion framework, which describes how the updating of specific training samples influences the model's predictions on other samples. Using this tool, we identify two main failure modes: (1) Optimization Conflict, which arises from small reward margins between chosen and rejected samples, and (2) Suboptimal Maximization, caused by large reward margins. Informed by these insights, we introduce a novel solution named Policy-Guided DPO (PG-DPO), combining Adaptive Rejection Scaling (ARS) and Implicit Preference Regularization (IPR) to effectively mitigate likelihood displacement. Experiments show that PG-DPO outperforms existing methods in both quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations, offering a robust solution for improving preference alignment in video generation tasks.

TL;DR: Grc-SAM is a coarse-to-fine framework that uses Granular Computing to enable prompt-free image segmentation, addressing limitations in localizability and scalability through multi-granularity attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of existing prompt-free segmentation models like SAM, which lack autonomous region localization mechanisms and have limited fine-grained modeling at high resolution.

Method: A three-stage coarse-to-fine framework: (1) coarse stage extracts high-response regions for foreground localization, (2) fine stage uses finer patch partitioning with sparse local swin-style attention for detail modeling, (3) refined masks are encoded as latent prompt embeddings for SAM decoder.

Result: Extensive experiments show Grc-SAM outperforms baseline methods in both accuracy and scalability for prompt-free segmentation.

Conclusion: Grc-SAM successfully bridges granular computing with vision transformers, providing a unique granular computational perspective for automated prompt-free segmentation.

Abstract: Prompt-free image segmentation aims to generate accurate masks without manual guidance. Typical pre-trained models, notably Segmentation Anything Model (SAM), generate prompts directly at a single granularity level. However, this approach has two limitations: (1) Localizability, lacking mechanisms for autonomous region localization; (2) Scalability, limited fine-grained modeling at high resolution. To address these challenges, we introduce Granular Computing-driven SAM (Grc-SAM), a coarse-to-fine framework motivated by Granular Computing (GrC). First, the coarse stage adaptively extracts high-response regions from features to achieve precise foreground localization and reduce reliance on external prompts. Second, the fine stage applies finer patch partitioning with sparse local swin-style attention to enhance detail modeling and enable high-resolution segmentation. Third, refined masks are encoded as latent prompt embeddings for the SAM decoder, replacing handcrafted prompts with an automated reasoning process. By integrating multi-granularity attention, Grc-SAM bridges granular computing with vision transformers. Extensive experimental results demonstrate Grc-SAM outperforms baseline methods in both accuracy and scalability. It offers a unique granular computational perspective for prompt-free segmentation.

Conclusion: Proper training dynamics understanding enables effective MeanFlow optimization, yielding faster convergence and superior few-step generation quality.

Abstract: MeanFlow promises high-quality generative modeling in few steps, by jointly learning instantaneous and average velocity fields. Yet, the underlying training dynamics remain unclear. We analyze the interaction between the two velocities and find: (i) well-established instantaneous velocity is a prerequisite for learning average velocity; (ii) learning of instantaneous velocity benefits from average velocity when the temporal gap is small, but degrades as the gap increases; and (iii) task-affinity analysis indicates that smooth learning of large-gap average velocities, essential for one-step generation, depends on the prior formation of accurate instantaneous and small-gap average velocities. Guided by these observations, we design an effective training scheme that accelerates the formation of instantaneous velocity, then shifts emphasis from short- to long-interval average velocity. Our enhanced MeanFlow training yields faster convergence and significantly better few-step generation: With the same DiT-XL backbone, our method reaches an impressive FID of 2.87 on 1-NFE ImageNet 256x256, compared to 3.43 for the conventional MeanFlow baseline. Alternatively, our method matches the performance of the MeanFlow baseline with 2.5x shorter training time, or with a smaller DiT-L backbone.

TL;DR: DynaMix is a novel method for generalizable person re-identification that combines labeled multi-camera and pseudo-labeled single-camera data through dynamic adaptation to data structure and noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely heavily on limited labeled multi-camera data, which restricts their generalization capability across unseen cameras and environments.

Method: Three core components: (1) Relabeling Module for refining pseudo-labels on-the-fly, (2) Efficient Centroids Module for maintaining robust identity representations, and (3) Data Sampling Module for balanced mini-batch composition.

Result: Extensive experiments show DynaMix consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generalizable person Re-ID.

Conclusion: DynaMix enables effective training at scale (millions of images, hundreds of thousands of identities) and achieves superior generalization performance in person re-identification.

Abstract: Generalizable person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to recognize individuals across unseen cameras and environments. While existing methods rely heavily on limited labeled multi-camera data, we propose DynaMix, a novel method that effectively combines manually labeled multi-camera and large-scale pseudo-labeled single-camera data. Unlike prior works, DynaMix dynamically adapts to the structure and noise of the training data through three core components: (1) a Relabeling Module that refines pseudo-labels of single-camera identities on-the-fly; (2) an Efficient Centroids Module that maintains robust identity representations under a large identity space; and (3) a Data Sampling Module that carefully composes mixed data mini-batches to balance learning complexity and intra-batch diversity. All components are specifically designed to operate efficiently at scale, enabling effective training on millions of images and hundreds of thousands of identities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DynaMix consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generalizable person Re-ID.

*Fangda Chen,Jintao Tang,Pancheng Wang,Ting Wang,Shasha Li,Ting Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DEAP-3DSAM enhances SAM for 3D medical image segmentation by adding a Feature Enhanced Decoder and Dual Attention Prompter to address spatial feature loss and manual prompt dependency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM shows potential for medical image segmentation but has limitations: pseudo 3D processing causes spatial feature loss, and reliance on manual prompts is impractical for real-world use.

Method: Proposed DEAP-3DSAM with Feature Enhanced Decoder (fuses original image features with spatial information) and Dual Attention Prompter (automatically generates prompts via Spatial and Channel Attention).

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on four abdominal tumor segmentation datasets, matching or outperforming manual prompt methods.

Conclusion: Both proposed modules are effective, enabling automatic 3D medical image segmentation without manual prompts while preserving spatial features.

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has recently demonstrated significant potential in medical image segmentation. Although SAM is primarily trained on 2D images, attempts have been made to apply it to 3D medical image segmentation. However, the pseudo 3D processing used to adapt SAM results in spatial feature loss, limiting its performance. Additionally, most SAM-based methods still rely on manual prompts, which are challenging to implement in real-world scenarios and require extensive external expert knowledge. To address these limitations, we introduce the Decoder Enhanced and Auto Prompt SAM (DEAP-3DSAM) to tackle these limitations. Specifically, we propose a Feature Enhanced Decoder that fuses the original image features with rich and detailed spatial information to enhance spatial features. We also design a Dual Attention Prompter to automatically obtain prompt information through Spatial Attention and Channel Attention. We conduct comprehensive experiments on four public abdominal tumor segmentation datasets. The results indicate that our DEAP-3DSAM achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D image segmentation, outperforming or matching existing manual prompt methods. Furthermore, both quantitative and qualitative ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of our proposed modules.

TL;DR: GraphPose-Fi is a graph-based framework for WiFi-based 3D human pose estimation that explicitly models skeletal topology using GCN layers with self-attention, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing WiFi-based HPE approaches ignore inherent topological relationships among human joints by using regression networks that directly map CSI to 3D coordinates, lacking structural awareness.

Method: Uses CNN encoder for subcarrier-time feature extraction, lightweight attention module for adaptive feature reweighting, and graph-based regression head combining GCN layers with self-attention to capture both local topology and global dependencies.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing methods on the MM-Fi dataset across various settings.

Conclusion: GraphPose-Fi successfully incorporates skeletal topology modeling into WiFi-based HPE, demonstrating the importance of structural relationships for improved pose estimation performance.

Abstract: WiFi-based human pose estimation (HPE) has attracted increasing attention due to its resilience to occlusion and privacy-preserving compared to camera-based methods. However, existing WiFi-based HPE approaches often employ regression networks that directly map WiFi channel state information (CSI) to 3D joint coordinates, ignoring the inherent topological relationships among human joints. In this paper, we present GraphPose-Fi, a graph-based framework that explicitly models skeletal topology for WiFi-based 3D HPE. Our framework comprises a CNN encoder shared across antennas for subcarrier-time feature extraction, a lightweight attention module that adaptively reweights features over time and across antennas, and a graph-based regression head that combines GCN layers with self-attention to capture local topology and global dependencies. Our proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods on the MM-Fi dataset in various settings. The source code is available at: https://github.com/Cirrick/GraphPose-Fi.

*Mohan Ramesh,Mark Azer,Fabian B. Flohr*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HABIT is a high-fidelity simulation benchmark that integrates realistic human motion into CARLA to address limitations in current autonomous driving simulations, revealing critical safety failures in state-of-the-art AD agents that were missed by traditional evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autonomous driving simulations inadequately represent realistic and diverse human behavior, particularly pedestrian interactions, which is essential for ensuring safety and reliability in real-world deployment.

Method: HABIT integrates real-world human motion from mocap and videos into CARLA via a modular motion retargeting pipeline, curating 4,730 traffic-compatible pedestrian motions in SMPL format for physically consistent trajectories.

Result: Evaluation of three state-of-the-art AD agents (InterFuser, TransFuser, BEVDriver) revealed up to 7.43 collisions/km, 12.94% AIS 3+ injury risk, and unnecessary braking in up to 33% of cases - significantly worse performance than shown on CARLA Leaderboard.

Conclusion: HABIT exposes critical weaknesses in AD planners that remain hidden in scripted simulations, demonstrating the need for more realistic human behavior modeling in autonomous driving evaluation.

Abstract: Current autonomous driving (AD) simulations are critically limited by their inadequate representation of realistic and diverse human behavior, which is essential for ensuring safety and reliability. Existing benchmarks often simplify pedestrian interactions, failing to capture complex, dynamic intentions and varied responses critical for robust system deployment. To overcome this, we introduce HABIT (Human Action Benchmark for Interactive Traffic), a high-fidelity simulation benchmark. HABIT integrates real-world human motion, sourced from mocap and videos, into CARLA (Car Learning to Act, a full autonomous driving simulator) via a modular, extensible, and physically consistent motion retargeting pipeline. From an initial pool of approximately 30,000 retargeted motions, we curate 4,730 traffic-compatible pedestrian motions, standardized in SMPL format for physically consistent trajectories. HABIT seamlessly integrates with CARLA's Leaderboard, enabling automated scenario generation and rigorous agent evaluation. Our safety metrics, including Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) and False Positive Braking Rate (FPBR), reveal critical failure modes in state-of-the-art AD agents missed by prior evaluations. Evaluating three state-of-the-art autonomous driving agents, InterFuser, TransFuser, and BEVDriver, demonstrates how HABIT exposes planner weaknesses that remain hidden in scripted simulations. Despite achieving close or equal to zero collisions per kilometer on the CARLA Leaderboard, the autonomous agents perform notably worse on HABIT, with up to 7.43 collisions/km and a 12.94% AIS 3+ injury risk, and they brake unnecessarily in up to 33% of cases. All components are publicly released to support reproducible, pedestrian-aware AI research.

*Hai Ci,Ziheng Peng,Pei Yang,Yingxin Xuan,Mike Zheng Shou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffSeg30k is a 30k-image dataset with pixel-level annotations for detecting and localizing diffusion-based image edits, enabling AIGC detection to shift from binary classification to semantic segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AIGC detection benchmarks focus on classifying entire images but overlook localization of diffusion-based edits, which enables realistic modification of local image regions and makes AI-generated content harder to detect.

Method: Created DiffSeg30k dataset featuring: 1) in-the-wild images from COCO, 2) diverse diffusion models (8 SOTA models), 3) multi-turn editing (up to 3 sequential edits), and 4) realistic editing scenarios using VLM-based pipeline for context-aware prompts covering additions, removals, and attribute changes.

Result: Benchmarked three baseline segmentation approaches, revealing significant challenges in semantic segmentation tasks, particularly robustness to image distortions. Segmentation models emerge as highly reliable whole-image classifiers of diffusion edits, outperforming established forgery classifiers while showing great potential in cross-generator generalization.

Conclusion: DiffSeg30k advances research in fine-grained localization of AI-generated content by demonstrating the promise and limitations of segmentation-based methods, shifting AIGC detection from binary classification to semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Diffusion-based editing enables realistic modification of local image regions, making AI-generated content harder to detect. Existing AIGC detection benchmarks focus on classifying entire images, overlooking the localization of diffusion-based edits. We introduce DiffSeg30k, a publicly available dataset of 30k diffusion-edited images with pixel-level annotations, designed to support fine-grained detection. DiffSeg30k features: 1) In-the-wild images--we collect images or image prompts from COCO to reflect real-world content diversity; 2) Diverse diffusion models--local edits using eight SOTA diffusion models; 3) Multi-turn editing--each image undergoes up to three sequential edits to mimic real-world sequential editing; and 4) Realistic editing scenarios--a vision-language model (VLM)-based pipeline automatically identifies meaningful regions and generates context-aware prompts covering additions, removals, and attribute changes. DiffSeg30k shifts AIGC detection from binary classification to semantic segmentation, enabling simultaneous localization of edits and identification of the editing models. We benchmark three baseline segmentation approaches, revealing significant challenges in semantic segmentation tasks, particularly concerning robustness to image distortions. Experiments also reveal that segmentation models, despite being trained for pixel-level localization, emerge as highly reliable whole-image classifiers of diffusion edits, outperforming established forgery classifiers while showing great potential in cross-generator generalization. We believe DiffSeg30k will advance research in fine-grained localization of AI-generated content by demonstrating the promise and limitations of segmentation-based methods.

### [269] [3M-TI: High-Quality Mobile Thermal Imaging via Calibration-free Multi-Camera Cross-Modal Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19117)
*Minchong Chen,Xiaoyun Yuan,Junzhe Wan,Jianing Zhang,Jun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3M-TI is a calibration-free multi-camera cross-modality diffusion framework that enhances mobile thermal imaging resolution without requiring explicit camera calibration between thermal and RGB cameras.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile thermal sensors have limited spatial resolution leading to blurry images. Existing thermal super-resolution methods either struggle with fine structure recovery (single-image) or require laborious cross-camera calibration (RGB-guided), hindering practical deployment.

Method: Integrates cross-modal self-attention module into diffusion UNet to adaptively align thermal and RGB features during denoising process, leveraging diffusion network's generative prior without explicit calibration.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world mobile thermal cameras and public benchmarks, with substantial improvements in visual quality and quantitative metrics. Enhanced thermal images significantly boost downstream tasks like object detection and segmentation.

Conclusion: 3M-TI provides a practical and robust solution for mobile thermal perception systems by enabling high-quality thermal super-resolution without calibration requirements, demonstrating strong practical value.

Abstract: The miniaturization of thermal sensors for mobile platforms inherently limits their spatial resolution and textural fidelity, leading to blurry and less informative images. Existing thermal super-resolution (SR) methods can be grouped into single-image and RGB-guided approaches: the former struggles to recover fine structures from limited information, while the latter relies on accurate and laborious cross-camera calibration, which hinders practical deployment and robustness. Here, we propose 3M-TI, a calibration-free Multi-camera cross-Modality diffusion framework for Mobile Thermal Imaging. At its core, 3M-TI integrates a cross-modal self-attention module (CSM) into the diffusion UNet, replacing the original self-attention layers to adaptively align thermal and RGB features throughout the denoising process, without requiring explicit camera calibration. This design enables the diffusion network to leverage its generative prior to enhance spatial resolution, structural fidelity, and texture detail in the super-resolved thermal images. Extensive evaluations on real-world mobile thermal cameras and public benchmarks validate our superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results in both visual quality and quantitative metrics. More importantly, the thermal images enhanced by 3M-TI lead to substantial gains in critical downstream tasks like object detection and segmentation, underscoring its practical value for robust mobile thermal perception systems.

TL;DR: MonoSR is a large-scale monocular spatial reasoning dataset for diverse scenarios to advance real-world applications, revealing limitations of current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing spatial reasoning research focuses on indoor environments with multi-view observations, limiting generalizability to outdoor scenarios and monocular images.

Method: Proposed MonoSR dataset spanning indoor, outdoor, and object-centric settings with multiple question types, and evaluated advanced vision-language models.

Result: Revealed limitations of current models on monocular spatial reasoning and analyzed whether auxiliary information is crucial for this task.

Conclusion: Established foundation for advancing monocular spatial reasoning in real-world, open-world environments with practical guidance for future model design.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning (SR), the ability to infer 3D spatial information from 2D inputs, is essential for real-world applications such as embodied AI and autonomous driving. However, existing research primarily focuses on indoor environments and typically relies on multi-view observations, which limits their generalizability to outdoor scenarios and constrains their applicability to monocular images, the most common real-world setting. In this work, we propose MonoSR, a large-scale monocular spatial reasoning dataset that spans diverse scenarios including indoor, outdoor, and object-centric settings, and supports multiple question types. MonoSR provides a path toward open-world monocular spatial reasoning. Beyond introducing the dataset, we evaluate advanced vision-language models to reveal their limitations on this challenging task. We further analyze whether auxiliary information is crucial for monocular spatial reasoning and offer practical guidance for designing future models. These contributions collectively establish a foundation for advancing monocular spatial reasoning in real-world, open-world environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SemAnti is a semantic-antagonistic fine-tuning method that freezes CLIP's semantic subspace and adapts only artifact-sensitive layers under shuffled semantics, achieving state-of-the-art cross-domain generalization for AI-generated image detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CLIP-based detectors rely on semantic cues rather than generator artifacts, leading to brittle performance under distribution shifts when detecting AI-generated images from various generators.

Method: Proposes SemAnti paradigm that uses Patch Shuffle to disrupt global semantic continuity while preserving local artifact cues, then freezes CLIP's semantic subspace and fine-tunes only artifact-sensitive layers under shuffled semantics.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art cross-domain generalization on AIGCDetectBenchmark and GenImage benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance in detecting AI-generated images across different generators.

Conclusion: Regulating semantics is key to unlocking CLIP's full potential for robust AI-generated image detection, and semantic bias suppression enables stable cross-domain representations.

Abstract: The rapid progress of GANs and Diffusion Models poses new challenges for detecting AI-generated images. Although CLIP-based detectors exhibit promising generalization, they often rely on semantic cues rather than generator artifacts, leading to brittle performance under distribution shifts. In this work, we revisit the nature of semantic bias and uncover that Patch Shuffle provides an unusually strong benefit for CLIP, that disrupts global semantic continuity while preserving local artifact cues, which reduces semantic entropy and homogenizes feature distributions between natural and synthetic images. Through a detailed layer-wise analysis, we further show that CLIP's deep semantic structure functions as a regulator that stabilizes cross-domain representations once semantic bias is suppressed. Guided by these findings, we propose SemAnti, a semantic-antagonistic fine-tuning paradigm that freezes the semantic subspace and adapts only artifact-sensitive layers under shuffled semantics. Despite its simplicity, SemAnti achieves state-of-the-art cross-domain generalization on AIGCDetectBenchmark and GenImage, demonstrating that regulating semantics is key to unlocking CLIP's full potential for robust AI-generated image detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small object detection in UAV imagery is challenging due to low resolution and background clutter. Existing RGB-IR fusion methods struggle with balancing effective cross-modal interaction and computational efficiency.

Method: Proposes MambaRefine-YOLO with two key components: Dual-Gated Complementary Mamba fusion module (DGC-MFM) that adaptively balances RGB and IR modalities through illumination-aware and difference-aware gating, and Hierarchical Feature Aggregation Neck (HFAN) using a "refine-then-fuse" strategy for multi-scale features.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art mAP of 83.2% on DroneVehicle dataset (7.9% improvement over baseline). On VisDrone dataset, HFAN-only variant also shows significant gains, demonstrating general applicability.

Conclusion: The work presents a superior balance between accuracy and speed, making it highly suitable for real-world UAV applications.

Abstract: Small object detection in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) imagery is a persistent challenge, hindered by low resolution and background clutter. While fusing RGB and infrared (IR) data offers a promising solution, existing methods often struggle with the trade-off between effective cross-modal interaction and computational efficiency. In this letter, we introduce MambaRefine-YOLO. Its core contributions are a Dual-Gated Complementary Mamba fusion module (DGC-MFM) that adaptively balances RGB and IR modalities through illumination-aware and difference-aware gating mechanisms, and a Hierarchical Feature Aggregation Neck (HFAN) that uses a ``refine-then-fuse'' strategy to enhance multi-scale features. Our comprehensive experiments validate this dual-pronged approach. On the dual-modality DroneVehicle dataset, the full model achieves a state-of-the-art mAP of 83.2%, an improvement of 7.9% over the baseline. On the single-modality VisDrone dataset, a variant using only the HFAN also shows significant gains, demonstrating its general applicability. Our work presents a superior balance between accuracy and speed, making it highly suitable for real-world UAV applications.

TL;DR: FilmSceneDesigner is an automated system that generates complete film scenes from natural language descriptions using agent-based parameter generation and procedural generation pipeline, supported by a curated dataset of film-specific 3D assets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional film set design is labor-intensive and time-consuming, relying on expert-driven manual modeling. The paper aims to automate this process to reduce manual effort and improve efficiency.

Method: Uses agent-based chaining framework to generate structured parameters from natural language descriptions, followed by procedural generation pipeline for floorplan generation, material assignment, object retrieval and layout. Also introduces SetDepot-Pro dataset with 6,862 film-specific 3D assets and 733 materials.

Result: The system produces structurally sound scenes with strong cinematic fidelity, supporting downstream tasks like virtual previs, construction drawing and mood board creation. Experimental results and human evaluations validate the effectiveness.

Conclusion: FilmSceneDesigner successfully automates film set design workflow, generating realistic film scenes from text descriptions while maintaining structural integrity and cinematic quality.

Abstract: Film set design plays a pivotal role in cinematic storytelling and shaping the visual atmosphere. However, the traditional process depends on expert-driven manual modeling, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. To address this issue, we introduce FilmSceneDesigner, an automated scene generation system that emulates professional film set design workflow. Given a natural language description, including scene type, historical period, and style, we design an agent-based chaining framework to generate structured parameters aligned with film set design workflow, guided by prompt strategies that ensure parameter accuracy and coherence. On the other hand, we propose a procedural generation pipeline which executes a series of dedicated functions with the structured parameters for floorplan and structure generation, material assignment, door and window placement, and object retrieval and layout, ultimately constructing a complete film scene from scratch. Moreover, to enhance cinematic realism and asset diversity, we construct SetDepot-Pro, a curated dataset of 6,862 film-specific 3D assets and 733 materials. Experimental results and human evaluations demonstrate that our system produces structurally sound scenes with strong cinematic fidelity, supporting downstream tasks such as virtual previs, construction drawing and mood board creation.

*Dongha Lee,Jinhee Park,Minjun Kim,Junseok Kwon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ABM-LoRA is an initialization strategy that accelerates LoRA convergence by aligning adapter activation boundaries with the pretrained model, reducing information loss and improving early training performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Random initialization in LoRA restricts gradient updates to mismatched tangent spaces, causing significant information loss and hindering early convergence despite LoRA's parameter efficiency.

Method: Aligns the adapter's activation boundaries with those of the pretrained model before downstream training to maximize projection of full-parameter gradients into the adapter subspace.

Result: Achieves highest accuracy on VTAB-1K among all methods, with strong gains on structured reasoning tasks requiring geometric understanding. Shows effectiveness across language understanding, dialogue generation, and vision recognition tasks.

Conclusion: ABM-LoRA substantially accelerates LoRA convergence by reducing information loss at initialization through principled activation boundary alignment, delivering improved performance across diverse architectures and tasks.

Abstract: We propose Activation Boundary Matching for Low-Rank Adaptation (ABM-LoRA), a principled initialization strategy that substantially accelerates the convergence of low-rank adapters. While LoRA offers high parameter efficiency, its random initialization restricts gradient updates to a mismatched tangent space, causing significant information loss and hindering early convergence. Our ABM-LoRA addresses this by aligning the adapter's activation boundaries with those of the pretrained model before downstream training, thereby maximizing the projection of full-parameter gradients into the adapter subspace. This alignment sharply reduces information loss at initialization, yields a lower starting loss, and accelerates convergence. We demonstrate ABM-LoRA's effectiveness across diverse architectures and tasks: language understanding (T5-Base on GLUE), dialogue generation (LLaMA2-7B on WizardLM), and vision recognition (ViT-B/16 on VTAB-1K). On VTAB-1K, it achieves the highest accuracy among all methods, with strong gains on structured reasoning tasks requiring geometric understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoMA framework leverages multiple foundation models (CLIP and BLIP) with complementary properties for source-free domain adaptation, using bidirectional adaptation and decomposed mutual information to achieve state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single foundation models in SFDA have limited semantic coverage and fail to capture diverse contextual cues under domain shift, requiring a multi-model approach for better adaptation.

Method: Collaborative framework using two complementary FMs with bidirectional adaptation and decomposed mutual information to align models while maintaining semantic distinctiveness and transferring knowledge.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art SFDA methods across Office-31, Office-Home, DomainNet-126, and VisDA benchmarks in closed-set, partial-set, and open-set settings.

Conclusion: Multi-foundation model collaboration with proper adaptation mechanisms effectively addresses SFDA challenges and achieves superior performance across various domain adaptation scenarios.

Abstract: Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) aims to adapt a pre-trained source model to an unlabeled target domain without access to source data. Recent advances in Foundation Models (FMs) have introduced new opportunities for leveraging external semantic knowledge to guide SFDA. However, relying on a single FM is often insufficient, as it tends to bias adaptation toward a restricted semantic coverage, failing to capture diverse contextual cues under domain shift. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Collaborative Multi-foundation Adaptation (CoMA) framework that jointly leverages two different FMs (e.g., CLIP and BLIP) with complementary properties to capture both global semantics and local contextual cues. Specifically, we employ a bidirectional adaptation mechanism that (1) aligns different FMs with the target model for task adaptation while maintaining their semantic distinctiveness, and (2) transfers complementary knowledge from the FMs to the target model. To ensure stable adaptation under mini-batch training, we introduce Decomposed Mutual Information (DMI) that selectively enhances true dependencies while suppressing false dependencies arising from incomplete class coverage. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art SFDA methods across four benchmarks, including Office-31, Office-Home, DomainNet-126, and VisDA, under the closed-set setting, while also achieving best results on partial-set and open-set variants.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A retrieval-augmented framework for fashion caption and hashtag generation that combines multi-garment detection, attribute reasoning, and LLM prompting to create visually grounded, descriptive text with better factual accuracy than end-to-end approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of end-to-end captioners that struggle with attribute fidelity and domain generalization in fashion imagery, aiming to produce more accurate and stylistically interesting fashion content.

Method: Pipeline combines YOLO-based multi-garment detection, k-means clustering for color extraction, CLIP-FAISS retrieval for fabric/gender attributes, and uses retrieved evidence to guide LLM for caption/hashtag generation. BLIP model used as baseline comparison.

Result: YOLO detector achieved mAP@0.5 of 0.71 for 9 garment categories. RAG-LLM pipeline achieved 0.80 mean attribute coverage with full coverage at 50% threshold in hashtag generation, outperforming BLIP which had higher lexical overlap but lower generalization.

Conclusion: Retrieval-augmented generation is an effective and interpretable paradigm for automated fashion content generation, exhibiting better factual grounding, less hallucination, and scalability across clothing domains.

Abstract: This paper introduces the retrieval-augmented framework for automatic fashion caption and hashtag generation, combining multi-garment detection, attribute reasoning, and Large Language Model (LLM) prompting. The system aims to produce visually grounded, descriptive, and stylistically interesting text for fashion imagery, overcoming the limitations of end-to-end captioners that have problems with attribute fidelity and domain generalization. The pipeline combines a YOLO-based detector for multi-garment localization, k-means clustering for dominant color extraction, and a CLIP-FAISS retrieval module for fabric and gender attribute inference based on a structured product index. These attributes, together with retrieved style examples, create a factual evidence pack that is used to guide an LLM to generate human-like captions and contextually rich hashtags. A fine-tuned BLIP model is used as a supervised baseline model for comparison. Experimental results show that the YOLO detector is able to obtain a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 0.71 for nine categories of garments. The RAG-LLM pipeline generates expressive attribute-aligned captions and achieves mean attribute coverage of 0.80 with full coverage at the 50% threshold in hashtag generation, whereas BLIP gives higher lexical overlap and lower generalization. The retrieval-augmented approach exhibits better factual grounding, less hallucination, and great potential for scalable deployment in various clothing domains. These results demonstrate the use of retrieval-augmented generation as an effective and interpretable paradigm for automated and visually grounded fashion content generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Test-Time Preference Optimization (TTPO), a training-free method that enhances image restoration quality by aligning with human preferences using online-generated preference data and diffusion guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image restoration models often fail to align with human preferences, creating a need for methods that improve perceptual quality without retraining models or collecting extensive preference data.

Method: Three-stage pipeline: 1) Generate candidate preference images using diffusion inversion/denoising, 2) Select preferred/dispreferred images using automated metrics or human feedback, 3) Use selected images as reward signals to guide diffusion denoising for preference alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments across various image restoration tasks and models demonstrate the method's effectiveness and flexibility in improving perceptual quality.

Conclusion: TTPO successfully enhances image restoration quality by aligning with human preferences, works with any IR model backbone, and eliminates the need for model retraining or labor-intensive data collection.

Abstract: Image restoration (IR) models are typically trained to recover high-quality images using L1 or LPIPS loss. To handle diverse unknown degradations, zero-shot IR methods have also been introduced. However, existing pre-trained and zero-shot IR approaches often fail to align with human preferences, resulting in restored images that may not be favored. This highlights the critical need to enhance restoration quality and adapt flexibly to various image restoration tasks or backbones without requiring model retraining and ideally without labor-intensive preference data collection. In this paper, we propose the first Test-Time Preference Optimization (TTPO) paradigm for image restoration, which enhances perceptual quality, generates preference data on-the-fly, and is compatible with any IR model backbone. Specifically, we design a training-free, three-stage pipeline: (i) generate candidate preference images online using diffusion inversion and denoising based on the initially restored image; (ii) select preferred and dispreferred images using automated preference-aligned metrics or human feedback; and (iii) use the selected preference images as reward signals to guide the diffusion denoising process, optimizing the restored image to better align with human preferences. Extensive experiments across various image restoration tasks and models demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed pipeline.

Conclusion: MetroGS provides an effective framework for robust reconstruction in complex urban environments, successfully addressing geometric fidelity challenges through its integrated approach of dense enhancement, hybrid optimization, and appearance modeling.

Abstract: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting and its derivatives have achieved significant breakthroughs in large-scale scene reconstruction. However, how to efficiently and stably achieve high-quality geometric fidelity remains a core challenge. To address this issue, we introduce MetroGS, a novel Gaussian Splatting framework for efficient and robust reconstruction in complex urban environments. Our method is built upon a distributed 2D Gaussian Splatting representation as the core foundation, serving as a unified backbone for subsequent modules. To handle potential sparse regions in complex scenes, we propose a structured dense enhancement scheme that utilizes SfM priors and a pointmap model to achieve a denser initialization, while incorporating a sparsity compensation mechanism to improve reconstruction completeness. Furthermore, we design a progressive hybrid geometric optimization strategy that organically integrates monocular and multi-view optimization to achieve efficient and accurate geometric refinement. Finally, to address the appearance inconsistency commonly observed in large-scale scenes, we introduce a depth-guided appearance modeling approach that learns spatial features with 3D consistency, facilitating effective decoupling between geometry and appearance and further enhancing reconstruction stability. Experiments on large-scale urban datasets demonstrate that MetroGS achieves superior geometric accuracy, rendering quality, offering a unified solution for high-fidelity large-scale scene reconstruction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: nnActive is an open-source Active Learning framework for 3D biomedical imaging that addresses four evaluation pitfalls in current AL assessment and reveals that while AL methods outperform standard random sampling, none reliably surpasses improved foreground-aware random sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic segmentation in biomedical imaging requires large annotated datasets, which are costly and time-consuming to create. Active Learning aims to reduce annotation effort by selecting the most informative samples, but there's no consensus on whether AL consistently outperforms random sampling in 3D biomedical imaging due to evaluation limitations.

Method: nnActive framework overcomes evaluation pitfalls through: (1) large-scale study across four datasets and three label regimes, (2) extending nnU-Net with partial annotations and 3D patch-based query selection, (3) proposing foreground-aware random sampling strategies, and (4) introducing foreground efficiency metric to measure annotation cost.

Result: Key findings: (A) AL methods outperform standard random sampling but none reliably beat improved foreground-aware random sampling; (B) AL benefits depend on task-specific parameters; (C) Predictive Entropy is the best performing AL method but requires most annotation effort; (D) AL performance improves with more compute-intensive design choices.

Conclusion: nnActive serves as a holistic, open-source framework that can catalyze research and application of Active Learning in 3D biomedical imaging, providing standardized evaluation methods and revealing important insights about AL performance in this domain.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is crucial for various biomedical applications, yet its reliance on large annotated datasets presents a bottleneck due to the high cost and specialized expertise required for manual labeling. Active Learning (AL) aims to mitigate this challenge by querying only the most informative samples, thereby reducing annotation effort. However, in the domain of 3D biomedical imaging, there is no consensus on whether AL consistently outperforms Random sampling. Four evaluation pitfalls hinder the current methodological assessment. These are (1) restriction to too few datasets and annotation budgets, (2) using 2D models on 3D images without partial annotations, (3) Random baseline not being adapted to the task, and (4) measuring annotation cost only in voxels. In this work, we introduce nnActive, an open-source AL framework that overcomes these pitfalls by (1) means of a large scale study spanning four biomedical imaging datasets and three label regimes, (2) extending nnU-Net by using partial annotations for training with 3D patch-based query selection, (3) proposing Foreground Aware Random sampling strategies tackling the foreground-background class imbalance of medical images and (4) propose the foreground efficiency metric, which captures the low annotation cost of background-regions. We reveal the following findings: (A) while all AL methods outperform standard Random sampling, none reliably surpasses an improved Foreground Aware Random sampling; (B) benefits of AL depend on task specific parameters; (C) Predictive Entropy is overall the best performing AL method, but likely requires the most annotation effort; (D) AL performance can be improved with more compute intensive design choices. As a holistic, open-source framework, nnActive can serve as a catalyst for research and application of AL in 3D biomedical imaging. Code is at: https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnActive

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the bottleneck of obtaining 3D anatomical models from real patients due to legal, ethical, and technical challenges, especially for soft tissue organs like prostate with poor imaging contrast.

Method: Using physical prostate models made of biomimetic hydrogels with multi-zone imaging contrast, placed in customized ultrasound scanner before/after endoscopic surgery simulation. Neural network segmentation of ultrasound images and 3D mesh reconstruction with 3D GAN for manifold generation.

Result: Neural network segmentation outperforms conventional computer vision techniques in IoU metrics. Successful generation of 3D models and performance feedback from surgical simulations.

Conclusion: The workflow enables automated generation of 3D anatomical data for surgical planning and training, overcoming data scarcity issues through physical organ models and advanced machine learning techniques.

Abstract: Surgical planning and training based on machine learning requires a large amount of 3D anatomical models reconstructed from medical imaging, which is currently one of the major bottlenecks. Obtaining these data from real patients and during surgery is very demanding, if even possible, due to legal, ethical, and technical challenges. It is especially difficult for soft tissue organs with poor imaging contrast, such as the prostate. To overcome these challenges, we present a novel workflow for automated 3D anatomical data generation using data obtained from physical organ models. We additionally use a 3D Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to obtain a manifold of 3D models useful for other downstream machine learning tasks that rely on 3D data. We demonstrate our workflow using an artificial prostate model made of biomimetic hydrogels with imaging contrast in multiple zones. This is used to physically simulate endoscopic surgery. For evaluation and 3D data generation, we place it into a customized ultrasound scanner that records the prostate before and after the procedure. A neural network is trained to segment the recorded ultrasound images, which outperforms conventional, non-learning-based computer vision techniques in terms of intersection over union (IoU). Based on the segmentations, a 3D mesh model is reconstructed, and performance feedback is provided.

Motivation: Existing benchmarks assume input consistency and fail to evaluate cross-modal contradiction detection, which is crucial for preventing hallucinations and ensuring reliability in real-world multimodal systems.

Method: Created CLASH benchmark with COCO images paired with contradictory captions containing object-level or attribute-level contradictions, including multiple-choice and open-ended questions, with automated quality checks and human verification.

Result: Analysis shows state-of-the-art models have substantial limitations in recognizing cross-modal conflicts, exhibiting systematic modality biases and category-specific weaknesses.

Conclusion: Targeted fine-tuning on CLASH substantially enhances conflict detection capabilities, demonstrating the benchmark's utility for improving multimodal model reliability.

Abstract: Contradictory multimodal inputs are common in real-world settings, yet existing benchmarks typically assume input consistency and fail to evaluate cross-modal contradiction detection - a fundamental capability for preventing hallucinations and ensuring reliability. We introduce CLASH, a novel benchmark for multimodal contradiction detection, featuring COCO images paired with contradictory captions containing controlled object-level or attribute-level contradictions. The samples include targeted questions evaluated in both multiple-choice and open-ended formats. The benchmark provides an extensive fine-tuning set filtered through automated quality checks, alongside a smaller human-verified diagnostic set. Our analysis of state-of-the-art models reveals substantial limitations in recognizing cross-modal conflicts, exposing systematic modality biases and category-specific weaknesses. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that targeted fine-tuning on CLASH substantially enhances conflict detection capabilities.

TL;DR: The paper studies whether vision-language models like CLIP can distinguish between real objects and their lookalikes (toys, statues, drawings, etc.) by creating a RoLA dataset and developing methods to separate real vs. lookalike representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite strong performance on recognition benchmarks, computer vision models still lag behind human perception in subtle abilities like judging whether something looks like an object without actually being one.

Method: Created RoLA dataset of real and lookalike exemplars; evaluated prompt-based baseline; estimated direction in CLIP's embedding space between real and lookalike representations; applied this direction to improve cross-modal retrieval and captioning.

Result: The estimated direction in CLIP's embedding space successfully improved discrimination in cross-modal retrieval on Conceptual12M and enhanced captions produced by CLIP prefix captioner.

Conclusion: Vision-language models like CLIP can capture the distinction between real objects and their lookalikes, and this capability can be leveraged to improve various vision-language tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in computer vision have yielded models with strong performance on recognition benchmarks; however, significant gaps remain in comparison to human perception. One subtle ability is to judge whether an image looks like a given object without being an instance of that object. We study whether vision-language models such as CLIP capture this distinction. We curated a dataset named RoLA (Real or Lookalike) of real and lookalike exemplars (e.g., toys, statues, drawings, pareidolia) across multiple categories, and first evaluate a prompt-based baseline with paired "real"/"lookalike" prompts. We then estimate a direction in CLIP's embedding space that moves representations between real and lookalike. Applying this direction to image and text embeddings improves discrimination in cross-modal retrieval on Conceptual12M, and also enhances captions produced by a CLIP prefix captioner.

TL;DR: A method for occlusion culling in 3D Gaussian Splatting using a shared MLP to learn viewpoint-dependent visibility, enabling efficient rendering by discarding occluded primitives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The semi-transparent nature of Gaussians prevents the application of occlusion culling, which is a highly effective technique for accelerating rendering in scenes with many primitives.

Method: Learn viewpoint-dependent visibility function using a small, shared MLP across instances, query it for Gaussians within viewing frustum before rasterization, and integrate neural queries into a novel instanced software rasterizer leveraging Tensor Cores.

Result: Outperforms current state-of-the-art for composed scenes in VRAM usage and image quality, with complementary properties to existing LoD techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses the occlusion culling limitation in 3D Gaussian Splatting through neural visibility learning and efficient rasterization integration.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting can exploit frustum culling and level-of-detail strategies to accelerate rendering of scenes containing a large number of primitives. However, the semi-transparent nature of Gaussians prevents the application of another highly effective technique: occlusion culling. We address this limitation by proposing a novel method to learn the viewpoint-dependent visibility function of all Gaussians in a trained model using a small, shared MLP across instances of an asset in a scene. By querying it for Gaussians within the viewing frustum prior to rasterization, our method can discard occluded primitives during rendering. Leveraging Tensor Cores for efficient computation, we integrate these neural queries directly into a novel instanced software rasterizer. Our approach outperforms the current state of the art for composed scenes in terms of VRAM usage and image quality, utilizing a combination of our instanced rasterizer and occlusion culling MLP, and exhibits complementary properties to existing LoD techniques.

TL;DR: Proposes ReAlign, a reward-guided sampling method for text-to-motion generation that improves alignment between text and motion distributions in diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address misalignment between text and motion distributions in diffusion models, which causes semantically inconsistent or low-quality motions in text-to-motion generation.

Method: ReAlign framework with step-aware reward model that assesses alignment quality during denoising, and reward-guided strategy directing diffusion toward optimally aligned distribution. Combines text-aligned module for semantic consistency and motion-aligned module for realism.

Result: Significantly improves text-motion alignment and motion quality compared to state-of-the-art methods in both motion generation and retrieval tasks.

Conclusion: ReAlign effectively addresses text-motion misalignment in diffusion models, enhancing semantic consistency and motion quality in text-to-motion generation.

Abstract: Text-to-motion generation, which synthesizes 3D human motions from text inputs, holds immense potential for applications in gaming, film, and robotics. Recently, diffusion-based methods have been shown to generate more diversity and realistic motion. However, there exists a misalignment between text and motion distributions in diffusion models, which leads to semantically inconsistent or low-quality motions. To address this limitation, we propose Reward-guided sampling Alignment (ReAlign), comprising a step-aware reward model to assess alignment quality during the denoising sampling and a reward-guided strategy that directs the diffusion process toward an optimally aligned distribution. This reward model integrates step-aware tokens and combines a text-aligned module for semantic consistency and a motion-aligned module for realism, refining noisy motions at each timestep to balance probability density and alignment. Extensive experiments of both motion generation and retrieval tasks demonstrate that our approach significantly improves text-motion alignment and motion quality compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: To investigate whether frontier VLMs genuinely integrate visual information when answering medical questions, rather than relying on textual shortcuts.

Method: Tested four state-of-the-art VLMs on 60 Italian medical questions requiring image interpretation, substituting correct medical images with blank placeholders to isolate visual dependency.

Result: GPT-4o showed strongest visual grounding with 27.9pp accuracy drop, while GPT-5-mini, Gemini, and Claude had modest drops of 8.5pp, 2.4pp, and 5.6pp respectively, revealing confident but fabricated visual interpretations.

Conclusion: Critical differences exist in model robustness and visual grounding, highlighting the need for rigorous evaluation before clinical deployment.

Abstract: Large vision language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance on medical visual question answering benchmarks, yet their reliance on visual information remains unclear. We investigate whether frontier VLMs demonstrate genuine visual grounding when answering Italian medical questions by testing four state-of-the-art models: Claude Sonnet 4.5, GPT-4o, GPT-5-mini, and Gemini 2.0 flash exp. Using 60 questions from the EuropeMedQA Italian dataset that explicitly require image interpretation, we substitute correct medical images with blank placeholders to test whether models truly integrate visual and textual information. Our results reveal striking variability in visual dependency: GPT-4o shows the strongest visual grounding with a 27.9pp accuracy drop (83.2% [74.6%, 91.7%] to 55.3% [44.1%, 66.6%]), while GPT-5-mini, Gemini, and Claude maintain high accuracy with modest drops of 8.5pp, 2.4pp, and 5.6pp respectively. Analysis of model-generated reasoning reveals confident explanations for fabricated visual interpretations across all models, suggesting varying degrees of reliance on textual shortcuts versus genuine visual analysis. These findings highlight critical differences in model robustness and the need for rigorous evaluation before clinical deployment.

Motivation: Current vision-language models are weak at spatial grounding and understanding, leading to limited perception and localization ability in autonomous driving systems, especially in long-tail scenarios and complex interactions.

Method: Unifies 2D/3D perception tasks into World-PV and World-BEV tokens with grid-conditioned prediction mechanism, incorporating IoU-aware scoring and parallel autoregressive decoding. Leverages pretrained VLM parameters to retain general intelligence.

Result: Achieves 51.7/58.9 mAP on COCO 2D detection and nuScenes BEV 3D detection. When integrated with trajectory decoders, surpasses DiffusionDrive by 2.1 in PMDS on NAVSIM. Shows strong open-vocabulary and long-tail generalization.

Conclusion: Percept-WAM successfully integrates 2D/3D perception within a single VLM, matching or surpassing classical detectors while improving planning performance in autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Autonomous driving heavily relies on accurate and robust spatial perception. Many failures arise from inaccuracies and instability, especially in long-tail scenarios and complex interactions. However, current vision-language models are weak at spatial grounding and understanding, and VLA systems built on them therefore show limited perception and localization ability. To address these challenges, we introduce Percept-WAM, a perception-enhanced World-Awareness-Action Model that is the first to implicitly integrate 2D/3D scene understanding abilities within a single vision-language model (VLM). Instead of relying on QA-style spatial reasoning, Percept-WAM unifies 2D/3D perception tasks into World-PV and World-BEV tokens, which encode both spatial coordinates and confidence. We propose a grid-conditioned prediction mechanism for dense object perception, incorporating IoU-aware scoring and parallel autoregressive decoding, improving stability in long-tail, far-range, and small-object scenarios. Additionally, Percept-WAM leverages pretrained VLM parameters to retain general intelligence (e.g., logical reasoning) and can output perception results and trajectory control outputs directly. Experiments show that Percept-WAM matches or surpasses classical detectors and segmenters on downstream perception benchmarks, achieving 51.7/58.9 mAP on COCO 2D detection and nuScenes BEV 3D detection. When integrated with trajectory decoders, it further improves planning performance on nuScenes and NAVSIM, e.g., surpassing DiffusionDrive by 2.1 in PMDS on NAVSIM. Qualitative results further highlight its strong open-vocabulary and long-tail generalization.

Motivation: Current DiT-based video generation models frequently violate physical laws and commonsense dynamics due to lack of explicit world knowledge, despite achieving good visual quality and temporal coherence.

Method: Proposes DiT-Mem, a learnable memory encoder using stacked 3D CNNs, low-/high-pass filters, and self-attention layers to map reference videos into memory tokens. These tokens are concatenated in DiT self-attention layers while keeping the diffusion backbone frozen during training.

Result: The method enables efficient training with only 150M parameters and 10K data samples, and extensive experiments show improved physical rule following and video fidelity in state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: DiT-Mem successfully equips video generation models with world knowledge through a plug-and-play memory approach, addressing physical law violations while maintaining training efficiency.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer(DiT) based video generation models have recently achieved impressive visual quality and temporal coherence, but they still frequently violate basic physical laws and commonsense dynamics, revealing a lack of explicit world knowledge. In this work, we explore how to equip them with a plug-and-play memory that injects useful world knowledge. Motivated by in-context memory in Transformer-based LLMs, we conduct empirical studies to show that DiT can be steered via interventions on its hidden states, and simple low-pass and high-pass filters in the embedding space naturally disentangle low-level appearance and high-level physical/semantic cues, enabling targeted guidance. Building on these observations, we propose a learnable memory encoder DiT-Mem, composed of stacked 3D CNNs, low-/high-pass filters, and self-attention layers. The encoder maps reference videos into a compact set of memory tokens, which are concatenated as the memory within the DiT self-attention layers. During training, we keep the diffusion backbone frozen, and only optimize the memory encoder. It yields a rather efficient training process on few training parameters (150M) and 10K data samples, and enables plug-and-play usage at inference time. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art models demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in improving physical rule following and video fidelity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for dynamic scene reconstruction either require costly human annotations for object trajectories or use time-varying representations without explicit object-level decomposition, leading to intertwined static and dynamic elements that hinder scene separation.

Method: Models dynamic objects as coherent instances undergoing rigid transformations, employs zero-shot language-grounded video tracking anchored to 3D using lidar, estimates consistent poses via feature correspondences, and uses coordinated-turn smoothing for temporally and physically consistent motion trajectories followed by joint optimization.

Result: Achieves competitive reconstruction quality on Waymo Open Dataset while maintaining instance-level decomposition and generalizes across diverse sequences and view densities without retraining.

Conclusion: IDSplat provides a practical solution for large-scale autonomous driving applications by enabling self-supervised dynamic scene reconstruction with explicit instance decomposition and physically consistent motion trajectories.

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic driving scenes is essential for developing autonomous systems through sensor-realistic simulation. Although recent methods achieve high-fidelity reconstructions, they either rely on costly human annotations for object trajectories or use time-varying representations without explicit object-level decomposition, leading to intertwined static and dynamic elements that hinder scene separation. We present IDSplat, a self-supervised 3D Gaussian Splatting framework that reconstructs dynamic scenes with explicit instance decomposition and learnable motion trajectories, without requiring human annotations. Our key insight is to model dynamic objects as coherent instances undergoing rigid transformations, rather than unstructured time-varying primitives. For instance decomposition, we employ zero-shot, language-grounded video tracking anchored to 3D using lidar, and estimate consistent poses via feature correspondences. We introduce a coordinated-turn smoothing scheme to obtain temporally and physically consistent motion trajectories, mitigating pose misalignments and tracking failures, followed by joint optimization of object poses and Gaussian parameters. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that our method achieves competitive reconstruction quality while maintaining instance-level decomposition and generalizes across diverse sequences and view densities without retraining, making it practical for large-scale autonomous driving applications. Code will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Computer vision systems in logistics are vulnerable to physical adversarial attacks, particularly printed patches that could manipulate cargo occupancy estimation for planning, routing, and billing purposes.

Method: Used Mitsuba 3 for differentiable rendering to optimize patch textures across variations in geometry, lighting, and viewpoint in fully simulated 3D environments, comparing effectiveness to 2D compositing baseline.

Result: 3D-optimized patches achieved 84.94% success in denial-of-service attacks (empty to full) and 30.32% in concealment attacks (full to empty), significantly outperforming 2D baseline approaches.

Conclusion: Adversarial patches pose significant security risks to automated logistics pipelines, and the study highlights the need for strengthening physical robustness in computer vision systems for logistics applications.

Abstract: Computer vision systems are increasingly adopted in modern logistics operations, including the estimation of trailer occupancy for planning, routing, and billing. Although effective, such systems may be vulnerable to physical adversarial attacks, particularly adversarial patches that can be printed and placed on interior surfaces. In this work, we study the feasibility of such attacks on a convolutional cargo-occupancy classifier using fully simulated 3D environments. Using Mitsuba 3 for differentiable rendering, we optimize patch textures across variations in geometry, lighting, and viewpoint, and compare their effectiveness to a 2D compositing baseline. Our experiments demonstrate that 3D-optimized patches achieve high attack success rates, especially in a denial-of-service scenario (empty to full), where success reaches 84.94 percent. Concealment attacks (full to empty) prove more challenging but still reach 30.32 percent. We analyze the factors influencing attack success, discuss implications for the security of automated logistics pipelines, and highlight directions for strengthening physical robustness.

TL;DR: LAST (LeArn to Think in Space and Time) improves 3D spatial and long video understanding in vision-language models by enabling visual thinking trajectories in 3D space and time rather than just text-based reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models struggle with 3D space and long video understanding despite being powerful in typical vision-language tasks, requiring specialized architectural designs for separate 3D and video tasks.

Method: Propose LAST framework that makes VLMs think in space and time by building visual thinking trajectories in 3D space and temporal dimension, using only 2D images as inputs. Applied in zero-shot prompting of proprietary models and fine-tuning general VLMs with thinking trajectory data.

Result: Substantial gains across various benchmarks: 15.8% improvement on EgoSchema with GPT-4o in zero-shot, 8.3 gains on VSI-Bench compared with Qwen2.5-VL-7B, and improvements in 3 spatial, 4 video, and 3 image understanding tasks.

Conclusion: LAST effectively enhances 3D spatial and long video understanding for general VLMs by enabling visual thinking trajectories in space and time, achieving significant performance improvements across multiple benchmarks without requiring specialized architectures.

Abstract: Humans can perceive and understand 3D space and long videos from sequential visual observations. But do vision-language models (VLMs) can? Recent work demonstrates that even state-of-the-art VLMs still struggle to understand 3D space and long videos, although they are powerful in typical vision-language tasks. Current methods often rely on specialized architectural designs to improve performance for 3D tasks and video understanding tasks separately. In contrast, we propose LAST, short for LeArn to Think in Space and Time, to jointly improve 3D spatial and long video understanding for general VLMs with only a set of 2D images as inputs. LAST makes VLMs think in space and time rather than only with text before giving the final answer, building visual thinking trajectories in 3D space and temporal dimension. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LAST in two scenarios: 1) zero-shot, where we directly prompt proprietary models; and 2) fine-tuning general VLMs with data that include thinking trajectories in 3D space and time. We show that LAST brings substantial gains in various benchmarks, including 3 spatial understanding, 4 video understanding, and 3 image understanding tasks. Notably, 15.8% gains on EgoSchema with GPT-4o in a zero-shot manner and 8.3 gains on VSI-Bench compared with Qwen2.5-VL-7B.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BideDPO is a bidirectionally decoupled DPO framework that addresses conflicts in conditional image generation by creating disentangled preference pairs for text and condition signals, using adaptive loss balancing and automated data generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current conditional image generation methods struggle with input-level conflicts (conditioning image contradicts text prompt) and model-bias conflicts (generative biases disrupt alignment), which standard supervised fine-tuning cannot adequately address.

Method: Proposes BideDPO with two disentangled preference pairs (one for condition, one for text) to reduce gradient entanglement, adaptive loss balancing strategy, automated data pipeline for conflict-aware data generation, and iterative optimization strategy.

Result: Significantly improves text success rates (+35%) and condition adherence, validated on DualAlign benchmark and COCO dataset.

Conclusion: BideDPO effectively resolves conflicts in conditional image generation through bidirectional decoupling and adaptive optimization, demonstrating substantial improvements in both text and condition alignment.

Abstract: Conditional image generation enhances text-to-image synthesis with structural, spatial, or stylistic priors, but current methods face challenges in handling conflicts between sources. These include 1) input-level conflicts, where the conditioning image contradicts the text prompt, and 2) model-bias conflicts, where generative biases disrupt alignment even when conditions match the text. Addressing these conflicts requires nuanced solutions, which standard supervised fine-tuning struggles to provide. Preference-based optimization techniques like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) show promise but are limited by gradient entanglement between text and condition signals and lack disentangled training data for multi-constraint tasks. To overcome this, we propose a bidirectionally decoupled DPO framework (BideDPO). Our method creates two disentangled preference pairs-one for the condition and one for the text-to reduce gradient entanglement. The influence of pairs is managed using an Adaptive Loss Balancing strategy for balanced optimization. We introduce an automated data pipeline to sample model outputs and generate conflict-aware data. This process is embedded in an iterative optimization strategy that refines both the model and the data. We construct a DualAlign benchmark to evaluate conflict resolution between text and condition. Experiments show BideDPO significantly improves text success rates (e.g., +35%) and condition adherence. We also validate our approach using the COCO dataset.

*Mingyang Chen,Jiawei Du,Bo Huang,Yi Wang,Xiaobo Zhang,Wei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel core-set selection method using diffusion models to estimate data likelihood through reconstruction deviation, outperforming existing baselines and achieving full-data performance with only 50% of data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing core-set selection methods rely on heuristic signals without explicit data likelihood modeling, potentially missing critical distributional structures needed for effective model training.

Method: Leverages diffusion models to estimate data likelihood via reconstruction deviation from partial reverse denoising, with theoretical grounding in Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) and an information-theoretic approach to identify optimal reconstruction timestep.

Result: Outperforms existing baselines across selection ratios on ImageNet, closely matching full-data training performance using only 50% of data, with likelihood-informed scores providing insights into data distribution characteristics and model learning preferences.

Conclusion: Reconstruction deviation from diffusion models provides an effective, distribution-aware scoring criterion for core-set selection, offering theoretical grounding and practical performance improvements over heuristic methods.

Abstract: Existing core-set selection methods predominantly rely on heuristic scoring signals such as training dynamics or model uncertainty, lacking explicit modeling of data likelihood. This omission may hinder the constructed subset from capturing subtle yet critical distributional structures that underpin effective model training. In this work, we propose a novel, theoretically grounded approach that leverages diffusion models to estimate data likelihood via reconstruction deviation induced by partial reverse denoising. Specifically, we establish a formal connection between reconstruction error and data likelihood, grounded in the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) of Markovian diffusion processes, thereby enabling a principled, distribution-aware scoring criterion for data selection. Complementarily, we introduce an efficient information-theoretic method to identify the optimal reconstruction timestep, ensuring that the deviation provides a reliable signal indicative of underlying data likelihood. Extensive experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that reconstruction deviation offers an effective scoring criterion, consistently outperforming existing baselines across selection ratios, and closely matching full-data training using only 50% of the data. Further analysis shows that the likelihood-informed nature of our score reveals informative insights in data selection, shedding light on the interplay between data distributional characteristics and model learning preferences.

*Qianying Liu,Xiao Liang,Zhiqiang Zhang,Yibo Chen,Xu Tang,Zhongfei Qing,Fengfan Zhou,Yao Hu,Paul Henderson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReMatch is a framework that uses MLLMs for multimodal retrieval by training them end-to-end with a generative matching stage, achieving state-of-the-art results on MMEB with strong zero-shot generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous approaches underutilized MLLMs' generative nature and compositional reasoning capabilities by treating them as simple encoders rather than leveraging their full potential for multimodal retrieval.

Method: End-to-end training of embedding MLLM with chat-style generative matching stage that autoregressively decides relevance from multi-view inputs; uses multiple learnable tokens to generate fine-grained contextual embeddings; combines instance-wise discrimination supervision with standard contrastive loss.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art on Massive Multimodal Embedding Benchmark (MMEB) with particularly strong zero-shot generalization results on five datasets, demonstrating robustness and transferability.

Conclusion: ReMatch effectively leverages MLLMs' generative capabilities for multimodal retrieval, providing superior performance through its novel training approach that preserves compositional reasoning while offering strong discrimination on hard negatives.

Abstract: We present ReMatch, a framework that leverages the generative strength of MLLMs for multimodal retrieval. Previous approaches treated an MLLM as a simple encoder, ignoring its generative nature, and under-utilising its compositional reasoning and world knowledge. We instead train the embedding MLLM end-to-end with a chat-style generative matching stage. The matching stage uses the same MLLM to autoregressively decide relevance from multi-view inputs, including both raw data and its own projected embeddings for each query and document. It provides instance-wise discrimination supervision that complements a standard contrastive loss, offering stronger gradients on hard negatives and preserving the compositional strengths of the original MLLM. To obtain semantically richer multimodal embeddings, we use multiple learnable tokens to augment each input, generating fine-grained contextual, mutually orthogonal embeddings with low inference cost. Leveraging our established high-performance baseline,we assemble the ideas mentioned above into a powerful training recipe and achieve a new state-of-the-art on the Massive Multimodal Embedding Benchmark (MMEB). Our experiments show particularly strong zero-shot generalization results on five datasets, highlighting the robustness and transferability of ReMatch.

TL;DR: Proposes densify beforehand approach for 3D Gaussian Splatting that combines LiDAR and monocular depth to create dense point clouds, eliminating adaptive density control issues and improving efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing 3DGS methods, particularly adaptive density control that causes floating artifacts and inefficient resource usage.

Method: Novel densify beforehand approach combining sparse LiDAR data with monocular depth estimation, using ROI-aware sampling to prioritize important regions and create dense point clouds.

Result: Achieves comparable results to state-of-the-art techniques while significantly lowering resource consumption and training time, with improved visual fidelity.

Conclusion: The approach effectively bypasses adaptive density control issues, reduces overlap, enhances visual quality, and preserves regions of interest in complex scenes.

Abstract: This paper addresses the limitations of existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods, particularly their reliance on adaptive density control, which can lead to floating artifacts and inefficient resource usage. We propose a novel densify beforehand approach that enhances the initialization of 3D scenes by combining sparse LiDAR data with monocular depth estimation from corresponding RGB images. Our ROI-aware sampling scheme prioritizes semantically and geometrically important regions, yielding a dense point cloud that improves visual fidelity and computational efficiency. This densify beforehand approach bypasses the adaptive density control that may introduce redundant Gaussians in the original pipeline, allowing the optimization to focus on the other attributes of 3D Gaussian primitives, reducing overlap while enhancing visual quality. Our method achieves comparable results to state-of-the-art techniques while significantly lowering resource consumption and training time. We validate our approach through extensive comparisons and ablation studies on four newly collected datasets, showcasing its effectiveness in preserving regions of interest in complex scenes.

*Johannes Meier,Florian Günther,Riccardo Marin,Oussema Dhaouadi,Jacques Kaiser,Daniel Cremers*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IDEAL-M3D is an instance-level active learning pipeline for monocular 3D detection that addresses limitations of previous image-level and uncertainty-based approaches, achieving similar performance with only 60% of annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular 3D detection requires costly 3D annotations, and existing active learning methods are inefficient (select entire images) and biased (toward depth ambiguity, favoring distant objects over nearby ones).

Method: Proposes IDEAL-M3D with instance-level selection and explicitly diverse ensemble using heterogeneous backbones, task-agnostic features, loss weight perturbation, and time-dependent bagging.

Result: Achieves similar or better AP3D on KITTI validation and test sets with only 60% of annotations compared to training on the full dataset.

Conclusion: IDEAL-M3D provides superior performance and significant resource savings, demonstrating the effectiveness of instance-level selection and diversity-driven ensemble for monocular 3D detection active learning.

Abstract: Monocular 3D detection relies on just a single camera and is therefore easy to deploy. Yet, achieving reliable 3D understanding from monocular images requires substantial annotation, and 3D labels are especially costly. To maximize performance under constrained labeling budgets, it is essential to prioritize annotating samples expected to deliver the largest performance gains. This prioritization is the focus of active learning. Curiously, we observed two significant limitations in active learning algorithms for 3D monocular object detection. First, previous approaches select entire images, which is inefficient, as non-informative instances contained in the same image also need to be labeled. Secondly, existing methods rely on uncertainty-based selection, which in monocular 3D object detection creates a bias toward depth ambiguity. Consequently, distant objects are selected, while nearby objects are overlooked.
  To address these limitations, we propose IDEAL-M3D, the first instance-level pipeline for monocular 3D detection. For the first time, we demonstrate that an explicitly diverse, fast-to-train ensemble improves diversity-driven active learning for monocular 3D. We induce diversity with heterogeneous backbones and task-agnostic features, loss weight perturbation, and time-dependent bagging. IDEAL-M3D shows superior performance and significant resource savings: with just 60% of the annotations, we achieve similar or better AP3D on KITTI validation and test set results compared to training the same detector on the whole dataset.

TL;DR: DGSPNet is a language prompt-driven framework for infrared small target detection that uses dual-granularity semantic prompts and text-guided attention mechanisms to improve detection accuracy without manual annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CLIP-inspired methods for infrared small target detection suffer from inaccurate text descriptions and reliance on manual annotations, limiting their effectiveness in handling limited feature representation and background interference.

Method: Proposed DGSPNet with dual-granularity semantic prompts (coarse-grained textual priors and fine-grained personalized semantic descriptions), plus text-guide channel attention (TGCA) and text-guide spatial attention (TGSA) mechanisms.

Result: Significantly improves detection accuracy and achieves state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively leverages language prompts for infrared small target detection without annotation requirements, demonstrating superior performance through dual-granularity semantic integration and text-guided attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection remains challenging due to limited feature representation and severe background interference, resulting in sub-optimal performance. While recent CLIP-inspired methods attempt to leverage textual guidance for detection, they are hindered by inaccurate text descriptions and reliance on manual annotations. To overcome these limitations, we propose DGSPNet, an end-to-end language prompt-driven framework. Our approach integrates dual-granularity semantic prompts: coarse-grained textual priors (e.g., 'infrared image', 'small target') and fine-grained personalized semantic descriptions derived through visual-to-textual mapping within the image space. This design not only facilitates learning fine-grained semantic information but also can inherently leverage language prompts during inference without relying on any annotation requirements. By fully leveraging the precision and conciseness of text descriptions, we further introduce a text-guide channel attention (TGCA) mechanism and text-guide spatial attention (TGSA) mechanism that enhances the model's sensitivity to potential targets across both low- and high-level feature spaces. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves detection accuracy and achieves state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper establishes a comprehensive evaluation framework for dataset watermarking in diffusion models, revealing vulnerabilities in existing methods and proposing a practical watermark removal technique.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fine-tuning techniques for diffusion models introduce copyright and security risks, and while dataset watermarking has been proposed for traceability, there's no unified evaluation framework to assess its effectiveness.

Method: The paper establishes a general threat model and introduces a comprehensive evaluation framework covering Universality, Transmissibility, and Robustness, and proposes a practical watermark removal method.

Result: Experiments show existing methods perform well in universality and transmissibility, and have some robustness against common image processing, but fail under real-world threats. The proposed removal method can fully eliminate watermarks without affecting fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Current dataset watermarking methods have significant vulnerabilities in real-world scenarios, highlighting a key challenge for future research in ensuring effective copyright protection for diffusion models.

Abstract: Recent fine-tuning techniques for diffusion models enable them to reproduce specific image sets, such as particular faces or artistic styles, but also introduce copyright and security risks. Dataset watermarking has been proposed to ensure traceability by embedding imperceptible watermarks into training images, which remain detectable in outputs even after fine-tuning. However, current methods lack a unified evaluation framework. To address this, this paper establishes a general threat model and introduces a comprehensive evaluation framework encompassing Universality, Transmissibility, and Robustness. Experiments show that existing methods perform well in universality and transmissibility, and exhibit some robustness against common image processing operations, yet still fall short under real-world threat scenarios. To reveal these vulnerabilities, the paper further proposes a practical watermark removal method that fully eliminates dataset watermarks without affecting fine-tuning, highlighting a key challenge for future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SyncMV4D is the first model that jointly generates synchronized multi-view hand-object interaction videos and 4D motions by unifying visual priors, motion dynamics, and multi-view geometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video-based HOI methods are single-view with geometric distortions, while 3D HOI approaches require controlled lab data and lack real-world generalization. There's a need for methods that overcome both limitations.

Method: Uses Multi-view Joint Diffusion (MJD) to co-generate HOI videos and intermediate motions, and Diffusion Points Aligner (DPA) to refine motion into globally aligned 4D metric point tracks. Establishes a closed-loop cycle where video conditions motion refinement and aligned tracks guide next-step generation.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance to state-of-the-art alternatives in visual realism, motion plausibility, and multi-view consistency.

Conclusion: SyncMV4D successfully addresses limitations of both single-view video methods and 3D HOI approaches by jointly generating synchronized multi-view videos and 4D motions through a unified framework.

Abstract: Hand-Object Interaction (HOI) generation plays a critical role in advancing applications across animation and robotics. Current video-based methods are predominantly single-view, which impedes comprehensive 3D geometry perception and often results in geometric distortions or unrealistic motion patterns. While 3D HOI approaches can generate dynamically plausible motions, their dependence on high-quality 3D data captured in controlled laboratory settings severely limits their generalization to real-world scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we introduce SyncMV4D, the first model that jointly generates synchronized multi-view HOI videos and 4D motions by unifying visual prior, motion dynamics, and multi-view geometry. Our framework features two core innovations: (1) a Multi-view Joint Diffusion (MJD) model that co-generates HOI videos and intermediate motions, and (2) a Diffusion Points Aligner (DPA) that refines the coarse intermediate motion into globally aligned 4D metric point tracks. To tightly couple 2D appearance with 4D dynamics, we establish a closed-loop, mutually enhancing cycle. During the diffusion denoising process, the generated video conditions the refinement of the 4D motion, while the aligned 4D point tracks are reprojected to guide next-step joint generation. Experimentally, our method demonstrates superior performance to state-of-the-art alternatives in visual realism, motion plausibility, and multi-view consistency.

TL;DR: SteadyDancer is an I2V framework that solves identity drift and motion control issues in human animation through condition reconciliation, synergistic pose modulation, and staged training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing R2V methods suffer from spatio-temporal misalignments causing identity drift and visual artifacts, failing to preserve first-frame identity while controlling motion precisely.

Method: Uses Condition-Reconciliation Mechanism to harmonize conflicting conditions, Synergistic Pose Modulation Modules for adaptive pose representation, and Staged Decoupled-Objective Training Pipeline for hierarchical optimization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in appearance fidelity and motion control while requiring significantly fewer training resources than comparable methods.

Conclusion: SteadyDancer successfully addresses fundamental challenges in human image animation by ensuring first-frame preservation and precise motion control through its novel I2V paradigm.

Abstract: Preserving first-frame identity while ensuring precise motion control is a fundamental challenge in human image animation. The Image-to-Motion Binding process of the dominant Reference-to-Video (R2V) paradigm overlooks critical spatio-temporal misalignments common in real-world applications, leading to failures such as identity drift and visual artifacts. We introduce SteadyDancer, an Image-to-Video (I2V) paradigm-based framework that achieves harmonized and coherent animation and is the first to ensure first-frame preservation robustly. Firstly, we propose a Condition-Reconciliation Mechanism to harmonize the two conflicting conditions, enabling precise control without sacrificing fidelity. Secondly, we design Synergistic Pose Modulation Modules to generate an adaptive and coherent pose representation that is highly compatible with the reference image. Finally, we employ a Staged Decoupled-Objective Training Pipeline that hierarchically optimizes the model for motion fidelity, visual quality, and temporal coherence. Experiments demonstrate that SteadyDancer achieves state-of-the-art performance in both appearance fidelity and motion control, while requiring significantly fewer training resources than comparable methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current monocular methods use oversimplified, anatomically inaccurate models (e.g., SMPL) and ignore physics, fundamentally limiting their biomechanical fidelity. Marker-based systems are lab-bound and slow, creating a need for accurate monocular motion reconstruction.

Uses a novel forward-inverse consistency loss to align motion reconstruction with kinetic reasoning.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in kinematic accuracy on BML-MoVi, BEDLAM, and OpenCap datasets, while enabling precise monocular kinetics estimation for the first time.

Conclusion: MonoMSK successfully bridges data-driven learning and physics-based simulation to achieve biomechanically realistic 3D human motion estimation from monocular video, addressing key limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Reconstructing biomechanically realistic 3D human motion - recovering both kinematics (motion) and kinetics (forces) - is a critical challenge. While marker-based systems are lab-bound and slow, popular monocular methods use oversimplified, anatomically inaccurate models (e.g., SMPL) and ignore physics, fundamentally limiting their biomechanical fidelity. In this work, we introduce MonoMSK, a hybrid framework that bridges data-driven learning and physics-based simulation for biomechanically realistic 3D human motion estimation from monocular video. MonoMSK jointly recovers both kinematics (motions) and kinetics (forces and torques) through an anatomically accurate musculoskeletal model. By integrating transformer-based inverse dynamics with differentiable forward kinematics and dynamics layers governed by ODE-based simulation, MonoMSK establishes a physics-regulated inverse-forward loop that enforces biomechanical causality and physical plausibility. A novel forward-inverse consistency loss further aligns motion reconstruction with the underlying kinetic reasoning. Experiments on BML-MoVi, BEDLAM, and OpenCap show that MonoMSK significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in kinematic accuracy, while for the first time enabling precise monocular kinetics estimation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: POUR introduces a provably optimal method for machine unlearning at the representation level using geometric projections based on Neural Collapse theory, outperforming existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing machine unlearning methods often only modify classifiers while leaving internal representations intact, leading to incomplete forgetting of target concepts.

Method: Developed POUR with two variants: POUR-P (closed-form geometric projection) and POUR-D (feature-level unlearning under distillation), based on Neural Collapse theory showing orthogonal projection of simplex ETFs remains optimal.

Result: Experiments on CIFAR-10/100 and PathMNIST show POUR achieves effective unlearning while preserving retained knowledge, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on both classification and representation metrics.

Conclusion: POUR provides a theoretically grounded and practically effective approach for representation-level machine unlearning, addressing limitations of existing methods through geometric projections and proper representation modification.

Abstract: In computer vision, machine unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific visual concepts or training images without retraining from scratch. Studies show that existing approaches often modify the classifier while leaving internal representations intact, resulting in incomplete forgetting. In this work, we extend the notion of unlearning to the representation level, deriving a three-term interplay between forgetting efficacy, retention fidelity, and class separation. Building on Neural Collapse theory, we show that the orthogonal projection of a simplex Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) remains an ETF in a lower dimensional space, yielding a provably optimal forgetting operator. We further introduce the Representation Unlearning Score (RUS) to quantify representation-level forgetting and retention fidelity. Building on this, we introduce POUR (Provably Optimal Unlearning of Representations), a geometric projection method with closed-form (POUR-P) and a feature-level unlearning variant under a distillation scheme (POUR-D). Experiments on CIFAR-10/100 and PathMNIST demonstrate that POUR achieves effective unlearning while preserving retained knowledge, outperforming state-of-the-art unlearning methods on both classification-level and representation-level metrics.

TL;DR: Syn-GRPO improves MLLM perception by synthesizing diverse training data through an online generator, addressing low data quality in reinforcement learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL methods for MLLMs suffer from low data quality where samples fail to elicit diverse responses, limiting exploration scope. Current entropy constraints don't solve the root problem.

Method: Proposes Syn-GRPO with two components: (1) data server that synthesizes new samples from existing ones using image generation with decoupled asynchronous scheme, (2) GRPO workflow that provides image descriptions and uses diversity reward to supervise MLLM for diverse response prediction.

Result: Experiments across three visual perception tasks show Syn-GRPO significantly improves data quality and achieves superior performance compared to existing MLLM perception methods.

Conclusion: Syn-GRPO demonstrates promising potential for scaling long-term self-evolving reinforcement learning by effectively addressing data quality issues through online data synthesis.

Abstract: RL (reinforcement learning) methods (e.g., GRPO) for MLLM (Multimodal LLM) perception ability has attracted wide research interest owing to its remarkable generalization ability. Nevertheless, existing reinforcement learning methods still face the problem of low data quality, where data samples cannot elicit diverse responses from MLLMs, thus restricting the exploration scope for MLLM reinforcement learning. Some methods attempt to mitigate this problem by imposing constraints on entropy, but none address it at its root. Therefore, to tackle this problem, this work proposes Syn-GRPO (Synthesis-GRPO), which employs an online data generator to synthesize high-quality training data with diverse responses in GRPO training. Specifically, Syn-GRPO consists of two components: (1) data server; (2) GRPO workflow. The data server synthesizes new samples from existing ones using an image generation model, featuring a decoupled and asynchronous scheme to achieve high generation efficiency. The GRPO workflow provides the data server with the new image descriptions, and it leverages a diversity reward to supervise the MLLM to predict image descriptions for synthesizing samples with diverse responses. Experiment results across three visual perception tasks demonstrate that Syn-GRPO improves the data quality by a large margin, achieving significant superior performance to existing MLLM perception methods, and Syn-GRPO presents promising potential for scaling long-term self-evolving RL.

TL;DR: Introduces a large-scale cell counting dataset with 3,023 images and 430,000+ annotations, benchmarks existing methods, and adapts SAM for cell counting with improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual cell counting is labor-intensive and error-prone, while existing datasets are too small (often <500 images) to train reliable deep learning models for biomedical applications.

Method: Created large annotated dataset from immunocytochemistry experiments, benchmarked regression-based, crowd-counting, and cell-counting methods, and adapted Segment Anything Model (SAM) for microscopy cell counting using dot annotations.

Result: SAM-Counter achieved MAE of 22.12, outperforming second-best method (MAE 27.46), demonstrating the dataset's value for driving progress in automated cell counting.

Conclusion: The dataset and benchmarking framework provide a robust foundation for future research in automated cell counting, with SAM adaptation showing promising results.

Abstract: Accurate cell counting is essential in various biomedical research and clinical applications, including cancer diagnosis, stem cell research, and immunology. Manual counting is labor-intensive and error-prone, motivating automation through deep learning techniques. However, training reliable deep learning models requires large amounts of high-quality annotated data, which is difficult and time-consuming to produce manually. Consequently, existing cell-counting datasets are often limited, frequently containing fewer than $500$ images. In this work, we introduce a large-scale annotated dataset comprising $3{,}023$ images from immunocytochemistry experiments related to cellular differentiation, containing over $430{,}000$ manually annotated cell locations. The dataset presents significant challenges: high cell density, overlapping and morphologically diverse cells, a long-tailed distribution of cell count per image, and variation in staining protocols. We benchmark three categories of existing methods: regression-based, crowd-counting, and cell-counting techniques on a test set with cell counts ranging from $10$ to $2{,}126$ cells per image. We also evaluate how the Segment Anything Model (SAM) can be adapted for microscopy cell counting using only dot-annotated datasets. As a case study, we implement a density-map-based adaptation of SAM (SAM-Counter) and report a mean absolute error (MAE) of $22.12$, which outperforms existing approaches (second-best MAE of $27.46$). Our results underscore the value of the dataset and the benchmarking framework for driving progress in automated cell counting and provide a robust foundation for future research and development.

*Rui Li,Yuanzhi Liang,Ziqi Ni,Haibing Huang,Chi Zhang,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Self-Paced GRPO improves video generation alignment by making rewards co-evolve with the generator, shifting from visual fidelity to temporal coherence and semantic alignment as quality improves.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static reward models in GRPO introduce distributional bias, saturate quickly, and limit reinforcement learning effectiveness for video generation alignment.

Method: Progressive reward mechanism that automatically shifts emphasis from coarse visual fidelity to temporal coherence and fine-grained text-video semantic alignment as generation quality increases.

Result: Consistent improvements in visual quality and semantic alignment across multiple video generation backbones on VBench compared to static reward GRPO baselines.

Conclusion: Self-Paced GRPO provides more stable optimization, mitigates reward exploitation, and offers effective co-evolution of rewards and generators for video generation alignment.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has emerged as a powerful reinforcement learning paradigm for post-training video generation models. However, existing GRPO pipelines rely on static, fixed-capacity reward models whose evaluation behavior is frozen during training. Such rigid rewards introduce distributional bias, saturate quickly as the generator improves, and ultimately limit the stability and effectiveness of reinforcement-based alignment. We propose Self-Paced GRPO, a competence-aware GRPO framework in which reward feedback co-evolves with the generator. Our method introduces a progressive reward mechanism that automatically shifts its emphasis from coarse visual fidelity to temporal coherence and fine-grained text-video semantic alignment as generation quality increases. This self-paced curriculum alleviates reward-policy mismatch, mitigates reward exploitation, and yields more stable optimization. Experiments on VBench across multiple video generation backbones demonstrate consistent improvements in both visual quality and semantic alignment over GRPO baselines with static rewards, validating the effectiveness and generality of Self-Paced GRPO.

*Zehong Ma,Longhui Wei,Shuai Wang,Shiliang Zhang,Qi Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeCo proposes a frequency-decoupled pixel diffusion framework that separates high-frequency detail generation from low-frequency semantic modeling using a lightweight pixel decoder and diffusion transformer, achieving state-of-the-art performance while improving training and inference efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pixel diffusion models suffer from slow training and inference because they model both high-frequency signals and low-frequency semantics within a single diffusion transformer, limiting efficiency and performance.

Method: Proposes frequency-decoupled pixel diffusion with a lightweight pixel decoder for high-frequency details and a DiT specializing in low-frequency semantics, plus a frequency-aware flow-matching loss that emphasizes visually salient frequencies.

Result: Achieves FID of 1.62 (256x256) and 2.22 (512x512) on ImageNet, closing the gap with latent diffusion methods, and attains leading overall score of 0.86 on GenEval for text-to-image generation.

Conclusion: The frequency-decoupled approach enables more efficient and effective pixel diffusion, achieving competitive performance with latent diffusion while maintaining end-to-end pixel space generation advantages.

Abstract: Pixel diffusion aims to generate images directly in pixel space in an end-to-end fashion. This approach avoids the limitations of VAE in the two-stage latent diffusion, offering higher model capacity. Existing pixel diffusion models suffer from slow training and inference, as they usually model both high-frequency signals and low-frequency semantics within a single diffusion transformer (DiT). To pursue a more efficient pixel diffusion paradigm, we propose the frequency-DeCoupled pixel diffusion framework. With the intuition to decouple the generation of high and low frequency components, we leverage a lightweight pixel decoder to generate high-frequency details conditioned on semantic guidance from the DiT. This thus frees the DiT to specialize in modeling low-frequency semantics. In addition, we introduce a frequency-aware flow-matching loss that emphasizes visually salient frequencies while suppressing insignificant ones. Extensive experiments show that DeCo achieves superior performance among pixel diffusion models, attaining FID of 1.62 (256x256) and 2.22 (512x512) on ImageNet, closing the gap with latent diffusion methods. Furthermore, our pretrained text-to-image model achieves a leading overall score of 0.86 on GenEval in system-level comparison. Codes are publicly available at https://github.com/Zehong-Ma/DeCo.

*Saniah Kayenat Chowdhury,Rusab Sarmun,Muhammad E. H. Chowdhury,Sohaib Bassam Zoghoul,Israa Al-Hashimi,Adam Mushtak,Amith Khandakar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A medically grounded hybrid pipeline for lung cancer tumor staging that explicitly measures tumor size and distances to anatomical structures rather than treating staging as pure image classification, achieving 91.36% accuracy with transparent decision support.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End-to-end deep learning approaches often overlook spatial and anatomical information crucial for tumor-node-metastasis staging, and small variations in tumor properties can significantly alter staging outcomes.

Method: Uses specialized encoder-decoder networks to segment lung, lobes, tumor, mediastinum, and diaphragm, then extracts tumor size and distance properties from segmentation masks, and applies rule-based staging aligned with medical guidelines.

Result: Achieved 91.36% overall classification accuracy on Lung-PET-CT-Dx dataset with per-stage F1-scores: T1 (0.93), T2 (0.89), T3 (0.96), T4 (0.90), outperforming traditional deep learning models.

Conclusion: First study to embed explicit clinical context into tumor stage classification, offering both state-of-the-art performance and transparent decision support compared to black-box CNN approaches.

Abstract: Accurate lung cancer tumor staging is crucial for prognosis and treatment planning. However, it remains challenging for end-to-end deep learning approaches, as such approaches often overlook spatial and anatomical information that are central to the tumor-node-metastasis system. The tumor stage depends on multiple quantitative criteria, including the tumor size and its proximity to the nearest anatomical structures, and small variations can alter the staging outcome. We propose a medically grounded hybrid pipeline that performs staging by explicitly measuring the tumor's size and distance properties rather than treating it as a pure image classification task. Our method employs specialized encoder-decoder networks to precisely segment the lung and adjacent anatomy, including the lobes, tumor, mediastinum, and diaphragm. Subsequently, we extract the necessary tumor properties, i.e. measure the largest tumor dimension and calculate the distance between the tumor and neighboring anatomical structures by a quantitative analysis of the segmentation masks. Finally, we apply rule-based tumor staging aligned with the medical guidelines. This novel framework has been evaluated on the Lung-PET-CT-Dx dataset, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional deep learning models, achieving an overall classification accuracy of 91.36%. We report the per-stage F1-scores of 0.93 (T1), 0.89 (T2), 0.96 (T3), and 0.90 (T4), a critical evaluation aspect often omitted in prior literature. To our knowledge, this is the first study that embeds explicit clinical context into tumor stage classification. Unlike standard convolutional neural networks that operate in an uninterpretable "black box" manner, our method offers both state-of-the-art performance and transparent decision support.

*Maroun Ayli,Youssef Bakouny,Tushar Sharma,Nader Jalloul,Hani Seifeddine,Rima Kilany*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A graph-based representation for UI screenshots that encodes hierarchical and spatial relationships, enabling better search and analysis than vision-only approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enterprise software has thousands of UI screens that need consistent design and compliance checking, but existing methods lack structural modeling.

Method: Convert UI screenshots to attributed graphs, use contrastive graph autoencoder to learn embeddings preserving visual, structural, and semantic similarity.

Result: Achieves 0.92 Top-5 accuracy on 20,396 financial UIs with 47.5ms median latency, scales to 20,000+ screens.

Conclusion: Structural embeddings provide better discriminative power than vision encoders alone, enabling fine-grained UI distinction and complex queries.

Abstract: Enterprise software companies maintain thousands of user interface screens across products and versions, creating critical challenges for design consistency, pattern discovery, and compliance check. Existing approaches rely on visual similarity or text semantics, lacking explicit modeling of structural properties fundamental to user interface (UI) composition. We present a novel graph-based representation that converts UI screenshots into attributed graphs encoding hierarchical relationships and spatial arrangements, potentially generalizable to document layouts, architectural diagrams, and other structured visual domains. A contrastive graph autoencoder learns embeddings preserving multi-level similarity across visual, structural, and semantic properties. The comprehensive analysis demonstrates that our structural embeddings achieve better discriminative power than state-of-the-art Vision Encoders, representing a fundamental advance in the expressiveness of the UI representation. We implement this representation in UISearch, a multi-modal search framework that combines structural embeddings with semantic search through a composable query language. On 20,396 financial software UIs, UISearch achieves 0.92 Top-5 accuracy with 47.5ms median latency (P95: 124ms), scaling to 20,000+ screens. The hybrid indexing architecture enables complex queries and supports fine-grained UI distinction impossible with vision-only approaches.

### [310] [BackSplit: The Importance of Sub-dividing the Background in Biomedical Lesion Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19394)
*Rachit Saluja,Asli Cihangir,Ruining Deng,Johannes C. Paetzold,Fengbei Liu,Mert R. Sabuncu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BackSplit improves small lesion segmentation by subdividing the heterogeneous background into fine-grained anatomical classes rather than treating it as a single class, boosting performance without increasing inference costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional lesion segmentation treats all non-lesion pixels as a single background class, ignoring the rich anatomical context. This oversimplification makes small lesion segmentation difficult.

Method: Proposes BackSplit - training with fine-grained labels that subdivide the background class into tissues, organs and structures. Uses Fisher Information theory to prove tighter asymptotic bounds and more stable optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and architectures show BackSplit consistently boosts small-lesion segmentation performance, even with automatically generated auxiliary labels from pretrained models or interactive frameworks.

Conclusion: BackSplit is a simple yet powerful paradigm that significantly improves small lesion segmentation by properly modeling the heterogeneous background, demonstrating robustness and broad applicability across different label sources.

Abstract: Segmenting small lesions in medical images remains notoriously difficult. Most prior work tackles this challenge by either designing better architectures, loss functions, or data augmentation schemes; and collecting more labeled data. We take a different view, arguing that part of the problem lies in how the background is modeled. Common lesion segmentation collapses all non-lesion pixels into a single "background" class, ignoring the rich anatomical context in which lesions appear. In reality, the background is highly heterogeneous-composed of tissues, organs, and other structures that can now be labeled manually or inferred automatically using existing segmentation models.
  In this paper, we argue that training with fine-grained labels that sub-divide the background class, which we call BackSplit, is a simple yet powerful paradigm that can offer a significant performance boost without increasing inference costs. From an information theoretic standpoint, we prove that BackSplit increases the expected Fisher Information relative to conventional binary training, leading to tighter asymptotic bounds and more stable optimization. With extensive experiments across multiple datasets and architectures, we empirically show that BackSplit consistently boosts small-lesion segmentation performance, even when auxiliary labels are generated automatically using pretrained segmentation models. Additionally, we demonstrate that auxiliary labels derived from interactive segmentation frameworks exhibit the same beneficial effect, demonstrating its robustness, simplicity, and broad applicability.

### [311] [In-Video Instructions: Visual Signals as Generative Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19401)
*Gongfan Fang,Xinyin Ma,Xinchao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video generative models can interpret visual instructions embedded in frames (like arrows or text overlays) for controllable image-to-video generation, enabling precise spatial control over multiple objects' actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage video models' visual reasoning capabilities for more precise control in image-to-video generation, moving beyond coarse text prompts to enable explicit spatial instructions for different objects.

Method: In-Video Instruction paradigm that encodes user guidance directly in visual domain through overlays like text, arrows, or trajectories, allowing distinct instructions for different objects with spatial awareness.

Result: Extensive experiments on Veo 3.1, Kling 2.5, and Wan 2.2 show video models reliably interpret and execute visually embedded instructions, especially in complex multi-object scenarios.

Conclusion: Video generative models can effectively interpret visual instructions embedded in frames, providing more precise, spatial-aware control for image-to-video generation compared to text-based approaches.

Abstract: Large-scale video generative models have recently demonstrated strong visual capabilities, enabling the prediction of future frames that adhere to the logical and physical cues in the current observation. In this work, we investigate whether such capabilities can be harnessed for controllable image-to-video generation by interpreting visual signals embedded within the frames as instructions, a paradigm we term In-Video Instruction. In contrast to prompt-based control, which provides textual descriptions that are inherently global and coarse, In-Video Instruction encodes user guidance directly into the visual domain through elements such as overlaid text, arrows, or trajectories. This enables explicit, spatial-aware, and unambiguous correspondences between visual subjects and their intended actions by assigning distinct instructions to different objects. Extensive experiments on three state-of-the-art generators, including Veo 3.1, Kling 2.5, and Wan 2.2, show that video models can reliably interpret and execute such visually embedded instructions, particularly in complex multi-object scenarios.

*Yiming Qin,Bomin Wei,Jiaxin Ge,Konstantinos Kallidromitis,Stephanie Fu,Trevor Darrell,Xudong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Chain-of-Visual-Thought (COVT) enables VLMs to reason through continuous visual tokens, improving perceptual understanding and performance across diverse benchmarks by 3-16%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle with dense visual perception tasks like spatial reasoning and geometric awareness due to limited mechanisms for capturing dense visual information across spatial dimensions.

Method: COVT framework uses roughly 20 continuous visual tokens to distill knowledge from lightweight vision experts, capturing 2D appearance, 3D geometry, spatial layout, and edge structure. VLMs are trained to autoregressively predict these tokens to reconstruct dense supervision signals.

Result: Integration of COVT into strong VLMs (Qwen2.5-VL, LLaVA) consistently improves performance by 3% to 16% across more than ten diverse perception benchmarks including CV-Bench, MMVP, RealWorldQA, MMStar, WorldMedQA, and HRBench.

Conclusion: Compact continuous visual thinking enables more precise, grounded, and interpretable multimodal intelligence while preserving efficiency during inference.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at reasoning in linguistic space but struggle with perceptual understanding that requires dense visual perception, e.g., spatial reasoning and geometric awareness. This limitation stems from the fact that current VLMs have limited mechanisms to capture dense visual information across spatial dimensions. We introduce Chain-of-Visual-Thought (COVT), a framework that enables VLMs to reason not only in words but also through continuous visual tokens-compact latent representations that encode rich perceptual cues. Within a small budget of roughly 20 tokens, COVT distills knowledge from lightweight vision experts, capturing complementary properties such as 2D appearance, 3D geometry, spatial layout, and edge structure. During training, the VLM with COVT autoregressively predicts these visual tokens to reconstruct dense supervision signals (e.g., depth, segmentation, edges, and DINO features). At inference, the model reasons directly in the continuous visual token space, preserving efficiency while optionally decoding dense predictions for interpretability. Evaluated across more than ten diverse perception benchmarks, including CV-Bench, MMVP, RealWorldQA, MMStar, WorldMedQA, and HRBench, integrating COVT into strong VLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL and LLaVA consistently improves performance by 3% to 16% and demonstrates that compact continuous visual thinking enables more precise, grounded, and interpretable multimodal intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous SAM generations struggle with fine-grained, low-level segmentation tasks such as camouflaged object detection, medical image segmentation, and shadow detection. The emergence of SAM3's improved architecture and training pipeline provides an opportunity to address these limitations.

Method: Developed SAM3-Adapter, an adapter framework specifically designed for SAM3 that reduces computational overhead while enhancing segmentation capability. Built on the modular design philosophy of the original SAM-Adapter.

Result: SAM3-Adapter consistently surpasses both SAM and SAM2-based solutions, establishing new state-of-the-art results across multiple downstream tasks including medical imaging, camouflaged object segmentation, and shadow detection. It provides stronger generalizability, richer task adaptability, and significantly improved segmentation precision.

Conclusion: Integrating SAM3 with the proposed adapter yields superior accuracy, robustness, and efficiency compared to all prior SAM-based adaptations. SAM3-Adapter serves as a foundation for future research and practical segmentation applications.

Abstract: The rapid rise of large-scale foundation models has reshaped the landscape of image segmentation, with models such as Segment Anything achieving unprecedented versatility across diverse vision tasks. However, previous generations-including SAM and its successor-still struggle with fine-grained, low-level segmentation challenges such as camouflaged object detection, medical image segmentation, cell image segmentation, and shadow detection. To address these limitations, we originally proposed SAM-Adapter in 2023, demonstrating substantial gains on these difficult scenarios. With the emergence of Segment Anything 3 (SAM3)-a more efficient and higher-performing evolution with a redesigned architecture and improved training pipeline-we revisit these long-standing challenges. In this work, we present SAM3-Adapter, the first adapter framework tailored for SAM3 that unlocks its full segmentation capability. SAM3-Adapter not only reduces computational overhead but also consistently surpasses both SAM and SAM2-based solutions, establishing new state-of-the-art results across multiple downstream tasks, including medical imaging, camouflaged (concealed) object segmentation, and shadow detection. Built upon the modular and composable design philosophy of the original SAM-Adapter, SAM3-Adapter provides stronger generalizability, richer task adaptability, and significantly improved segmentation precision. Extensive experiments confirm that integrating SAM3 with our adapter yields superior accuracy, robustness, and efficiency compared to all prior SAM-based adaptations. We hope SAM3-Adapter can serve as a foundation for future research and practical segmentation applications. Code, pre-trained models, and data processing pipelines are available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM3D lacks the ability to reconstruct objects based on textual descriptions, which limits its practical applications in 3D editing, game development, and virtual environments where text guidance is essential.

Method: Extends SAM3D by incorporating textual descriptions as a high-level prior, enabling text-guided 3D reconstruction from a single RGB image using natural language input.

Result: Ref-SAM3D delivers competitive and high-fidelity zero-shot reconstruction performance, effectively bridging 2D visual cues with 3D geometric understanding using only natural language and a single 2D view.

Conclusion: Ref-SAM3D offers a more flexible and accessible paradigm for reference-guided 3D reconstruction, addressing the key limitation of SAM3D while maintaining strong reconstruction capabilities.

Abstract: SAM3D has garnered widespread attention for its strong 3D object reconstruction capabilities. However, a key limitation remains: SAM3D cannot reconstruct specific objects referred to by textual descriptions, a capability that is essential for practical applications such as 3D editing, game development, and virtual environments. To address this gap, we introduce Ref-SAM3D, a simple yet effective extension to SAM3D that incorporates textual descriptions as a high-level prior, enabling text-guided 3D reconstruction from a single RGB image. Through extensive qualitative experiments, we show that Ref-SAM3D, guided only by natural language and a single 2D view, delivers competitive and high-fidelity zero-shot reconstruction performance.

Method: Proposed ORS3D-60K dataset with 60K composite tasks across 4K scenes, and GRANT model with scheduling token mechanism for efficient task schedules and grounded actions.

Result: Extensive experiments validate GRANT's effectiveness across language understanding, 3D grounding, and scheduling efficiency on ORS3D-60K.

Conclusion: ORS3D enables embodied AI to leverage OR knowledge for efficient task scheduling in 3D environments, with GRANT demonstrating strong performance on this challenging task.

Abstract: Task scheduling is critical for embodied AI, enabling agents to follow natural language instructions and execute actions efficiently in 3D physical worlds. However, existing datasets often simplify task planning by ignoring operations research (OR) knowledge and 3D spatial grounding. In this work, we propose Operations Research knowledge-based 3D Grounded Task Scheduling (ORS3D), a new task that requires the synergy of language understanding, 3D grounding, and efficiency optimization. Unlike prior settings, ORS3D demands that agents minimize total completion time by leveraging parallelizable subtasks, e.g., cleaning the sink while the microwave operates. To facilitate research on ORS3D, we construct ORS3D-60K, a large-scale dataset comprising 60K composite tasks across 4K real-world scenes. Furthermore, we propose GRANT, an embodied multi-modal large language model equipped with a simple yet effective scheduling token mechanism to generate efficient task schedules and grounded actions. Extensive experiments on ORS3D-60K validate the effectiveness of GRANT across language understanding, 3D grounding, and scheduling efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current global weather models operate at kilometer-scale resolution, making it difficult to model individual clouds and extreme weather phenomena. High-resolution real-world observations are needed but challenging to obtain with current instruments.

Method: Uses synchronized ground-based cameras and a homography-guided 2D-to-3D transformer to infer the full 3D distribution of liquid water content. Tracks 3D liquid water content over time to estimate horizontal wind vectors.

Result: Achieves an order-of-magnitude improvement in space-time resolution compared to state-of-the-art satellite measurements, with single-digit relative error (<10%) against collocated radar measurements across a two-month deployment with six cameras.

Conclusion: Cloud4D provides the first physically consistent 4D cloud state reconstruction framework using only ground-based cameras, enabling high-resolution cloud modeling that was previously unavailable.

Abstract: There has been great progress in improving numerical weather prediction and climate models using machine learning. However, most global models act at a kilometer-scale, making it challenging to model individual clouds and factors such as extreme precipitation, wind gusts, turbulence, and surface irradiance. Therefore, there is a need to move towards higher-resolution models, which in turn require high-resolution real-world observations that current instruments struggle to obtain. We present Cloud4D, the first learning-based framework that reconstructs a physically consistent, four-dimensional cloud state using only synchronized ground-based cameras. Leveraging a homography-guided 2D-to-3D transformer, Cloud4D infers the full 3D distribution of liquid water content at 25 m spatial and 5 s temporal resolution. By tracking the 3D liquid water content retrievals over time, Cloud4D additionally estimates horizontal wind vectors. Across a two-month deployment comprising six skyward cameras, our system delivers an order-of-magnitude improvement in space-time resolution relative to state-of-the-art satellite measurements, while retaining single-digit relative error ($<10\%$) against collocated radar measurements.

TL;DR: A plug-and-play sampling method that combines two pretrained diffusion experts by switching between them during denoising to break the trade-off between perceptual quality and data likelihood.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models face a fundamental trade-off: training for high perceptual quality yields realistic images but poor likelihoods, while likelihood-oriented training harms visual fidelity by overweighting low-noise steps.

Method: Combine two pretrained diffusion experts by applying an image-quality expert at high noise levels to shape global structure, then switching to a likelihood expert at low noise levels to refine pixel statistics. No retraining required - only choosing an intermediate switching step.

Result: On CIFAR-10 and ImageNet32, the merged model consistently matches or outperforms its base components, improving or preserving both likelihood and sample quality relative to each expert alone.

Conclusion: Expert switching across noise levels is an effective way to break the likelihood-quality trade-off in image diffusion models without requiring retraining or fine-tuning.

Abstract: Diffusion models for image generation often exhibit a trade-off between perceptual sample quality and data likelihood: training objectives emphasizing high-noise denoising steps yield realistic images but poor likelihoods, whereas likelihood-oriented training overweights low-noise steps and harms visual fidelity. We introduce a simple plug-and-play sampling method that combines two pretrained diffusion experts by switching between them along the denoising trajectory. Specifically, we apply an image-quality expert at high noise levels to shape global structure, then switch to a likelihood expert at low noise levels to refine pixel statistics. The approach requires no retraining or fine-tuning -- only the choice of an intermediate switching step. On CIFAR-10 and ImageNet32, the merged model consistently matches or outperforms its base components, improving or preserving both likelihood and sample quality relative to each expert alone. These results demonstrate that expert switching across noise levels is an effective way to break the likelihood-quality trade-off in image diffusion models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the underexplored potential of large-scale video diffusion models as zero-shot image editors, addressing key challenges in instruction-driven image editing.

Method: Uses chain-of-thought prompt enhancement, temporal latent dropout strategy for compression, and self-consistent post-refinement for frame sharpening.

Result: Strong performance on reasoning-centric tasks and competitive results on general-purpose edits across four public benchmarks.

Conclusion: Video diffusion models can effectively serve as unified image editors, providing a simple approach for video-image generative reasoning.

Abstract: Large-scale video diffusion models show strong world simulation and temporal reasoning abilities, but their use as zero-shot image editors remains underexplored. We introduce IF-Edit, a tuning-free framework that repurposes pretrained image-to-video diffusion models for instruction-driven image editing. IF-Edit addresses three key challenges: prompt misalignment, redundant temporal latents, and blurry late-stage frames. It includes (1) a chain-of-thought prompt enhancement module that transforms static editing instructions into temporally grounded reasoning prompts; (2) a temporal latent dropout strategy that compresses frame latents after the expert-switch point, accelerating denoising while preserving semantic and temporal coherence; and (3) a self-consistent post-refinement step that sharpens late-stage frames using a short still-video trajectory. Experiments on four public benchmarks, covering non-rigid editing, physical and temporal reasoning, and general instruction edits, show that IF-Edit performs strongly on reasoning-centric tasks while remaining competitive on general-purpose edits. Our study provides a systematic view of video diffusion models as image editors and highlights a simple recipe for unified video-image generative reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a video captioning system that doesn't require expensive human annotations or larger teacher models, enabling scalable and cost-effective training.

Method: Uses a closed-loop system with caption generation, principle-guided scoring, prompt refinement, and self-reflection. Converts trajectories into preference tuples for curriculum direct preference optimization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on VDC benchmark with 49.08% average accuracy and 2.50 score, improving base model by +5.13% accuracy and +0.27 score.

Conclusion: The self-evolving framework successfully creates high-quality training data automatically and achieves superior video captioning performance without human supervision.

Abstract: We present VDC-Agent, a self-evolving framework for Video Detailed Captioning that requires neither human annotations nor larger teacher models. The agent forms a closed loop of caption generation, principle-guided scoring (score and textual suggestions), and prompt refinement. When caption quality regresses, a self-reflection path leverages the previous chain-of-thought to amend the update. Running this process on unlabeled videos produces trajectories of (caption, score) pairs. We convert the trajectories into preference tuples and filter out samples with JSON parsing errors, resulting in VDC-Agent-19K, which contains 18,886 automatically constructed pairs. We then fine-tune the base MLLM on this dataset using an easy-to-hard curriculum direct preference optimization. Built on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, our VDC-Agent-7B attains state-of-the-art performance on the VDC benchmark with 49.08% average accuracy and 2.50 score, surpassing specialized video captioners and improving over the base model by +5.13% accuracy and +0.27 score at similar inference cost.

Motivation: Existing PBR texture generation methods fail to handle materials decomposition from image prompts with limited illumination cues and cannot achieve seamless, view-consistent texture completion.

Method: Uses three key components: multi-branch generation for albedo/metallic-roughness disentanglement, lighting-aware material attention for physically grounded generation, and geometry-guided inpainting for seamless UV completion.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in texture quality, surpassing both existing open-source and commercial methods.

Conclusion: LumiTex provides a comprehensive solution for high-quality PBR texture generation with robust material understanding and seamless completion capabilities.

Abstract: Physically-based rendering (PBR) provides a principled standard for realistic material-lighting interactions in computer graphics. Despite recent advances in generating PBR textures, existing methods fail to address two fundamental challenges: 1) materials decomposition from image prompts under limited illumination cues, and 2) seamless and view-consistent texture completion. To this end, we propose LumiTex, an end-to-end framework that comprises three key components: (1) a multi-branch generation scheme that disentangles albedo and metallic-roughness under shared illumination priors for robust material understanding, (2) a lighting-aware material attention mechanism that injects illumination context into the decoding process for physically grounded generation of albedo, metallic, and roughness maps, and (3) a geometry-guided inpainting module based on a large view synthesis model that enriches texture coverage and ensures seamless, view-consistent UV completion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LumiTex achieves state-of-the-art performance in texture quality, surpassing both existing open-source and commercial methods.
