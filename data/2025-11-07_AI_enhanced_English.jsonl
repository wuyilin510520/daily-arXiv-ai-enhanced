Building on the recent\nsuccess of autoregressive modeling in both vision and language, our purely\ndiscrete approach jointly captures spatial and temporal dependencies within a\nsingle architecture. This unified design naturally supports a variety of\ngeneration tasks such as text-to-image, text-to-video, image-to-video, and long\ninteractive video synthesis via straightforward temporal autoregression.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that InfinityStar scores 83.74 on VBench,\noutperforming all autoregressive models by large margins, even surpassing some\ndiffusion competitors like HunyuanVideo. Without extra optimizations, our model\ngenerates a 5s, 720p video approximately 10x faster than leading\ndiffusion-based methods.
