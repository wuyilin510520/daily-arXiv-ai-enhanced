This paper investigates the temporal awareness of VLMs, assessing their\nability to position visual content in time. We introduce TIME10k, a benchmark\ndataset of over 10,000 images with temporal ground truth, and evaluate the\ntime-awareness of 37 VLMs by a novel methodology. Our investigation reveals\nthat temporal information is structured along a low-dimensional, non-linear\nmanifold in the VLM embedding space. Based on this insight, we propose methods\nto derive an explicit ``timeline'' representation from the embedding space.\nThese representations model time and its chronological progression and thereby\nfacilitate temporal reasoning tasks. Our timeline approaches achieve\ncompetitive to superior accuracy compared to a prompt-based baseline while\nbeing computationally efficient.

This paper\ncontributes a novel, quantitative analysis of existing metrics in terms of\ntheir sensitivity to various types of perturbations of ground truth,\nemphasizing comparison to human judgment. Our analysis reveals that existing\nmetrics are severely under-sensitive to curvature perturbation such as making\nflat surfaces wavy. To remedy this, we introduce a new metric based on relative\nsurface normals, along with new depth visualization tools and a principled\nmethod to create composite metrics with better human alignment.
