*Ming Yang,Dongrun Li,Xin Wang,Feng Li,Lisheng Fan,Chunxiao Wang,Xiaoming Wu,Peng Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedeCouple is a federated learning method that balances global generalization and local adaptability through fine-grained feature representation learning and dynamic knowledge distillation, achieving superior performance in privacy-preserving scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing personalized federated learning methods focus on feature space consistency and classification personalization but neglect local extractor adaptability and global classifier generalization, leading to poor component coordination and degraded performance.

Method: Jointly learns global and local feature representations, uses dynamic knowledge distillation for classifier generalization, and introduces anchors with strict locality and non-transmission for privacy preservation and reduced communication overhead.

Result: Outperforms nine baseline methods on five image-classification datasets with 4.3% improvement over the best baseline, demonstrating effectiveness, stability, scalability, and security.

Conclusion: FedeCouple successfully addresses the coordination problem between feature extractors and classifiers in federated learning, providing theoretical convergence guarantees and practical performance improvements while maintaining privacy.

Abstract: In privacy-preserving mobile network transmission scenarios with heterogeneous client data, personalized federated learning methods that decouple feature extractors and classifiers have demonstrated notable advantages in enhancing learning capability. However, many existing approaches primarily focus on feature space consistency and classification personalization during local training, often neglecting the local adaptability of the extractor and the global generalization of the classifier. This oversight results in insufficient coordination and weak coupling between the components, ultimately degrading the overall model performance. To address this challenge, we propose FedeCouple, a federated learning method that balances global generalization and local adaptability at a fine-grained level. Our approach jointly learns global and local feature representations while employing dynamic knowledge distillation to enhance the generalization of personalized classifiers. We further introduce anchors to refine the feature space; their strict locality and non-transmission inherently preserve privacy and reduce communication overhead. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis proving that FedeCouple converges for nonconvex objectives, with iterates approaching a stationary point as the number of communication rounds increases. Extensive experiments conducted on five image-classification datasets demonstrate that FedeCouple consistently outperforms nine baseline methods in effectiveness, stability, scalability, and security. Notably, in experiments evaluating effectiveness, FedeCouple surpasses the best baseline by a significant margin of 4.3%.

*Ye Tian,Ling Yang,Jiongfan Yang,Anran Wang,Yu Tian,Jiani Zheng,Haochen Wang,Zhiyang Teng,Zhuochen Wang,Yinjie Wang,Yunhai Tong,Mengdi Wang,Xiangtai Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes MMaDA-Parallel, a parallel multimodal diffusion framework that addresses error propagation in thinking-aware generation by enabling continuous bidirectional interaction between text and images, achieving 6.9% improvement in output alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sequential, autoregressive approaches for thinking-aware generation can paradoxically degrade performance due to error propagation, particularly poor alignment between generated reasoning and final images.

Method: Proposes MMaDA-Parallel framework with parallel multimodal diffusion enabling continuous bidirectional text-image interaction, trained with supervised finetuning and optimized via Parallel Reinforcement Learning (ParaRL) with semantic rewards for cross-modal consistency.

Result: Achieves 6.9% improvement in Output Alignment on ParaBench benchmark compared to state-of-the-art Bagel model, significantly improving cross-modal alignment and semantic consistency.

Conclusion: Establishes a more robust paradigm for thinking-aware image synthesis by addressing error propagation through parallel multimodal interaction and trajectory-based reinforcement learning.

Abstract: While thinking-aware generation aims to improve performance on complex tasks, we identify a critical failure mode where existing sequential, autoregressive approaches can paradoxically degrade performance due to error propagation. To systematically analyze this issue, we propose ParaBench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate both text and image output modalities. Our analysis using ParaBench reveals that this performance degradation is strongly correlated with poor alignment between the generated reasoning and the final image. To resolve this, we propose a parallel multimodal diffusion framework, MMaDA-Parallel, that enables continuous, bidirectional interaction between text and images throughout the entire denoising trajectory. MMaDA-Parallel is trained with supervised finetuning and then further optimized by Parallel Reinforcement Learning (ParaRL), a novel strategy that applies semantic rewards along the trajectory to enforce cross-modal consistency. Experiments validate that our model significantly improves cross-modal alignment and semantic consistency, achieving a 6.9\% improvement in Output Alignment on ParaBench compared to the state-of-the-art model, Bagel, establishing a more robust paradigm for thinking-aware image synthesis.

TL;DR: PriVi is a large-scale primate-centric video dataset for pretraining computer vision models, enabling better generalization and data efficiency in primate behavior analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing computer vision methods for primate behavior analysis rely on human-centric models and focus on single datasets, limiting generalization across different primate species and settings.

Method: Created PriVi dataset with 424 hours of curated primate videos from 11 research settings and web sources, pretrained V-JEPA model on this data, and evaluated with lightweight frozen classifier across four benchmark datasets.

Result: Outperformed prior work including fully finetuned baselines across ChimpACT, BaboonLand, PanAf500, and ChimpBehave datasets, with better scaling using fewer labels.

Conclusion: Primate-centric pretraining substantially improves data efficiency and generalization, making it promising for low-label applications in primate behavior research.

Abstract: Non-human primates are our closest living relatives, and analyzing their behavior is central to research in cognition, evolution, and conservation. Computer vision could greatly aid this research, but existing methods often rely on human-centric pretrained models and focus on single datasets, which limits generalization. We address this limitation by shifting from a model-centric to a data-centric approach and introduce PriVi, a large-scale primate-centric video pretraining dataset. PriVi contains 424 hours of curated video, combining 174 hours from behavioral research across 11 settings with 250 hours of diverse web-sourced footage, assembled through a scalable data curation pipeline. We pretrain V-JEPA on PriVi to learn primate-specific representations and evaluate it using a lightweight frozen classifier. Across four benchmark datasets, ChimpACT, BaboonLand, PanAf500, and ChimpBehave, our approach consistently outperforms prior work, including fully finetuned baselines, and scales favorably with fewer labels. These results demonstrate that primate-centric pretraining substantially improves data efficiency and generalization, making it a promising approach for low-label applications. Code, models, and the majority of the dataset will be made available.

*Katie Matton,Purvaja Balaji,Hamzeh Ghasemzadeh,Jameson C. Cooper,Daryush D. Mehta,Jarrad H. Van Stan,Robert E. Hillman,Rosalind Picard,John Guttag,S. Mazdak Abulnaga*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First automated method for classifying phonotrauma severity from vocal fold images using ordinal regression with soft labels to handle annotator uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current phonotrauma severity assessment relies on costly clinician judgment with variable reliability, limiting large-scale studies and consistent patient care.

Method: Proposed soft ordinal regression framework that modifies ordinal regression loss functions to operate on soft labels representing annotator rating distributions.

Result: Achieved predictive performance approaching clinical experts with well-calibrated uncertainty estimates for phonotrauma severity classification.

Conclusion: Automated phonotrauma severity assessment enables large-scale studies, improved clinical understanding, and better patient care.

Abstract: Phonotrauma refers to vocal fold tissue damage resulting from exposure to forces during voicing. It occurs on a continuum from mild to severe, and treatment options can vary based on severity. Assessment of severity involves a clinician's expert judgment, which is costly and can vary widely in reliability. In this work, we present the first method for automatically classifying phonotrauma severity from vocal fold images. To account for the ordinal nature of the labels, we adopt a widely used ordinal regression framework. To account for label uncertainty, we propose a novel modification to ordinal regression loss functions that enables them to operate on soft labels reflecting annotator rating distributions. Our proposed soft ordinal regression method achieves predictive performance approaching that of clinical experts, while producing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. By providing an automated tool for phonotrauma severity assessment, our work can enable large-scale studies of phonotrauma, ultimately leading to improved clinical understanding and patient care.

*Arman Zarei,Samyadeep Basu,Mobina Pournemat,Sayan Nag,Ryan Rossi,Soheil Feizi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SliderEdit enables continuous, fine-grained control over individual instructions in multi-instruction image editing by exposing each instruction as an adjustable slider, allowing users to precisely control edit strength.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current instruction-based image editing models apply each instruction with fixed strength, limiting users' ability to precisely control the intensity of individual edits in multi-instruction prompts.

Method: Disentangles individual instructions from multi-part prompts and exposes each as a globally trained slider using a single set of low-rank adaptation matrices that generalize across diverse edits, attributes, and compositional instructions.

Result: Applied to state-of-the-art models like FLUX-Kontext and Qwen-Image-Edit, showing substantial improvements in edit controllability, visual consistency, and user steerability with continuous interpolation along individual edit dimensions.

Conclusion: First framework for continuous, fine-grained instruction control in instruction-based image editing, paving the way for interactive, instruction-driven image manipulation with continuous and compositional control.

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing models have recently achieved impressive performance, enabling complex edits to an input image from a multi-instruction prompt. However, these models apply each instruction in the prompt with a fixed strength, limiting the user's ability to precisely and continuously control the intensity of individual edits. We introduce SliderEdit, a framework for continuous image editing with fine-grained, interpretable instruction control. Given a multi-part edit instruction, SliderEdit disentangles the individual instructions and exposes each as a globally trained slider, allowing smooth adjustment of its strength. Unlike prior works that introduced slider-based attribute controls in text-to-image generation, typically requiring separate training or fine-tuning for each attribute or concept, our method learns a single set of low-rank adaptation matrices that generalize across diverse edits, attributes, and compositional instructions. This enables continuous interpolation along individual edit dimensions while preserving both spatial locality and global semantic consistency. We apply SliderEdit to state-of-the-art image editing models, including FLUX-Kontext and Qwen-Image-Edit, and observe substantial improvements in edit controllability, visual consistency, and user steerability. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore and propose a framework for continuous, fine-grained instruction control in instruction-based image editing models. Our results pave the way for interactive, instruction-driven image manipulation with continuous and compositional control.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address temporal challenges in video-based crowd analysis and provide scalable real-time monitoring for applications like public safety and event management.

Method: Integrates denoising probabilistic model with diffusion processes, uses narrow Gaussian kernels for multiple density maps, incorporates regression branch for feature extraction, and employs event-driven sampling with Farneback optical flow to selectively capture frames with significant crowd movements.

Result: Model effectively captures crowd dynamics in both dense and sparse settings, reduces computational load and storage while maintaining essential crowd events, as validated through qualitative evaluations and MAE metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully adapts image-based crowd density estimation to video scenarios, offering an efficient and scalable solution for real-time crowd monitoring applications.

Abstract: This study enhances a crowd density estimation algorithm originally designed for image-based analysis by adapting it for video-based scenarios. The proposed method integrates a denoising probabilistic model that utilizes diffusion processes to generate high-quality crowd density maps. To improve accuracy, narrow Gaussian kernels are employed, and multiple density map outputs are generated. A regression branch is incorporated into the model for precise feature extraction, while a consolidation mechanism combines these maps based on similarity scores to produce a robust final result. An event-driven sampling technique, utilizing the Farneback optical flow algorithm, is introduced to selectively capture frames showing significant crowd movements, reducing computational load and storage by focusing on critical crowd dynamics. Through qualitative and quantitative evaluations, including overlay plots and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), the model demonstrates its ability to effectively capture crowd dynamics in both dense and sparse settings. The efficiency of the sampling method is further assessed, showcasing its capability to decrease frame counts while maintaining essential crowd events. By addressing the temporal challenges unique to video analysis, this work offers a scalable and efficient framework for real-time crowd monitoring in applications such as public safety, disaster response, and event management.

*Yunqian Cheng,Benjamin Princen,Roberto Manduchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PALMS+ is an improved vision-based indoor localization system that uses monocular depth estimation and geometric layout matching to achieve accurate infrastructure-free localization without training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-based indoor localization methods like PALMS have limitations due to short-range smartphone LiDAR and ambiguity in indoor layouts, which need to be addressed for better emergency response and assistive navigation applications.

Method: PALMS+ reconstructs scale-aligned 3D point clouds from posed RGB images using Depth Pro foundation model, then performs geometric layout matching via convolution with floor plans to output location and orientation posteriors.

Result: PALMS+ outperformed PALMS and F3Loc in stationary localization on Structured3D and campus datasets, and achieved lower errors in sequential localization with particle filtering on 33 real-world trajectories.

Conclusion: PALMS+ demonstrates robust infrastructure-free indoor localization capabilities suitable for camera-free tracking applications, offering improved accuracy without requiring training.

Abstract: Indoor localization in GPS-denied environments is crucial for applications like emergency response and assistive navigation. Vision-based methods such as PALMS enable infrastructure-free localization using only a floor plan and a stationary scan, but are limited by the short range of smartphone LiDAR and ambiguity in indoor layouts. We propose PALMS$+$, a modular, image-based system that addresses these challenges by reconstructing scale-aligned 3D point clouds from posed RGB images using a foundation monocular depth estimation model (Depth Pro), followed by geometric layout matching via convolution with the floor plan. PALMS$+$ outputs a posterior over the location and orientation, usable for direct or sequential localization. Evaluated on the Structured3D and a custom campus dataset consisting of 80 observations across four large campus buildings, PALMS$+$ outperforms PALMS and F3Loc in stationary localization accuracy -- without requiring any training. Furthermore, when integrated with a particle filter for sequential localization on 33 real-world trajectories, PALMS$+$ achieved lower localization errors compared to other methods, demonstrating robustness for camera-free tracking and its potential for infrastructure-free applications.

### [8] [Social LSTM with Dynamic Occupancy Modeling for Realistic Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09735)
*Ahmed Alia,Mohcine Chraibi,Armin Seyfried*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a novel deep learning model that enhances Social LSTM with a Dynamic Occupied Space loss function to improve pedestrian trajectory prediction by reducing collisions without increasing displacement error across different crowd densities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pedestrian trajectory prediction models treat pedestrians as point entities, ignoring the physical space each person occupies, leading to unrealistic collisions in crowded environments.

Method: Enhanced Social LSTM with a new Dynamic Occupied Space loss function that combines average displacement error with a collision penalty sensitive to scene density and individual spatial occupancy.

Result: Achieved up to 31% reduction in collision rate and reduced average displacement error by 5% and final displacement error by 6% on average across all datasets compared to baseline, outperforming state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively reduces collisions while maintaining or improving trajectory prediction accuracy across various crowd densities, demonstrating the importance of considering physical occupancy space in pedestrian trajectory prediction.

Abstract: In dynamic and crowded environments, realistic pedestrian trajectory prediction remains a challenging task due to the complex nature of human motion and the mutual influences among individuals. Deep learning models have recently achieved promising results by implicitly learning such patterns from 2D trajectory data. However, most approaches treat pedestrians as point entities, ignoring the physical space that each person occupies. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel deep learning model that enhances the Social LSTM with a new Dynamic Occupied Space loss function. This loss function guides Social LSTM in learning to avoid realistic collisions without increasing displacement error across different crowd densities, ranging from low to high, in both homogeneous and heterogeneous density settings. Such a function achieves this by combining the average displacement error with a new collision penalty that is sensitive to scene density and individual spatial occupancy. For efficient training and evaluation, five datasets were generated from real pedestrian trajectories recorded during the Festival of Lights in Lyon 2022. Four datasets represent homogeneous crowd conditions -- low, medium, high, and very high density -- while the fifth corresponds to a heterogeneous density distribution. The experimental findings indicate that the proposed model not only lowers collision rates but also enhances displacement prediction accuracy in each dataset. Specifically, the model achieves up to a 31% reduction in the collision rate and reduces the average displacement error and the final displacement error by 5% and 6%, respectively, on average across all datasets compared to the baseline. Moreover, the proposed model consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art deep learning models across most test sets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Soiling detection is crucial for robust advanced driver assistance systems to handle external conditions like weather and dust, but existing datasets have issues with data leakage and imprecise annotations.

Method: Treat soiling detection as semantic segmentation problem, compare popular segmentation methods against tile-level classification approaches, analyze Woodscape dataset issues, and create new cleaned data subset.

Result: Segmentation methods show superior performance over classification approaches. The new smaller dataset subset enables comparable results in much shorter training time despite being smaller.

Conclusion: Semantic segmentation is effective for soiling detection, and addressing dataset issues with a carefully curated smaller subset can achieve comparable performance more efficiently.

Abstract: Soiling detection for automotive cameras is a crucial part of advanced driver assistance systems to make them more robust to external conditions like weather, dust, etc. In this paper, we regard the soiling detection as a semantic segmentation problem. We provide a comprehensive comparison of popular segmentation methods and show their superiority in performance while comparing them to tile-level classification approaches. Moreover, we present an extensive analysis of the Woodscape dataset showing that the original dataset contains a data-leakage and imprecise annotations. To address these problems, we create a new data subset, which, despite being much smaller, provides enough information for the segmentation method to reach comparable results in a much shorter time.

TL;DR: Medical foundation models outperform general-domain ones for chest X-ray analysis, but pre-trained features are not universally effective - especially for complex segmentation tasks where supervised models remain competitive.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how pre-training domain (medical vs. general), paradigm, and architecture influence embedding quality for radiology tasks, enabling better selection of optimal encoders.

Method: Evaluated vision encoders from eight medical and general-domain foundation models for chest X-ray analysis using linear probing and fine-tuning on classification (pneumothorax, cardiomegaly) and segmentation (pneumothorax, cardiac boundary) tasks.

Result: Medical FMs consistently outperformed general-domain models in linear probing, showing superior initial feature quality. However, all FMs performed poorly for segmenting complex pathologies without significant fine-tuning. Text-image alignment was not essential, with image-only and label-supervised FMs among top performers. Supervised baseline remained highly competitive on segmentation.

Conclusion: Medical pre-training is beneficial but not universally effective; architectural choices are critical, and pre-trained features struggle with complex localization tasks where supervised models remain a strong alternative.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) promise to generalize medical imaging, but their effectiveness varies. It remains unclear how pre-training domain (medical vs. general), paradigm (e.g., text-guided), and architecture influence embedding quality, hindering the selection of optimal encoders for specific radiology tasks. To address this, we evaluate vision encoders from eight medical and general-domain FMs for chest X-ray analysis. We benchmark classification (pneumothorax, cardiomegaly) and segmentation (pneumothorax, cardiac boundary) using linear probing and fine-tuning. Our results show that domain-specific pre-training provides a significant advantage; medical FMs consistently outperformed general-domain models in linear probing, establishing superior initial feature quality. However, feature utility is highly task-dependent. Pre-trained embeddings were strong for global classification and segmenting salient anatomy (e.g., heart). In contrast, for segmenting complex, subtle pathologies (e.g., pneumothorax), all FMs performed poorly without significant fine-tuning, revealing a critical gap in localizing subtle disease. Subgroup analysis showed FMs use confounding shortcuts (e.g., chest tubes for pneumothorax) for classification, a strategy that fails for precise segmentation. We also found that expensive text-image alignment is not a prerequisite; image-only (RAD-DINO) and label-supervised (Ark+) FMs were among top performers. Notably, a supervised, end-to-end baseline remained highly competitive, matching or exceeding the best FMs on segmentation tasks. These findings show that while medical pre-training is beneficial, architectural choices (e.g., multi-scale) are critical, and pre-trained features are not universally effective, especially for complex localization tasks where supervised models remain a strong alternative.

### [11] [Gradient-Guided Exploration of Generative Model's Latent Space for Controlled Iris Image Augmentations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09749)
*Mahsa Mitcheff,Siamul Karim Khan,Adam Czajka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new iris image augmentation method that manipulates specific attributes while preserving identity by traversing a generative model's latent space guided by differentiable feature gradients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for diverse iris datasets with realistic variations and controlled attributes for reliable iris recognition and presentation attack detection, given the challenge of synthesizing same-identity iris images with rich texture spanning wide spatial frequencies.

Method: Latent space traversal guided by gradients of specific iris features (sharpness, pupil size, iris size, pupil-to-iris ratio) using either GAN-generated or real iris images via GAN inversion, with differentiable loss terms for attribute manipulation.

Result: The approach enables controlled manipulation of iris image properties while maintaining identity consistency, and can be extended to any attribute with differentiable loss formulation.

Conclusion: Proposed method provides flexible iris image augmentation that preserves identity while allowing controlled attribute manipulation, applicable to both synthetic and real iris images through GAN inversion.

Abstract: Developing reliable iris recognition and presentation attack detection methods requires diverse datasets that capture realistic variations in iris features and a wide spectrum of anomalies. Because of the rich texture of iris images, which spans a wide range of spatial frequencies, synthesizing same-identity iris images while controlling specific attributes remains challenging. In this work, we introduce a new iris image augmentation strategy by traversing a generative model's latent space toward latent codes that represent same-identity samples but with some desired iris image properties manipulated. The latent space traversal is guided by a gradient of specific geometrical, textural, or quality-related iris image features (e.g., sharpness, pupil size, iris size, or pupil-to-iris ratio) and preserves the identity represented by the image being manipulated. The proposed approach can be easily extended to manipulate any attribute for which a differentiable loss term can be formulated. Additionally, our approach can use either randomly generated images using either a pre-train GAN model or real-world iris images. We can utilize GAN inversion to project any given iris image into the latent space and obtain its corresponding latent code.

TL;DR: STORM is an annotation-free real-time 6D pose estimation system that combines vision-language understanding with self-supervised feature matching to track objects without manual segmentation masks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 6D pose estimation methods require labor-intensive manual annotation of segmentation masks in the first frame, which reduces performance under occlusions or rapid movement.

Method: Three-stage pipeline: contextual object descriptions guide localization, self-cross-attention identifies candidate regions, and segmentation produces precise masks. Includes automatic re-registration that detects tracking failures through feature similarity monitoring.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on challenging industrial datasets with multi-object occlusions, high-speed motion, and varying illumination, while operating at real-time speeds without additional training.

Conclusion: STORM's annotation-free approach significantly reduces deployment overhead, providing a practical solution for flexible manufacturing and intelligent quality control applications.

Abstract: Accurate 6D pose estimation and tracking are fundamental capabilities for physical AI systems such as robots. However, existing approaches typically rely on a manually annotated segmentation mask of the target in the first frame, which is labor-intensive and leads to reduced performance when faced with occlusions or rapid movement. To address these limi- tations, we propose STORM (Segment, Track, and Object Re-localization from a single 3D Model), an open-source robust real-time 6D pose estimation system that requires no manual annotation. STORM employs a novel three-stage pipeline combining vision-language understanding with self-supervised feature matching: contextual object descriptions guide localization, self-cross-attention mechanisms identify candidate regions, and a segmentation model produces precise masks for accurate pose estimation. Another key innovation is our automatic re-registration mechanism that detects tracking failures through feature similarity monitoring and recovers from severe occlusions or rapid motion. STORM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on challenging industrial datasets featuring multi-object occlusions, high-speed motion, and varying illumination, while operating at real-time speeds without additional training. This annotation-free approach significantly reduces deployment overhead, providing a practical solution for modern applications, such as flexible manufacturing and intelligent quality control.

*Siddeshwar Raghavan,Jiangpeng He,Fengqing Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PANDA is a Patch-and-Distribution-Aware Augmentation framework that addresses dual-level imbalances in real-world data streams for Exemplar-Free Continual Learning, improving accuracy and reducing catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world data streams exhibit dual-level imbalances - dataset-level distributions combined with extreme/reversed skews within individual tasks, creating both intra-task and inter-task disparities that hinder effective learning and generalization in Exemplar-Free Continual Learning.

Method: PANDA amplifies low-frequency classes using CLIP encoder to identify representative regions and transplant them into frequent-class samples within each task. It also incorporates adaptive balancing strategy leveraging prior task distributions to smooth inter-task imbalances.

Result: Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate PANDA's capability to work with existing PTM-based CL methods, improving accuracy and reducing catastrophic forgetting.

Conclusion: PANDA effectively addresses dual-level imbalances in real-world data streams for Exemplar-Free Continual Learning, enabling fairer learning with frozen pre-trained models and enhancing overall performance.

Abstract: Exemplar-Free Continual Learning (EFCL) restricts the storage of previous task data and is highly susceptible to catastrophic forgetting. While pre-trained models (PTMs) are increasingly leveraged for EFCL, existing methods often overlook the inherent imbalance of real-world data distributions. We discovered that real-world data streams commonly exhibit dual-level imbalances, dataset-level distributions combined with extreme or reversed skews within individual tasks, creating both intra-task and inter-task disparities that hinder effective learning and generalization. To address these challenges, we propose PANDA, a Patch-and-Distribution-Aware Augmentation framework that integrates seamlessly with existing PTM-based EFCL methods. PANDA amplifies low-frequency classes by using a CLIP encoder to identify representative regions and transplanting those into frequent-class samples within each task. Furthermore, PANDA incorporates an adaptive balancing strategy that leverages prior task distributions to smooth inter-task imbalances, reducing the overall gap between average samples across tasks and enabling fairer learning with frozen PTMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate PANDA's capability to work with existing PTM-based CL methods, improving accuracy and reducing catastrophic forgetting.

### [14] [Test-Time Spectrum-Aware Latent Steering for Zero-Shot Generalization in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09809)
*Konstantinos M. Dafnis,Dimitris N. Metaxas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STS is a lightweight test-time adaptation method that steers VLM representations using spectral subspaces without backpropagation, achieving faster inference with minimal parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time adaptation methods for VLMs require backpropagation through large encoders or alter core components, making them computationally expensive and impractical for real-time applications.

Method: Extracts spectral subspace from textual embeddings to define principal semantic directions, learns per-sample shift parameters to minimize entropy across augmented views, operates entirely in latent space without backpropagation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods with 8x faster inference, 12x smaller memory footprint, and only a handful of additional parameters.

Conclusion: STS provides an efficient and effective test-time adaptation framework that maintains performance while significantly reducing computational overhead.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at zero-shot inference but often degrade under test-time domain shifts. For this reason, episodic test-time adaptation strategies have recently emerged as powerful techniques for adapting VLMs to a single unlabeled image. However, existing adaptation strategies, such as test-time prompt tuning, typically require backpropagating through large encoder weights or altering core model components. In this work, we introduce Spectrum-Aware Test-Time Steering (STS), a lightweight adaptation framework that extracts a spectral subspace from the textual embeddings to define principal semantic directions and learns to steer latent representations in a spectrum-aware manner by adapting a small number of per-sample shift parameters to minimize entropy across augmented views. STS operates entirely at inference in the latent space, without backpropagation through or modification of the frozen encoders. Building on standard evaluation protocols, our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that STS largely surpasses or compares favorably against state-of-the-art test-time adaptation methods, while introducing only a handful of additional parameters and achieving inference speeds up to 8x faster with a 12x smaller memory footprint than conventional test-time prompt tuning.

TL;DR: Lumos3D is a generalizable pose-free framework for 3D low-light scene restoration that directly reconstructs normal-light 3D Gaussian representations from unposed, low-light multi-view images without per-scene optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D low-light restoration methods depend on precomputed camera poses and scene-specific optimization, which limits scalability to dynamic real-world environments.

Method: Built on a geometry-grounded backbone, Lumos3D uses cross-illumination distillation where a teacher network trained on normal-light data transfers geometric information to the student model, with a dedicated Lumos loss for photometric consistency.

Result: Experiments show Lumos3D achieves high-fidelity 3D scene restoration with accurate geometry and strong generalization to unseen cases, and can also handle over-exposure correction.

Conclusion: Lumos3D provides a scalable, feed-forward solution for 3D low-light scene restoration that eliminates the need for pose estimation and per-scene optimization while maintaining high quality results.

Abstract: Restoring 3D scenes captured under low-light con- ditions remains a fundamental yet challenging problem. Most existing approaches depend on precomputed camera poses and scene-specific optimization, which greatly restricts their scala- bility to dynamic real-world environments. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Lumos3D, a generalizable pose-free framework for 3D low-light scene restoration. Trained once on a single dataset, Lumos3D performs inference in a purely feed- forward manner, directly restoring illumination and structure from unposed, low-light multi-view images without any per- scene training or optimization. Built upon a geometry-grounded backbone, Lumos3D reconstructs a normal-light 3D Gaussian representation that restores illumination while faithfully pre- serving structural details. During training, a cross-illumination distillation scheme is employed, where the teacher network is distilled on normal-light ground truth to transfer accurate geometric information, such as depth, to the student model. A dedicated Lumos loss is further introduced to promote photomet- ric consistency within the reconstructed 3D space. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that Lumos3D achieves high- fidelity low-light 3D scene restoration with accurate geometry and strong generalization to unseen cases. Furthermore, the framework naturally extends to handle over-exposure correction, highlighting its versatility for diverse lighting restoration tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A zero-shot cross-view image retrieval framework that uses pretrained vision encoders and LLMs for street-to-satellite matching without training, outperforming supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cross-view retrieval methods require supervised training on curated datasets and rely on panoramic/UAV images, limiting real-world deployment. Need for training-free approach.

Method: Extracts geographic cues from monocular street-view images via web search and LLM location inference, generates satellite queries via geocoding API, and retrieves matches using DINOv2 with PCA-based whitening feature refinement.

Result: Outperforms prior learning-based approaches on benchmark dataset under zero-shot settings despite no ground-truth supervision or finetuning.

Conclusion: Proposed method enables automatic construction of semantically aligned street-to-satellite datasets, offering scalable and cost-efficient alternative to manual annotation.

Abstract: Cross-view image retrieval, particularly street-to-satellite matching, is a critical task for applications such as autonomous navigation, urban planning, and localization in GPS-denied environments. However, existing approaches often require supervised training on curated datasets and rely on panoramic or UAV-based images, which limits real-world deployment. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective cross-view image retrieval framework that leverages a pretrained vision encoder and a large language model (LLM), requiring no additional training. Given a monocular street-view image, our method extracts geographic cues through web-based image search and LLM-based location inference, generates a satellite query via geocoding API, and retrieves matching tiles using a pretrained vision encoder (e.g., DINOv2) with PCA-based whitening feature refinement. Despite using no ground-truth supervision or finetuning, our proposed method outperforms prior learning-based approaches on the benchmark dataset under zero-shot settings. Moreover, our pipeline enables automatic construction of semantically aligned street-to-satellite datasets, which is offering a scalable and cost-efficient alternative to manual annotation.

*Aymen Mir,Jian Wang,Riza Alp Guler,Chuan Guo,Gerard Pons-Moll,Bing Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework using 3D Gaussian Splatting for animating humans in 3D scenes, enabling geometry-consistent free-viewpoint rendering without requiring paired human-scene data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting achieves state-of-the-art photorealistic novel-view synthesis but remains unexplored for human-scene animation and interaction, unlike traditional mesh or point cloud approaches.

Method: Uses Gaussian-aligned motion module with opacity-based cues and projected Gaussian structures for motion synthesis, plus human-scene Gaussian refinement optimization for realistic contact and navigation.

Result: Successfully evaluated on Scannet++ and SuperSplat scenes with avatars from multi-view capture, enabling geometry-consistent free-viewpoint rendering of edited monocular RGB videos.

Conclusion: Demonstrates 3DGS's unique advantage for monocular video-based human animation with natural human-scene interactions and free-viewpoint rendering capabilities.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for animating humans in 3D scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a neural scene representation that has recently achieved state-of-the-art photorealistic results for novel-view synthesis but remains under-explored for human-scene animation and interaction. Unlike existing animation pipelines that use meshes or point clouds as the underlying 3D representation, our approach introduces the use of 3DGS as the 3D representation to the problem of animating humans in scenes. By representing humans and scenes as Gaussians, our approach allows for geometry-consistent free-viewpoint rendering of humans interacting with 3D scenes. Our key insight is that the rendering can be decoupled from the motion synthesis and each sub-problem can be addressed independently, without the need for paired human-scene data. Central to our method is a Gaussian-aligned motion module that synthesizes motion without explicit scene geometry, using opacity-based cues and projected Gaussian structures to guide human placement and pose alignment. To ensure natural interactions, we further propose a human-scene Gaussian refinement optimization that enforces realistic contact and navigation. We evaluate our approach on scenes from Scannet++ and the SuperSplat library, and on avatars reconstructed from sparse and dense multi-view human capture. Finally, we demonstrate that our framework allows for novel applications such as geometry-consistent free-viewpoint rendering of edited monocular RGB videos with new animated humans, showcasing the unique advantage of 3DGS for monocular video-based human animation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CertMask is a certifiably robust defense against adversarial patch attacks that uses a single round of masking with O(n) complexity, outperforming PatchCleanser's O(n²) approach while improving certified robust accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adversarial patch attacks pose serious risks to real-world vision systems, and existing defenses like PatchCleanser are computationally expensive with O(n²) inference cost.

Method: Constructs a provably sufficient set of binary masks using a mathematically rigorous coverage strategy that ensures each possible patch location is covered at least k times, requiring only single-round masking.

Result: Improves certified robust accuracy by up to +13.4% over PatchCleanser on ImageNet, ImageNette, and CIFAR-10 while maintaining clean accuracy nearly identical to the vanilla model.

Conclusion: CertMask provides an efficient and certifiably robust defense against adversarial patch attacks with strong theoretical guarantees and significantly reduced computational overhead.

Abstract: Adversarial patch attacks inject localized perturbations into images to mislead deep vision models. These attacks can be physically deployed, posing serious risks to real-world applications. In this paper, we propose CertMask, a certifiably robust defense that constructs a provably sufficient set of binary masks to neutralize patch effects with strong theoretical guarantees. While the state-of-the-art approach (PatchCleanser) requires two rounds of masking and incurs $O(n^2)$ inference cost, CertMask performs only a single round of masking with $O(n)$ time complexity, where $n$ is the cardinality of the mask set to cover an input image. Our proposed mask set is computed using a mathematically rigorous coverage strategy that ensures each possible patch location is covered at least $k$ times, providing both efficiency and robustness. We offer a theoretical analysis of the coverage condition and prove its sufficiency for certification. Experiments on ImageNet, ImageNette, and CIFAR-10 show that CertMask improves certified robust accuracy by up to +13.4\% over PatchCleanser, while maintaining clean accuracy nearly identical to the vanilla model.

TL;DR: Adapting a solar physics foundation model to create embeddings for solar wind structure classification using Parker Solar Probe data, demonstrating feasibility of using foundation models for in situ solar wind analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Space weather poses growing risks to satellites and ground infrastructure, with solar wind and coronal mass ejections being major contributors whose variable properties make automated classification challenging.

Method: Adapt a foundation model trained on solar imagery to create embeddings, concatenate with spacecraft position and solar magnetic connectivity encoded via Fourier features, and fine-tune the neural field-based model using Parker Solar Probe measurements for classification.

Result: Overall classification performance is modest, likely due to coarse labeling, class imbalance, and limited transferability of the pretrained model, but demonstrates feasibility of using foundation model embeddings for solar wind tasks.

Conclusion: This proof-of-concept study lays groundwork for future improvements toward more reliable space weather predictions, with code and configuration files publicly available for reproducibility.

Abstract: Space weather at Earth, driven by the solar activity, poses growing risks to satellites around our planet as well as to critical ground-based technological infrastructure. Major space weather contributors are the solar wind and coronal mass ejections whose variable density, speed, temperature, and magnetic field make the automated classification of those structures challenging. In this work, we adapt a foundation model for solar physics, originally trained on Solar Dynamics Observatory imagery, to create embeddings suitable for solar wind structure analysis. These embeddings are concatenated with the spacecraft position and solar magnetic connectivity encoded using Fourier features which generates a neural field-based model. The full deep learning architecture is fine-tuned bridging the gap between remote sensing and in situ observations. Labels are derived from Parker Solar Probe measurements, forming a downstream classification task that maps plasma properties to solar wind structures. Although overall classification performance is modest, likely due to coarse labeling, class imbalance, and limited transferability of the pretrained model, this study demonstrates the feasibility of leveraging foundation model embeddings for in situ solar wind tasks. As a first proof-of-concept, it lays the groundwork for future improvements toward more reliable space weather predictions. The code and configuration files used in this study are publicly available to support reproducibility.

TL;DR: IPCD-Net enables direct decomposition of colored point clouds into albedo and shade components, addressing challenges of non-grid structure and global-light direction through point-wise feature aggregation and multi-view projection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point clouds are widely used in AR and robotics, requiring accurate albedo-shade separation for realistic relighting and texture editing, but face challenges from non-grid structure and lack of global-light consideration.

Method: Proposes IPCD-Net with point-wise feature aggregation for non-grid data processing and Projection-based Luminance Distribution (PLD) with hierarchical feature refinement using multi-view projection to capture global-light direction.

Result: IPCD-Net reduces cast shadows in albedo and enhances color accuracy in shade, demonstrated on synthetic outdoor-scene dataset. Successfully applied to texture editing, relighting, and point-cloud registration.

Conclusion: IPCD-Net effectively addresses point cloud decomposition challenges and shows real-world applicability for various computer vision and graphics tasks.

Abstract: Point clouds are widely used in various fields, including augmented reality (AR) and robotics, where relighting and texture editing are crucial for realistic visualization. Achieving these tasks requires accurately separating albedo from shade. However, performing this separation on point clouds presents two key challenges: (1) the non-grid structure of point clouds makes conventional image-based decomposition models ineffective, and (2) point-cloud models designed for other tasks do not explicitly consider global-light direction, resulting in inaccurate shade. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{Intrinsic Point-Cloud Decomposition (IPCD)}, which extends image decomposition to the direct decomposition of colored point clouds into albedo and shade. To overcome challenge (1), we propose \textbf{IPCD-Net} that extends image-based model with point-wise feature aggregation for non-grid data processing. For challenge (2), we introduce \textbf{Projection-based Luminance Distribution (PLD)} with a hierarchical feature refinement, capturing global-light ques via multi-view projection. For comprehensive evaluation, we create a synthetic outdoor-scene dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that IPCD-Net reduces cast shadows in albedo and enhances color accuracy in shade. Furthermore, we showcase its applications in texture editing, relighting, and point-cloud registration under varying illumination. Finally, we verify the real-world applicability of IPCD-Net.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: T-DRS is an inference-only method that addresses progressive attention decay in LVLMs using three strategies to enhance long-range dependency modeling without training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs using ROPE suffer from progressive attention decay over distant token pairs, impairing global context memory.

Method: Three-step Decay Resilience Strategies: SD-DRS amplifies distant semantic signals, DC-DRS modulates attention weights by position, and reRD-DRS reinforces remaining remote dependencies.

Result: T-DRS consistently improves performance on VQA benchmarks in a training-free manner.

Conclusion: T-DRS effectively recovers suppressed long-range dependencies while preserving local inductive biases, enhancing LVLM performance without retraining.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a wide range of multimodal tasks. However, they still face critical challenges in modeling long-range dependencies under the usage of Rotary Positional Encoding (ROPE). Although it can facilitate precise modeling of token positions, it induces progressive attention decay as token distance increases, especially with progressive attention decay over distant token pairs, which severely impairs the model's ability to remember global context. To alleviate this issue, we propose inference-only Three-step Decay Resilience Strategies (T-DRS), comprising (1) Semantic-Driven DRS (SD-DRS), amplifying semantically meaningful but distant signals via content-aware residuals, (2) Distance-aware Control DRS (DC-DRS), which can purify attention by smoothly modulating weights based on positional distances, suppressing noise while preserving locality, and (3) re-Reinforce Distant DRS (reRD-DRS), consolidating the remaining informative remote dependencies to maintain global coherence. Together, the T-DRS recover suppressed long-range token pairs without harming local inductive biases. Extensive experiments on Vision Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks demonstrate that T-DRS can consistently improve performance in a training-free manner.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of directly applying SAM to RGB-D VSOD, including manual prompt dependence, high memory consumption of sequential adapters, and computational burden of memory attention.

Method: Uses parallel adapter-based multi-modal image encoder with depth-guided parallel adapters for multi-modal feature fusion, and query-driven temporal memory module that unifies memory bank and prompt embeddings using frame-level and video-level queries.

Result: Extensive experiments on three RGB-D VSOD datasets show SAM-DAQ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: SAM-DAQ successfully adapts SAM2 for RGB-D video salient object detection by effectively integrating depth and temporal information in a unified framework.

Abstract: Recently segment anything model (SAM) has attracted widespread concerns, and it is often treated as a vision foundation model for universal segmentation. Some researchers have attempted to directly apply the foundation model to the RGB-D video salient object detection (RGB-D VSOD) task, which often encounters three challenges, including the dependence on manual prompts, the high memory consumption of sequential adapters, and the computational burden of memory attention. To address the limitations, we propose a novel method, namely Segment Anything Model with Depth-guided Adaptive Queries (SAM-DAQ), which adapts SAM2 to pop-out salient objects from videos by seamlessly integrating depth and temporal cues within a unified framework. Firstly, we deploy a parallel adapter-based multi-modal image encoder (PAMIE), which incorporates several depth-guided parallel adapters (DPAs) in a skip-connection way. Remarkably, we fine-tune the frozen SAM encoder under prompt-free conditions, where the DPA utilizes depth cues to facilitate the fusion of multi-modal features. Secondly, we deploy a query-driven temporal memory (QTM) module, which unifies the memory bank and prompt embeddings into a learnable pipeline. Concretely, by leveraging both frame-level queries and video-level queries simultaneously, the QTM module can not only selectively extract temporal consistency features but also iteratively update the temporal representations of the queries. Extensive experiments are conducted on three RGB-D VSOD datasets, and the results show that the proposed SAM-DAQ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of all evaluation metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semantic scene completion approaches use dense network architectures with high parameter counts, leading to increased complexity and resource demands.

Method: Proposes RWKV-PCSSC with RWKV Seed Generator to aggregate features from partial point clouds, and multiple stages of RWKV Point Deconvolution modules to progressively restore point-wise features.

Result: Reduces parameter count by 4.18× and improves memory efficiency by 1.37× compared to PointSSC, while achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed lightweight network effectively addresses model complexity issues in semantic scene completion while maintaining high performance.

Abstract: Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) aims to generate a complete semantic scene from an incomplete input. Existing approaches often employ dense network architectures with a high parameter count, leading to increased model complexity and resource demands. To address these limitations, we propose RWKV-PCSSC, a lightweight point cloud semantic scene completion network inspired by the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) mechanism. Specifically, we introduce a RWKV Seed Generator (RWKV-SG) module that can aggregate features from a partial point cloud to produce a coarse point cloud with coarse features. Subsequently, the point-wise feature of the point cloud is progressively restored through multiple stages of the RWKV Point Deconvolution (RWKV-PD) modules. By leveraging a compact and efficient design, our method achieves a lightweight model representation. Experimental results demonstrate that RWKV-PCSSC reduces the parameter count by 4.18$\times$ and improves memory efficiency by 1.37$\times$ compared to state-of-the-art methods PointSSC. Furthermore, our network achieves state-of-the-art performance on established indoor (SSC-PC, NYUCAD-PC) and outdoor (PointSSC) scene dataset, as well as on our proposed datasets (NYUCAD-PC-V2, 3D-FRONT-PC).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HCC-3D introduces hierarchical compression to reduce 3D token computational cost in Vision-Language Models while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D-VLMs have high computational costs due to processing all 3D tokens in LLMs, limiting practical applications.

Method: Proposes Hierarchical Compensatory Compression with global structure compression and adaptive detail mining to selectively compress 3D tokens.

Result: Achieves ~98% compression ratio while achieving state-of-the-art performance on 3D understanding tasks.

Conclusion: HCC-3D provides an efficient solution that improves both computational efficiency and performance in 3D-VLMs.

Abstract: 3D understanding has drawn significant attention recently, leveraging Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to enable multi-modal reasoning between point cloud and text data. Current 3D-VLMs directly embed the 3D point clouds into 3D tokens, following large 2D-VLMs with powerful reasoning capabilities. However, this framework has a great computational cost limiting its application, where we identify that the bottleneck lies in processing all 3D tokens in the Large Language Model (LLM) part. This raises the question: how can we reduce the computational overhead introduced by 3D tokens while preserving the integrity of their essential information? To address this question, we introduce Hierarchical Compensatory Compression (HCC-3D) to efficiently compress 3D tokens while maintaining critical detail retention. Specifically, we first propose a global structure compression (GSC), in which we design global queries to compress all 3D tokens into a few key tokens while keeping overall structural information. Then, to compensate for the information loss in GSC, we further propose an adaptive detail mining (ADM) module that selectively recompresses salient but under-attended features through complementary scoring. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HCC-3D not only achieves extreme compression ratios (approximately 98%) compared to previous 3D-VLMs, but also achieves new state-of-the-art performance, showing the great improvements on both efficiency and performance.

TL;DR: A method for improving tiny object detection in aerial images using Scale-Aware Relay Layer and Scale-Adaptive Loss that boosts performance by 5.5% AP on standard benchmarks and 29.0% AP on noisy datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern detectors struggle with tiny objects in aerial images due to limited features that degrade during network propagation and disproportionate regression penalties for smaller objects during training.

Method: Proposes Scale-Aware Relay Layer (SARL) with cross-scale spatial-channel attention to enrich features and strengthen cross-layer sharing, and Scale-Adaptive Loss (SAL) that reshapes IoU-based losses to assign lower weights to larger objects.

Result: Boosts generalization ability by 5.5% AP when embedded in YOLOv5 and YOLOx baselines on AI-TOD, DOTA-v2.0 and VisDrone2019 benchmarks, and promotes robust performance with 29.0% AP on real-world noisy dataset AI-TOD-v2.0.

Conclusion: The proposed SARL and SAL effectively address tiny object detection challenges in aerial images and are compatible with top-performing frameworks, demonstrating significant performance improvements across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Recently, despite the remarkable advancements in object detection, modern detectors still struggle to detect tiny objects in aerial images. One key reason is that tiny objects carry limited features that are inevitably degraded or lost during long-distance network propagation. Another is that smaller objects receive disproportionately greater regression penalties than larger ones during training. To tackle these issues, we propose a Scale-Aware Relay Layer (SARL) and a Scale-Adaptive Loss (SAL) for tiny object detection, both of which are seamlessly compatible with the top-performing frameworks. Specifically, SARL employs a cross-scale spatial-channel attention to progressively enrich the meaningful features of each layer and strengthen the cross-layer feature sharing. SAL reshapes the vanilla IoU-based losses so as to dynamically assign lower weights to larger objects. This loss is able to focus training on tiny objects while reducing the influence on large objects. Extensive experiments are conducted on three benchmarks (\textit{i.e.,} AI-TOD, DOTA-v2.0 and VisDrone2019), and the results demonstrate that the proposed method boosts the generalization ability by 5.5\% Average Precision (AP) when embedded in YOLOv5 (anchor-based) and YOLOx (anchor-free) baselines. Moreover, it also promotes the robust performance with 29.0\% AP on the real-world noisy dataset (\textit{i.e.,} AI-TOD-v2.0).

Abstract: Automated medical image captioning translates complex radiological images into diagnostic narratives that can support reporting workflows. We present a Swin-BART encoder-decoder system with a lightweight regional attention module that amplifies diagnostically salient regions before cross-attention. Trained and evaluated on ROCO, our model achieves state-of-the-art semantic fidelity while remaining compact and interpretable. We report results as mean$\pm$std over three seeds and include $95\%$ confidence intervals. Compared with baselines, our approach improves ROUGE (proposed 0.603, ResNet-CNN 0.356, BLIP2-OPT 0.255) and BERTScore (proposed 0.807, BLIP2-OPT 0.645, ResNet-CNN 0.623), with competitive BLEU, CIDEr, and METEOR. We further provide ablations (regional attention on/off and token-count sweep), per-modality analysis (CT/MRI/X-ray), paired significance tests, and qualitative heatmaps that visualize the regions driving each description. Decoding uses beam search (beam size $=4$), length penalty $=1.1$, $no\_repeat\_ngram\_size$ $=3$, and max length $=128$. The proposed design yields accurate, clinically phrased captions and transparent regional attributions, supporting safe research use with a human in the loop.

TL;DR: Proposes Liquid Temporal Feature Evolution (LTFE) for Single-Domain Generalized Object Detection, using temporal modeling and liquid neural networks to simulate continuous domain shifts and improve generalization to unseen domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use discrete data augmentation or static perturbations which fail to capture continuous domain shifts like weather or lighting changes, limiting model's ability to perceive fine-grained cross-domain differences.

Method: LTFE simulates progressive feature evolution using controllable Gaussian noise injection, multi-scale Gaussian blurring for initial perturbations, temporal modeling, and liquid parameter adjustment mechanism to generate adaptive modulation parameters for smooth domain adaptation.

Result: Significant performance improvements on Diverse Weather dataset and Real-to-Art benchmark, demonstrating superior generalization and robustness to unseen domain shifts.

Conclusion: LTFE effectively bridges source-unknown domain distribution gap by capturing progressive cross-domain feature evolution and dynamically regulating adaptation paths, significantly boosting generalization capabilities.

Abstract: In this paper, we focus on Single-Domain Generalized Object Detection (Single-DGOD), aiming to transfer a detector trained on one source domain to multiple unknown domains. Existing methods for Single-DGOD typically rely on discrete data augmentation or static perturbation methods to expand data diversity, thereby mitigating the lack of access to target domain data. However, in real-world scenarios such as changes in weather or lighting conditions, domain shifts often occur continuously and gradually. Discrete augmentations and static perturbations fail to effectively capture the dynamic variation of feature distributions, thereby limiting the model's ability to perceive fine-grained cross-domain differences. To this end, we propose a new method, Liquid Temporal Feature Evolution, which simulates the progressive evolution of features from the source domain to simulated latent distributions by incorporating temporal modeling and liquid neural network-driven parameter adjustment. Specifically, we introduce controllable Gaussian noise injection and multi-scale Gaussian blurring to simulate initial feature perturbations, followed by temporal modeling and a liquid parameter adjustment mechanism to generate adaptive modulation parameters, enabling a smooth and continuous adaptation across domains. By capturing progressive cross-domain feature evolution and dynamically regulating adaptation paths, our method bridges the source-unknown domain distribution gap, significantly boosting generalization and robustness to unseen shifts. Significant performance improvements on the Diverse Weather dataset and Real-to-Art benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our method. Our code is available at https://github.com/2490o/LTFE.

Motivation: Existing Vision-Language Model benchmarks are inadequate for VRDU as they are predominantly English-centric, have simplistic layouts, and support limited tasks, failing to evaluate model performance on real-world document complexity.

Method: DocWeaver, a multi-agent pipeline leveraging Large Language Models, was used to automatically generate MosaicDoc - a large-scale bilingual benchmark sourced from newspapers and magazines with diverse layouts and rich stylistic variety.

Result: MosaicDoc contains 72K images and over 600K QA pairs with comprehensive annotations for OCR, VQA, reading order, and localization. Evaluation of state-of-the-art models revealed their limitations in handling real-world document complexity.

Conclusion: MosaicDoc serves as a definitive benchmark for VRDU research, revealing current model limitations and charting a clear path for future research in handling complex document understanding tasks.

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their capabilities are inadequately assessed by existing benchmarks, which are predominantly English-centric, feature simplistic layouts, and support limited tasks. Consequently, they fail to evaluate model performance for Visually Rich Document Understanding (VRDU), a critical challenge involving complex layouts and dense text. To address this, we introduce DocWeaver, a novel multi-agent pipeline that leverages Large Language Models to automatically generate a new benchmark.

### [29] [Compensating Distribution Drifts in Class-incremental Learning of Pre-trained Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09926)
*Xuan Rao,Simian Xu,Zheng Li,Bo Zhao,Derong Liu,Mingming Ha,Cesare Alippi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SLDC introduces latent space transition operators to compensate for distribution drift in sequential fine-tuning for class-incremental learning, achieving performance comparable to joint training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sequential fine-tuning of ViTs suffers from distribution drift due to sequential optimization, causing mismatch between learned class distributions and updater model, degrading classifier performance over time.

Method: Proposes linear and weakly nonlinear SLDC variants that learn transition operators to align feature distributions across tasks, combined with knowledge distillation to reduce representation drift.

Result: SLDC significantly improves SeqFT performance on standard CIL benchmarks, achieving performance comparable to joint training across all evaluated datasets.

Conclusion: Combining KD for representation drift with SLDC for distribution drift compensation enables SeqFT to match joint training performance in class-incremental learning.

Abstract: Recent advances have shown that sequential fine-tuning (SeqFT) of pre-trained vision transformers (ViTs), followed by classifier refinement using approximate distributions of class features, can be an effective strategy for class-incremental learning (CIL). However, this approach is susceptible to distribution drift, caused by the sequential optimization of shared backbone parameters. This results in a mismatch between the distributions of the previously learned classes and that of the updater model, ultimately degrading the effectiveness of classifier performance over time. To address this issue, we introduce a latent space transition operator and propose Sequential Learning with Drift Compensation (SLDC). SLDC aims to align feature distributions across tasks to mitigate the impact of drift. First, we present a linear variant of SLDC, which learns a linear operator by solving a regularized least-squares problem that maps features before and after fine-tuning. Next, we extend this with a weakly nonlinear SLDC variant, which assumes that the ideal transition operator lies between purely linear and fully nonlinear transformations. This is implemented using learnable, weakly nonlinear mappings that balance flexibility and generalization. To further reduce representation drift, we apply knowledge distillation (KD) in both algorithmic variants. Extensive experiments on standard CIL benchmarks demonstrate that SLDC significantly improves the performance of SeqFT. Notably, by combining KD to address representation drift with SLDC to compensate distribution drift, SeqFT achieves performance comparable to joint training across all evaluated datasets.

*Yuhang Zhou,Yanxiang Zhao,Zhongyun Hua,Zhipu Liu,Zhaoquan Gu,Qing Liao,Leo Yu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a debiased dual-invariant defense framework for person ReID that addresses model bias and composite generalization requirements through data balancing and bi-adversarial self-meta defense.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Person ReID models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, but existing defenses fail to address the unique challenges of adversarially robust ReID, particularly model bias and composite generalization requirements.

Method: Two-phase framework: 1) Data balancing using diffusion-model-based resampling for fairness and diversity; 2) Bi-adversarial self-meta defense with farthest negative extension softening and adversarially-enhanced self-meta mechanism for dual-generalization.

Result: Experiments show the method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art defenses for person ReID.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the key challenges in adversarial defense for person ReID and achieves superior robustness performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReID) is a fundamental task in many real-world applications such as pedestrian trajectory tracking. However, advanced deep learning-based ReID models are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks, where imperceptible perturbations to pedestrian images can cause entirely incorrect predictions, posing significant security threats. Although numerous adversarial defense strategies have been proposed for classification tasks, their extension to metric learning tasks such as person ReID remains relatively unexplored. Moreover, the several existing defenses for person ReID fail to address the inherent unique challenges of adversarially robust ReID. In this paper, we systematically identify the challenges of adversarial defense in person ReID into two key issues: model bias and composite generalization requirements. To address them, we propose a debiased dual-invariant defense framework composed of two main phases. In the data balancing phase, we mitigate model bias using a diffusion-model-based data resampling strategy that promotes fairness and diversity in training data. In the bi-adversarial self-meta defense phase, we introduce a novel metric adversarial training approach incorporating farthest negative extension softening to overcome the robustness degradation caused by the absence of classifier. Additionally, we introduce an adversarially-enhanced self-meta mechanism to achieve dual-generalization for both unseen identities and unseen attack types. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art defenses.

Conclusion: AdaptViG provides an efficient and powerful hybrid Vision GNN that significantly reduces computational costs while achieving superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Vision Graph Neural Networks (ViGs) offer a new direction for advancements in vision architectures. While powerful, ViGs often face substantial computational challenges stemming from their graph construction phase, which can hinder their efficiency. To address this issue we propose AdaptViG, an efficient and powerful hybrid Vision GNN that introduces a novel graph construction mechanism called Adaptive Graph Convolution. This mechanism builds upon a highly efficient static axial scaffold and a dynamic, content-aware gating strategy called Exponential Decay Gating. This gating mechanism selectively weighs long-range connections based on feature similarity. Furthermore, AdaptViG employs a hybrid strategy, utilizing our efficient gating mechanism in the early stages and a full Global Attention block in the final stage for maximum feature aggregation. Our method achieves a new state-of-the-art trade-off between accuracy and efficiency among Vision GNNs. For instance, our AdaptViG-M achieves 82.6% top-1 accuracy, outperforming ViG-B by 0.3% while using 80% fewer parameters and 84% fewer GMACs. On downstream tasks, AdaptViG-M obtains 45.8 mIoU, 44.8 APbox, and 41.1 APmask, surpassing the much larger EfficientFormer-L7 by 0.7 mIoU, 2.2 APbox, and 2.1 APmask, respectively, with 78% fewer parameters.

*Zhiyuan Xu,Nan Min,Yuhang Guo,Tong Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TSPE-GS improves 3D Gaussian Splatting for semi-transparent surfaces by modeling multi-modal opacity/depth distributions instead of single-depth assumptions, enabling separate reconstruction of external and internal surfaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting struggles with semi-transparent surfaces due to its single-depth-per-pixel assumption, which fails when multiple surfaces are visible through transparency.

Method: Uniformly samples transmittance to model pixel-wise multi-modal distributions of opacity and depth, progressively fuses truncated signed distance functions to reconstruct external and internal surfaces separately.

Result: Significantly improves semi-transparent geometry reconstruction while maintaining performance on opaque scenes, works with other Gaussian-based pipelines without extra training.

Conclusion: TSPE-GS successfully resolves cross-surface depth ambiguity in semi-transparent reconstruction and generalizes well across different scene types.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting offers a strong speed-quality trade-off but struggles to reconstruct semi-transparent surfaces because most methods assume a single depth per pixel, which fails when multiple surfaces are visible. We propose TSPE-GS (Transparent Surface Probabilistic Extraction for Gaussian Splatting), which uniformly samples transmittance to model a pixel-wise multi-modal distribution of opacity and depth, replacing the prior single-peak assumption and resolving cross-surface depth ambiguity. By progressively fusing truncated signed distance functions, TSPE-GS reconstructs external and internal surfaces separately within a unified framework. The method generalizes to other Gaussian-based reconstruction pipelines without extra training overhead. Extensive experiments on public and self-collected semi-transparent and opaque datasets show TSPE-GS significantly improves semi-transparent geometry reconstruction while maintaining performance on opaque scenes.

### [33] [Beyond Cosine Similarity Magnitude-Aware CLIP for No-Reference Image Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09948)
*Zhicheng Liao,Dongxu Wu,Zhenshan Shi,Sijie Mai,Hanwei Zhu,Lingyu Zhu,Yuncheng Jiang,Baoliang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel adaptive fusion framework that combines CLIP's cosine similarity with magnitude-aware quality cues for no-reference image quality assessment, outperforming existing methods without task-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard CLIP-based NR-IQA methods only use semantic similarity between image embeddings and text prompts, ignoring the important quality cue in the magnitude of CLIP image features which correlates strongly with perceptual quality.

Method: Extracts absolute CLIP image features, applies Box-Cox transformation for statistical normalization, and uses confidence-guided fusion to adaptively combine the magnitude-aware cue with cosine similarity-based prompt matching.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark IQA datasets show consistent performance improvements over standard CLIP-based IQA and state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The magnitude of CLIP image features provides a valuable quality cue that, when properly normalized and fused with semantic similarity, significantly enhances no-reference image quality assessment performance.

Abstract: Recent efforts have repurposed the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model for No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) by measuring the cosine similarity between the image embedding and textual prompts such as "a good photo" or "a bad photo." However, this semantic similarity overlooks a critical yet underexplored cue: the magnitude of the CLIP image features, which we empirically find to exhibit a strong correlation with perceptual quality. In this work, we introduce a novel adaptive fusion framework that complements cosine similarity with a magnitude-aware quality cue. Specifically, we first extract the absolute CLIP image features and apply a Box-Cox transformation to statistically normalize the feature distribution and mitigate semantic sensitivity. The resulting scalar summary serves as a semantically-normalized auxiliary cue that complements cosine-based prompt matching. To integrate both cues effectively, we further design a confidence-guided fusion scheme that adaptively weighs each term according to its relative strength. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark IQA datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms standard CLIP-based IQA and state-of-the-art baselines, without any task-specific training.

*Uday Bhaskar,Rishabh Bhattacharya,Avinash Patel,Sarthak Khoche,Praveen Anil Kulkarni,Naresh Manwani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A pipeline using vision-language models to generate pseudo-labels for training efficient object detectors, featuring per-object co-teaching to handle noisy labels and achieve real-time performance for autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models offer zero-shot object detection but have high latency and hallucination issues, making them unsuitable for direct deployment in autonomous driving where manual labeling is expensive.

Method: Uses VLMs to generate pseudo-labels and introduces per-object co-teaching where two YOLO models collaboratively filter noisy bounding boxes based on peer loss values during training.

Result: Achieved significant mAP@0.5 improvement from 31.12% to 46.61% on KITTI dataset while maintaining real-time latency. With 10% ground truth labels, reached 57.97% mAP@0.5. Similar improvements on ACDC and BDD100k datasets.

Conclusion: The pipeline provides an efficient, robust, and scalable approach to train high-performance object detectors for autonomous driving, significantly reducing reliance on costly human annotation.

Abstract: Foundation models, especially vision-language models (VLMs), offer compelling zero-shot object detection for applications like autonomous driving, a domain where manual labelling is prohibitively expensive. However, their detection latency and tendency to hallucinate predictions render them unsuitable for direct deployment. This work introduces a novel pipeline that addresses this challenge by leveraging VLMs to automatically generate pseudo-labels for training efficient, real-time object detectors. Our key innovation is a per-object co-teaching-based training strategy that mitigates the inherent noise in VLM-generated labels. The proposed per-object coteaching approach filters noisy bounding boxes from training instead of filtering the entire image. Specifically, two YOLO models learn collaboratively, filtering out unreliable boxes from each mini-batch based on their peers' per-object loss values. Overall, our pipeline provides an efficient, robust, and scalable approach to train high-performance object detectors for autonomous driving, significantly reducing reliance on costly human annotation. Experimental results on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms a baseline YOLOv5m model, achieving a significant mAP@0.5 boost ($31.12\%$ to $46.61\%$) while maintaining real-time detection latency. Furthermore, we show that supplementing our pseudo-labelled data with a small fraction of ground truth labels ($10\%$) leads to further performance gains, reaching $57.97\%$ mAP@0.5 on the KITTI dataset. We observe similar performance improvements for the ACDC and BDD100k datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing problem-agnostic diffusion model-based image restoration methods don't fully leverage diffusion priors, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: EquS imposes equivariant information through dual sampling trajectories, enhanced by Timestep-Aware Schedule (TAS) that prioritizes deterministic steps for better certainty and efficiency.

Result: Extensive experiments show EquS is compatible with previous methods and significantly boosts their performance without increasing computational costs.

Conclusion: The proposed EquS method effectively addresses limitations of current problem-agnostic DMIR approaches by better utilizing diffusion priors through dual trajectories and optimized scheduling.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models, especially diffusion models, have significantly improved image restoration (IR) performance. However, existing problem-agnostic diffusion model-based image restoration (DMIR) methods face challenges in fully leveraging diffusion priors, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this paper, we address the limitations of current problem-agnostic DMIR methods by analyzing their sampling process and providing effective solutions. We introduce EquS, a DMIR method that imposes equivariant information through dual sampling trajectories. To further boost EquS, we propose the Timestep-Aware Schedule (TAS) and introduce EquS$^+$. TAS prioritizes deterministic steps to enhance certainty and sampling efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiVE (Difference Vector Equalization) is a robust fine-tuning method for vision-language models that preserves geometric structure by constraining difference vectors between pre-trained and fine-tuned embeddings to be equal across data samples, maintaining strong OOD and zero-shot performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robust fine-tuning methods for vision-language models distort the geometric structure of embeddings during contrastive learning, which limits out-of-distribution (OOD) and zero-shot generalization performance.

Method: Proposes DiVE with two losses: Average Vector Loss (AVL) to preserve global geometric structure by constraining difference vectors to their weighted average, and Pairwise Vector Loss (PVL) to preserve local geometric structure through consistent multimodal alignment.

Result: Experiments show DiVE effectively preserves geometric structure and achieves strong performance across in-distribution, out-of-distribution, and zero-shot metrics.

Conclusion: DiVE successfully fine-tunes vision-language models on in-distribution data without compromising their generalization abilities in OOD and zero-shot settings by preserving the crucial geometric structure of embeddings.

Abstract: Contrastive pre-trained vision-language models, such as CLIP, demonstrate strong generalization abilities in zero-shot classification by leveraging embeddings extracted from image and text encoders. This paper aims to robustly fine-tune these vision-language models on in-distribution (ID) data without compromising their generalization abilities in out-of-distribution (OOD) and zero-shot settings. Current robust fine-tuning methods tackle this challenge by reusing contrastive learning, which was used in pre-training, for fine-tuning. However, we found that these methods distort the geometric structure of the embeddings, which plays a crucial role in the generalization of vision-language models, resulting in limited OOD and zero-shot performance. To address this, we propose Difference Vector Equalization (DiVE), which preserves the geometric structure during fine-tuning. The idea behind DiVE is to constrain difference vectors, each of which is obtained by subtracting the embeddings extracted from the pre-trained and fine-tuning models for the same data sample. By constraining the difference vectors to be equal across various data samples, we effectively preserve the geometric structure. Therefore, we introduce two losses: average vector loss (AVL) and pairwise vector loss (PVL). AVL preserves the geometric structure globally by constraining difference vectors to be equal to their weighted average. PVL preserves the geometric structure locally by ensuring a consistent multimodal alignment. Our experiments demonstrate that DiVE effectively preserves the geometric structure, achieving strong results across ID, OOD, and zero-shot metrics.

TL;DR: STELLAR is a diffusion-based scene text editing model that addresses limitations in multilingual support, real-world data adaptation, and evaluation metrics through language-adaptive glyph encoding, multi-stage training, and a novel Text Appearance Similarity metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Scene Text Editing approaches lack support for low-resource languages, suffer from domain gaps between synthetic and real data, and lack appropriate metrics for evaluating text style preservation.

Method: Proposes STELLAR with language-adaptive glyph encoder, multi-stage training (pre-training on synthetic data then fine-tuning on real images), and constructs STIPLAR dataset for training/evaluation. Also introduces Text Appearance Similarity (TAS) metric.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art models in visual consistency and recognition accuracy, achieving average TAS improvement of 2.2% across languages over baselines.

Conclusion: STELLAR effectively addresses key limitations in scene text editing by enabling reliable multilingual editing, bridging synthetic-real domain gap, and providing robust evaluation through TAS metric.

Abstract: Scene Text Editing (STE) is the task of modifying text content in an image while preserving its visual style, such as font, color, and background. While recent diffusion-based approaches have shown improvements in visual quality, key limitations remain: lack of support for low-resource languages, domain gap between synthetic and real data, and the absence of appropriate metrics for evaluating text style preservation. To address these challenges, we propose STELLAR (Scene Text Editor for Low-resource LAnguages and Real-world data). STELLAR enables reliable multilingual editing through a language-adaptive glyph encoder and a multi-stage training strategy that first pre-trains on synthetic data and then fine-tunes on real images. We also construct a new dataset, STIPLAR(Scene Text Image Pairs of Low-resource lAnguages and Real-world data), for training and evaluation. Furthermore, we propose Text Appearance Similarity (TAS), a novel metric that assesses style preservation by independently measuring font, color, and background similarity, enabling robust evaluation even without ground truth. Experimental results demonstrate that STELLAR outperforms state-of-the-art models in visual consistency and recognition accuracy, achieving an average TAS improvement of 2.2% across languages over the baselines.

TL;DR: MOBA is a physically realizable backdoor attack framework for LiDAR-based 3D object detection that bridges the digital-physical gap by modeling material properties, achieving 93.50% attack success rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing backdoor attacks lack physical realizability due to digital-to-physical domain gap and unoptimized physical triggers that are either ineffective or easily detectable.

Method: Systematic material selection (TiO₂ for high diffuse reflectivity) and novel simulation pipeline with angle-independent Oren-Nayar BRDF model and distance-aware scaling for accurate digital-physical alignment.

Result: Achieves 93.50% attack success rate, outperforming prior methods by over 41% on state-of-the-art LiDAR-based and Camera-LiDAR fusion models.

Conclusion: Reveals new physically realizable threats and underscores need for defenses accounting for material-level properties in real-world environments.

Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D object detection is widely used in safety-critical systems. However, these systems remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks that embed hidden malicious behaviors during training. A key limitation of existing backdoor attacks is their lack of physical realizability, primarily due to the digital-to-physical domain gap. Digital triggers often fail in real-world settings because they overlook material-dependent LiDAR reflection properties. On the other hand, physically constructed triggers are often unoptimized, leading to low effectiveness or easy detectability.This paper introduces Material-Oriented Backdoor Attack (MOBA), a novel framework that bridges the digital-physical gap by explicitly modeling the material properties of real-world triggers. MOBA tackles two key challenges in physical backdoor design: 1) robustness of the trigger material under diverse environmental conditions, 2) alignment between the physical trigger's behavior and its digital simulation. First, we propose a systematic approach to selecting robust trigger materials, identifying titanium dioxide (TiO_2) for its high diffuse reflectivity and environmental resilience. Second, to ensure the digital trigger accurately mimics the physical behavior of the material-based trigger, we develop a novel simulation pipeline that features: (1) an angle-independent approximation of the Oren-Nayar BRDF model to generate realistic LiDAR intensities, and (2) a distance-aware scaling mechanism to maintain spatial consistency across varying depths. We conduct extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LiDAR-based and Camera-LiDAR fusion models, showing that MOBA achieves a 93.50% attack success rate, outperforming prior methods by over 41%. Our work reveals a new class of physically realizable threats and underscores the urgent need for defenses that account for material-level properties in real-world environments.

TL;DR: DBGroup is a two-stage weakly supervised 3D instance segmentation framework that uses scene-level annotations to reduce labeling costs, achieving competitive performance with sparse-point supervision methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing weakly supervised 3D instance segmentation methods that still require labor-intensive annotation processes and expert annotators, by leveraging more efficient scene-level annotations.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Dual-Branch Point Grouping module generates pseudo labels using semantic and mask cues from multi-view images, with refinement strategies (Granularity-Aware Instance Merging and Semantic Selection/Propagation); 2) Multi-round self-training on end-to-end instance segmentation network with Instance Mask Filter to handle pseudo label inconsistencies.

Result: Extensive experiments show DBGroup achieves competitive performance compared to sparse-point-level supervised 3D instance segmentation methods and surpasses state-of-the-art scene-level supervised 3D semantic segmentation approaches.

Conclusion: Scene-level annotations provide a more efficient and scalable alternative for weakly supervised 3D instance segmentation, with DBGroup demonstrating effective performance while reducing annotation costs.

Abstract: Weakly supervised 3D instance segmentation is essential for 3D scene understanding, especially as the growing scale of data and high annotation costs associated with fully supervised approaches. Existing methods primarily rely on two forms of weak supervision: one-thing-one-click annotations and bounding box annotations, both of which aim to reduce labeling efforts. However, these approaches still encounter limitations, including labor-intensive annotation processes, high complexity, and reliance on expert annotators. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{DBGroup}, a two-stage weakly supervised 3D instance segmentation framework that leverages scene-level annotations as a more efficient and scalable alternative. In the first stage, we introduce a Dual-Branch Point Grouping module to generate pseudo labels guided by semantic and mask cues extracted from multi-view images. To further improve label quality, we develop two refinement strategies: Granularity-Aware Instance Merging and Semantic Selection and Propagation. The second stage involves multi-round self-training on an end-to-end instance segmentation network using the refined pseudo-labels. Additionally, we introduce an Instance Mask Filter strategy to address inconsistencies within the pseudo labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DBGroup achieves competitive performance compared to sparse-point-level supervised 3D instance segmentation methods, while surpassing state-of-the-art scene-level supervised 3D semantic segmentation approaches.

TL;DR: LampQ is a layer-wise mixed precision quantization method for Vision Transformers that addresses limitations of existing approaches through fine-grained control, type-aware sensitivity metrics, and optimal bit allocation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Vision Transformer quantization methods use uniform precision, ignoring component sensitivity differences, while previous mixed precision methods suffer from coarse granularity, metric scale mismatch, and quantization-unaware bit allocation.

Method: Proposes LampQ with layer-wise quantization, type-aware Fisher-based sensitivity metric, integer linear programming for optimal bit allocation, and iterative bit-width updates.

Result: Extensive experiments show LampQ achieves state-of-the-art performance in quantizing ViTs for image classification, object detection, and zero-shot quantization tasks.

Conclusion: LampQ effectively overcomes limitations of existing mixed precision quantization methods for Vision Transformers through fine-grained layer-wise control and optimal bit allocation strategies.

Abstract: How can we accurately quantize a pre-trained Vision Transformer model? Quantization algorithms compress Vision Transformers (ViTs) into low-bit formats, reducing memory and computation demands with minimal accuracy degradation. However, existing methods rely on uniform precision, ignoring the diverse sensitivity of ViT components to quantization. Metric-based Mixed Precision Quantization (MPQ) is a promising alternative, but previous MPQ methods for ViTs suffer from three major limitations: 1) coarse granularity, 2) mismatch in metric scale across component types, and 3) quantization-unaware bit allocation. In this paper, we propose LampQ (Layer-wise Mixed Precision Quantization for Vision Transformers), an accurate metric-based MPQ method for ViTs to overcome these limitations. LampQ performs layer-wise quantization to achieve both fine-grained control and efficient acceleration, incorporating a type-aware Fisher-based metric to measure sensitivity. Then, LampQ assigns bit-widths optimally through integer linear programming and further updates them iteratively. Extensive experiments show that LampQ provides the state-of-the-art performance in quantizing ViTs pre-trained on various tasks such as image classification, object detection, and zero-shot quantization.

Conclusion: MIRNet provides an effective framework for medical image analysis that addresses key challenges in the field and shows promising generalization capabilities beyond tongue diagnosis.

Abstract: Automated interpretation of medical images demands robust modeling of complex visual-semantic relationships while addressing annotation scarcity, label imbalance, and clinical plausibility constraints. We introduce MIRNet (Medical Image Reasoner Network), a novel framework that integrates self-supervised pre-training with constrained graph-based reasoning. Tongue image diagnosis is a particularly challenging domain that requires fine-grained visual and semantic understanding. Our approach leverages self-supervised masked autoencoder (MAE) to learn transferable visual representations from unlabeled data; employs graph attention networks (GAT) to model label correlations through expert-defined structured graphs; enforces clinical priors via constraint-aware optimization using KL divergence and regularization losses; and mitigates imbalance using asymmetric loss (ASL) and boosting ensembles. To address annotation scarcity, we also introduce TongueAtlas-4K, a comprehensive expert-curated benchmark comprising 4,000 images annotated with 22 diagnostic labels--representing the largest public dataset in tongue analysis. Validation shows our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. While optimized for tongue diagnosis, the framework readily generalizes to broader diagnostic medical imaging tasks.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on SceneFun3D dataset, demonstrating strong generalization and physically grounded reasoning with only 3D point cloud input and MLLMs.

Conclusion: AffordBot effectively bridges 3D input with 2D-compatible MLLMs for fine-grained embodied reasoning, enabling coherent instruction-driven affordance understanding in physical environments.

Abstract: Effective human-agent collaboration in physical environments requires understanding not only what to act upon, but also where the actionable elements are and how to interact with them. Existing approaches often operate at the object level or disjointedly handle fine-grained affordance reasoning, lacking coherent, instruction-driven grounding and reasoning. In this work, we introduce a new task: Fine-grained 3D Embodied Reasoning, which requires an agent to predict, for each referenced affordance element in a 3D scene, a structured triplet comprising its spatial location, motion type, and motion axis, based on a task instruction. To solve this task, we propose AffordBot, a novel framework that integrates Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with a tailored chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning paradigm. To bridge the gap between 3D input and 2D-compatible MLLMs, we render surround-view images of the scene and project 3D element candidates into these views, forming a rich visual representation aligned with the scene geometry. Our CoT pipeline begins with an active perception stage, prompting the MLLM to select the most informative viewpoint based on the instruction, before proceeding with step-by-step reasoning to localize affordance elements and infer plausible interaction motions. Evaluated on the SceneFun3D dataset, AffordBot achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating strong generalization and physically grounded reasoning with only 3D point cloud input and MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of generating realistic anomalies without requiring exemplar anomalies, enabling better training of anomaly detection models through synthetic data.

Method: Uses crossmodal prompt encoding to unify visual and textual cues, an inpainting-based generation pipeline, and contrastive refinement for precise anomaly-mask alignment. Trained on AnomVerse dataset with 12,987 anomaly-mask-caption triplets.

Result: Generates more realistic and varied anomalies than prior methods, yielding superior improvements in downstream anomaly detection performance.

Conclusion: Anomagic establishes a versatile foundation model for anomaly generation that can create anomalies for any normal-category image using user-defined prompts.

Abstract: We propose Anomagic, a zero-shot anomaly generation method that produces semantically coherent anomalies without requiring any exemplar anomalies. By unifying both visual and textual cues through a crossmodal prompt encoding scheme, Anomagic leverages rich contextual information to steer an inpainting-based generation pipeline. A subsequent contrastive refinement strategy enforces precise alignment between synthesized anomalies and their masks, thereby bolstering downstream anomaly detection accuracy. To facilitate training, we introduce AnomVerse, a collection of 12,987 anomaly-mask-caption triplets assembled from 13 publicly available datasets, where captions are automatically generated by multimodal large language models using structured visual prompts and template-based textual hints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Anomagic trained on AnomVerse can synthesize more realistic and varied anomalies than prior methods, yielding superior improvements in downstream anomaly detection. Furthermore, Anomagic can generate anomalies for any normal-category image using user-defined prompts, establishing a versatile foundation model for anomaly generation.

TL;DR: DGFusion is a dual-guided multi-modal 3D object detection method that addresses the challenge of detecting distant, small, or occluded objects by combining both Point-guide-Image and Image-guide-Point paradigms through difficulty-aware instance matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-modal 3D object detection methods fail to account for differences in information density between modalities for hard instances (distant, small, or occluded objects), which compromises autonomous driving safety.

Method: Proposes DGFusion with Difficulty-aware Instance Pair Matcher (DIPM) that performs instance-level feature matching based on difficulty to generate easy and hard instance pairs, and Dual-guided Modules that exploit both pair types for effective multi-modal feature fusion.

Result: Outperforms baseline methods with improvements of +1.0% mAP, +0.8% NDS, and +1.3% average recall on nuScenes dataset, with consistent robustness gains for hard instance detection across various scenarios.

Conclusion: The dual-guided paradigm effectively addresses limitations of single-guided approaches and improves detection performance for challenging objects in autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: As a critical task in autonomous driving perception systems, 3D object detection is used to identify and track key objects, such as vehicles and pedestrians. However, detecting distant, small, or occluded objects (hard instances) remains a challenge, which directly compromises the safety of autonomous driving systems. We observe that existing multi-modal 3D object detection methods often follow a single-guided paradigm, failing to account for the differences in information density of hard instances between modalities. In this work, we propose DGFusion, based on the Dual-guided paradigm, which fully inherits the advantages of the Point-guide-Image paradigm and integrates the Image-guide-Point paradigm to address the limitations of the single paradigms. The core of DGFusion, the Difficulty-aware Instance Pair Matcher (DIPM), performs instance-level feature matching based on difficulty to generate easy and hard instance pairs, while the Dual-guided Modules exploit the advantages of both pair types to enable effective multi-modal feature fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that our DGFusion outperforms the baseline methods, with respective improvements of +1.0\% mAP, +0.8\% NDS, and +1.3\% average recall on nuScenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent robustness gains for hard instance detection across ego-distance, size, visibility, and small-scale training scenarios.

TL;DR: A novel 3D VAE framework using unsigned distance fields (UDFs) with local-to-global architecture that achieves high-fidelity 3D content generation at ultra-high resolutions up to 2048^3.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming limitations of existing methods: SDFs require costly watertight preprocessing and struggle with non-manifold geometries, while point-cloud representations suffer from sampling artifacts and surface discontinuities.

Method: 3D VAE framework built on UDFs with local-to-global architecture using UBlocks (uniform subvolumes), combining 3D convolutions for local detail and sparse transformers for global coherence, plus Pad-Average strategy for smooth transitions.

Result: State-of-the-art performance in reconstruction accuracy and generative quality, achieving superior surface smoothness and geometric flexibility at previously unattainable resolutions up to 2048^3.

Conclusion: The proposed UDF-based 3D VAE with local-to-global architecture successfully addresses key challenges in 3D content generation, enabling high-fidelity representation of complex topologies at ultra-high resolutions.

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity 3D contents remains a fundamental challenge due to the complexity of representing arbitrary topologies-such as open surfaces and intricate internal structures-while preserving geometric details. Prevailing methods based on signed distance fields (SDFs) are hampered by costly watertight preprocessing and struggle with non-manifold geometries, while point-cloud representations often suffer from sampling artifacts and surface discontinuities. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel 3D variational autoencoder (VAE) framework built upon unsigned distance fields (UDFs)-a more robust and computationally efficient representation that naturally handles complex and incomplete shapes. Our core innovation is a local-to-global (LoG) architecture that processes the UDF by partitioning it into uniform subvolumes, termed UBlocks. This architecture couples 3D convolutions for capturing local detail with sparse transformers for enforcing global coherence. A Pad-Average strategy further ensures smooth transitions at subvolume boundaries during reconstruction. This modular design enables seamless scaling to ultra-high resolutions up to 2048^3-a regime previously unattainable for 3D VAEs. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in both reconstruction accuracy and generative quality, yielding superior surface smoothness and geometric flexibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visible-infrared object detection suffers from information imbalance between modalities and inadequate cross-modal fusion in complex scenarios, while existing methods ignore the potential of frequency domain transformers for mining complementary information.

Method: Proposes multimodal frequency domain attention (MFDA) to mine complementary information, frequency domain feed-forward layer (FDFFL) for feature enhancement, cross-modal global modeling module (CGMM) for pixel-wise inter-modal interaction, and local feature enhancement module (LFEM) using convolution layers and channel shuffle.

Result: Extensive experiments show FreDFT achieves excellent performance on multiple public datasets compared with state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed frequency domain fusion transformer effectively addresses modality imbalance and enhances cross-modal feature fusion for improved visible-infrared object detection performance.

Abstract: Visible-infrared object detection has gained sufficient attention due to its detection performance in low light, fog, and rain conditions. However, visible and infrared modalities captured by different sensors exist the information imbalance problem in complex scenarios, which can cause inadequate cross-modal fusion, resulting in degraded detection performance. \textcolor{red}{Furthermore, most existing methods use transformers in the spatial domain to capture complementary features, ignoring the advantages of developing frequency domain transformers to mine complementary information.} To solve these weaknesses, we propose a frequency domain fusion transformer, called FreDFT, for visible-infrared object detection. The proposed approach employs a novel multimodal frequency domain attention (MFDA) to mine complementary information between modalities and a frequency domain feed-forward layer (FDFFL) via a mixed-scale frequency feature fusion strategy is designed to better enhance multimodal features. To eliminate the imbalance of multimodal information, a cross-modal global modeling module (CGMM) is constructed to perform pixel-wise inter-modal feature interaction in a spatial and channel manner. Moreover, a local feature enhancement module (LFEM) is developed to strengthen multimodal local feature representation and promote multimodal feature fusion by using various convolution layers and applying a channel shuffle. Extensive experimental results have verified that our proposed FreDFT achieves excellent performance on multiple public datasets compared with other state-of-the-art methods.

*Xurui Li,Feng Xue,Yu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MuSc-V2 is a zero-shot anomaly classification and segmentation framework that leverages the property that normal patches find similar neighbors while anomalies remain isolated, using mutual scoring across 2D/3D modalities to achieve significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods overlook that normal image patches across industrial products typically find many similar patches in both 2D appearance and 3D shapes, while anomalies remain diverse and isolated. This discriminative property can be leveraged for better anomaly detection.

Method: Proposes Mutual Scoring framework with: Iterative Point Grouping for improved 3D representation, Similarity Neighborhood Aggregation with Multi-Degrees for multi-scale patch features, Mutual Scoring Mechanism for intra-modal scoring, Cross-modal Anomaly Enhancement to fuse 2D/3D scores, and Re-scoring with Constrained Neighborhood to suppress false positives.

Conclusion: MuSc-V2 provides a flexible framework that works on full datasets and smaller subsets with robust performance, ensuring adaptability across diverse product lines while achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot anomaly detection performance.

Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly classification (AC) and segmentation (AS) methods aim to identify and outline defects without using any labeled samples. In this paper, we reveal a key property that is overlooked by existing methods: normal image patches across industrial products typically find many other similar patches, not only in 2D appearance but also in 3D shapes, while anomalies remain diverse and isolated. To explicitly leverage this discriminative property, we propose a Mutual Scoring framework (MuSc-V2) for zero-shot AC/AS, which flexibly supports single 2D/3D or multimodality. Specifically, our method begins by improving 3D representation through Iterative Point Grouping (IPG), which reduces false positives from discontinuous surfaces. Then we use Similarity Neighborhood Aggregation with Multi-Degrees (SNAMD) to fuse 2D/3D neighborhood cues into more discriminative multi-scale patch features for mutual scoring. The core comprises a Mutual Scoring Mechanism (MSM) that lets samples within each modality to assign score to each other, and Cross-modal Anomaly Enhancement (CAE) that fuses 2D and 3D scores to recover modality-specific missing anomalies. Finally, Re-scoring with Constrained Neighborhood (RsCon) suppresses false classification based on similarity to more representative samples. Our framework flexibly works on both the full dataset and smaller subsets with consistently robust performance, ensuring seamless adaptability across diverse product lines. In aid of the novel framework, MuSc-V2 achieves significant performance improvements: a $\textbf{+23.7\%}$ AP gain on the MVTec 3D-AD dataset and a $\textbf{+19.3\%}$ boost on the Eyecandies dataset, surpassing previous zero-shot benchmarks and even outperforming most few-shot methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a comprehensive solution for image screening using MLLMs, including a large dataset (128k samples, 640k images) and an enhanced training method (HCM-GRPO) that improves image aesthetic reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image screening performance with MLLMs is unsatisfactory due to lack of data and weak image aesthetic reasoning capabilities, despite significant improvements in image generation.

Method: Created a comprehensive dataset with four evaluation aspects; introduced Hard Cases Mining with Dynamic Proportional Accuracy reward in GRPO framework (HCM-GRPO) for enhanced training.

Result: HCM-GRPO enables smaller models to surpass both large-scale open-source and leading closed-source models (like GPT4o and Qwen-VL-Max) in image aesthetic reasoning, where current SOTA models perform near random guessing.

Conclusion: The proposed data collection and HCM-GRPO method significantly improve image aesthetic reasoning in MLLMs, demonstrating that smaller models can outperform much larger models with proper training methodology.

Abstract: The performance of image generation has been significantly improved in recent years. However, the study of image screening is rare and its performance with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is unsatisfactory due to the lack of data and the weak image aesthetic reasoning ability in MLLMs. In this work, we propose a complete solution to address these problems in terms of data and methodology. For data, we collect a comprehensive image screening dataset with over 128k samples, about 640k images. Each sample consists of an original image, four generated images. The dataset evaluates the image aesthetic reasoning ability under four aspects: appearance deformation, physical shadow, placement layout, and extension rationality. Regarding data annotation, we investigate multiple approaches, including purely manual, fully automated, and answer-driven annotations, to acquire high-quality chains of thought (CoT) data in the most cost-effective manner. Methodologically, we introduce a Hard Cases Mining (HCM) strategy with a Dynamic Proportional Accuracy (DPA) reward into the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework, called HCM-GRPO. This enhanced method demonstrates superior image aesthetic reasoning capabilities compared to the original GRPO. Our experimental results reveal that even state-of-the-art closed-source MLLMs, such as GPT4o and Qwen-VL-Max, exhibit performance akin to random guessing in image aesthetic reasoning. In contrast, by leveraging the HCM-GRPO, we are able to surpass the scores of both large-scale open-source and leading closed-source models with a much smaller model.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether Multimodal Large Language Models can detect when objects are visually present but audio-absent, and address their tendency for visually dominated reasoning that leads to confusion in audio-visual scenarios.

Method: Proposes RL-CoMM with two stages: 1) Uses Large Audio Language Model as reference to generate audio-only reasoning with Step-wise Reasoning Reward for self-improvement, 2) Implements Answer-centered Confidence Optimization to reduce uncertainty from heterogeneous reasoning differences.

Result: RL-CoMM improves accuracy by 10-30% over baseline models on audio-visual question answering and hallucination tasks with limited training data.

Conclusion: The proposed RL-CoMM framework effectively addresses audio-visual confusion in MLLMs by leveraging reinforcement learning and collaborative multi-model approaches, significantly improving performance on challenging audio-visual reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Can Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) discern confused objects that are visually present but audio-absent? To study this, we introduce a new benchmark, AV-ConfuseBench, which simulates an ``Audio-Visual Confusion'' scene by modifying the corresponding sound of an object in the video, e.g., mute the sounding object and ask MLLMs Is there a/an muted-object sound''. Experimental results reveal that MLLMs, such as Qwen2.5-Omni and Gemini 2.5, struggle to discriminate non-existent audio due to visually dominated reasoning. Motivated by this observation, we introduce RL-CoMM, a Reinforcement Learning-based Collaborative Multi-MLLM that is built upon the Qwen2.5-Omni foundation. RL-CoMM includes two stages: 1) To alleviate visually dominated ambiguities, we introduce an external model, a Large Audio Language Model (LALM), as the reference model to generate audio-only reasoning. Then, we design a Step-wise Reasoning Reward function that enables MLLMs to self-improve audio-visual reasoning with the audio-only reference. 2) To ensure an accurate answer prediction, we introduce Answer-centered Confidence Optimization to reduce the uncertainty of potential heterogeneous reasoning differences. Extensive experiments on audio-visual question answering and audio-visual hallucination show that RL-CoMM improves the accuracy by 10~30\% over the baseline model with limited training data.

Motivation: Address challenges in medical action evaluation including lack of comprehensive datasets, high precision requirements, and insufficient modeling of rapid spatiotemporal dynamics in medical procedures.

Method: Uses multivariate Gaussian representation to project joint motions to temporally scaled space, decomposing actions into adaptive 3D Gaussian tokens. Employs hybrid spatial encoding with Cartesian and Vector dual-stream strategy for skeletal information.

Result: Achieves 92.1% Top-1 accuracy on CPREval-6k benchmark, outperforming ST-GCN baseline by +5.9% with only 10% FLOPs. Demonstrates real-time inference and superior robustness in cross-dataset experiments.

Conclusion: GaussMedAct effectively addresses medical action evaluation challenges through adaptive spatiotemporal representation learning, showing significant performance improvements and practical applicability in clinical settings.

Abstract: Fine-grained action evaluation in medical vision faces unique challenges due to the unavailability of comprehensive datasets, stringent precision requirements, and insufficient spatiotemporal dynamic modeling of very rapid actions. To support development and evaluation, we introduce CPREval-6k, a multi-view, multi-label medical action benchmark containing 6,372 expert-annotated videos with 22 clinical labels. Using this dataset, we present GaussMedAct, a multivariate Gaussian encoding framework, to advance medical motion analysis through adaptive spatiotemporal representation learning. Multivariate Gaussian Representation projects the joint motions to a temporally scaled multi-dimensional space, and decomposes actions into adaptive 3D Gaussians that serve as tokens. These tokens preserve motion semantics through anisotropic covariance modeling while maintaining robustness to spatiotemporal noise. Hybrid Spatial Encoding, employing a Cartesian and Vector dual-stream strategy, effectively utilizes skeletal information in the form of joint and bone features. The proposed method achieves 92.1% Top-1 accuracy with real-time inference on the benchmark, outperforming the ST-GCN baseline by +5.9% accuracy with only 10% FLOPs. Cross-dataset experiments confirm the superiority of our method in robustness.

*Muzhou Yang,Wuzhou Quan,Mingqiang Wei*

TL;DR: CABIN is a semi-supervised framework that addresses overconfidence in hyperspectral image classification by using epistemic uncertainty estimation and a closed-loop learning process to reduce confirmation bias and improve generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Models in hyperspectral image classification often mistake high predictive confidence for correctness while lacking uncertainty awareness, leading to confirmation bias, especially under sparse annotations or class imbalance where models overfit confident errors.

Method: CABIN uses a closed-loop learning process: 1) perceptual awareness through epistemic uncertainty estimation to identify ambiguous regions, 2) uncertainty-guided dual sampling strategy for exploration and stable pseudo-labels, and 3) fine-grained dynamic assignment strategy to categorize pseudo-labeled data and apply tailored losses.

Result: Experimental results show that various state-of-the-art methods benefit from CABIN integration, with improved labeling efficiency and performance in hyperspectral image classification.

Conclusion: CABIN effectively addresses overconfidence issues in hyperspectral image classification by incorporating uncertainty awareness and dynamic correction mechanisms, leading to better generalization and reduced confirmation bias.

Abstract: Confidence alone is often misleading in hyperspectral image classification, as models tend to mistake high predictive scores for correctness while lacking awareness of uncertainty. This leads to confirmation bias, especially under sparse annotations or class imbalance, where models overfit confident errors and fail to generalize. We propose CABIN (Cognitive-Aware Behavior-Informed learNing), a semi-supervised framework that addresses this limitation through a closed-loop learning process of perception, action, and correction. CABIN first develops perceptual awareness by estimating epistemic uncertainty, identifying ambiguous regions where errors are likely to occur. It then acts by adopting an Uncertainty-Guided Dual Sampling Strategy, selecting uncertain samples for exploration while anchoring confident ones as stable pseudo-labels to reduce bias. To correct noisy supervision, CABIN introduces a Fine-Grained Dynamic Assignment Strategy that categorizes pseudo-labeled data into reliable, ambiguous, and noisy subsets, applying tailored losses to enhance generalization. Experimental results show that a wide range of state-of-the-art methods benefit from the integration of CABIN, with improved labeling efficiency and performance.

TL;DR: VLF-MSC is a unified multimodal semantic communication system that transmits a single vision-language feature to generate both images and text at the receiver, improving spectral efficiency and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semantic communication techniques process each modality separately, requiring multiple streams and reducing spectral efficiency. A unified approach is needed to handle both vision and language modalities efficiently.

Method: Uses a pre-trained vision-language model to encode source images into vision-language semantic features (VLF), transmitted over wireless channels. Receiver uses decoder-based language model and diffusion-based image generator conditioned on VLF.

Result: Outperforms text-only and image-only baselines, achieving higher semantic accuracy for both modalities under low SNR with significantly reduced bandwidth.

Conclusion: VLF-MSC provides an efficient unified framework for multimodal semantic communication that eliminates modality-specific streams while maintaining semantic fidelity and robustness to channel noise.

Abstract: We propose Vision-Language Feature-based Multimodal Semantic Communication (VLF-MSC), a unified system that transmits a single compact vision-language representation to support both image and text generation at the receiver. Unlike existing semantic communication techniques that process each modality separately, VLF-MSC employs a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) to encode the source image into a vision-language semantic feature (VLF), which is transmitted over the wireless channel. At the receiver, a decoder-based language model and a diffusion-based image generator are both conditioned on the VLF to produce a descriptive text and a semantically aligned image. This unified representation eliminates the need for modality-specific streams or retransmissions, improving spectral efficiency and adaptability. By leveraging foundation models, the system achieves robustness to channel noise while preserving semantic fidelity. Experiments demonstrate that VLF-MSC outperforms text-only and image-only baselines, achieving higher semantic accuracy for both modalities under low SNR with significantly reduced bandwidth.

*Xiangyue Zhang,Jianfang Li,Jianqiang Ren,Jiaxu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GlobalDiff is a diffusion-based framework that generates co-speech motion using global joint rotations instead of hierarchical local rotations, eliminating cumulative errors through multi-level structural constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods using hierarchical local joint rotations suffer from cumulative errors causing unstable motions at end-effectors. Global rotations can decouple joint predictions from upstream dependencies.

Method: Proposes GlobalDiff framework operating in global joint rotation space with multi-level constraints: joint structure constraints with virtual anchor points, skeleton structure constraints for angular consistency, and temporal structure constraints using multi-scale variational encoder.

Result: Extensive evaluations show GlobalDiff generates smooth and accurate motions, improving performance by 46.0% compared to state-of-the-art methods under multiple speaker identities.

Conclusion: Operating in global rotation space with proper structural constraints effectively eliminates hierarchical error accumulation and produces more reliable co-speech motion generation.

Abstract: Reliable co-speech motion generation requires precise motion representation and consistent structural priors across all joints. Existing generative methods typically operate on local joint rotations, which are defined hierarchically based on the skeleton structure. This leads to cumulative errors during generation, manifesting as unstable and implausible motions at end-effectors. In this work, we propose GlobalDiff, a diffusion-based framework that operates directly in the space of global joint rotations for the first time, fundamentally decoupling each joint's prediction from upstream dependencies and alleviating hierarchical error accumulation. To compensate for the absence of structural priors in global rotation space, we introduce a multi-level constraint scheme. Specifically, a joint structure constraint introduces virtual anchor points around each joint to better capture fine-grained orientation. A skeleton structure constraint enforces angular consistency across bones to maintain structural integrity. A temporal structure constraint utilizes a multi-scale variational encoder to align the generated motion with ground-truth temporal patterns. These constraints jointly regularize the global diffusion process and reinforce structural awareness. Extensive evaluations on standard co-speech benchmarks show that GlobalDiff generates smooth and accurate motions, improving the performance by 46.0 % compared to the current SOTA under multiple speaker identities.

### [54] [GridPrune: From "Where to Look" to "What to Select" in Visual Token Pruning for MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10081)
*Yuxiang Duan,Ao Li,Yingqin Li,Luyu Li,Pengwei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GridPrune is a visual token pruning method for MLLMs that uses a "guide-globally, select-locally" approach to efficiently allocate attention across spatial zones before fine-grained selection, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual token pruning methods focus only on "what to select" without considering "where to look", leading to inefficient spatial allocation, positional bias, and retention of irrelevant tokens. Human visual cognition uses a two-stage strategy that first determines regions to attend to before detailed processing.

Method: GridPrune replaces global Top-K with a zonal selection system: (1) text-conditional guidance dynamically allocates token budgets across spatial zones, (2) local selection within each budgeted zone. This mimics human visual attention by first determining "where to look" then "what to select".

Result: On LLaVA-NeXT-7B, GridPrune retains 96.98% of full performance while using only 11.1% of tokens, outperforming the best baseline by 2.34% at the same pruning rate. Superior performance demonstrated across various MLLM architectures.

Conclusion: GridPrune's two-stage "guide-globally, select-locally" approach effectively addresses limitations of existing pruning methods by incorporating spatial allocation guidance, achieving significant computational efficiency gains while maintaining high performance in multimodal language models.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in a wide range of vision-language tasks. However, the large number of visual tokens introduces significant computational overhead. To address this issue, visual token pruning has emerged as a key technique for enhancing the efficiency of MLLMs. In cognitive science, humans tend to first determine which regions of a scene to attend to ("where to look") before deciding which specific elements within those regions to process in detail ("what to select"). This two-stage strategy enables the visual system to efficiently allocate attention at a coarse spatial level before performing fine-grained selection. However, existing pruning methods primarily focus on directly optimizing "what to select", typically using attention scores or similarity metrics. They rarely consider "where to look", which has been shown to lead to inefficient spatial allocation, positional bias, and the retention of irrelevant or redundant tokens. In this paper, we propose GridPrune, a method that replaces the global Top-K mechanism with a "guide-globally, select-locally" zonal selection system. GridPrune splits the pruning process into two steps: first, it uses text-conditional guidance to dynamically allocate a token budget across spatial zones; and then, it performs local selection within each budgeted zone. Experimental results demonstrate that GridPrune achieves superior performance across various MLLM architectures. On LLaVA-NeXT-7B, GridPrune retains 96.98% of the full performance while using 11.1% of the tokens, outperforming the best-performing baseline by 2.34% at the same pruning rate.

Result: Experiments on skeleton-based action classification benchmarks demonstrate SUGAR's effectiveness. In zero-shot scenarios, SUGAR outperforms linear-based methods, showing greater versatility.

Conclusion: SUGAR successfully bridges LLMs with skeleton data for action recognition, enabling LLMs to understand skeleton representations and perform accurate action classification and description through visual-motion knowledge transfer.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold rich implicit knowledge and powerful transferability. In this paper, we explore the combination of LLMs with the human skeleton to perform action classification and description. However, when treating LLM as a recognizer, two questions arise: 1) How can LLMs understand skeleton? 2) How can LLMs distinguish among actions? To address these problems, we introduce a novel paradigm named learning Skeleton representation with visUal-motion knowledGe for Action Recognition (SUGAR). In our pipeline, we first utilize off-the-shelf large-scale video models as a knowledge base to generate visual, motion information related to actions. Then, we propose to supervise skeleton learning through this prior knowledge to yield discrete representations. Finally, we use the LLM with untouched pre-training weights to understand these representations and generate the desired action targets and descriptions. Notably, we present a Temporal Query Projection (TQP) module to continuously model the skeleton signals with long sequences. Experiments on several skeleton-based action classification benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our SUGAR. Moreover, experiments on zero-shot scenarios show that SUGAR is more versatile than linear-based methods.

*Zihan Wang,Guansong Pang,Wenjun Miao,Jin Zheng,Xiao Bai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MTAttack is a novel multi-target backdoor attack framework for Large Visual Language Models that enables multiple independent triggers to map to different attack targets in a single training pass, overcoming feature interference challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing backdoor attacks on LVLMs only focus on single-target attacks, but multi-target attacks pose greater real-world threats. The challenge is severe feature interference among different triggers that creates incorrect trigger-target mappings.

Method: Proposed MTAttack with two optimization constraints: Proxy Space Partitioning (maps clean images to unique proxy classes) and Trigger Prototype Anchoring (guarantees trigger separability). Jointly optimizes multiple triggers in latent space.

Result: High success rate for multi-target attacks, substantially outperforming existing methods. Strong generalizability across datasets and robustness against backdoor defense strategies.

Conclusion: LVLMs are vulnerable to multi-target backdoor attacks, highlighting urgent need for mitigation strategies. MTAttack demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of such attacks.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across various vision-language tasks by leveraging large-scale image-text pretraining and instruction tuning. However, the security vulnerabilities of LVLMs have become increasingly concerning, particularly their susceptibility to backdoor attacks. Existing backdoor attacks focus on single-target attacks, i.e., targeting a single malicious output associated with a specific trigger. In this work, we uncover multi-target backdoor attacks, where multiple independent triggers corresponding to different attack targets are added in a single pass of training, posing a greater threat to LVLMs in real-world applications. Executing such attacks in LVLMs is challenging since there can be many incorrect trigger-target mappings due to severe feature interference among different triggers. To address this challenge, we propose MTAttack, the first multi-target backdoor attack framework for enforcing accurate multiple trigger-target mappings in LVLMs. The core of MTAttack is a novel optimization method with two constraints, namely Proxy Space Partitioning constraint and Trigger Prototype Anchoring constraint. It jointly optimizes multiple triggers in the latent space, with each trigger independently mapping clean images to a unique proxy class while at the same time guaranteeing their separability. Experiments on popular benchmarks demonstrate a high success rate of MTAttack for multi-target attacks, substantially outperforming existing attack methods. Furthermore, our attack exhibits strong generalizability across datasets and robustness against backdoor defense strategies. These findings highlight the vulnerability of LVLMs to multi-target backdoor attacks and underscore the urgent need for mitigating such threats.

*Jueun Ko,Hyewon Park,Hyesong Choi,Dongbo Min*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RobIA is a robust, instance-aware framework for continual test-time adaptation in stereo depth estimation that dynamically adapts to domain shifts using attention-based expert routing and pseudo-supervision from a teacher model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in stereo depth estimation including dynamic domain shifts, sparse supervision, and high cost of dense ground-truth labels, while overcoming limitations of existing TTA methods that assume static domains and use input-invariant strategies.

Method: Proposes RobIA with two components: (1) Attend-and-Excite Mixture-of-Experts (AttEx-MoE) that dynamically routes inputs to frozen experts using lightweight self-attention tailored to epipolar geometry, and (2) Robust AdaptBN Teacher that provides dense pseudo-supervision using PEFT-based teacher model to complement sparse handcrafted labels.

Result: Extensive experiments show RobIA achieves superior adaptation performance across dynamic target domains while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: RobIA enables input-specific flexibility and broad supervision coverage, improving generalization under domain shift for stereo depth estimation in real-world environments.

Abstract: Stereo Depth Estimation in real-world environments poses significant challenges due to dynamic domain shifts, sparse or unreliable supervision, and the high cost of acquiring dense ground-truth labels. While recent Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods offer promising solutions, most rely on static target domain assumptions and input-invariant adaptation strategies, limiting their effectiveness under continual shifts. In this paper, we propose RobIA, a novel Robust, Instance-Aware framework for Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) in stereo depth estimation. RobIA integrates two key components: (1) Attend-and-Excite Mixture-of-Experts (AttEx-MoE), a parameter-efficient module that dynamically routes input to frozen experts via lightweight self-attention mechanism tailored to epipolar geometry, and (2) Robust AdaptBN Teacher, a PEFT-based teacher model that provides dense pseudo-supervision by complementing sparse handcrafted labels. This strategy enables input-specific flexibility, broad supervision coverage, improving generalization under domain shift. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RobIA achieves superior adaptation performance across dynamic target domains while maintaining computational efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes CACMI, a context-aware cross-modal interaction framework for dense video captioning that explicitly models temporal coherence and semantic context through cross-modal frame aggregation and context-aware feature enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dense video captioning methods rely on implicit modeling with frame-level or fragmented video features, failing to capture temporal coherence across event sequences and comprehensive semantics within visual contexts.

Method: CACMI framework with two core components: Cross-modal Frame Aggregation that aggregates relevant frames to extract temporally coherent event-aligned textual features through cross-modal retrieval, and Context-aware Feature Enhancement that uses query-guided attention to integrate visual dynamics with pseudo-event semantics.

Result: Extensive experiments on ActivityNet Captions and YouCook2 datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on dense video captioning task.

Conclusion: CACMI effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods by explicitly modeling temporal-semantic relationships through cross-modal interactions, achieving superior performance in dense video captioning.

Abstract: Dense video captioning jointly localizes and captions salient events in untrimmed videos. Recent methods primarily focus on leveraging additional prior knowledge and advanced multi-task architectures to achieve competitive performance. However, these pipelines rely on implicit modeling that uses frame-level or fragmented video features, failing to capture the temporal coherence across event sequences and comprehensive semantics within visual contexts. To address this, we propose an explicit temporal-semantic modeling framework called Context-Aware Cross-Modal Interaction (CACMI), which leverages both latent temporal characteristics within videos and linguistic semantics from text corpus. Specifically, our model consists of two core components: Cross-modal Frame Aggregation aggregates relevant frames to extract temporally coherent, event-aligned textual features through cross-modal retrieval; and Context-aware Feature Enhancement utilizes query-guided attention to integrate visual dynamics with pseudo-event semantics. Extensive experiments on the ActivityNet Captions and YouCook2 datasets demonstrate that CACMI achieves the state-of-the-art performance on dense video captioning task.

*Mayank Vatsa,Aparna Bharati,Richa Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Text-to-image models fail at logical composition involving negation, counting, and spatial relations due to training data gaps, architectural limitations, and flawed evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate why leading text-to-image models struggle with logical composition despite strong performance on individual primitives, exposing fundamental architectural flaws.

Method: Analysis across three core logical primitives (negation, counting, spatial relations) using recent benchmarks, examining training data, attention architectures, and evaluation metrics.

Result: Models show dramatic performance collapse when primitives are combined, with severe interference effects. Training data lacks explicit negations, continuous attention is unsuitable for discrete logic, and metrics prioritize visual plausibility over constraints.

Conclusion: Genuine compositionality requires fundamental advances in representation and reasoning, not incremental adjustments or scaling of current architectures.

Abstract: The architectural blueprint of today's leading text-to-image models contains a fundamental flaw: an inability to handle logical composition. This survey investigates this breakdown across three core primitives-negation, counting, and spatial relations. Our analysis reveals a dramatic performance collapse: models that are accurate on single primitives fail precipitously when these are combined, exposing severe interference. We trace this failure to three key factors. First, training data show a near-total absence of explicit negations. Second, continuous attention architectures are fundamentally unsuitable for discrete logic. Third, evaluation metrics reward visual plausibility over constraint satisfaction. By analyzing recent benchmarks and methods, we show that current solutions and simple scaling cannot bridge this gap. Achieving genuine compositionality, we conclude, will require fundamental advances in representation and reasoning rather than incremental adjustments to existing architectures.

*Zhicheng Cai,Hao Zhu,Linsen Chen,Qiu Shen,Xun Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a split-layer architecture for implicit neural representations that enhances representational capacity by creating high-dimensional feature spaces through parallel branches and Hadamard products, achieving superior performance across multiple tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Implicit neural representations (INR) face limitations in representational capacity due to low-dimensional feature spaces in conventional MLPs, and widening MLPs leads to quadratic growth in computational costs.

Method: Proposes split-layer architecture that divides each MLP layer into parallel branches and integrates outputs via Hadamard product, effectively constructing high-degree polynomial spaces to expand feature dimensionality.

Result: Extensive experiments show split-layer substantially improves INR performance, surpassing existing methods in 2D image fitting, 2D CT reconstruction, 3D shape representation, and 5D novel view synthesis.

Conclusion: The split-layer provides an effective solution to enhance INR's representational capacity without prohibitive computational overhead, demonstrating superior performance across diverse applications.

Abstract: Implicit neural representation (INR) models signals as continuous functions using neural networks, offering efficient and differentiable optimization for inverse problems across diverse disciplines. However, the representational capacity of INR defined by the range of functions the neural network can characterize, is inherently limited by the low-dimensional feature space in conventional multilayer perceptron (MLP) architectures. While widening the MLP can linearly increase feature space dimensionality, it also leads to a quadratic growth in computational and memory costs. To address this limitation, we propose the split-layer, a novel reformulation of MLP construction. The split-layer divides each layer into multiple parallel branches and integrates their outputs via Hadamard product, effectively constructing a high-degree polynomial space. This approach significantly enhances INR's representational capacity by expanding the feature space dimensionality without incurring prohibitive computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the split-layer substantially improves INR performance, surpassing existing methods across multiple tasks, including 2D image fitting, 2D CT reconstruction, 3D shape representation, and 5D novel view synthesis.

*Feng Ding,Wenhui Yi,Yunpeng Zhou,Xinan He,Hong Rao,Shu Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dual-mechanism framework that improves fairness in deepfake detection while maintaining accuracy through structural fairness decoupling and global distribution alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fairness-enhanced deepfake detectors often sacrifice detection accuracy to improve fairness, which is problematic for digital identity security applications where both fairness and accuracy are crucial.

Method: Proposes a dual-mechanism collaborative optimization framework that integrates structural fairness decoupling (decoupling demographic-sensitive channels at architectural level) and global distribution alignment (reducing distance between overall sample distribution and demographic group distributions at feature level).

Result: Experimental results show the framework improves both inter-group and intra-group fairness while maintaining overall detection accuracy across domains, outperforming other methods.

Conclusion: The proposed dual-mechanism framework successfully addresses the fairness-accuracy trade-off in deepfake detection, providing a balanced solution for trustworthy deployment in digital identity security.

Abstract: Fairness is a core element in the trustworthy deployment of deepfake detection models, especially in the field of digital identity security. Biases in detection models toward different demographic groups, such as gender and race, may lead to systemic misjudgments, exacerbating the digital divide and social inequities. However, current fairness-enhanced detectors often improve fairness at the cost of detection accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose a dual-mechanism collaborative optimization framework. Our proposed method innovatively integrates structural fairness decoupling and global distribution alignment: decoupling channels sensitive to demographic groups at the model architectural level, and subsequently reducing the distance between the overall sample distribution and the distributions corresponding to each demographic group at the feature level. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with other methods, our framework improves both inter-group and intra-group fairness while maintaining overall detection accuracy across domains.

*Hao Zou,Runqing Zhang,Xue Zhou,Jianxiao Zou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GEA proposes a generative approach for text-to-image person retrieval using diffusion-generated images as intermediate representations to bridge modality gaps and improve cross-modal alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Textual queries often fail to accurately reflect image content, leading to poor cross-modal alignment and overfitting. The inherent modality gap between text and image makes retrieval challenging.

Method: Uses two parallel modules: Text-Guided Token Enhancement (TGTE) with diffusion-generated images as semantic bridges, and Generative Intermediate Fusion (GIF) combining cross-attention between generated images, original images, and text features.

Result: Extensive experiments on CUHK-PEDES, RSTPReid, and ICFG-PEDES datasets justify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Conclusion: GEA successfully addresses modality gap issues in text-to-image person retrieval through generative enhancement and achieves improved performance on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Text-to-Image Person Retrieval (TIPR) aims to retrieve person images based on natural language descriptions. Although many TIPR methods have achieved promising results, sometimes textual queries cannot accurately and comprehensively reflect the content of the image, leading to poor cross-modal alignment and overfitting to limited datasets. Moreover, the inherent modality gap between text and image further amplifies these issues, making accurate cross-modal retrieval even more challenging. To address these limitations, we propose the Generation-Enhanced Alignment (GEA) from a generative perspective. GEA contains two parallel modules: (1) Text-Guided Token Enhancement (TGTE), which introduces diffusion-generated images as intermediate semantic representations to bridge the gap between text and visual patterns. These generated images enrich the semantic representation of text and facilitate cross-modal alignment. (2) Generative Intermediate Fusion (GIF), which combines cross-attention between generated images, original images, and text features to generate a unified representation optimized by triplet alignment loss. We conduct extensive experiments on three public TIPR datasets, CUHK-PEDES, RSTPReid, and ICFG-PEDES, to evaluate the performance of GEA. The results justify the effectiveness of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world images often contain multiple degradations simultaneously (rain, noise, haze), but most existing methods only handle single degradation types. Current approaches also lack interpretability despite performance improvements through module stacking.

Method: Deep unfolding network mapping mathematical optimization algorithm into learnable structure, using improved second-order semi-smooth Newton algorithm for physical interpretability, and explainable convolution modules inspired by human brain's flexible information processing.

Result: InterIR demonstrates excellent performance in multi-degradation restoration while remaining highly competitive on single-degradation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed interpretability-driven approach successfully addresses multi-degradation image restoration with clear physical interpretability and maintains strong performance across both multi-degradation and single-degradation scenarios.

Abstract: Although image restoration has advanced significantly, most existing methods target only a single type of degradation. In real-world scenarios, images often contain multiple degradations simultaneously, such as rain, noise, and haze, requiring models capable of handling diverse degradation types. Moreover, methods that improve performance through module stacking often suffer from limited interpretability. In this paper, we propose a novel interpretability-driven approach for multi-degradation image restoration, built upon a deep unfolding network that maps the iterative process of a mathematical optimization algorithm into a learnable network structure. Specifically, we employ an improved second-order semi-smooth Newton algorithm to ensure that each module maintains clear physical interpretability. To further enhance interpretability and adaptability, we design an explainable convolution module inspired by the human brain's flexible information processing and the intrinsic characteristics of images, allowing the network to flexibly leverage learned knowledge and autonomously adjust parameters for different input. The resulting tightly integrated architecture, named InterIR, demonstrates excellent performance in multi-degradation restoration while remaining highly competitive on single-degradation tasks.

Abstract: Accurate localization of cephalometric landmarks from 2D lateral skull X-rays is vital for orthodontic diagnosis and treatment. Manual annotation is time-consuming and error-prone, whereas automated approaches often struggle with low contrast and anatomical complexity. This paper introduces CephRes-MHNet, a multi-head residual convolutional network for robust and efficient cephalometric landmark detection.

Conclusion: VISTA generates socially compliant, goal-aware, and interpretable trajectories, making it promising for safety-critical autonomous systems.

Abstract: Multi-agent trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous systems operating in dense, interactive environments. Existing methods often fail to jointly capture agents' long-term goals and their fine-grained social interactions, which leads to unrealistic multi-agent futures. We propose VISTA, a recursive goal-conditioned transformer for multi-agent trajectory forecasting. VISTA combines (i) a cross-attention fusion module that integrates long-horizon intent with past motion, (ii) a social-token attention mechanism for flexible interaction modeling across agents, and (iii) pairwise attention maps that make social influence patterns interpretable at inference time. Our model turns single-agent goal-conditioned prediction into a coherent multi-agent forecasting framework. Beyond standard displacement metrics, we evaluate trajectory collision rates as a measure of joint realism. On the high-density MADRAS benchmark and on SDD, VISTA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and substantially fewer collisions. On MADRAS, it reduces the average collision rate of strong baselines from 2.14 to 0.03 percent, and on SDD it attains zero collisions while improving ADE, FDE, and minFDE. These results show that VISTA generates socially compliant, goal-aware, and interpretable trajectories, making it promising for safety-critical autonomous systems.

Motivation: Previous diffusion-based methods for LiDAR scene completion suffer from significant computational overhead due to multi-step iterative sampling, limiting real-time applicability in autonomous vehicles.

Method: Proposes LiNeXt with Noise-to-Coarse (N2C) Module for single-pass denoising, Refine Module for precise refinement, and Distance-aware Selected Repeat strategy to handle LiDAR's distance-dependent spatial distribution.

Result: Achieves 199.8x inference speedup, 50.7% reduction in Chamfer Distance, and uses only 6.1% parameters compared to LiDiff on SemanticKITTI dataset.

Conclusion: LiNeXt demonstrates superior efficiency and effectiveness for real-time scene completion, making it suitable for autonomous vehicle perception systems.

Abstract: 3D LiDAR scene completion from point clouds is a fundamental component of perception systems in autonomous vehicles. Previous methods have predominantly employed diffusion models for high-fidelity reconstruction. However, their multi-step iterative sampling incurs significant computational overhead, limiting its real-time applicability. To address this, we propose LiNeXt-a lightweight, non-diffusion network optimized for rapid and accurate point cloud completion. Specifically, LiNeXt first applies the Noise-to-Coarse (N2C) Module to denoise the input noisy point cloud in a single pass, thereby obviating the multi-step iterative sampling of diffusion-based methods. The Refine Module then takes the coarse point cloud and its intermediate features from the N2C Module to perform more precise refinement, further enhancing structural completeness. Furthermore, we observe that LiDAR point clouds exhibit a distance-dependent spatial distribution, being densely sampled at proximal ranges and sparsely sampled at distal ranges. Accordingly, we propose the Distance-aware Selected Repeat strategy to generate a more uniformly distributed noisy point cloud. On the SemanticKITTI dataset, LiNeXt achieves a 199.8x speedup in inference, reduces Chamfer Distance by 50.7%, and uses only 6.1% of the parameters compared with LiDiff. These results demonstrate the superior efficiency and effectiveness of LiNeXt for real-time scene completion.

TL;DR: HeatV2X is a scalable V2X collaborative perception framework that addresses multi-modal heterogeneity and scalability challenges through heterogeneous graph attention and efficient fine-tuning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing V2X frameworks struggle with multi-modal heterogeneous agents and lack scalability for accommodating new agents, requiring effective cross-agent feature alignment and scalable adaptation.

Method: Uses heterogeneous graph attention to train a foundation agent, then applies Local Heterogeneous Fine-Tuning with Hetero-Aware Adapters and Global Collaborative Fine-Tuning with Multi-Cognitive Adapter for alignment and interaction.

Result: Achieves superior perception performance on OPV2V-H and DAIR-V2X datasets with significantly reduced training overhead, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: HeatV2X provides an effective solution for scalable V2X collaborative perception that handles heterogeneity while minimizing training costs.

Abstract: Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) collaborative perception extends sensing beyond single vehicle limits through transmission. However, as more agents participate, existing frameworks face two key challenges: (1) the participating agents are inherently multi-modal and heterogeneous, and (2) the collaborative framework must be scalable to accommodate new agents. The former requires effective cross-agent feature alignment to mitigate heterogeneity loss, while the latter renders full-parameter training impractical, highlighting the importance of scalable adaptation. To address these issues, we propose Heterogeneous Adaptation (HeatV2X), a scalable collaborative framework. We first train a high-performance agent based on heterogeneous graph attention as the foundation for collaborative learning. Then, we design Local Heterogeneous Fine-Tuning and Global Collaborative Fine-Tuning to achieve effective alignment and interaction among heterogeneous agents. The former efficiently extracts modality-specific differences using Hetero-Aware Adapters, while the latter employs the Multi-Cognitive Adapter to enhance cross-agent collaboration and fully exploit the fusion potential. These designs enable substantial performance improvement of the collaborative framework with minimal training cost. We evaluate our approach on the OPV2V-H and DAIR-V2X datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior perception performance with significantly reduced training overhead, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches. Our implementation will be released soon.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses limitations of existing methods by enhancing generalization capabilities and improving detection accuracy for both fully manipulated videos and partially spoofed samples through better artifact localization.

Abstract: Recent multimodal deepfake detection methods designed for generalization conjecture that single-stage supervised training struggles to generalize across unseen manipulations and datasets. However, such approaches that target generalization require pretraining over real samples. Additionally, these methods primarily focus on detecting audio-visual inconsistencies and may overlook intra-modal artifacts causing them to fail against manipulations that preserve audio-visual alignment. To address these limitations, we propose a single-stage training framework that enhances generalization by incorporating next-frame prediction for both uni-modal and cross-modal features. Additionally, we introduce a window-level attention mechanism to capture discrepancies between predicted and actual frames, enabling the model to detect local artifacts around every frame, which is crucial for accurately classifying fully manipulated videos and effectively localizing deepfake segments in partially spoofed samples. Our model, evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrates strong generalization and precise temporal localization.

TL;DR: TubeRMC is a framework for weakly-supervised spatio-temporal video grounding that generates text-conditioned tubes and refines them through tube-conditioned reconstruction with spatio-temporal constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of existing weakly-supervised STVG methods that use simple late-fusion and generate tubes independent of text descriptions, leading to target identification failures and inconsistent tracking.

Method: Proposes Tube-conditioned Reconstruction with Mutual Constraints (TubeRMC) that generates text-conditioned candidate tubes using pre-trained visual grounding models and refines them via three reconstruction strategies (temporal, spatial, spatio-temporal) with mutual constraints between spatial and temporal proposals.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on VidSTG and HCSTVG benchmarks and effectively mitigates both target identification errors and inconsistent tracking.

Conclusion: TubeRMC successfully addresses the limitations of previous weakly-supervised STVG approaches by incorporating text-conditioned tube generation and comprehensive reconstruction strategies with mutual constraints.

Abstract: Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding (STVG) aims to localize a spatio-temporal tube that corresponds to a given language query in an untrimmed video. This is a challenging task since it involves complex vision-language understanding and spatiotemporal reasoning. Recent works have explored weakly-supervised setting in STVG to eliminate reliance on fine-grained annotations like bounding boxes or temporal stamps. However, they typically follow a simple late-fusion manner, which generates tubes independent of the text description, often resulting in failed target identification and inconsistent target tracking. To address this limitation, we propose a Tube-conditioned Reconstruction with Mutual Constraints (\textbf{TubeRMC}) framework that generates text-conditioned candidate tubes with pre-trained visual grounding models and further refine them via tube-conditioned reconstruction with spatio-temporal constraints. Specifically, we design three reconstruction strategies from temporal, spatial, and spatio-temporal perspectives to comprehensively capture rich tube-text correspondences. Each strategy is equipped with a Tube-conditioned Reconstructor, utilizing spatio-temporal tubes as condition to reconstruct the key clues in the query. We further introduce mutual constraints between spatial and temporal proposals to enhance their quality for reconstruction. TubeRMC outperforms existing methods on two public benchmarks VidSTG and HCSTVG. Further visualization shows that TubeRMC effectively mitigates both target identification errors and inconsistent tracking.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes JudgeMind, a novel AQA method that simulates professional referees' judgment by segmenting actions into stages, using stage-aware feature enhancement and knowledge-based deduction to improve scoring accuracy and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AQA methods lack interpretability and reliability, and current datasets lack fine-grained annotations for action scores, deduction items, and sub-scores.

Method: Segments action videos into stages, uses stage-aware feature enhancement and fusion, and incorporates a knowledge-based grade-aware decoder with deduction items as prior knowledge.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on the new aerial skiing AQA benchmark with fine-grained annotations.

Conclusion: JudgeMind significantly enhances AQA performance and reliability by mimicking professional referees' scoring process through stage segmentation and deduction-aware scoring.

Abstract: Action Quality Assessment (AQA) aims to evaluate and score sports actions, which has attracted widespread interest in recent years. Existing AQA methods primarily predict scores based on features extracted from the entire video, resulting in limited interpretability and reliability. Meanwhile, existing AQA datasets also lack fine-grained annotations for action scores, especially for deduction items and sub-score annotations. In this paper, we construct the first AQA dataset containing fine-grained sub-score and deduction annotations for aerial skiing, which will be released as a new benchmark. For the technical challenges, we propose a novel AQA method, named JudgeMind, which significantly enhances performance and reliability by simulating the judgment and scoring mindset of professional referees. Our method segments the input action video into different stages and scores each stage to enhance accuracy. Then, we propose a stage-aware feature enhancement and fusion module to boost the perception of stage-specific key regions and enhance the robustness to visual changes caused by frequent camera viewpoints switching. In addition, we propose a knowledge-based grade-aware decoder to incorporate possible deduction items as prior knowledge to predict more accurate and reliable scores. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: Facial-R1 is a three-stage alignment framework that addresses hallucinated reasoning and misalignment issues in Facial Emotion Analysis using instruction fine-tuning, reinforcement training, and iterative data synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Vision-Language Models in Facial Emotion Analysis suffer from hallucinated reasoning (generating plausible but inaccurate explanations) and misalignment between emotion reasoning and recognition due to insufficient emotion-specific knowledge and fragmented connections between facial features and labels.

Method: Three-stage framework: 1) Instruction fine-tuning for basic emotional reasoning capability, 2) Reinforcement training guided by emotion and Action Unit labels as reward signals to align reasoning with predicted emotion, 3) Iterative data synthesis pipeline that expands training dataset for scalable self-improvement.

Result: Facial-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance across eight standard benchmarks in Facial Emotion Analysis, with strong generalization and robust interpretability. Introduced FEA-20K dataset with 17,737 training and 1,688 test samples.

Conclusion: The proposed three-stage alignment framework effectively addresses hallucinated reasoning and misalignment challenges in Facial Emotion Analysis, demonstrating superior performance, generalization capability, and interpretability compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Facial Emotion Analysis (FEA) extends traditional facial emotion recognition by incorporating explainable, fine-grained reasoning. The task integrates three subtasks: emotion recognition, facial Action Unit (AU) recognition, and AU-based emotion reasoning to model affective states jointly. While recent approaches leverage Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and achieve promising results, they face two critical limitations: (1) hallucinated reasoning, where VLMs generate plausible but inaccurate explanations due to insufficient emotion-specific knowledge; and (2) misalignment between emotion reasoning and recognition, caused by fragmented connections between observed facial features and final labels. We propose Facial-R1, a three-stage alignment framework that effectively addresses both challenges with minimal supervision. First, we employ instruction fine-tuning to establish basic emotional reasoning capability. Second, we introduce reinforcement training guided by emotion and AU labels as reward signals, which explicitly aligns the generated reasoning process with the predicted emotion. Third, we design a data synthesis pipeline that iteratively leverages the prior stages to expand the training dataset, enabling scalable self-improvement of the model. Built upon this framework, we introduce FEA-20K, a benchmark dataset comprising 17,737 training and 1,688 test samples with fine-grained emotion analysis annotations. Extensive experiments across eight standard benchmarks demonstrate that Facial-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance in FEA, with strong generalization and robust interpretability.

TL;DR: H3Former is a token-to-region framework for fine-grained visual classification that uses high-order semantic relations and hyperbolic hierarchical contrastive learning to better capture discriminative features while reducing redundancy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FGVC methods fail to comprehensively capture discriminative cues and introduce category-agnostic redundancy, limiting their effectiveness in handling subtle inter-class differences and large intra-class variations.

Method: Proposes Semantic-Aware Aggregation Module (SAAM) that constructs weighted hypergraphs among tokens using multi-scale contextual cues, and Hyperbolic Hierarchical Contrastive Loss (HHCL) that enforces hierarchical semantic constraints in non-Euclidean space.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on four standard FGVC benchmarks validate the superiority of the H3Former framework over existing approaches.

Conclusion: H3Former effectively addresses limitations of previous FGVC methods by leveraging high-order semantic relations and hyperbolic hierarchical contrastive learning, achieving improved performance on fine-grained visual classification tasks.

Abstract: Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) remains a challenging task due to subtle inter-class differences and large intra-class variations. Existing approaches typically rely on feature-selection mechanisms or region-proposal strategies to localize discriminative regions for semantic analysis. However, these methods often fail to capture discriminative cues comprehensively while introducing substantial category-agnostic redundancy. To address these limitations, we propose H3Former, a novel token-to-region framework that leverages high-order semantic relations to aggregate local fine-grained representations with structured region-level modeling. Specifically, we propose the Semantic-Aware Aggregation Module (SAAM), which exploits multi-scale contextual cues to dynamically construct a weighted hypergraph among tokens. By applying hypergraph convolution, SAAM captures high-order semantic dependencies and progressively aggregates token features into compact region-level representations. Furthermore, we introduce the Hyperbolic Hierarchical Contrastive Loss (HHCL), which enforces hierarchical semantic constraints in a non-Euclidean embedding space. The HHCL enhances inter-class separability and intra-class consistency while preserving the intrinsic hierarchical relationships among fine-grained categories. Comprehensive experiments conducted on four standard FGVC benchmarks validate the superiority of our H3Former framework.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PROPA introduces a novel framework combining Monte Carlo Tree Search with GRPO to generate dense process-level rewards for optimizing visual reasoning in VLMs without human annotations, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs struggle with complex visual reasoning where early errors cascade through multi-step dependencies. Current methods either require costly step-level annotations (SFT) or provide only sparse outcome-level feedback (RLVR), limiting stable optimization.

Method: PROPA integrates MCTS with GRPO to generate dense process-level rewards, interleaves GRPO updates with SFT to overcome cold-start problem, and trains a Process Reward Model to guide inference-time search.

Result: Across seven benchmarks and four VLM backbones, PROPA consistently outperforms SFT- and RLVR-based baselines, achieving up to 17.0% gains on in-domain tasks and 21.0% gains on out-of-domain tasks compared to state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: PROPA establishes strong reasoning and generalization capability for visual reasoning tasks by enabling optimization at each intermediate step without human annotations through dense process-level rewards.

Abstract: Despite significant progress, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) still struggle with complex visual reasoning, where multi-step dependencies cause early errors to cascade through the reasoning chain. Existing post-training paradigms are limited: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) relies on costly step-level annotations, while Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) methods like GRPO provide only sparse, outcome-level feedback, hindering stable optimization. We introduce PROPA (Process-level Reasoning Optimization with interleaved Policy Alignment), a novel framework that integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with GRPO to generate dense, process-level rewards and optimize reasoning at each intermediate step without human annotations. To overcome the cold-start problem, PROPA interleaves GRPO updates with SFT, enabling the model to learn from both successful and failed reasoning trajectories. A Process Reward Model (PRM) is further trained to guide inference-time search, aligning the test-time search with the training signal. Across seven benchmarks and four VLM backbones, PROPA consistently outperforms both SFT- and RLVR-based baselines. It achieves up to 17.0% gains on in-domain tasks and 21.0% gains on out-of-domain tasks compared to existing state-of-the-art, establishing a strong reasoning and generalization capability for visual reasoning tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RUDDER is a low-overhead framework that mitigates object hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models by using visual evidence vectors extracted during standard forward passes and adaptive token-wise injection, achieving comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing inference-time interventions for mitigating object hallucination in LVLMs suffer from substantial computational overhead, typically requiring extra forward passes, which limits their practicality for real-world, latency-sensitive deployments.

Method: RUDDER uses two key innovations: (1) Contextual Activation Residual Direction (CARD) vector - a per-sample visual evidence vector extracted from residual updates of self-attention layers during standard forward passes, and (2) A Bayesian-inspired adaptive gate that performs token-wise injection with corrective signal strength conditioned on model deviation from visual context.

Result: Extensive experiments on hallucination benchmarks (POPE and CHAIR) show RUDDER achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while introducing negligible computational latency.

Conclusion: RUDDER provides a pragmatic and effective approach for improving LVLMs' reliability without significant efficiency compromise, making it suitable for real-world deployments.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) often suffer from object hallucination, generating text inconsistent with visual inputs, which can critically undermine their reliability. Existing inference-time interventions to mitigate this issue present a challenging trade-off: while methods that steer internal states or adjust output logits can be effective, they often incur substantial computational overhead, typically requiring extra forward passes. This efficiency bottleneck can limit their practicality for real-world, latency-sensitive deployments. In this work, we aim to address this trade-off with Residual-Update Directed DEcoding Regulation (RUDDER), a low-overhead framework that steers LVLMs towards visually-grounded generation. RUDDER is built on two key innovations: (1) Contextual Activation Residual Direction (CARD) vector, a per-sample visual evidence vector extracted from the residual update of a self-attention layer during a single, standard forward pass. (2) A Bayesian-inspired adaptive gate that performs token-wise injection, applying a corrective signal whose strength is conditioned on the model's deviation from the visual context. Extensive experiments on key hallucination benchmarks, including POPE and CHAIR, indicate that RUDDER achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while introducing negligible computational latency, validating RUDDER as a pragmatic and effective approach for improving LVLMs' reliability without a significant compromise on efficiency.

TL;DR: GRAM is a test-time adaptation framework for satellite-based slum segmentation that uses Mixture-of-Experts to generalize across regions without requiring target region labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Satellite-based slum mapping is promising for global poverty estimation, but morphological heterogeneity of informal settlements prevents models trained on specific regions from generalizing to unseen locations.

Method: Two-phase test-time adaptation framework with Mixture-of-Experts architecture: uses million-scale satellite imagery from 12 cities across 4 continents for source training, captures region-specific characteristics while learning universal features through shared backbone, and filters unreliable pseudo-labels during adaptation.

Result: GRAM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in low-resource settings like African cities, demonstrating robust generalization to previously unseen regions.

Conclusion: GRAM provides a scalable and label-efficient solution for global slum mapping and data-driven urban planning by enabling robust slum segmentation without requiring labeled data from target regions.

Abstract: Satellite-based slum segmentation holds significant promise in generating global estimates of urban poverty. However, the morphological heterogeneity of informal settlements presents a major challenge, hindering the ability of models trained on specific regions to generalize effectively to unseen locations. To address this, we introduce a large-scale high-resolution dataset and propose GRAM (Generalized Region-Aware Mixture-of-Experts), a two-phase test-time adaptation framework that enables robust slum segmentation without requiring labeled data from target regions. We compile a million-scale satellite imagery dataset from 12 cities across four continents for source training. Using this dataset, the model employs a Mixture-of-Experts architecture to capture region-specific slum characteristics while learning universal features through a shared backbone. During adaptation, prediction consistency across experts filters out unreliable pseudo-labels, allowing the model to generalize effectively to previously unseen regions. GRAM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in low-resource settings such as African cities, offering a scalable and label-efficient solution for global slum mapping and data-driven urban planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inherent mismatch between text and vision modalities in LLaVA architecture by enabling LLMs to serve as both language models and vision encoders.

Method: Three key modifications: (1) learning separate QKV projections for vision modality, (2) enabling bidirectional attention on visual tokens, and (3) incorporating both global and local visual representations.

Result: LLaViT significantly outperforms baseline LLaVA method on multiple benchmarks and even surpasses models with double its parameter count.

Conclusion: LLaViT establishes a more effective approach to vision-language modeling by enabling LLMs to simultaneously function as vision encoders.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of the LLaVA architecture for vision-language tasks, its design inherently struggles to effectively integrate visual features due to the inherent mismatch between text and vision modalities. We tackle this issue from a novel perspective in which the LLM not only serves as a language model but also a powerful vision encoder. To this end, we present LLaViT - Large Language Models as extended Vision Transformers - which enables the LLM to simultaneously function as a vision encoder through three key modifications: (1) learning separate QKV projections for vision modality, (2) enabling bidirectional attention on visual tokens, and (3) incorporating both global and local visual representations. Through extensive controlled experiments on a wide range of LLMs, we demonstrate that LLaViT significantly outperforms the baseline LLaVA method on a multitude of benchmarks, even surpassing models with double its parameter count, establishing a more effective approach to vision-language modeling.

TL;DR: This paper proposes new metrics for pedestrian detection evaluation that categorize errors into eight types using image segmentation, enabling more fine-grained and safety-critical performance comparison between models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pedestrian detection benchmarks have weaknesses in realistic performance evaluation, as existing metrics don't properly distinguish between different types of errors that have varying safety implications.

Method: The authors use image segmentation to automatically distinguish between eight different error categories for pedestrian detection and propose new metrics for performance comparison along these categories. They apply these metrics to compare various backbones for a simplified version of APD.

Result: The proposed metrics enable more fine-grained and robust model comparison, particularly for safety-critical performance. The authors achieve state-of-the-art results on CityPersons-reasonable dataset without using extra training data, using a simple architecture.

Conclusion: The new error categorization and metrics provide a more realistic evaluation framework for pedestrian detection systems, especially important for automated driving applications where safety-critical performance assessment is crucial.

Abstract: Reliable pedestrian detection represents a crucial step towards automated driving systems. However, the current performance benchmarks exhibit weaknesses. The currently applied metrics for various subsets of a validation dataset prohibit a realistic performance evaluation of a DNN for pedestrian detection. As image segmentation supplies fine-grained information about a street scene, it can serve as a starting point to automatically distinguish between different types of errors during the evaluation of a pedestrian detector. In this work, eight different error categories for pedestrian detection are proposed and new metrics are proposed for performance comparison along these error categories. We use the new metrics to compare various backbones for a simplified version of the APD, and show a more fine-grained and robust way to compare models with each other especially in terms of safety-critical performance. We achieve SOTA on CityPersons-reasonable (without extra training data) by using a rather simple architecture.

TL;DR: CLIP4VI-ReID is a novel network for visible-infrared person re-identification that uses CLIP-driven modality-shared representation learning with text semantics as a bridge between visible and infrared modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the huge gap in physical characteristics between natural visible images and infrared images in VI-ReID tasks, enabling effective cross-modal alignment and representation learning.

Method: Proposes three components: Text Semantic Generation (TSG) for visible-text alignment, Infrared Feature Embedding (IFE) to inject ID-related semantics into infrared features using text, and High-level Semantic Alignment (HSA) to refine semantic alignment and enhance discriminability.

Result: Extensive experiments show CLIP4VI-ReID achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on widely used VI-ReID datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively bridges the visible-infrared modality gap using text semantics as an intermediate representation, achieving accurate cross-modal alignment and learning highly discriminative modality-shared representations.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel CLIP-driven modality-shared representation learning network named CLIP4VI-ReID for VI-ReID task, which consists of Text Semantic Generation (TSG), Infrared Feature Embedding (IFE), and High-level Semantic Alignment (HSA). Specifically, considering the huge gap in the physical characteristics between natural images and infrared images, the TSG is designed to generate text semantics only for visible images, thereby enabling preliminary visible-text modality alignment. Then, the IFE is proposed to rectify the feature embeddings of infrared images using the generated text semantics. This process injects id-related semantics into the shared image encoder, enhancing its adaptability to the infrared modality. Besides, with text serving as a bridge, it enables indirect visible-infrared modality alignment. Finally, the HSA is established to refine the high-level semantic alignment. This process ensures that the fine-tuned text semantics only contain id-related information, thereby achieving more accurate cross-modal alignment and enhancing the discriminability of the learned modal-shared representations. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CLIP4VI-ReID achieves superior performance than other state-of-the-art methods on some widely used VI-ReID datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to handle extreme depth variations in scenes, leading to inaccurate depth estimation in distant areas and structural degradation in close-range regions.

Method: Two core components: (1) Depth-of-field Supervision using scale-recovered monocular depth estimator and defocus convolution with depth-of-field loss; (2) Multi-View Consistency Supervision using LoFTR-based feature matching and least squares optimization for depth consistency.

Result: Achieves 0.8 dB PSNR improvement over state-of-the-art on Waymo Open Dataset, demonstrating superior depth fidelity in both far-field and near-field regions.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges physical imaging principles with learning-based depth regularization, providing a scalable solution for complex depth stratification in urban environments.

Abstract: Three-dimensional reconstruction in scenes with extreme depth variations remains challenging due to inconsistent supervisory signals between near-field and far-field regions. Existing methods fail to simultaneously address inaccurate depth estimation in distant areas and structural degradation in close-range regions. This paper proposes a novel computational framework that integrates depth-of-field supervision and multi-view consistency supervision to advance 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our approach comprises two core components: (1) Depth-of-field Supervision employs a scale-recovered monocular depth estimator (e.g., Metric3D) to generate depth priors, leverages defocus convolution to synthesize physically accurate defocused images, and enforces geometric consistency through a novel depth-of-field loss, thereby enhancing depth fidelity in both far-field and near-field regions; (2) Multi-View Consistency Supervision employing LoFTR-based semi-dense feature matching to minimize cross-view geometric errors and enforce depth consistency via least squares optimization of reliable matched points. By unifying defocus physics with multi-view geometric constraints, our method achieves superior depth fidelity, demonstrating a 0.8 dB PSNR improvement over the state-of-the-art method on the Waymo Open Dataset. This framework bridges physical imaging principles and learning-based depth regularization, offering a scalable solution for complex depth stratification in urban environments.

TL;DR: DSANet is a novel weakly-supervised video anomaly detection method that disentangles abnormal and normal features through self-guided normality modeling and decoupled contrastive semantic alignment, achieving state-of-the-art performance on XD-Violence and UCF-Crime benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods tend to detect only the most salient anomalous segments while neglecting diverse normal patterns, and suffer from category confusion due to similar appearances, leading to unsatisfactory fine-grained classification results.

Method: Proposes DSANet with two key components: 1) Self-guided normality modeling branch that reconstructs video features using learned normal prototypes to separate normal patterns from anomalies; 2) Decoupled contrastive semantic alignment that temporally decomposes videos into event-centric and background-centric components for enhanced class-discriminative representations.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on XD-Violence and UCF-Crime benchmarks demonstrate that DSANet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed disentangled semantic alignment approach effectively enhances the distinguishability between abnormal and normal features at both coarse-grained and fine-grained levels, achieving superior performance in weakly-supervised video anomaly detection.

Abstract: Recent advancements in weakly-supervised video anomaly detection have achieved remarkable performance by applying the multiple instance learning paradigm based on multimodal foundation models such as CLIP to highlight anomalous instances and classify categories. However, their objectives may tend to detect the most salient response segments, while neglecting to mine diverse normal patterns separated from anomalies, and are prone to category confusion due to similar appearance, leading to unsatisfactory fine-grained classification results. Therefore, we propose a novel Disentangled Semantic Alignment Network (DSANet) to explicitly separate abnormal and normal features from coarse-grained and fine-grained aspects, enhancing the distinguishability. Specifically, at the coarse-grained level, we introduce a self-guided normality modeling branch that reconstructs input video features under the guidance of learned normal prototypes, encouraging the model to exploit normality cues inherent in the video, thereby improving the temporal separation of normal patterns and anomalous events. At the fine-grained level, we present a decoupled contrastive semantic alignment mechanism, which first temporally decomposes each video into event-centric and background-centric components using frame-level anomaly scores and then applies visual-language contrastive learning to enhance class-discriminative representations. Comprehensive experiments on two standard benchmarks, namely XD-Violence and UCF-Crime, demonstrate that DSANet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CLIP-based methods overlook feature distribution structure and frequency-domain characteristics crucial for robustness in single domain generalization.

Method: Integrates von Mises-Fisher distribution for directional feature modeling and Fourier-based augmentation with amplitude/phase perturbation to simulate domain shifts.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on diverse weather-driving benchmark, achieving better cross-domain generalization.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enhances SDG object detection by combining semantic alignment with structural and frequency-domain robustness.

Abstract: Single Domain Generalization (SDG) for object detection aims to train a model on a single source domain that can generalize effectively to unseen target domains. While recent methods like CLIP-based semantic augmentation have shown promise, they often overlook the underlying structure of feature distributions and frequency-domain characteristics that are critical for robustness. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that enhances SDG object detection by integrating the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution and Fourier transformation into a CLIP-guided pipeline. Specifically, we model the directional features of object representations using vMF to better capture domain-invariant semantic structures in the embedding space. Additionally, we introduce a Fourier-based augmentation strategy that perturbs amplitude and phase components to simulate domain shifts in the frequency domain, further improving feature robustness. Our method not only preserves the semantic alignment benefits of CLIP but also enriches feature diversity and structural consistency across domains. Extensive experiments on the diverse weather-driving benchmark demonstrate that our approach outperforms the existing state-of-the-art method.

The DermAI clinical dataset, encompasses a wide range of skin tones, ethinicity and source devices. In preliminary experiments, models trained on public datasets failed to generalize to our samples, while fine-tuning with local data improved performance. These results highlight the importance of standardized, diverse data collection aligned with healthcare needs and oriented to machine learning development.

Motivation: Geospatial foundation models often fail in underrepresented environments during pretraining, creating reliability issues for climate-sensitive applications.

Method: Integrates three complementary signals: OOD detection in input space, OOD detection in embedding space, and task-specific predictive uncertainty.

Result: OOD scores correlate with lower performance in specific environmental conditions, uncertainty flags help discard poor predictions, and failures concentrate in underrepresented geographies like low-elevation zones and large river areas.

Conclusion: SHRUG-FM enables safer and more interpretable deployment of geospatial foundation models, bridging the gap between benchmark performance and real-world reliability.

Abstract: Geospatial foundation models for Earth observation often fail to perform reliably in environments underrepresented during pretraining. We introduce SHRUG-FM, a framework for reliability-aware prediction that integrates three complementary signals: out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in the input space, OOD detection in the embedding space and task-specific predictive uncertainty. Applied to burn scar segmentation, SHRUG-FM shows that OOD scores correlate with lower performance in specific environmental conditions, while uncertainty-based flags help discard many poorly performing predictions. Linking these flags to land cover attributes from HydroATLAS shows that failures are not random but concentrated in certain geographies, such as low-elevation zones and large river areas, likely due to underrepresentation in pretraining data. SHRUG-FM provides a pathway toward safer and more interpretable deployment of GFMs in climate-sensitive applications, helping bridge the gap between benchmark performance and real-world reliability.

TL;DR: MSGNav is a zero-shot navigation system that uses Multi-modal 3D Scene Graphs (M3DSG) to preserve visual cues and addresses the last-mile problem with visibility-based viewpoint decision, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot navigation methods compress visual observations into text-only relations, leading to high construction cost, irreversible visual loss, and constrained vocabularies. Real-world deployment requires open vocabulary generalization and low training overhead.

Method: Introduces M3DSG with visual relational edges, Key Subgraph Selection for efficient reasoning, Adaptive Vocabulary Update for open vocabulary, Closed-Loop Reasoning for exploration, and Visibility-based Viewpoint Decision for last-mile problem.

Result: MSGNav achieves state-of-the-art performance on GOAT-Bench and HM3D-OVON datasets, demonstrating superior zero-shot navigation capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed MSGNav system effectively addresses limitations of existing zero-shot methods by preserving visual evidence and explicitly solving the last-mile problem, enabling practical real-world robotic navigation.

Abstract: Embodied navigation is a fundamental capability for robotic agents operating. Real-world deployment requires open vocabulary generalization and low training overhead, motivating zero-shot methods rather than task-specific RL training. However, existing zero-shot methods that build explicit 3D scene graphs often compress rich visual observations into text-only relations, leading to high construction cost, irreversible loss of visual evidence, and constrained vocabularies. To address these limitations, we introduce the Multi-modal 3D Scene Graph (M3DSG), which preserves visual cues by replacing textual relational edges with dynamically assigned images. Built on M3DSG, we propose MSGNav, a zero-shot navigation system that includes a Key Subgraph Selection module for efficient reasoning, an Adaptive Vocabulary Update module for open vocabulary support, and a Closed-Loop Reasoning module for accurate exploration reasoning. Additionally, we further identify the last-mile problem in zero-shot navigation - determining the feasible target location with a suitable final viewpoint, and propose a Visibility-based Viewpoint Decision module to explicitly resolve it. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that MSGNav achieves state-of-the-art performance on GOAT-Bench and HM3D-OVON datasets. The open-source code will be publicly available.

*Zhen Chen,Yi Zhang,Xiangyu Yin,Chengxuan Qin,Xingyu Zhao,Xiaowei Huang,Wenjie Ruan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Current AI photo protection methods like Anti-DreamBooth are vulnerable to simple image filtering attacks, failing to provide reliable privacy protection against facial identity leakage in personalized AI applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the privacy risks in personalized AI applications where user photos can be used to generate customized content, exposing users to facial identity leakage despite existing defense mechanisms.

Method: Proposed AntiDB_Purify evaluation framework to systematically test existing defense methods under realistic purification threats including traditional image filters and adversarial purification techniques.

Result: All current defense methods fail to maintain protective effectiveness when subjected to purification attacks - adversarial perturbations are easily removed, allowing models to memorize and reproduce user identities.

Conclusion: Existing defenses provide only a false sense of security, highlighting the urgent need for more imperceptible and robust protection methods to safeguard user identity in personalized generation systems.

Abstract: Personalized AI applications such as DreamBooth enable the generation of customized content from user images, but also raise significant privacy concerns, particularly the risk of facial identity leakage. Recent defense mechanisms like Anti-DreamBooth attempt to mitigate this risk by injecting adversarial perturbations into user photos to prevent successful personalization. However, we identify two critical yet overlooked limitations of these methods. First, the adversarial examples often exhibit perceptible artifacts such as conspicuous patterns or stripes, making them easily detectable as manipulated content. Second, the perturbations are highly fragile, as even a simple, non-learned filter can effectively remove them, thereby restoring the model's ability to memorize and reproduce user identity. To investigate this vulnerability, we propose a novel evaluation framework, AntiDB_Purify, to systematically evaluate existing defenses under realistic purification threats, including both traditional image filters and adversarial purification. Results reveal that none of the current methods maintains their protective effectiveness under such threats. These findings highlight that current defenses offer a false sense of security and underscore the urgent need for more imperceptible and robust protections to safeguard user identity in personalized generation.

Result: Extensive experiments on CULane, Tusimple, and LLAMAS benchmarks show SAMIRO consistently improves performance across different models and datasets.

Conclusion: SAMIRO effectively enhances lane detection performance by knowledge transfer from pretrained models while maintaining spatial information, demonstrating consistent improvements across various approaches.

Abstract: Lane detection is an important topic in the future mobility solutions. Real-world environmental challenges such as background clutter, varying illumination, and occlusions pose significant obstacles to effective lane detection, particularly when relying on data-driven approaches that require substantial effort and cost for data collection and annotation. To address these issues, lane detection methods must leverage contextual and global information from surrounding lanes and objects. In this paper, we propose a Spatial Attention Mutual Information Regularization with a pre-trained model as an Oracle, called SAMIRO. SAMIRO enhances lane detection performance by transferring knowledge from a pretrained model while preserving domain-agnostic spatial information. Leveraging SAMIRO's plug-and-play characteristic, we integrate it into various state-of-the-art lane detection approaches and conduct extensive experiments on major benchmarks such as CULane, Tusimple, and LLAMAS. The results demonstrate that SAMIRO consistently improves performance across different models and datasets. The code will be made available upon publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a cost-effective vegetation monitoring solution that doesn't require real satellite images or in-situ labels for training, while maintaining accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods.

Method: Transformer-VAE architecture with PROSAIL radiative transfer model as differentiable physical decoder, trained exclusively on simulated data to infer physically plausible leaf and canopy properties.

Result: Achieved accurate retrieval of leaf area index (LAI) and canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) on real-world datasets (FRM4Veg and BelSAR) with performance comparable to models trained with real Sentinel-2 data.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates successful integration of physical models with deep networks for vegetation monitoring, offering a self-supervised solution that requires no in-situ labels or calibration on real images.

Abstract: Accurate retrieval of vegetation biophysical variables from satellite imagery is crucial for ecosystem monitoring and agricultural management. In this work, we propose a physics-informed Transformer-VAE architecture to invert the PROSAIL radiative transfer model for simultaneous estimation of key canopy parameters from Sentinel-2 data. Unlike previous hybrid approaches that require real satellite images for self-supevised training. Our model is trained exclusively on simulated data, yet achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art methods that utilize real imagery. The Transformer-VAE incorporates the PROSAIL model as a differentiable physical decoder, ensuring that inferred latent variables correspond to physically plausible leaf and canopy properties. We demonstrate retrieval of leaf area index (LAI) and canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) on real-world field datasets (FRM4Veg and BelSAR) with accuracy comparable to models trained with real Sentinel-2 data. Our method requires no in-situ labels or calibration on real images, offering a cost-effective and self-supervised solution for global vegetation monitoring. The proposed approach illustrates how integrating physical models with advanced deep networks can improve the inversion of RTMs, opening new prospects for large-scale, physically-constrained remote sensing of vegetation traits.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world documents often feature complex layouts with multi-level tables, embedded images/formulas, and cross-page structures that remain challenging for existing OCR systems, limiting document intelligence applications like information extraction and automated analysis.

Method: Two-stage parsing pipeline: 1) Large multimodal model jointly predicts document layout and reading order using visual information; 2) Localized recognition of text, formulas, and tables within detected regions. Specialized modules for visual consistency-based RL, image-decoupled table parsing, and type-guided table merging handle complex table structures.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on OmniDocBench v1.5, outperforming PPOCR-VL and MinerU 2.5 while showing exceptional robustness in visually complex document scenarios.

Conclusion: MonkeyOCR v1.5 provides an effective unified framework for parsing complex documents with improved layout understanding and content recognition capabilities, particularly excelling at handling challenging table structures and cross-page elements.

Abstract: Document parsing is a core task in document intelligence, supporting applications such as information extraction, retrieval-augmented generation, and automated document analysis. However, real-world documents often feature complex layouts with multi-level tables, embedded images or formulas, and cross-page structures, which remain challenging for existing OCR systems. We introduce MonkeyOCR v1.5, a unified vision-language framework that enhances both layout understanding and content recognition through a two-stage parsing pipeline. The first stage employs a large multimodal model to jointly predict document layout and reading order, leveraging visual information to ensure structural and sequential consistency. The second stage performs localized recognition of text, formulas, and tables within detected regions, maintaining high visual fidelity while reducing error propagation. To address complex table structures, we propose a visual consistency-based reinforcement learning scheme that evaluates recognition quality via render-and-compare alignment, improving structural accuracy without manual annotations. Additionally, two specialized modules, Image-Decoupled Table Parsing and Type-Guided Table Merging, are introduced to enable reliable parsing of tables containing embedded images and reconstruction of tables crossing pages or columns. Comprehensive experiments on OmniDocBench v1.5 demonstrate that MonkeyOCR v1.5 achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming PPOCR-VL and MinerU 2.5 while showing exceptional robustness in visually complex document scenarios.

TL;DR: GrounDiff is a diffusion-based framework for generating Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) from Digital Surface Models (DSMs) by iteratively removing non-ground structures as a denoising task, with gated design and confidence-guided filtering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional DTM generation methods rely on manually tuned parameters or require complex deep learning architectures with post-processing, creating challenges in automation and performance.

Method: Proposes Ground Diffusion (GrounDiff) framework using diffusion models for denoising DSMs, with gated design and confidence-guided generation. Introduces Prior-Guided Stitching (PrioStitch) for scalability using downsampled global priors to guide local predictions.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing RMSE by up to 93% on ALS2DTM and 47% on USGS benchmarks. For road reconstruction, achieves 81% lower distance error on GeRoD benchmark while maintaining competitive smoothness.

Conclusion: GrounDiff provides an effective diffusion-based approach for DTM generation that eliminates the need for manual parameter tuning and complex architectures, achieving superior performance across multiple benchmarks and applications.

Abstract: Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) represent the bare-earth elevation and are important in numerous geospatial applications. Such data models cannot be directly measured by sensors and are typically generated from Digital Surface Models (DSMs) derived from LiDAR or photogrammetry. Traditional filtering approaches rely on manually tuned parameters, while learning-based methods require well-designed architectures, often combined with post-processing. To address these challenges, we introduce Ground Diffusion (GrounDiff), the first diffusion-based framework that iteratively removes non-ground structures by formulating the problem as a denoising task. We incorporate a gated design with confidence-guided generation that enables selective filtering. To increase scalability, we further propose Prior-Guided Stitching (PrioStitch), which employs a downsampled global prior automatically generated using GrounDiff to guide local high-resolution predictions. We evaluate our method on the DSM-to-DTM translation task across diverse datasets, showing that GrounDiff consistently outperforms deep learning-based state-of-the-art methods, reducing RMSE by up to 93% on ALS2DTM and up to 47% on USGS benchmarks. In the task of road reconstruction, which requires both high precision and smoothness, our method achieves up to 81% lower distance error compared to specialized techniques on the GeRoD benchmark, while maintaining competitive surface smoothness using only DSM inputs, without task-specific optimization. Our variant for road reconstruction, GrounDiff+, is specifically designed to produce even smoother surfaces, further surpassing state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an integrated framework combining YOLOMS with LLM for wind turbine fault detection, achieving 90.6% accuracy and generating interpretable maintenance reports.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fault detection methods lack semantic interpretability and fail to support maintenance decision-making, limiting their practical utility.

Method: Uses YOLOMS with multi-scale detection and sliding-window cropping for feature extraction, plus a KV mapping module to convert visual outputs to structured text, followed by domain-tuned LLM for semantic reasoning.

Result: Achieves 90.6% fault detection accuracy and generates maintenance reports with 89% average accuracy on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The framework improves diagnostic interpretability and provides practical decision support for wind turbine operation and maintenance.

Abstract: The health condition of wind turbine (WT) components is crucial for ensuring stable and reliable operation. However, existing fault detection methods are largely limited to visual recognition, producing structured outputs that lack semantic interpretability and fail to support maintenance decision-making. To address these limitations, this study proposes an integrated framework that combines YOLOMS with a large language model (LLM) for intelligent fault analysis and diagnosis. Specifically, YOLOMS employs multi-scale detection and sliding-window cropping to enhance fault feature extraction, while a lightweight key-value (KV) mapping module bridges the gap between visual outputs and textual inputs. This module converts YOLOMS detection results into structured textual representations enriched with both qualitative and quantitative attributes. A domain-tuned LLM then performs semantic reasoning to generate interpretable fault analyses and maintenance recommendations. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves a fault detection accuracy of 90.6\% and generates maintenance reports with an average accuracy of 89\%, thereby improving the interpretability of diagnostic results and providing practical decision support for the operation and maintenance of wind turbines.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively standardizes facial plane localization in 3D fetal ultrasound, reducing operator dependency and improving diagnostic consistency.

Abstract: Acquiring standard facial planes during routine fetal ultrasound (US) examinations is often challenging due to fetal movement, variability in orientation, and operator-dependent expertise. These factors contribute to inconsistencies, increased examination time, and potential diagnostic bias.
  To address these challenges in the context of facial assessment, we present: 1) GT++, a robust algorithm that estimates standard facial planes from 3D US volumes using annotated anatomical landmarks; and 2) 3DFETUS, a deep learning model that automates and standardizes their localization in 3D fetal US volumes.
  We evaluated our methods both qualitatively, through expert clinical review, and quantitatively. The proposed approach achieved a mean translation error of 4.13 mm and a mean rotation error of 7.93 degrees per plane, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods on 3D US volumes. Clinical assessments further confirmed the effectiveness of both GT++ and 3DFETUS, demonstrating statistically significant improvements in plane estimation accuracy.

Abstract: We introduce a curated video dataset of laboratory rodents for automatic detection of convulsive events. The dataset contains short (10~s) top-down and side-view video clips of individual rodents, labeled at clip level as normal activity or seizure. It includes 10,101 negative samples and 2,952 positive samples collected from 19 subjects. We describe the data curation, annotation protocol and preprocessing pipeline, and report baseline experiments using a transformer-based video classifier (TimeSformer).

Results show that the TimeSformer architecture enables discrimination between seizure and normal activity with an average F1-score of 97%.

Motivation: Current digital pathology pipelines use grid-based tiling that ignores tissue architecture, introducing irrelevant information and limiting interpretability of cancer grade assessment.

Method: Semantic segmentation to extract glands from whole slide images as input patches for multiple-instance learning, trained on 137 samples from ProMPT cohort.

Result: Achieved gland-level Dice score of 0.83, improved MIL model AUCs by 10% for detecting CNVs in EMT and MYC genes, and revealed 15 gland clusters associated with cancer relapse, mutations, and high Gleason score.

Conclusion: HIT improves accuracy and interpretability of MIL predictions while streamlining computations by focusing on biologically meaningful structures during feature extraction.

Abstract: Histopathologists establish cancer grade by assessing histological structures, such as glands in prostate cancer. Yet, digital pathology pipelines often rely on grid-based tiling that ignores tissue architecture. This introduces irrelevant information and limits interpretability. We introduce histology-informed tiling (HIT), which uses semantic segmentation to extract glands from whole slide images (WSIs) as biologically meaningful input patches for multiple-instance learning (MIL) and phenotyping. Trained on 137 samples from the ProMPT cohort, HIT achieved a gland-level Dice score of 0.83 +/- 0.17. By extracting 380,000 glands from 760 WSIs across ICGC-C and TCGA-PRAD cohorts, HIT improved MIL models AUCs by 10% for detecting copy number variation (CNVs) in genes related to epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMT) and MYC, and revealed 15 gland clusters, several of which were associated with cancer relapse, oncogenic mutations, and high Gleason. Therefore, HIT improved the accuracy and interpretability of MIL predictions, while streamlining computations by focussing on biologically meaningful structures during feature extraction.

TL;DR: Automated CT imaging approach detects pancreatic surface lobularity as a biomarker for Type 2 Diabetes screening, achieving 0.90 AUC for T2DM prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of Type 2 Diabetes is crucial to prevent organ damage, but the role of pancreatic surface lobularity in T2DM patients hasn't been fully investigated.

Method: Used four deep learning models to segment pancreas in 584 patients, automatically detected pancreatic surface lobularity, and developed multivariate model with CT biomarkers for T2DM prediction.

Result: Higher pancreatic surface lobularity in diabetic patients (4.26 vs 3.19, p=0.01), PancAP model achieved best segmentation (Dice: 0.79, ASSD: 1.94mm), and T2DM prediction model attained 0.90 AUC with 66.7% sensitivity and 91.9% specificity.

Conclusion: Pancreatic surface lobularity is useful for T2DM screening and could help predict early onset of Type 2 Diabetes.

Abstract: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection is crucial as it can alter pancreas function through morphological changes and increased deposition of ectopic fat, eventually leading to organ damage. While studies have shown an association between T2DM and pancreas volume and fat content, the role of increased pancreatic surface lobularity (PSL) in patients with T2DM has not been fully investigated. In this pilot work, we propose a fully automated approach to delineate the pancreas and other abdominal structures, derive CT imaging biomarkers, and opportunistically screen for T2DM. Four deep learning-based models were used to segment the pancreas in an internal dataset of 584 patients (297 males, 437 non-diabetic, age: 45$\pm$15 years). PSL was automatically detected and it was higher for diabetic patients (p=0.01) at 4.26 $\pm$ 8.32 compared to 3.19 $\pm$ 3.62 for non-diabetic patients. The PancAP model achieved the highest Dice score of 0.79 $\pm$ 0.17 and lowest ASSD error of 1.94 $\pm$ 2.63 mm (p$<$0.05). For predicting T2DM, a multivariate model trained with CT biomarkers attained 0.90 AUC, 66.7\% sensitivity, and 91.9\% specificity. Our results suggest that PSL is useful for T2DM screening and could potentially help predict the early onset of T2DM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers have high computational costs that scale quadratically with token count, and compact attention representations can guide early detection of less important tokens before expensive attention computation.

Method: Leverages token embeddings, interactions, and attention dynamics across layers to infer token importance, using lightweight predictors that can be plugged into various ViT architectures for input-specific token prioritization.

Result: Achieves significant efficiency gains of up to 40% compared to standard ViTs while maintaining or even improving accuracy across various architectures.

Conclusion: SPOT provides a versatile, context-aware framework for token sparsification that improves computational efficiency in Vision Transformers without performance degradation, adaptable to different resource constraints.

Abstract: While Vision Transformers (ViT) have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse tasks, their computational demands are substantial, scaling quadratically with the number of processed tokens. Compact attention representations, reflecting token interaction distributions, can guide early detection and reduction of less salient tokens prior to attention computation. Motivated by this, we present SParsification with attentiOn dynamics via Token relevance (SPOT), a framework for early detection of redundant tokens within ViTs that leverages token embeddings, interactions, and attention dynamics across layers to infer token importance, resulting in a more context-aware and interpretable relevance detection process. SPOT informs token sparsification and facilitates the elimination of such tokens, improving computational efficiency without sacrificing performance. SPOT employs computationally lightweight predictors that can be plugged into various ViT architectures and learn to derive effective input-specific token prioritization across layers. Its versatile design supports a range of performance levels adaptable to varying resource constraints. Empirical evaluations demonstrate significant efficiency gains of up to 40% compared to standard ViTs, while maintaining or even improving accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical Total Variation (TV) depends on a fixed lambda parameter, limiting efficiency and effectiveness in image denoising applications.

Method: Couples unrolled TV solver with data-driven Lambda Mapping Network (LambdaNet) that predicts per-pixel regularization maps, trained end-to-end for joint optimization of reconstruction and regularization.

Result: Consistent gains over classical TV and FBP+U-Net: +2.9 dB PSNR and +6% SSIM on average on DeepLesion dataset with realistic noise model.

Conclusion: LTV provides interpretable alternative to black-box CNNs and serves as basis for 3D and data-consistency-driven reconstruction.

Abstract: Although Total Variation (TV) performs well in noise reduction and edge preservation on images, its dependence on the lambda parameter limits its efficiency and makes it difficult to use effectively. In this study, we present a Learnable Total Variation (LTV) framework that couples an unrolled TV solver with a data-driven Lambda Mapping Network (LambdaNet) predicting a per-pixel regularization map. The pipeline is trained end-to-end so that reconstruction and regularization are optimized jointly, yielding spatially adaptive smoothing: strong in homogeneous regions, relaxed near anatomical boundaries. Experiments on the DeepLesion dataset, using a realistic noise model adapted from the LoDoPaB-CT methodology, show consistent gains over classical TV and FBP+U-Net: +2.9 dB PSNR and +6% SSIM on average. LTV provides an interpretable alternative to black-box CNNs and a basis for 3D and data-consistency-driven reconstruction. Our codes are available at: https://github.com/itu-biai/deep_tv_for_ldct

TL;DR: SemanticVLA is a Vision-Language-Action framework that addresses perceptual redundancy and instruction-vision misalignment in robotic manipulation through semantic-aligned sparsification and enhancement, achieving state-of-the-art performance with significant efficiency improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models suffer from inefficient processing of irrelevant visual inputs (perceptual redundancy) and poor semantic grounding of actions due to superficial instruction-vision alignment, hindering practical deployment in robotic manipulation.

Method: 1) Semantic-guided Dual Visual Pruner (SD-Pruner) with Instruction-driven Pruner for global action cues and Spatial-aggregation Pruner for geometry-rich features; 2) Semantic-complementary Hierarchical Fuser (SH-Fuser) for cross-modal fusion; 3) Semantic-conditioned Action Coupler (SA-Coupler) for efficient behavior modeling.

Result: SemanticVLA surpasses OpenVLA on LIBERO benchmark by 21.1% in success rate, while reducing training cost and inference latency by 3.0-fold and 2.7-fold, setting new SOTA in both performance and efficiency.

Conclusion: SemanticVLA effectively addresses key limitations in VLA models through semantic-aligned sparsification and enhancement, enabling more efficient and interpretable robotic manipulation with superior performance.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced in robotic manipulation, yet practical deployment remains hindered by two key limitations: 1) perceptual redundancy, where irrelevant visual inputs are processed inefficiently, and 2) superficial instruction-vision alignment, which hampers semantic grounding of actions. In this paper, we propose SemanticVLA, a novel VLA framework that performs Semantic-Aligned Sparsification and Enhancement for Efficient Robotic Manipulation. Specifically: 1) To sparsify redundant perception while preserving semantic alignment, Semantic-guided Dual Visual Pruner (SD-Pruner) performs: Instruction-driven Pruner (ID-Pruner) extracts global action cues and local semantic anchors in SigLIP; Spatial-aggregation Pruner (SA-Pruner) compacts geometry-rich features into task-adaptive tokens in DINOv2. 2) To exploit sparsified features and integrate semantics with spatial geometry, Semantic-complementary Hierarchical Fuser (SH-Fuser) fuses dense patches and sparse tokens across SigLIP and DINOv2 for coherent representation. 3) To enhance the transformation from perception to action, Semantic-conditioned Action Coupler (SA-Coupler) replaces the conventional observation-to-DoF approach, yielding more efficient and interpretable behavior modeling for manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments on simulation and real-world tasks show that SemanticVLA sets a new SOTA in both performance and efficiency. SemanticVLA surpasses OpenVLA on LIBERO benchmark by 21.1% in success rate, while reducing training cost and inference latency by 3.0-fold and 2.7-fold.SemanticVLA is open-sourced and publicly available at https://github.com/JiuTian-VL/SemanticVLA

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Separate-then-Map (StM) strategy for reconstructing dynamic humans interacting with environments from monocular videos, using information mapping to bridge separately optimized models and ensure spatial/visual coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches either model scenes holistically (neglecting distinct motion characteristics) or separately (causing spatial inconsistencies and artifacts at boundaries), requiring better integration between human and scene components.

Method: Uses Separate-then-Map strategy with shared transformation functions for Gaussian attributes to unify separately modeled components, avoiding exhaustive pairwise interactions while maintaining coherence.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual quality and rendering accuracy, especially at challenging human-scene interaction boundaries.

Conclusion: The StM strategy effectively addresses spatial inconsistencies and visual artifacts by bridging separately optimized models through dedicated information mapping, achieving superior reconstruction quality.

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic humans interacting with real-world environments from monocular videos is an important and challenging task. Despite considerable progress in 4D neural rendering, existing approaches either model dynamic scenes holistically or model scenes and backgrounds separately aim to introduce parametric human priors. However, these approaches either neglect distinct motion characteristics of various components in scene especially human, leading to incomplete reconstructions, or ignore the information exchange between the separately modeled components, resulting in spatial inconsistencies and visual artifacts at human-scene boundaries. To address this, we propose {\bf Separate-then-Map} (StM) strategy that introduces a dedicated information mapping mechanism to bridge separately defined and optimized models. Our method employs a shared transformation function for each Gaussian attribute to unify separately modeled components, enhancing computational efficiency by avoiding exhaustive pairwise interactions while ensuring spatial and visual coherence between humans and their surroundings. Extensive experiments on monocular video datasets demonstrate that StM significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both visual quality and rendering accuracy, particularly at challenging human-scene interaction boundaries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T2I models generate homogeneous outputs despite quality improvements, highlighting the need for robust diversity evaluation methods.

Method: Systematic diversity assessment using: human evaluation templates, curated prompts with variation factors (e.g., apple color), binomial tests for model comparison, and rigorous image embedding analysis.

Result: Enables ranking of T2I models by diversity, identifies specific categories where models struggle, and provides principled diversity measurement.

Conclusion: Offers a robust methodology for T2I diversity evaluation that can guide model improvements and metric development.

Abstract: Despite advances in generation quality, current text-to-image (T2I) models often lack diversity, generating homogeneous outputs. This work introduces a framework to address the need for robust diversity evaluation in T2I models. Our framework systematically assesses diversity by evaluating individual concepts and their relevant factors of variation. Key contributions include: (1) a novel human evaluation template for nuanced diversity assessment; (2) a curated prompt set covering diverse concepts with their identified factors of variation (e.g. prompt: An image of an apple, factor of variation: color); and (3) a methodology for comparing models in terms of human annotations via binomial tests.
  Furthermore, we rigorously compare various image embeddings for diversity measurement. Notably, our principled approach enables ranking of T2I models by diversity, identifying categories where they particularly struggle. This research offers a robust methodology and insights, paving the way for improvements in T2I model diversity and metric development.

*Huijie Liu,Shuhao Cui,Haoxiang Cao,Shuai Ma,Kai Wu,Guoliang Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoTyle introduces code-to-style image generation where a single numerical code controls visual style, enabling novel and consistent style creation without complex inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative methods struggle with style consistency, limited creativity, and complex style representations, requiring lengthy prompts or reference images.

Method: Train discrete style codebook from images, use embeddings to condition diffusion model, then train autoregressive style generator to synthesize novel style embeddings from numerical codes.

Result: CoTyle successfully generates diverse and consistent visual styles from simple numerical codes, demonstrating effective style control and reproducibility.

Conclusion: A style can be effectively represented and controlled by a single numerical code, enabling simple and diverse style generation without complex inputs.

Abstract: Innovative visual stylization is a cornerstone of artistic creation, yet generating novel and consistent visual styles remains a significant challenge. Existing generative approaches typically rely on lengthy textual prompts, reference images, or parameter-efficient fine-tuning to guide style-aware image generation, but often struggle with style consistency, limited creativity, and complex style representations. In this paper, we affirm that a style is worth one numerical code by introducing the novel task, code-to-style image generation, which produces images with novel, consistent visual styles conditioned solely on a numerical style code. To date, this field has only been primarily explored by the industry (e.g., Midjourney), with no open-source research from the academic community. To fill this gap, we propose CoTyle, the first open-source method for this task. Specifically, we first train a discrete style codebook from a collection of images to extract style embeddings. These embeddings serve as conditions for a text-to-image diffusion model (T2I-DM) to generate stylistic images. Subsequently, we train an autoregressive style generator on the discrete style embeddings to model their distribution, allowing the synthesis of novel style embeddings. During inference, a numerical style code is mapped to a unique style embedding by the style generator, and this embedding guides the T2I-DM to generate images in the corresponding style. Unlike existing methods, our method offers unparalleled simplicity and diversity, unlocking a vast space of reproducible styles from minimal input. Extensive experiments validate that CoTyle effectively turns a numerical code into a style controller, demonstrating a style is worth one code.

TL;DR: OmniVGGT is a 3D foundation model that effectively incorporates geometric modalities (depth, camera intrinsics/extrinsics) through a GeoAdapter with zero-initialized convolutions, enabling stable optimization and maintaining inference speed while supporting arbitrary modality inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most 3D foundation models assume RGB-only inputs and ignore readily available geometric cues like camera intrinsics, poses, and depth maps, limiting their performance and practical utility.

Method: Proposes a GeoAdapter with zero-initialized convolutions to encode geometric information without disrupting the foundation model's representation space, and a stochastic multimodal fusion regimen that randomly samples modality subsets during training for robust learning.

Result: Outperforms prior methods with auxiliary inputs and achieves state-of-the-art results even with RGB-only input on monocular/multi-view depth estimation, multi-view stereo, and camera pose estimation. Enhanced VLA models show consistent gains on robotic tasks.

Conclusion: OmniVGGT effectively leverages geometric modalities to improve 3D vision tasks while maintaining efficiency, demonstrating practical utility in vision-language-action models for robotics applications.

Abstract: General 3D foundation models have started to lead the trend of unifying diverse vision tasks, yet most assume RGB-only inputs and ignore readily available geometric cues (e.g., camera intrinsics, poses, and depth maps). To address this issue, we introduce OmniVGGT, a novel framework that can effectively benefit from an arbitrary number of auxiliary geometric modalities during both training and inference. In our framework, a GeoAdapter is proposed to encode depth and camera intrinsics/extrinsics into a spatial foundation model. It employs zero-initialized convolutions to progressively inject geometric information without disrupting the foundation model's representation space. This design ensures stable optimization with negligible overhead, maintaining inference speed comparable to VGGT even with multiple additional inputs. Additionally, a stochastic multimodal fusion regimen is proposed, which randomly samples modality subsets per instance during training. This enables an arbitrary number of modality inputs during testing and promotes learning robust spatial representations instead of overfitting to auxiliary cues. Comprehensive experiments on monocular/multi-view depth estimation, multi-view stereo, and camera pose estimation demonstrate that OmniVGGT outperforms prior methods with auxiliary inputs and achieves state-of-the-art results even with RGB-only input. To further highlight its practical utility, we integrated OmniVGGT into vision-language-action (VLA) models. The enhanced VLA model by OmniVGGT not only outperforms the vanilla point-cloud-based baseline on mainstream benchmarks, but also effectively leverages accessible auxiliary inputs to achieve consistent gains on robotic tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M&M-3D is a parameter-free 3D reasoning architecture for Digital Breast Tomosynthesis that enables learnable 3D features while allowing direct weight transfer from 2D mammography models, achieving superior performance in low-data regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address data scarcity in DBT by enabling 3D reasoning without requiring additional parameters compared to 2D FFDM models, overcoming limitations of existing methods that either discard volumetric information or require complex architectures and more training data.

Method: M&M-3D constructs malignancy-guided 3D features and learns 3D reasoning by repeatedly mixing these 3D features with slice-level information through modified operations in M&M architecture without adding parameters, enabling direct weight transfer from FFDM.

Result: Outperforms 2D projection and 3D slice-based methods by 11-54% for localization and 3-10% for classification; surpasses complex 3D variants by 20-47% for localization and 2-10% for classification in low-data regime while matching performance in high-data regime; beats previous top baseline on BCS-DBT benchmark by 4% for classification and 10% for localization.

Conclusion: M&M-3D effectively enables 3D reasoning for DBT analysis while maintaining parameter efficiency and enabling knowledge transfer from 2D models, making it particularly valuable in data-scarce scenarios.

Abstract: Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) enhances finding visibility for breast cancer detection by providing volumetric information that reduces the impact of overlapping tissues; however, limited annotated data has constrained the development of deep learning models for DBT. To address data scarcity, existing methods attempt to reuse 2D full-field digital mammography (FFDM) models by either flattening DBT volumes or processing slices individually, thus discarding volumetric information. Alternatively, 3D reasoning approaches introduce complex architectures that require more DBT training data. Tackling these drawbacks, we propose M&M-3D, an architecture that enables learnable 3D reasoning while remaining parameter-free relative to its FFDM counterpart, M&M. M&M-3D constructs malignancy-guided 3D features, and 3D reasoning is learned through repeatedly mixing these 3D features with slice-level information. This is achieved by modifying operations in M&M without adding parameters, thus enabling direct weight transfer from FFDM. Extensive experiments show that M&M-3D surpasses 2D projection and 3D slice-based methods by 11-54% for localization and 3-10% for classification. Additionally, M&M-3D outperforms complex 3D reasoning variants by 20-47% for localization and 2-10% for classification in the low-data regime, while matching their performance in high-data regime. On the popular BCS-DBT benchmark, M&M-3D outperforms previous top baseline by 4% for classification and 10% for localization.

Motivation: Sentinel-2 LULC classification faces challenges like spatial heterogeneity, context information modeling, and signature ambiguity that limit classification performance.

Method: Three key innovations: 1) OBIA-Mamba using superpixels as Mamba tokens to reduce redundancy, 2) Global-local dual-branch CNN-Mamba architecture for joint local and global modeling, 3) Multitask optimization with dual loss functions to balance local precision and global consistency.

Result: Tested on Sentinel-2 imagery in Alberta, Canada, the approach achieved higher classification accuracy and finer details compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed MSOM framework effectively addresses key data challenges in Sentinel-2 classification and outperforms existing advanced approaches.

Abstract: Although Sentinel-2 based land use and land cover (LULC) classification is critical for various environmental monitoring applications, it is a very difficult task due to some key data challenges (e.g., spatial heterogeneity, context information, signature ambiguity). This paper presents a novel Multitask Glocal OBIA-Mamba (MSOM) for enhanced Sentinel-2 classification with the following contributions. First, an object-based image analysis (OBIA) Mamba model (OBIA-Mamba) is designed to reduce redundant computation without compromising fine-grained details by using superpixels as Mamba tokens. Second, a global-local (GLocal) dual-branch convolutional neural network (CNN)-mamba architecture is designed to jointly model local spatial detail and global contextual information. Third, a multitask optimization framework is designed to employ dual loss functions to balance local precision with global consistency. The proposed approach is tested on Sentinel-2 imagery in Alberta, Canada, in comparison with several advanced classification approaches, and the results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves higher classification accuracy and finer details that the other state-of-the-art methods.

Result: Not specified in abstract - requires full paper for results.

Conclusion: Not specified in abstract - requires full paper for conclusions.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at understanding and generating video descriptions but their high memory, computation, and deployment demands hinder practical use particularly for blind and low-vision (BLV) users who depend on detailed, context-aware descriptions. To study the effect of model size on accessibility-focused description quality, we evaluate SmolVLM2 variants with 500M and 2.2B parameters across two diverse datasets: AVCaps (outdoor), and Charades (indoor). In this work, we introduce two novel evaluation frameworks specifically designed for BLV accessibility assessment: the Multi-Context BLV Framework evaluating spatial orientation, social interaction, action events, and ambience contexts; and the Navigational Assistance Framework focusing on mobility-critical information. Additionally, we conduct a systematic evaluation of four different prompt design strategies and deploy both models on a smartphone, evaluating FP32 and INT8 precision variants to assess real-world performance constraints on resource-limited mobile devices.

TL;DR: LUA is a lightweight latent space upscaler that performs super-resolution before VAE decoding, enabling efficient high-resolution image generation without modifying base diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models struggle with high-resolution scaling due to slow direct sampling and artifact-prone post-hoc super-resolution methods that add latency.

Method: A lightweight module with shared Swin-style backbone and scale-specific pixel-shuffle heads that performs super-resolution directly on latent codes before VAE decoding.

Result: Achieves comparable perceptual quality with 3x lower decoding time (only +0.42s for 1024px from 512px vs 1.87s for pixel-space SR), and generalizes across different VAEs without retraining.

Conclusion: LUA provides a practical and efficient path to scalable high-fidelity image synthesis in diffusion pipelines, closely matching native high-resolution generation quality.

Abstract: Diffusion models struggle to scale beyond their training resolutions, as direct high-resolution sampling is slow and costly, while post-hoc image super-resolution (ISR) introduces artifacts and additional latency by operating after decoding. We present the Latent Upscaler Adapter (LUA), a lightweight module that performs super-resolution directly on the generator's latent code before the final VAE decoding step. LUA integrates as a drop-in component, requiring no modifications to the base model or additional diffusion stages, and enables high-resolution synthesis through a single feed-forward pass in latent space. A shared Swin-style backbone with scale-specific pixel-shuffle heads supports 2x and 4x factors and remains compatible with image-space SR baselines, achieving comparable perceptual quality with nearly 3x lower decoding and upscaling time (adding only +0.42 s for 1024 px generation from 512 px, compared to 1.87 s for pixel-space SR using the same SwinIR architecture). Furthermore, LUA shows strong generalization across the latent spaces of different VAEs, making it easy to deploy without retraining from scratch for each new decoder. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LUA closely matches the fidelity of native high-resolution generation while offering a practical and efficient path to scalable, high-fidelity image synthesis in modern diffusion pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a minimal yet powerful geometry prediction model that works with arbitrary visual inputs and doesn't require known camera poses, simplifying the architecture and training process.

Method: Uses a single plain transformer backbone (vanilla DINO encoder) without architectural specialization, employs singular depth-ray prediction target to avoid complex multi-task learning, and follows a teacher-student training paradigm.

Result: Sets new SOTA on visual geometry benchmark: 44.3% improvement in camera pose accuracy and 25.1% in geometric accuracy over prior SOTA VGGT, and outperforms DA2 in monocular depth estimation.

Conclusion: DA3 demonstrates that minimal modeling with plain transformers and simple training targets can achieve superior geometry prediction performance across multiple tasks without architectural complexity.

Abstract: We present Depth Anything 3 (DA3), a model that predicts spatially consistent geometry from an arbitrary number of visual inputs, with or without known camera poses. In pursuit of minimal modeling, DA3 yields two key insights: a single plain transformer (e.g., vanilla DINO encoder) is sufficient as a backbone without architectural specialization, and a singular depth-ray prediction target obviates the need for complex multi-task learning. Through our teacher-student training paradigm, the model achieves a level of detail and generalization on par with Depth Anything 2 (DA2). We establish a new visual geometry benchmark covering camera pose estimation, any-view geometry and visual rendering. On this benchmark, DA3 sets a new state-of-the-art across all tasks, surpassing prior SOTA VGGT by an average of 44.3% in camera pose accuracy and 25.1% in geometric accuracy. Moreover, it outperforms DA2 in monocular depth estimation. All models are trained exclusively on public academic datasets.

TL;DR: Self-Consistency Sampling (SCS) addresses the issue of unfaithful reasoning in multimodal LLMs by using visual perturbations and trajectory resampling to generate consistency scores that down-weight unreliable reasoning traces during RL training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current outcome-reward RL methods for multimodal LLMs reward correct answers regardless of reasoning quality, allowing models to guess correctly after faulty reasoning chains, which undermines genuine reasoning development.

Method: SCS introduces small visual perturbations and performs repeated truncation/resampling of initial trajectories, then computes agreement among resulting trajectories to generate differentiable consistency scores that penalize unreliable reasoning during policy updates.

Result: SCS improves accuracy by up to 7.7 percentage points on six multimodal benchmarks when integrated with RLOO, GRPO, and REINFORCE++ methods, with negligible computational overhead, and shows consistent gains across different model sizes.

Conclusion: SCS provides a simple, general solution to the unfaithful reasoning problem in outcome-reward RL for multimodal LLMs, enabling more reliable reasoning development without significant computational cost.

Abstract: Outcome-reward reinforcement learning (RL) is a common and increasingly significant way to refine the step-by-step reasoning of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). In the multiple-choice setting - a dominant format for multimodal reasoning benchmarks - the paradigm faces a significant yet often overlooked obstacle: unfaithful trajectories that guess the correct option after a faulty chain of thought receive the same reward as genuine reasoning, which is a flaw that cannot be ignored. We propose Self-Consistency Sampling (SCS) to correct this issue. For each question, SCS (i) introduces small visual perturbations and (ii) performs repeated truncation and resampling of an initial trajectory; agreement among the resulting trajectories yields a differentiable consistency score that down-weights unreliable traces during policy updates. Based on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, plugging SCS into RLOO, GRPO, and REINFORCE++ series improves accuracy by up to 7.7 percentage points on six multimodal benchmarks with negligible extra computation. SCS also yields notable gains on both Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct and InternVL3-8B, offering a simple, general remedy for outcome-reward RL in MLLMs.
