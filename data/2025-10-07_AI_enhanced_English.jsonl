MetaSeg uses an underlying INR that simultaneously predicts per\npixel intensity values and class labels. It then uses a meta-learning procedure\nto find optimal initial parameters for this INR over a training dataset of\nimages and segmentation maps, such that the INR can simply be fine-tuned to fit\npixels of an unseen test image, and automatically decode its class labels. We\nevaluated MetaSeg on 2D and 3D brain MRI segmentation tasks and report Dice\nscores comparable to commonly used U-Net models, but with $90\\%$ fewer\nparameters. MetaSeg offers a fresh, scalable alternative to traditional\nresource-heavy architectures such as U-Nets and vision transformers for medical\nimage segmentation.

Early diagnosis of PD is crucial to prevent adverse effects,\nyet traditional diagnostic methods are often cumbersome and costly. In this\nstudy, a machine learning-based approach is proposed using hand-drawn spiral\nand wave images as potential biomarkers for PD detection. Our methodology\nleverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs), transfer learning, and\nattention mechanisms to improve model performance and resilience against\noverfitting. To enhance the diversity and richness of both spiral and wave\ncategories, the training dataset undergoes augmentation to increase the number\nof images. The proposed architecture comprises three phases: utilizing\npre-trained CNNs, incorporating custom convolutional layers, and ensemble\nvoting. Employing hard voting further enhances performance by aggregating\npredictions from multiple models. Experimental results show promising accuracy\nrates. For spiral images, weighted average precision, recall, and F1-score are\n90%, and for wave images, they are 96.67%. After combining the predictions\nthrough ensemble hard voting, the overall accuracy is 93.3%. These findings\nunderscore the potential of machine learning in early PD diagnosis, offering a\nnon-invasive and cost-effective solution to improve patient outcomes.", "AI": {"tldr": "Machine learning approach using hand-drawn spiral and wave images achieves 93.3% accuracy for Parkinson's disease detection through CNN, transfer learning, and ensemble voting.", "motivation": "Early PD diagnosis is crucial but traditional methods are cumbersome and costly.
