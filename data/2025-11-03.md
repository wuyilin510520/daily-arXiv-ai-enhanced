### [1] [Do Vision-Language Models Measure Up? Benchmarking Visual Measurement Reading with MeasureBench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26865)
*Fenfen Lin,Yesheng Liu,Haiyu Xu,Chen Yue,Zheqi He,Mingxuan Zhao,Miguel Hu Chen,Jiakang Liu,JG Yao,Xi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MeasureBench is a benchmark for evaluating visual measurement reading in vision-language models, showing that current VLMs struggle with fine-grained spatial grounding and indicator localization despite good textual reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models find reading measurement instruments surprisingly challenging, even though humans can do this effortlessly with minimal domain expertise.

Method: Created MeasureBench with real-world and synthesized measurement images, plus an extensible data synthesis pipeline that procedurally generates gauges with controllable visual elements like pointers, scales, and fonts.

Result: Evaluation shows even the strongest VLMs struggle with measurement reading, particularly failing at indicator localization - they can read digits but misidentify pointer positions, leading to large numeric errors.

Conclusion: The work highlights fundamental limitations in VLMs' fine-grained spatial grounding and hopes to advance visually grounded numeracy and precise spatial perception in future models.

Abstract: Reading measurement instruments is effortless for humans and requires
relatively little domain expertise, yet it remains surprisingly challenging for
current vision-language models (VLMs) as we find in preliminary evaluation. In
this work, we introduce MeasureBench, a benchmark on visual measurement reading
covering both real-world and synthesized images of various types of
measurements, along with an extensible pipeline for data synthesis. Our
pipeline procedurally generates a specified type of gauge with controllable
visual appearance, enabling scalable variation in key details such as pointers,
scales, fonts, lighting, and clutter. Evaluation on popular proprietary and
open-weight VLMs shows that even the strongest frontier VLMs struggle
measurement reading in general. A consistent failure mode is indicator
localization: models can read digits or labels but misidentify the key
positions of pointers or alignments, leading to big numeric errors despite
plausible textual reasoning. We have also conducted preliminary experiments
with reinforcement learning over synthetic data, and find encouraging results
on in-domain synthetic subset but less promising for real-world images. Our
analysis highlights a fundamental limitation of current VLMs in fine-grained
spatial grounding. We hope this resource can help future advances on visually
grounded numeracy and precise spatial perception of VLMs, bridging the gap
between recognizing numbers and measuring the world.

### [2] [PF-DAformer: Proximal Femur Segmentation via Domain Adaptive Transformer for Dual-Center QCT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26903)
*Rochak Dhakal,Chen Zhao,Zixin Shi,Joyce H. Keyak,Tadashi S. Kaneko,Kuan-Jui Su,Hui Shen,Hong-Wen Deng,Weihua Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A domain-adaptive transformer segmentation framework for multi-institutional QCT that addresses domain shift using adversarial and statistical alignment to enable scanner-agnostic proximal femur segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep networks trained on one QCT dataset often fail on others due to domain shift from varying scanners, reconstruction settings, and patient demographics, which hinders multi-center osteoporosis research and reproducibility of quantitative metrics.

Method: Developed a domain-adaptive transformer segmentation framework with 3D TransUNet backbone, integrating adversarial alignment via Gradient Reversal Layer (GRL) and statistical alignment via Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) to balance invariance and fine-grained alignment.

Result: Trained and validated on one of the largest hip fracture research cohorts with 1,024 QCT scans from Tulane University and 384 scans from Rochester, Minnesota for proximal femur segmentation.

Conclusion: The dual alignment mechanism enables scanner-agnostic feature learning while preserving anatomical detail, overcoming domain shift barriers for multi-institutional QCT applications.

Abstract: Quantitative computed tomography (QCT) plays a crucial role in assessing bone
strength and fracture risk by enabling volumetric analysis of bone density
distribution in the proximal femur. However, deploying automated segmentation
models in practice remains difficult because deep networks trained on one
dataset often fail when applied to another. This failure stems from domain
shift, where scanners, reconstruction settings, and patient demographics vary
across institutions, leading to unstable predictions and unreliable
quantitative metrics. Overcoming this barrier is essential for multi-center
osteoporosis research and for ensuring that radiomics and structural finite
element analysis results remain reproducible across sites. In this work, we
developed a domain-adaptive transformer segmentation framework tailored for
multi-institutional QCT. Our model is trained and validated on one of the
largest hip fracture related research cohorts to date, comprising 1,024 QCT
images scans from Tulane University and 384 scans from Rochester, Minnesota for
proximal femur segmentation. To address domain shift, we integrate two
complementary strategies within a 3D TransUNet backbone: adversarial alignment
via Gradient Reversal Layer (GRL), which discourages the network from encoding
site-specific cues, and statistical alignment via Maximum Mean Discrepancy
(MMD), which explicitly reduces distributional mismatches between institutions.
This dual mechanism balances invariance and fine-grained alignment, enabling
scanner-agnostic feature learning while preserving anatomical detail.

### [3] [DC4GS: Directional Consistency-Driven Adaptive Density Control for 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26921)
*Moonsoo Jeong,Dongbeen Kim,Minseong Kim,Sungkil Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DC4GS introduces Directional Consistency-driven Adaptive Density Control for 3D Gaussian Splatting, reducing primitive count by up to 30% while improving reconstruction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional Adaptive Density Control (ADC) uses only positional gradient magnitudes for primitive splitting, which can lead to redundant splitting and inefficient primitive placement.

Method: Incorporates Directional Consistency (DC) through angular coherence of gradients to better capture local structural complexities, and uses DC to define optimal split positions that align with local structures.

Result: Reduces number of primitives by up to 30% compared to existing ADC while greatly enhancing reconstruction fidelity.

Conclusion: DC4GS provides more efficient primitive management in 3D Gaussian Splatting by leveraging directional consistency, achieving better reconstruction with fewer primitives.

Abstract: We present a Directional Consistency (DC)-driven Adaptive Density Control
(ADC) for 3D Gaussian Splatting (DC4GS). Whereas the conventional ADC bases its
primitive splitting on the magnitudes of positional gradients, we further
incorporate the DC of the gradients into ADC, and realize it through the
angular coherence of the gradients. Our DC better captures local structural
complexities in ADC, avoiding redundant splitting. When splitting is required,
we again utilize the DC to define optimal split positions so that
sub-primitives best align with the local structures than the conventional
random placement. As a consequence, our DC4GS greatly reduces the number of
primitives (up to 30% in our experiments) than the existing ADC, and also
enhances reconstruction fidelity greatly.

### [4] [Scale-Aware Curriculum Learning for Ddata-Efficient Lung Nodule Detection with YOLOv11](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26923)
*Yi Luo,Yike Guo,Hamed Hooshangnejad,Kai Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SACL is a dynamic curriculum learning method that adapts to data scale, improving lung nodule detection performance in data-scarce scenarios without architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning approaches struggle with limited annotated data in clinical settings, and traditional static curriculum learning fails in data-scarce scenarios.

Method: Scale Adaptive Curriculum Learning (SACL) with three mechanisms: adaptive epoch scheduling, hard sample injection, and scale-aware optimization, evaluated on LUNA25 dataset using YOLOv11.

Result: SACL achieves comparable performance to static curriculum on full dataset, but shows significant improvements under data-limited conditions: 4.6%, 3.5%, and 2.0% improvements over baseline at 10%, 20%, and 50% of training data respectively.

Conclusion: SACL provides a practical solution for healthcare institutions to develop effective lung nodule detection systems despite limited annotation resources by enabling robust training across varying data scales.

Abstract: Lung nodule detection in chest CT is crucial for early lung cancer diagnosis,
yet existing deep learning approaches face challenges when deployed in clinical
settings with limited annotated data. While curriculum learning has shown
promise in improving model training, traditional static curriculum strategies
fail in data-scarce scenarios. We propose Scale Adaptive Curriculum Learning
(SACL), a novel training strategy that dynamically adjusts curriculum design
based on available data scale. SACL introduces three key mechanisms:(1)
adaptive epoch scheduling, (2) hard sample injection, and (3) scale-aware
optimization. We evaluate SACL on the LUNA25 dataset using YOLOv11 as the base
detector. Experimental results demonstrate that while SACL achieves comparable
performance to static curriculum learning on the full dataset in mAP50, it
shows significant advantages under data-limited conditions with 4.6%, 3.5%, and
2.0% improvements over baseline at 10%, 20%, and 50% of training data
respectively. By enabling robust training across varying data scales without
architectural modifications, SACL provides a practical solution for healthcare
institutions to develop effective lung nodule detection systems despite limited
annotation resources.

### [5] [SYNAPSE-Net: A Unified Framework with Lesion-Aware Hierarchical Gating for Robust Segmentation of Heterogeneous Brain Lesions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26961)
*Md. Mehedi Hassan,Shafqat Alam,Shahriar Ahmed Seam,Maruf Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Unified Multi-Stream SYNAPSE-Net, an adaptive framework for automated brain lesion segmentation that achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple pathologies with improved generalization and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models for brain lesion segmentation lack generalization and have high performance variance, limiting their clinical reliability as specialized 'point solutions'.

Method: Hybrid architecture with multi-stream CNN encoders, Swin Transformer bottleneck, dynamic cross-modal attention fusion (CMAF), hierarchical gated decoder, trained with variance reduction strategy combining pathology-specific data augmentation and difficulty-aware sampling.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art DSC of 0.831 (HD95: 3.03) on WMH dataset, best boundary accuracy on ISLES 2022 (HD95: 9.69), and highest DSC of 0.8651 for tumor core on BraTS 2020.

Conclusion: The unified adaptive framework provides robust and clinically feasible solution for automated brain lesion segmentation across multiple pathologies, achieving superior performance compared to specialized models.

Abstract: Automated segmentation of heterogeneous brain lesions from multi-modal MRI
remains a critical challenge in clinical neuroimaging. Current deep learning
models are typically specialized `point solutions' that lack generalization and
high performance variance, limiting their clinical reliability. To address
these gaps, we propose the Unified Multi-Stream SYNAPSE-Net, an adaptive
framework designed for both generalization and robustness. The framework is
built on a novel hybrid architecture integrating multi-stream CNN encoders, a
Swin Transformer bottleneck for global context, a dynamic cross-modal attention
fusion (CMAF) mechanism, and a hierarchical gated decoder for high-fidelity
mask reconstruction. The architecture is trained with a variance reduction
strategy that combines pathology specific data augmentation and
difficulty-aware sampling method. The model was evaluated on three different
challenging public datasets: the MICCAI 2017 WMH Challenge, the ISLES 2022
Challenge, and the BraTS 2020 Challenge. Our framework attained a
state-of-the-art DSC value of 0.831 with the HD95 value of 3.03 in the WMH
dataset. For ISLES 2022, it achieved the best boundary accuracy with a
statistically significant difference (HD95 value of 9.69). For BraTS 2020, it
reached the highest DSC value for the tumor core region (0.8651). These
experimental findings suggest that our unified adaptive framework achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple brain pathologies, providing a
robust and clinically feasible solution for automated segmentation. The source
code and the pre-trained models are available at

### [6] [Semantic Frame Aggregation-based Transformer for Live Video Comment Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26978)
*Anam Fatima,Yi Yu,Janak Kapuriya,Julien Lalanne,Jainendra Shukla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel Semantic Frame Aggregation-based Transformer (SFAT) model for live video comment generation that prioritizes semantically relevant video frames and uses weighted aggregation to generate contextually appropriate comments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches overlook prioritizing video frames relevant to ongoing viewer interactions, which is crucial for generating contextually appropriate comments on live video streams.

Method: SFAT model uses CLIP's multimodal knowledge, assigns weights to frames based on semantic relevance to viewer conversations, employs weighted sum of frames, and uses a cross-attention decoder to integrate both chat and video context.

Result: Created a large-scale English video comments dataset from Twitch (438 hours, 3.2M comments across 11 categories) and demonstrated SFAT's effectiveness compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The SFAT model successfully addresses the frame prioritization gap and generates contextually appropriate comments by focusing on semantically relevant video frames and integrating multimodal context.

Abstract: Live commenting on video streams has surged in popularity on platforms like
Twitch, enhancing viewer engagement through dynamic interactions. However,
automatically generating contextually appropriate comments remains a
challenging and exciting task. Video streams can contain a vast amount of data
and extraneous content. Existing approaches tend to overlook an important
aspect of prioritizing video frames that are most relevant to ongoing viewer
interactions. This prioritization is crucial for producing contextually
appropriate comments. To address this gap, we introduce a novel Semantic Frame
Aggregation-based Transformer (SFAT) model for live video comment generation.
This method not only leverages CLIP's visual-text multimodal knowledge to
generate comments but also assigns weights to video frames based on their
semantic relevance to ongoing viewer conversation. It employs an efficient
weighted sum of frames technique to emphasize informative frames while focusing
less on irrelevant ones. Finally, our comment decoder with a cross-attention
mechanism that attends to each modality ensures that the generated comment
reflects contextual cues from both chats and video. Furthermore, to address the
limitations of existing datasets, which predominantly focus on Chinese-language
content with limited video categories, we have constructed a large scale,
diverse, multimodal English video comments dataset. Extracted from Twitch, this
dataset covers 11 video categories, totaling 438 hours and 3.2 million
comments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our SFAT model by comparing it to
existing methods for generating comments from live video and ongoing dialogue
contexts.

Abstract: In this study, we propose MoME, a Mixture of Visual Language Medical Experts,
for Medical Image Segmentation. MoME adapts the successful Mixture of Experts
(MoE) paradigm, widely used in Large Language Models (LLMs), for medical
vision-language tasks. The architecture enables dynamic expert selection by
effectively utilizing multi-scale visual features tailored to the intricacies
of medical imagery, enriched with textual embeddings. This work explores a
novel integration of vision-language models for this domain. Utilizing an
assembly of 10 datasets, encompassing 3,410 CT scans, MoME demonstrates strong
performance on a comprehensive medical imaging segmentation benchmark. Our
approach explores the integration of foundation models for medical imaging,
benefiting from the established efficacy of MoE in boosting model performance
by incorporating textual information. Demonstrating competitive precision
across multiple datasets, MoME explores a novel architecture for achieving
robust results in medical image analysis.

### [8] [Incremental Human-Object Interaction Detection with Invariant Relation Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27020)
*Yana Wei,Zeen Chi,Chongyu Wang,Yu Wu,Shipeng Yan,Yongfei Liu,Xuming He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an exemplar-free incremental relation distillation (IRD) framework for incremental human-object interaction detection to address challenges in dynamic open-world environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop agents capable of discerning human-object relations in dynamic environments where interactions evolve continuously, overcoming catastrophic forgetting, interaction drift, and zero-shot HOI detection challenges.

Method: IRD framework that decouples learning of objects and relations, using two unique distillation losses to learn invariant relation features across different HOI combinations sharing the same relation.

Result: Superior performance on HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets in mitigating forgetting, strengthening robustness against interaction drift, and generalization on zero-shot HOIs compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed IRD framework effectively addresses incremental HOI detection challenges in dynamic environments through relation-focused distillation without requiring exemplars.

Abstract: In open-world environments, human-object interactions (HOIs) evolve
continuously, challenging conventional closed-world HOI detection models.
Inspired by humans' ability to progressively acquire knowledge, we explore
incremental HOI detection (IHOID) to develop agents capable of discerning
human-object relations in such dynamic environments. This setup confronts not
only the common issue of catastrophic forgetting in incremental learning but
also distinct challenges posed by interaction drift and detecting zero-shot HOI
combinations with sequentially arriving data. Therefore, we propose a novel
exemplar-free incremental relation distillation (IRD) framework. IRD decouples
the learning of objects and relations, and introduces two unique distillation
losses for learning invariant relation features across different HOI
combinations that share the same relation. Extensive experiments on HICO-DET
and V-COCO datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over
state-of-the-art baselines in mitigating forgetting, strengthening robustness
against interaction drift, and generalization on zero-shot HOIs. Code is

*Mario Camarena,Het Patel,Fatemeh Nazari,Evangelos Papalexakis,Mohamadhossein Noruzoliaee,Jia Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AD-SAM is a fine-tuned vision foundation model for autonomous driving semantic segmentation that extends SAM with dual-encoder architecture and deformable decoder, achieving superior performance on Cityscapes and BDD100K benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the spatial and geometric complexity of road scenes in autonomous driving by enhancing the Segment Anything Model with specialized architecture for better semantic segmentation performance.

Method: Extends SAM with dual-encoder (combining SAM's ViT-H with ResNet-50) and deformable decoder using deformable attention. Uses hybrid loss (Focal, Dice, Lovasz-Softmax, Surface) for training stability and boundary precision.

Result: Achieves 68.1 mIoU on Cityscapes and 59.5 mIoU on BDD100K, outperforming SAM, G-SAM, and DeepLabV3 by up to +22.9 and +19.2 mIoU. Shows strong cross-domain generalization (0.87 retention score) and faster convergence (30-40 epochs).

Conclusion: Targeted architectural and optimization enhancements to foundation models enable reliable and scalable autonomous driving perception with improved accuracy, generalization, and data efficiency.

Abstract: This paper presents the Autonomous Driving Segment Anything Model (AD-SAM), a
fine-tuned vision foundation model for semantic segmentation in autonomous
driving (AD). AD-SAM extends the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with a
dual-encoder and deformable decoder tailored to spatial and geometric
complexity of road scenes. The dual-encoder produces multi-scale fused
representations by combining global semantic context from SAM's pretrained
Vision Transformer (ViT-H) with local spatial detail from a trainable
convolutional deep learning backbone (i.e., ResNet-50). A deformable fusion
module aligns heterogeneous features across scales and object geometries. The
decoder performs progressive multi-stage refinement using deformable attention.
Training is guided by a hybrid loss that integrates Focal, Dice,
Lovasz-Softmax, and Surface losses, improving semantic class balance, boundary
precision, and optimization stability. Experiments on the Cityscapes and
Berkeley DeepDrive 100K (BDD100K) benchmarks show that AD-SAM surpasses SAM,
Generalized SAM (G-SAM), and a deep learning baseline (DeepLabV3) in
segmentation accuracy. It achieves 68.1 mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) on
Cityscapes and 59.5 mIoU on BDD100K, outperforming SAM, G-SAM, and DeepLabV3 by
margins of up to +22.9 and +19.2 mIoU in structured and diverse road scenes,
respectively. AD-SAM demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization with a
0.87 retention score (vs. 0.76 for SAM), and faster, more stable learning
dynamics, converging within 30-40 epochs, enjoying double the learning speed of
benchmark models. It maintains 0.607 mIoU with only 1000 samples, suggesting
data efficiency critical for reducing annotation costs. These results confirm
that targeted architectural and optimization enhancements to foundation models
enable reliable and scalable AD perception.

### [11] [Hierarchical Transformers for Unsupervised 3D Shape Abstraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27088)
*Aditya Vora,Lily Goli,Andrea Tagliasacchi,Hao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiT is a hierarchical neural field representation that learns general 3D shape hierarchies in an unsupervised manner across multiple categories using a hierarchical transformer with compressed codebook.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To learn meaningful hierarchical structures in 3D shapes across different categories without supervision, overcoming limitations of previous methods that used fixed hierarchical structures.

Method: Uses hierarchical transformer (HiT) with compressed codebook to learn parent-child relationships in tree hierarchies, allowing automatic identification of common substructures across shape categories without fixed structural constraints.

Result: Successfully captures meaningful containment relationships between parent and child nodes, and demonstrates effectiveness through unsupervised shape segmentation across all 55 ShapeNet categories with multiple granularity levels.

Conclusion: HiT provides a flexible approach for learning general hierarchical structures in 3D shapes that can infer complex hierarchies directly from data across multiple categories.

Abstract: We introduce HiT, a novel hierarchical neural field representation for 3D
shapes that learns general hierarchies in a coarse-to-fine manner across
different shape categories in an unsupervised setting. Our key contribution is
a hierarchical transformer (HiT), where each level learns parent-child
relationships of the tree hierarchy using a compressed codebook. This codebook
enables the network to automatically identify common substructures across
potentially diverse shape categories. Unlike previous works that constrain the
task to a fixed hierarchical structure (e.g., binary), we impose no such
restriction, except for limiting the total number of nodes at each tree level.
This flexibility allows our method to infer the hierarchical structure directly
from data, over multiple shape categories, and representing more general and
complex hierarchies than prior approaches. When trained at scale with a
reconstruction loss, our model captures meaningful containment relationships
between parent and child nodes. We demonstrate its effectiveness through an
unsupervised shape segmentation task over all 55 ShapeNet categories, where our
method successfully segments shapes into multiple levels of granularity.

### [12] [ZEBRA: Towards Zero-Shot Cross-Subject Generalization for Universal Brain Visual Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27128)
*Haonan Wang,Jingyu Lu,Hongrui Li,Xiaomeng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ZEBRA is a zero-shot brain visual decoding framework that eliminates subject-specific adaptation by disentangling fMRI representations into subject-related and semantic-related components using adversarial training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fMRI-to-image reconstruction methods rely on subject-specific models or fine-tuning, limiting scalability and real-world applicability. There's a need for methods that can generalize to unseen subjects without additional data or retraining.

Method: ZEBRA uses adversarial training to explicitly disentangle fMRI representations into subject-related and semantic-related components, isolating subject-invariant, semantic-specific representations for zero-shot generalization.

Result: ZEBRA significantly outperforms zero-shot baselines and achieves performance comparable to fully finetuned models on several metrics, demonstrating effective generalization to unseen subjects.

Conclusion: ZEBRA represents a scalable and practical step toward universal neural decoding by enabling zero-shot visual decoding from brain activity without subject-specific adaptation.

Abstract: Recent advances in neural decoding have enabled the reconstruction of visual
experiences from brain activity, positioning fMRI-to-image reconstruction as a
promising bridge between neuroscience and computer vision. However, current
methods predominantly rely on subject-specific models or require
subject-specific fine-tuning, limiting their scalability and real-world
applicability. In this work, we introduce ZEBRA, the first zero-shot brain
visual decoding framework that eliminates the need for subject-specific
adaptation. ZEBRA is built on the key insight that fMRI representations can be
decomposed into subject-related and semantic-related components. By leveraging
adversarial training, our method explicitly disentangles these components to
isolate subject-invariant, semantic-specific representations. This
disentanglement allows ZEBRA to generalize to unseen subjects without any
additional fMRI data or retraining. Extensive experiments show that ZEBRA
significantly outperforms zero-shot baselines and achieves performance
comparable to fully finetuned models on several metrics. Our work represents a
scalable and practical step toward universal neural decoding. Code and model
weights are available at: https://github.com/xmed-lab/ZEBRA.

### [13] [WildfireX-SLAM: A Large-scale Low-altitude RGB-D Dataset for Wildfire SLAM and Beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27133)
*Zhicong Sun,Jacqueline Lo,Jinxing Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces WildfireX-SLAM, a synthetic dataset for 3D Gaussian splatting-based SLAM in large-scale forest and wildfire environments, addressing the lack of real-world data for this domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3DGS-based SLAM works focus on small indoor scenes, but developing methods for large-scale forest scenes has great potential for wildfire emergency response and forest management applications. However, collecting real-world datasets is costly and technically infeasible.

Method: Built a pipeline using Unreal Engine 5 Electric Dreams Environment Sample Project to collect aerial and ground views with ground-truth camera poses and multiple data modalities from UAVs. The pipeline allows flexible control over environmental factors like light, weather, and wildfire conditions.

Result: Created WildfireX-SLAM dataset containing 5.5k low-altitude RGB-D aerial images from a large-scale forest map covering 16 km². Conducted thorough benchmark analysis revealing unique challenges of 3DGS-based SLAM in forest environments.

Conclusion: The dataset enables research in 3DGS-based SLAM for forest and wildfire scenarios, highlighting potential improvements for future work. The dataset and code will be publicly available.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) and its subsequent variants have led to
remarkable progress in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). While most
recent 3DGS-based SLAM works focus on small-scale indoor scenes, developing
3DGS-based SLAM methods for large-scale forest scenes holds great potential for
many real-world applications, especially for wildfire emergency response and
forest management. However, this line of research is impeded by the absence of
a comprehensive and high-quality dataset, and collecting such a dataset over
real-world scenes is costly and technically infeasible. To this end, we have
built a large-scale, comprehensive, and high-quality synthetic dataset for SLAM
in wildfire and forest environments. Leveraging the Unreal Engine 5 Electric
Dreams Environment Sample Project, we developed a pipeline to easily collect
aerial and ground views, including ground-truth camera poses and a range of
additional data modalities from unmanned aerial vehicle. Our pipeline also
provides flexible controls on environmental factors such as light, weather, and
types and conditions of wildfire, supporting the need for various tasks
covering forest mapping, wildfire emergency response, and beyond. The resulting
pilot dataset, WildfireX-SLAM, contains 5.5k low-altitude RGB-D aerial images
from a large-scale forest map with a total size of 16 km2. On top of
WildfireX-SLAM, a thorough benchmark is also conducted, which not only reveals
the unique challenges of 3DGS-based SLAM in the forest but also highlights
potential improvements for future works. The dataset and code will be publicly
available. Project page: https://zhicongsun.github.io/wildfirexslam.

*Tong Shen,Jingai Yu,Dong Zhou,Dong Li,Emad Barsoum*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: E-MMDiT is an efficient multimodal diffusion transformer with only 304M parameters that achieves competitive image generation results using minimal training data and computational resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models require large-scale training data and significant computational resources, or have heavy structures with high latency, making them impractical for many applications.

Method: Uses token reduction strategies including a compressive visual tokenizer, multi-path compression module, Position Reinforcement for spatial coherence, Alternating Subregion Attention to reduce computation, and AdaLN-affine for efficient modulation.

Result: Achieves 0.66 on GenEval for 512px generation using only 25M public data, trained in 1.5 days on 8 AMD MI300X GPUs, and reaches 0.72 with post-training techniques like GRPO.

Conclusion: E-MMDiT serves as a strong, practical baseline for future research and contributes to democratizing generative AI models by making them more accessible with lower resource requirements.

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown strong capabilities in generating high-quality
images from text prompts. However, these models often require large-scale
training data and significant computational resources to train, or suffer from
heavy structure with high latency. To this end, we propose Efficient Multimodal
Diffusion Transformer (E-MMDiT), an efficient and lightweight multimodal
diffusion model with only 304M parameters for fast image synthesis requiring
low training resources. We provide an easily reproducible baseline with
competitive results. Our model for 512px generation, trained with only 25M
public data in 1.5 days on a single node of 8 AMD MI300X GPUs, achieves 0.66 on
GenEval and easily reaches to 0.72 with some post-training techniques such as
GRPO. Our design philosophy centers on token reduction as the computational
cost scales significantly with the token count. We adopt a highly compressive
visual tokenizer to produce a more compact representation and propose a novel
multi-path compression module for further compression of tokens. To enhance our
design, we introduce Position Reinforcement, which strengthens positional
information to maintain spatial coherence, and Alternating Subregion Attention
(ASA), which performs attention within subregions to further reduce
computational cost. In addition, we propose AdaLN-affine, an efficient
lightweight module for computing modulation parameters in transformer blocks.
Our code is available at https://github.com/AMD-AGI/Nitro-E and we hope E-MMDiT
serves as a strong and practical baseline for future research and contributes
to democratization of generative AI models.

### [15] [Improving Cross-view Object Geo-localization: A Dual Attention Approach with Cross-view Interaction and Multi-Scale Spatial Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27139)
*Xingtao Ling Yingying Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel cross-view object geo-localization method using Cross-view Cross-attention Module (CVCAM) and Multi-head Spatial Attention Module (MHSAM) to improve spatial relationship modeling and suppress edge noise, achieving state-of-the-art performance on CVOGL and new G2D datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cross-view geo-localization methods fail to effectively transfer information between views and don't refine spatial relationship feature maps, causing models to focus on irrelevant edge noise and affecting localization performance.

Method: Proposed CVCAM performs multiple iterations of cross-view interaction for continuous contextual information exchange, and MHSAM uses multi-scale convolutional kernels to extract enhanced spatial features. Also created new G2D dataset for ground-to-drone localization.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method achieves high localization accuracy and surpasses current state-of-the-art on both CVOGL and G2D datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses limitations in cross-view information transfer and spatial relationship refinement, demonstrating superior performance in cross-view object geo-localization tasks.

Abstract: Cross-view object geo-localization has recently gained attention due to
potential applications. Existing methods aim to capture spatial dependencies of
query objects between different views through attention mechanisms to obtain
spatial relationship feature maps, which are then used to predict object
locations. Although promising, these approaches fail to effectively transfer
information between views and do not further refine the spatial relationship
feature maps. This results in the model erroneously focusing on irrelevant edge
noise, thereby affecting localization performance. To address these
limitations, we introduce a Cross-view and Cross-attention Module (CVCAM),
which performs multiple iterations of interaction between the two views,
enabling continuous exchange and learning of contextual information about the
query object from both perspectives. This facilitates a deeper understanding of
cross-view relationships while suppressing the edge noise unrelated to the
query object. Furthermore, we integrate a Multi-head Spatial Attention Module
(MHSAM), which employs convolutional kernels of various sizes to extract
multi-scale spatial features from the feature maps containing implicit
correspondences, further enhancing the feature representation of the query
object. Additionally, given the scarcity of datasets for cross-view object
geo-localization, we created a new dataset called G2D for the "Ground-to-Drone"
localization task, enriching existing datasets and filling the gap in
"Ground-to-Drone" localization task. Extensive experiments on the CVOGL and G2D
datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves high localization
accuracy, surpassing the current state-of-the-art.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiGS is a hierarchical generative framework for 3D scene generation that enables multi-step associative semantic spatial composition, allowing users to iteratively expand scenes by selecting key semantic objects while the model automatically completes peripheral areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing single-step generation methods struggle to balance scene complexity with minimal user input, unlike the human cognitive process which progresses from global to local and completes scenes through semantic association.

Method: Proposes HiGS framework with Progressive Hierarchical Spatial-Semantic Graph (PHiSSG) that dynamically organizes spatial relationships and semantic dependencies, maintaining one-to-one mapping between graph nodes and objects while supporting recursive layout optimization.

Result: HiGS outperforms single-stage methods in layout plausibility, style consistency, and user preference, offering a controllable and extensible paradigm for efficient 3D scene construction.

Conclusion: The hierarchical generative framework provides a more natural and controllable approach to 3D scene generation that aligns with human cognitive processes, enabling efficient scene construction with fine-grained control over regions of interest.

Abstract: Three-dimensional scene generation holds significant potential in gaming,
film, and virtual reality. However, most existing methods adopt a single-step
generation process, making it difficult to balance scene complexity with
minimal user input. Inspired by the human cognitive process in scene modeling,
which progresses from global to local, focuses on key elements, and completes
the scene through semantic association, we propose HiGS, a hierarchical
generative framework for multi-step associative semantic spatial composition.
HiGS enables users to iteratively expand scenes by selecting key semantic
objects, offering fine-grained control over regions of interest while the model
completes peripheral areas automatically. To support structured and coherent
generation, we introduce the Progressive Hierarchical Spatial-Semantic Graph
(PHiSSG), which dynamically organizes spatial relationships and semantic
dependencies across the evolving scene structure. PHiSSG ensures spatial and
geometric consistency throughout the generation process by maintaining a
one-to-one mapping between graph nodes and generated objects and supporting
recursive layout optimization. Experiments demonstrate that HiGS outperforms
single-stage methods in layout plausibility, style consistency, and user
preference, offering a controllable and extensible paradigm for efficient 3D
scene construction.

*Yuanhao Tang,Xuechao Zou,Zhengpei Hu,Junliang Xing,Chengkun Zhang,Jianqiang Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AFM-Net is a novel framework for remote sensing image scene classification that combines CNN for local texture modeling and Mamba for efficient global sequence modeling through hierarchical fusion, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Remote sensing image scene classification is challenging due to complex spatial structures and multi-scale characteristics of ground objects. Existing methods struggle to efficiently integrate CNNs (good for local textures) and Transformers (good for global context) due to Transformers' high computational cost.

Method: Proposes AFM-Net with two pathways: CNN branch for hierarchical visual priors and Mamba branch for efficient global sequence modeling. Uses Hierarchical Fusion Mechanism to progressively aggregate multi-scale features from both pathways, enabling dynamic cross-level feature interaction and contextual reconstruction. Features are adaptively routed through Mixture-of-Experts classifier.

Result: Achieves 93.72% accuracy on AID, 95.54% on NWPU-RESISC45, and 96.92% on UC Merced datasets, surpassing state-of-the-art methods with balanced performance and efficiency.

Conclusion: AFM-Net effectively addresses the local-global representation challenge in remote sensing scene classification through hierarchical fusion of CNN and Mamba pathways, demonstrating superior performance across multiple benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Remote sensing image scene classification remains a challenging task,
primarily due to the complex spatial structures and multi-scale characteristics
of ground objects. Existing approaches see CNNs excel at modeling local
textures, while Transformers excel at capturing global context. However,
efficiently integrating them remains a bottleneck due to the high computational
cost of Transformers. To tackle this, we propose AFM-Net, a novel Advanced
Hierarchical Fusing framework that achieves effective local and global
co-representation through two pathways: a CNN branch for extracting
hierarchical visual priors, and a Mamba branch for efficient global sequence
modeling. The core innovation of AFM-Net lies in its Hierarchical Fusion
Mechanism, which progressively aggregates multi-scale features from both
pathways, enabling dynamic cross-level feature interaction and contextual
reconstruction to produce highly discriminative representations. These fused
features are then adaptively routed through a Mixture-of-Experts classifier
module, which dispatches them to the most suitable experts for fine-grained
scene recognition. Experiments on AID, NWPU-RESISC45, and UC Merced show that
AFM-Net obtains 93.72, 95.54, and 96.92 percent accuracy, surpassing
state-of-the-art methods with balanced performance and efficiency. Code is

TL;DR: This study explores using existing deep learning models to approximate Banff lesion scores for renal transplant biopsies through a modular, rule-based framework that decomposes indicators into structural/inflammatory components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Banff Classification is the global standard for renal transplant biopsy evaluation but faces challenges due to its semi-quantitative nature, complex criteria, and inter-observer variability, making computational replication difficult.

Method: Decompose Banff indicators into constituent structural/inflammatory components, use existing segmentation/detection tools to compute them, map outputs to Banff scores using heuristic rules aligned with expert guidelines, and evaluate against expert-annotated ground truths.

Result: Partial successes but critical failure modes including structural omission, hallucination, and detection ambiguity. Even when final scores match expert annotations, inconsistencies in intermediate representations undermine interpretability.

Conclusion: Current AI pipelines have limitations in replicating expert-level grading, highlighting the importance of modular evaluation and computational Banff grading standards for future model development in transplant pathology.

Abstract: The Banff Classification provides the global standard for evaluating renal
transplant biopsies, yet its semi-quantitative nature, complex criteria, and
inter-observer variability present significant challenges for computational
replication. In this study, we explore the feasibility of approximating Banff
lesion scores using existing deep learning models through a modular, rule-based
framework. We decompose each Banff indicator - such as glomerulitis (g),
peritubular capillaritis (ptc), and intimal arteritis (v) - into its
constituent structural and inflammatory components, and assess whether current
segmentation and detection tools can support their computation. Model outputs
are mapped to Banff scores using heuristic rules aligned with expert
guidelines, and evaluated against expert-annotated ground truths. Our findings
highlight both partial successes and critical failure modes, including
structural omission, hallucination, and detection ambiguity. Even when final
scores match expert annotations, inconsistencies in intermediate
representations often undermine interpretability. These results reveal the
limitations of current AI pipelines in replicating computational expert-level
grading, and emphasize the importance of modular evaluation and computational
Banff grading standard in guiding future model development for transplant

### [19] [Generating Accurate and Detailed Captions for High-Resolution Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27164)
*Hankyeol Lee,Gawon Seo,Kyounggyu Lee,Dogun Kim,Kyungwoo Song,Jiyoung Jung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A pipeline combining VLMs, LLMs, and object detection to generate detailed captions for high-resolution images, addressing the limitation of VLMs trained on low-resolution inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs struggle with high-resolution images due to pre-training on low-resolution inputs, leading to loss of visual details and omission of important objects when downscaling.

Method: Multi-stage pipeline: VLM generates initial caption, LLM identifies key objects and predicts co-occurring objects, object detection verifies predictions, region-specific captioning for newly detected objects, and removal of references to undetected objects.

Result: Experiments on high-resolution images show the pipeline produces more detailed and reliable captions while effectively minimizing hallucinations.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline successfully enhances caption quality for high-resolution images by leveraging multiple AI components to enrich detail and reduce hallucinations.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) often struggle to generate accurate and
detailed captions for high-resolution images since they are typically
pre-trained on low-resolution inputs (e.g., 224x224 or 336x336 pixels).
Downscaling high-resolution images to these dimensions may result in the loss
of visual details and the omission of important objects. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel pipeline that integrates vision-language models,
large language models (LLMs), and object detection systems to enhance caption
quality. Our proposed pipeline refines captions through a novel, multi-stage
process. Given a high-resolution image, an initial caption is first generated
using a VLM, and key objects in the image are then identified by an LLM. The
LLM predicts additional objects likely to co-occur with the identified key
objects, and these predictions are verified by object detection systems. Newly
detected objects not mentioned in the initial caption undergo focused,
region-specific captioning to ensure they are incorporated. This process
enriches caption detail while reducing hallucinations by removing references to
undetected objects. We evaluate the enhanced captions using pairwise comparison
and quantitative scoring from large multimodal models, along with a benchmark
for hallucination detection. Experiments on a curated dataset of
high-resolution images demonstrate that our pipeline produces more detailed and
reliable image captions while effectively minimizing hallucinations.

*Xiaozhi Li,Huijun Di,Jian Li,Feng Liu,Wei Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M^3Detection is a multi-frame 3D object detection framework that fuses camera and 4D imaging radar data through multi-level feature aggregation and spatiotemporal reasoning to overcome limitations of single-frame fusion methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-frame camera-radar fusion methods capture only partial scene information, which is further limited by image degradation and radar sparsity. Multi-frame fusion offers richer spatiotemporal information but faces challenges in robust cross-modal feature fusion and computational efficiency.

Method: The framework uses intermediate features from baseline detectors and tracker-generated reference trajectories. It includes global-level inter-object feature aggregation guided by radar, local-level inter-grid feature aggregation along trajectories, and trajectory-level multi-frame spatiotemporal reasoning for cross-frame interactions.

Result: Extensive experiments on VoD and TJ4DRadSet datasets show that M^3Detection achieves state-of-the-art 3D detection performance, validating its effectiveness in multi-frame detection with camera-4D imaging radar fusion.

Conclusion: M^3Detection successfully addresses the challenges of multi-frame camera-radar fusion through its multi-level feature aggregation approach and spatiotemporal reasoning, demonstrating superior 3D object detection performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in 4D imaging radar have enabled robust perception in adverse
weather, while camera sensors provide dense semantic information. Fusing the
these complementary modalities has great potential for cost-effective 3D
perception. However, most existing camera-radar fusion methods are limited to
single-frame inputs, capturing only a partial view of the scene. The incomplete
scene information, compounded by image degradation and 4D radar sparsity,
hinders overall detection performance. In contrast, multi-frame fusion offers
richer spatiotemporal information but faces two challenges: achieving robust
and effective object feature fusion across frames and modalities, and
mitigating the computational cost of redundant feature extraction.
Consequently, we propose M^3Detection, a unified multi-frame 3D object
detection framework that performs multi-level feature fusion on multi-modal
data from camera and 4D imaging radar. Our framework leverages intermediate
features from the baseline detector and employs the tracker to produce
reference trajectories, improving computational efficiency and providing richer
information for second-stage. In the second stage, we design a global-level
inter-object feature aggregation module guided by radar information to align
global features across candidate proposals and a local-level inter-grid feature
aggregation module that expands local features along the reference trajectories
to enhance fine-grained object representation. The aggregated features are then
processed by a trajectory-level multi-frame spatiotemporal reasoning module to
encode cross-frame interactions and enhance temporal representation. Extensive
experiments on the VoD and TJ4DRadSet datasets demonstrate that M^3Detection
achieves state-of-the-art 3D detection performance, validating its
effectiveness in multi-frame detection with camera-4D imaging radar fusion.

TL;DR: DANCER is a diffusion-based framework for realistic single-person dance synthesis that enhances reference image details and extends motion guidance through specialized modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video generation, especially for human-involved content like dancing, is challenging due to high degrees of freedom in human motions and requirements for quality and continuity.

Method: Proposes DANCER framework with Appearance Enhancement Module (AEM) to focus on reference image details and Pose Rendering Module (PRM) to capture pose conditions from extra domains. Uses stable video diffusion model and collects TikTok-3K dataset for training.

Result: The model achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on real-world datasets, as validated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: DANCER effectively addresses the challenges of realistic dance video generation through specialized modules for appearance enhancement and pose rendering, demonstrating improved generation capability.

Abstract: Recently, diffusion models have shown their impressive ability in visual
generation tasks. Besides static images, more and more research attentions have
been drawn to the generation of realistic videos. The video generation not only
has a higher requirement for the quality, but also brings a challenge in
ensuring the video continuity. Among all the video generation tasks,
human-involved contents, such as human dancing, are even more difficult to
generate due to the high degrees of freedom associated with human motions. In
this paper, we propose a novel framework, named as DANCER (Dance ANimation via
Condition Enhancement and Rendering with Diffusion Model), for realistic
single-person dance synthesis based on the most recent stable video diffusion
model. As the video generation is generally guided by a reference image and a
video sequence, we introduce two important modules into our framework to fully
benefit from the two inputs. More specifically, we design an Appearance
Enhancement Module (AEM) to focus more on the details of the reference image
during the generation, and extend the motion guidance through a Pose Rendering
Module (PRM) to capture pose conditions from extra domains. To further improve
the generation capability of our model, we also collect a large amount of video
data from Internet, and generate a novel datasetTikTok-3K to enhance the model
training. The effectiveness of the proposed model has been evaluated through
extensive experiments on real-world datasets, where the performance of our
model is superior to that of the state-of-the-art methods. All the data and
codes will be released upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: H2-Cache is a hierarchical caching mechanism for diffusion models that accelerates inference up to 5.08x while maintaining image quality by separating denoising into structure-defining and detail-refining stages with dual-threshold caching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models face practical deployment challenges due to high computational costs of iterative denoising. Existing caching techniques create a trade-off between speed and fidelity, suffering from quality degradation and computational overhead.

Method: H2-Cache uses a hierarchical caching mechanism based on separating denoising into structure-defining and detail-refining stages. It employs dual-threshold system with independent thresholds for each stage, and introduces pooled feature summarization (PFS) for lightweight similarity estimation.

Result: Extensive experiments on Flux architecture show H2-Cache achieves up to 5.08x acceleration while maintaining nearly identical image quality to baseline, outperforming existing caching methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Conclusion: H2-Cache presents a robust and practical solution that resolves the speed-quality dilemma in diffusion models, significantly lowering barriers for real-world application of high-fidelity diffusion models.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as state-of-the-art in image generation, but
their practical deployment is hindered by the significant computational cost of
their iterative denoising process. While existing caching techniques can
accelerate inference, they often create a challenging trade-off between speed
and fidelity, suffering from quality degradation and high computational
overhead. To address these limitations, we introduce H2-Cache, a novel
hierarchical caching mechanism designed for modern generative diffusion model
architectures. Our method is founded on the key insight that the denoising
process can be functionally separated into a structure-defining stage and a
detail-refining stage. H2-cache leverages this by employing a dual-threshold
system, using independent thresholds to selectively cache each stage. To ensure
the efficiency of our dual-check approach, we introduce pooled feature
summarization (PFS), a lightweight technique for robust and fast similarity
estimation. Extensive experiments on the Flux architecture demonstrate that
H2-cache achieves significant acceleration (up to 5.08x) while maintaining
image quality nearly identical to the baseline, quantitatively and
qualitatively outperforming existing caching methods. Our work presents a
robust and practical solution that effectively resolves the speed-quality
dilemma, significantly lowering the barrier for the real-world application of
high-fidelity diffusion models. Source code is available at

TL;DR: SilhouetteTell is a novel video identification attack that uses subtitle silhouettes' spatiotemporal features to infer both online and offline videos, achieving high accuracy from distances up to 40 meters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video identification attacks pose serious privacy threats by revealing viewing habits that can expose personal information, enable user profiling, and lead to cyberbullying or discrimination. Existing methods rely on network traffic analysis.

Method: The approach analyzes subtitle silhouettes displayed on screens, combining spatial and temporal information into spatiotemporal features. It correlates recorded subtitle silhouettes with video subtitle files to identify videos.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on smartphones demonstrate high efficacy in inferring video titles and clips under various conditions, including from distances up to 40 meters.

Conclusion: SilhouetteTell presents a significant privacy threat by enabling effective video identification through subtitle silhouette analysis, highlighting the need for countermeasures against this novel attack vector.

Abstract: Video identification attacks pose a significant privacy threat that can
reveal videos that victims watch, which may disclose their hobbies, religious
beliefs, political leanings, sexual orientation, and health status. Also, video
watching history can be used for user profiling or advertising and may result
in cyberbullying, discrimination, or blackmail. Existing extensive video
inference techniques usually depend on analyzing network traffic generated by
streaming online videos. In this work, we observe that the content of a
subtitle determines its silhouette displayed on the screen, and identifying
each subtitle silhouette also derives the temporal difference between two
consecutive subtitles. We then propose SilhouetteTell, a novel video
identification attack that combines the spatial and time domain information
into a spatiotemporal feature of subtitle silhouettes. SilhouetteTell explores
the spatiotemporal correlation between recorded subtitle silhouettes of a video
and its subtitle file. It can infer both online and offline videos.
Comprehensive experiments on off-the-shelf smartphones confirm the high
efficacy of SilhouetteTell for inferring video titles and clips under various
settings, including from a distance of up to 40 meters.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DPHR is a dual-level progressive hardness-aware reweighting strategy for cross-view geo-localization that addresses viewpoint gaps and hard negatives through sample-level difficulty assessment and batch-level progressive weighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-view geo-localization between drone and satellite imagery faces severe viewpoint gaps and hard negatives. Existing static weighting methods are sensitive to distribution shifts and prone to overemphasizing difficult samples too early, causing noisy gradients and unstable convergence.

Method: Dual-level Progressive Hardness-aware Reweighting (DPHR) with: 1) Sample-level Ratio-based Difficulty-Aware (RDA) module that evaluates relative difficulty and assigns fine-grained weights to negatives; 2) Batch-level Progressive Adaptive Loss Weighting (PALW) mechanism that uses training-progress signal to attenuate noisy gradients early and progressively enhance hard-negative mining as training matures.

Result: Experiments on University-1652 and SUES-200 benchmarks demonstrate effectiveness and robustness, achieving consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: DPHR provides an effective solution for cross-view geo-localization by addressing the limitations of static weighting through progressive hardness-aware reweighting at both sample and batch levels.

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) between drone and satellite imagery
remains challenging due to severe viewpoint gaps and the presence of hard
negatives, which are visually similar but geographically mismatched samples.
Existing mining or reweighting strategies often use static weighting, which is
sensitive to distribution shifts and prone to overemphasizing difficult samples
too early, leading to noisy gradients and unstable convergence. In this paper,
we present a Dual-level Progressive Hardness-aware Reweighting (DPHR) strategy.
At the sample level, a Ratio-based Difficulty-Aware (RDA) module evaluates
relative difficulty and assigns fine-grained weights to negatives. At the batch
level, a Progressive Adaptive Loss Weighting (PALW) mechanism exploits a
training-progress signal to attenuate noisy gradients during early optimization
and progressively enhance hard-negative mining as training matures. Experiments
on the University-1652 and SUES-200 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness
and robustness of the proposed DPHR, achieving consistent improvements over
state-of-the-art methods.

*Zixuan Hu,Yongxian Wei,Li Shen,Zhenyi Wang,Lei Li,Chun Yuan,Dacheng Tao*

TL;DR: Proposes a sparse model inversion method that selectively inverts semantic foregrounds while avoiding noisy backgrounds and spurious correlations, achieving up to 3.79x speedup over dense inversion methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dense inversion methods are inefficient for high-resolution images from Vision Transformers due to redundant inversion of noisy backgrounds and unintended inversion of spurious correlations (hallucination).

Method: A plug-and-play sparse model inversion strategy that selectively inverts semantic foregrounds while stopping inversion of noisy backgrounds and potential spurious correlations, without modifying original loss functions.

Result: Achieves significant inversion acceleration (up to 3.79x faster) while maintaining comparable or enhanced downstream performance in data-free model quantization and knowledge transfer.

Conclusion: The proposed sparse model inversion approach effectively addresses inefficiency in existing methods by focusing on semantic foregrounds, providing a practical solution for data-free applications.

Abstract: Model inversion, which aims to reconstruct the original training data from
pre-trained discriminative models, is especially useful when the original
training data is unavailable due to privacy, usage rights, or size constraints.
However, existing dense inversion methods attempt to reconstruct the entire
image area, making them extremely inefficient when inverting high-resolution
images from large-scale Vision Transformers (ViTs). We further identify two
underlying causes of this inefficiency: the redundant inversion of noisy
backgrounds and the unintended inversion of spurious correlations--a phenomenon
we term "hallucination" in model inversion. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel sparse model inversion strategy, as a plug-and-play extension
to speed up existing dense inversion methods with no need for modifying their
original loss functions. Specifically, we selectively invert semantic
foregrounds while stopping the inversion of noisy backgrounds and potential
spurious correlations. Through both theoretical and empirical studies, we
validate the efficacy of our approach in achieving significant inversion
acceleration (up to 3.79 faster) while maintaining comparable or even enhanced
downstream performance in data-free model quantization and data-free knowledge
transfer. Code is available at https://github.com/Egg-Hu/SMI.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MIVA, a new multimodal deception detection task using Werewolf game data, and finds that current MLLMs like GPT-4o struggle significantly with truth detection despite their strong visual-textual capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI systems become more integrated into human lives, robust social intelligence including deception detection is crucial. Current MLLMs have impressive multimodal abilities but their capabilities in detecting deception in dynamic conversations remain unquantified.

Method: Created a new multimodal dataset from Werewolf social deduction game with synchronized video, text, and verifiable ground-truth labels. Established benchmark evaluating state-of-the-art MLLMs on this deception detection task.

Result: Significant performance gap found - even powerful models like GPT-4o struggle to reliably distinguish truth from falsehood. Models fail to ground language in visual social cues effectively and may be overly conservative in alignment.

Conclusion: Highlights urgent need for novel approaches to build more perceptive and trustworthy AI systems capable of multimodal deception detection in dynamic social interactions.

Abstract: As AI systems become increasingly integrated into human lives, endowing them
with robust social intelligence has emerged as a critical frontier. A key
aspect of this intelligence is discerning truth from deception, a ubiquitous
element of human interaction that is conveyed through a complex interplay of
verbal language and non-verbal visual cues. However, automatic deception
detection in dynamic, multi-party conversations remains a significant
challenge. The recent rise of powerful Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), with their impressive abilities in visual and textual understanding,
makes them natural candidates for this task. Consequently, their capabilities
in this crucial domain are mostly unquantified. To address this gap, we
introduce a new task, Multimodal Interactive Veracity Assessment (MIVA), and
present a novel multimodal dataset derived from the social deduction game
Werewolf. This dataset provides synchronized video, text, with verifiable
ground-truth labels for every statement. We establish a comprehensive benchmark
evaluating state-of-the-art MLLMs, revealing a significant performance gap:
even powerful models like GPT-4o struggle to distinguish truth from falsehood
reliably. Our analysis of failure modes indicates that these models fail to
ground language in visual social cues effectively and may be overly
conservative in their alignment, highlighting the urgent need for novel
approaches to building more perceptive and trustworthy AI systems.

Motivation: Address limitations in existing village studies that use single-disciplinary perspectives and qualitative methods, constrained by lack of digital infrastructure and insufficient data.

Method: Develops HGNN model with input/communication nodes and static/dynamic edges, combining GCN and GAT with two-stage feature update mechanism and relational pooling across 17 village subtypes.

Result: Achieves significant performance improvements, with joint optimization lifting mean accuracy/F1 from 0.71/0.83 to 0.82/0.90, driven by 6% gain for parcel tasks.

Conclusion: Provides scientific evidence for exploring village spatial patterns and generative logic, addressing urbanization-induced spatial characteristic disappearance and landscape homogenization.

Abstract: Villages areas hold significant importance in the study of human-land
relationships. However, with the advancement of urbanization, the gradual
disappearance of spatial characteristics and the homogenization of landscapes
have emerged as prominent issues. Existing studies primarily adopt a
single-disciplinary perspective to analyze villages spatial morphology and its
influencing factors, relying heavily on qualitative analysis methods. These
efforts are often constrained by the lack of digital infrastructure and
insufficient data. To address the current research limitations, this paper
proposes a Hierarchical Graph Neural Network (HGNN) model that integrates
multi-source data to conduct an in-depth analysis of villages spatial
morphology. The framework includes two types of nodes-input nodes and
communication nodes-and two types of edges-static input edges and dynamic
communication edges. By combining Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph
Attention Networks (GAT), the proposed model efficiently integrates multimodal
features under a two-stage feature update mechanism. Additionally, based on
existing principles for classifying villages spatial morphology, the paper
introduces a relational pooling mechanism and implements a joint training
strategy across 17 subtypes. Experimental results demonstrate that this method
achieves significant performance improvements over existing approaches in
multimodal fusion and classification tasks. Additionally, the proposed joint
optimization of all sub-types lifts mean accuracy/F1 from 0.71/0.83
(independent models) to 0.82/0.90, driven by a 6% gain for parcel tasks. Our
method provides scientific evidence for exploring villages spatial patterns and
generative logic.

*Ren Tasai,Guang Li,Ren Togo,Takahiro Ogawa,Kenji Hirata,Minghui Tang,Takaaki Yoshimura,Hiroyuki Sugimori,Noriko Nishioka,Yukie Shimizu,Kohsuke Kudo,Miki Haseyama*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel continual self-supervised learning framework for chest CT images that addresses domain shifts from different window settings while ensuring data privacy through latent replay and feature distillation techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming challenges in medical image diagnosis including scarcity of large annotated datasets, domain shifts from different CT window settings, and privacy constraints that prevent reusing past data.

Method: Continual pretraining on unlabeled images with latent replay mechanism to prevent catastrophic forgetting, plus feature distillation combining Wasserstein distance-based knowledge distillation and batch-knowledge ensemble.

Result: Superior performance demonstrated on chest CT images across two different window settings compared to other approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively learns diverse features from multi-window CT images while maintaining data privacy and robustness against domain shifts.

Abstract: We propose a novel continual self-supervised learning (CSSL) framework for
simultaneously learning diverse features from multi-window-obtained chest
computed tomography (CT) images and ensuring data privacy. Achieving a robust
and highly generalizable model in medical image diagnosis is challenging,
mainly because of issues, such as the scarcity of large-scale, accurately
annotated datasets and domain shifts inherent to dynamic healthcare
environments. Specifically, in chest CT, these domain shifts often arise from
differences in window settings, which are optimized for distinct clinical
purposes. Previous CSSL frameworks often mitigated domain shift by reusing past
data, a typically impractical approach owing to privacy constraints. Our
approach addresses these challenges by effectively capturing the relationship
between previously learned knowledge and new information across different
training stages through continual pretraining on unlabeled images.
Specifically, by incorporating a latent replay-based mechanism into CSSL, our
method mitigates catastrophic forgetting due to domain shifts during continual
pretraining while ensuring data privacy. Additionally, we introduce a feature
distillation technique that integrates Wasserstein distance-based knowledge
distillation (WKD) and batch-knowledge ensemble (BKE), enhancing the ability of
the model to learn meaningful, domain-shift-robust representations. Finally, we
validate our approach using chest CT images obtained across two different
window settings, demonstrating superior performance compared with other
approaches.

*Renjie Ji,Xue Wang,Chao Niu,Wen Zhang,Yong Mei,Kun Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpecAware is a hyperspectral foundation model that uses sensor meta-attributes and spectral content to enable unified multi-sensor learning for HSI mapping, achieving superior performance across various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HSI foundation models overlook sensor meta-attributes and struggle with multi-sensor training, limiting transferability across different sensors and scenes.

Method: Two-step hypernetwork-driven encoding: 1) Meta-content aware module fuses sensor attributes and image content, 2) HyperEmbedding module uses sample-conditioned hypernetwork to generate adaptive spatial-spectral feature encoding.

Result: Extensive experiments on six datasets show SpecAware learns superior feature representations and excels in land-cover semantic segmentation, change detection, and scene classification.

Conclusion: SpecAware establishes a unified framework for joint pre-training across diverse sensors and scenes, enabling adaptive processing of variable spectral channels and superior HSI analysis.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a vital tool for fine-grained land-use and
land-cover (LULC) mapping. However, the inherent heterogeneity of HSI data has
long posed a major barrier to developing generalized models via joint training.
Although HSI foundation models have shown promise for different downstream
tasks, the existing approaches typically overlook the critical guiding role of
sensor meta-attributes, and struggle with multi-sensor training, limiting their
transferability. To address these challenges, we propose SpecAware, which is a
novel hyperspectral spectral-content aware foundation model for unifying
multi-sensor learning for HSI mapping. We also constructed the Hyper-400K
dataset to facilitate this research, which is a new large-scale, high-quality
benchmark dataset with over 400k image patches from diverse airborne AVIRIS
sensors. The core of SpecAware is a two-step hypernetwork-driven encoding
process for HSI data. Firstly, we designed a meta-content aware module to
generate a unique conditional input for each HSI patch, tailored to each
spectral band of every sample by fusing the sensor meta-attributes and its own
image content. Secondly, we designed the HyperEmbedding module, where a
sample-conditioned hypernetwork dynamically generates a pair of matrix factors
for channel-wise encoding, consisting of adaptive spatial pattern extraction
and latent semantic feature re-projection. Thus, SpecAware gains the ability to
perceive and interpret spatial-spectral features across diverse scenes and
sensors. This, in turn, allows SpecAware to adaptively process a variable
number of spectral channels, establishing a unified framework for joint
pre-training. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate that SpecAware
can learn superior feature representations, excelling in land-cover semantic
segmentation classification, change detection, and scene classification.

This paper presents a detailed analysis of YOLOv11, the recent advancement in
the YOLO series of deep learning models, focusing on its application to joint
building extraction and discrete height classification from satellite imagery.
YOLOv11 builds on the strengths of earlier YOLO models by introducing a more
efficient architecture that better combines features at different scales,
improves object localization accuracy, and enhances performance in complex
urban scenes. Using the DFC2023 Track 2 dataset -- which includes over 125,000
annotated buildings across 12 cities -- we evaluate YOLOv11's performance using
metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and mean average precision (mAP).
Our findings demonstrate that YOLOv11 achieves strong instance segmentation
performance with 60.4\% mAP@50 and 38.3\% mAP@50--95 while maintaining robust
classification accuracy across five predefined height tiers. The model excels
in handling occlusions, complex building shapes, and class imbalance,
particularly for rare high-rise structures. Comparative analysis confirms that
YOLOv11 outperforms earlier multitask frameworks in both detection accuracy and
inference speed, making it well-suited for real-time, large-scale urban

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks. Supports effective downstream applications without requiring extra computation.

Conclusion: MoRE successfully addresses 3D model scaling challenges through its MoE architecture and specialized components, demonstrating superior performance and adaptability across diverse geometric tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in language and vision have demonstrated that scaling up
model capacity consistently improves performance across diverse tasks. In 3D
visual geometry reconstruction, large-scale training has likewise proven
effective for learning versatile representations. However, further scaling of
3D models is challenging due to the complexity of geometric supervision and the
diversity of 3D data. To overcome these limitations, we propose MoRE, a dense
3D visual foundation model based on a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture
that dynamically routes features to task-specific experts, allowing them to
specialize in complementary data aspects and enhance both scalability and
adaptability. Aiming to improve robustness under real-world conditions, MoRE
incorporates a confidence-based depth refinement module that stabilizes and
refines geometric estimation. In addition, it integrates dense semantic
features with globally aligned 3D backbone representations for high-fidelity
surface normal prediction. MoRE is further optimized with tailored loss
functions to ensure robust learning across diverse inputs and multiple
geometric tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoRE achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks and supports effective
downstream applications without extra computation.

TL;DR: Object-IR is a self-supervised image retargeting method that uses mesh warping optimization guided by object consistency and geometric constraints to eliminate distortion in important regions without requiring manual annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the challenge of geometric distortion in semantically important regions during image retargeting, which remains an intractable problem in the field.

Method: Reformulates image retargeting as a learning-based mesh warping optimization using a CNN to predict mesh grid motions. Uses object-consistent loss, geometric-preserving loss, and boundary loss in a self-supervised paradigm without manual annotations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on RetargetMe benchmark, outperforming existing methods in both quantitative metrics and subjective visual quality. Processes 1024x683 resolution in 0.009s average inference time with real-time performance on consumer GPUs.

Conclusion: Object-IR effectively eliminates geometric distortion in important regions through self-supervised mesh warping optimization, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency compared to existing retargeting methods.

Abstract: Eliminating geometric distortion in semantically important regions remains an
intractable challenge in image retargeting. This paper presents Object-IR, a
self-supervised architecture that reformulates image retargeting as a
learning-based mesh warping optimization problem, where the mesh deformation is
guided by object appearance consistency and geometric-preserving constraints.
Given an input image and a target aspect ratio, we initialize a uniform rigid
mesh at the output resolution and use a convolutional neural network to predict
the motion of each mesh grid and obtain the deformed mesh. The retargeted
result is generated by warping the input image according to the rigid mesh in
the input image and the deformed mesh in the output resolution. To mitigate
geometric distortion, we design a comprehensive objective function
incorporating a) object-consistent loss to ensure that the important semantic
objects retain their appearance, b) geometric-preserving loss to constrain
simple scale transform of the important meshes, and c) boundary loss to enforce
a clean rectangular output. Notably, our self-supervised paradigm eliminates
the need for manually annotated retargeting datasets by deriving supervision
directly from the input's geometric and semantic properties. Extensive
evaluations on the RetargetMe benchmark demonstrate that our Object-IR achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods in quantitative
metrics and subjective visual quality assessments. The framework efficiently
processes arbitrary input resolutions (average inference time: 0.009s for
1024x683 resolution) while maintaining real-time performance on consumer-grade
GPUs. The source code will soon be available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FuseCPath is a novel framework for fusing heterogeneous pathological foundation models (FMs) in whole slide image analysis, addressing performance variability caused by diverse training datasets and architectures through multi-view clustering, cluster-level re-embedding, and collaborative distillation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pathological foundation models exhibit substantial heterogeneity due to diverse private training datasets and different network architectures, which introduces performance variability when using extracted features from different FMs in downstream tasks.

Method: The framework includes: (i) multi-view clustering-based method to filter discriminative patches using multiple FMs' embeddings, (ii) cluster-level re-embedding strategy to online capture patch-level local features, and (iii) collaborative distillation strategy to explore connections between slide-level FMs.

Result: Extensive experiments on lung cancer, bladder cancer, and colorectal cancer datasets from TCGA demonstrated that FuseCPath achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks on these public datasets.

Conclusion: FuseCPath effectively fuses heterogeneous pathological foundation models to achieve superior ensemble performance in computational pathology tasks.

Abstract: Whole slide image (WSI) analysis has emerged as an increasingly essential
technique in computational pathology. Recent advances in the pathological
foundation models (FMs) have demonstrated significant advantages in deriving
meaningful patch-level or slide-level feature representations from WSIs.
However, current pathological FMs have exhibited substantial heterogeneity
caused by diverse private training datasets and different network
architectures. This heterogeneity introduces performance variability when we
utilize the extracted features from different FMs in the downstream tasks. To
fully explore the advantage of multiple FMs effectively, in this work, we
propose a novel framework for the fusion of heterogeneous pathological FMs,
called FuseCPath, yielding a model with a superior ensemble performance. The
main contributions of our framework can be summarized as follows: (i) To
guarantee the representativeness of the training patches, we propose a
multi-view clustering-based method to filter out the discriminative patches via
multiple FMs' embeddings. (ii) To effectively fuse the heterogeneous
patch-level FMs, we devise a cluster-level re-embedding strategy to online
capture patch-level local features. (iii) To effectively fuse the heterogeneous
slide-level FMs, we devise a collaborative distillation strategy to explore the
connections between slide-level FMs. Extensive experiments conducted on lung
cancer, bladder cancer, and colorectal cancer datasets from The Cancer Genome
Atlas (TCGA) have demonstrated that the proposed FuseCPath achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks on these public datasets.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a two-phase training method combining spatial and frequency domain denoising using Discrete Wavelet Transform to defend against adversarial attacks on DNNs, significantly improving classification accuracy across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, limiting their use in security-critical systems. The paper aims to develop robust defense mechanisms against these sophisticated attacks.

Method: Two-phase training: 1) Train a denoising network that integrates spatial image features with frequency analysis using Discrete Wavelet Transform through a transformer layer, 2) Retrain the classifier using denoised images to enhance robustness.

Result: Experimental results on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Fashion-MNIST datasets show the method significantly elevates classification accuracy, substantially exceeding performance of denoising networks and adversarial training approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid spatial-frequency domain denoising approach effectively defends against adversarial attacks and improves DNN robustness, with analysis revealing high-frequency components are more severely corrupted in attacked images.

Abstract: In recent times, deep neural networks (DNNs) have been successfully adopted
for various applications. Despite their notable achievements, it has become
evident that DNNs are vulnerable to sophisticated adversarial attacks,
restricting their applications in security-critical systems. In this paper, we
present two-phase training methods to tackle the attack: first, training the
denoising network, and second, the deep classifier model. We propose a novel
denoising strategy that integrates both spatial and frequency domain approaches
to defend against adversarial attacks on images. Our analysis reveals that
high-frequency components of attacked images are more severely corrupted
compared to their lower-frequency counterparts. To address this, we leverage
Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for frequency analysis and develop a denoising
network that combines spatial image features with wavelets through a
transformer layer. Next, we retrain the classifier using the denoised images,
which enhances the classifier's robustness against adversarial attacks.
Experimental results across the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Fashion-MNIST datasets
reveal that the proposed method remarkably elevates classification accuracy,
substantially exceeding the performance by utilizing a denoising network and
adversarial training approaches. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that cause incorrect predictions with small input perturbations, making robust defense crucial for deploying reliable deep-learning systems.

Method: Utilizes contrastive loss function to train classification models with both clean and adversarially perturbed images, optimizing model parameters alongside perturbations to learn robust representations.

Result: Experimental results show significant improvements in model robustness against various types of adversarial perturbations.

Conclusion: Contrastive loss helps extract more informative and resilient features, contributing to adversarial robustness in deep learning.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success in computer

However, they are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can cause incorrect

crucial for deploying robust deep-learning systems. This paper presents a novel
approach that utilizes contrastive learning for adversarial defense, a
previously unexplored area. Our method leverages the contrastive loss function
to enhance the robustness of classification models by training them with both
clean and adversarially perturbed images. By optimizing the model's parameters
alongside the perturbations, our approach enables the network to learn robust
representations that are less susceptible to adversarial attacks. Experimental
results show significant improvements in the model's robustness against various

extract more informative and resilient features, contributing to the field of
adversarial robustness in deep learning.

TL;DR: This paper addresses ambiguity in zero-shot action recognition by using web-crawled descriptions and LLM-extracted keywords instead of manual annotations, with a spatio-temporal module for better video-description alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models face challenges with multi-semantic words in action classes that introduce ambiguity, requiring better semantic context without manual annotation.

Method: Proposes using web-crawled descriptions processed by large-language models to extract keywords, plus a spatio-temporal interaction module to align description attributes with video content.

Result: Achieved 81.0% on UCF-101, 53.1% on HMDB-51, and 68.9% on Kinetics-600 in zero-shot experiments.

Conclusion: The approach effectively reduces ambiguity in action recognition, demonstrates strong adaptability across datasets, and eliminates the need for manual annotation.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
zero-shot action recognition by learning to associate video embeddings with
class embeddings. However, a significant challenge arises when relying solely
on action classes to provide semantic context, particularly due to the presence
of multi-semantic words, which can introduce ambiguity in understanding the
intended concepts of actions. To address this issue, we propose an innovative
approach that harnesses web-crawled descriptions, leveraging a large-language
model to extract relevant keywords. This method reduces the need for human
annotators and eliminates the laborious manual process of attribute data
creation. Additionally, we introduce a spatio-temporal interaction module
designed to focus on objects and action units, facilitating alignment between
description attributes and video content. In our zero-shot experiments, our
model achieves impressive results, attaining accuracies of 81.0%, 53.1%, and
68.9% on UCF-101, HMDB-51, and Kinetics-600, respectively, underscoring the

TL;DR: RegionRAG shifts multi-modal RAG from document-level to region-level retrieval, using hybrid supervision to identify relevant patches and dynamic grouping for semantic regions, achieving SOTA performance with improved accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-modal RAG methods use entire documents as retrieval units, introducing irrelevant visual content that dilutes focus on salient information and degrades performance through redundant contexts.

Method: Proposes region-level retrieval with hybrid supervision from labeled/unlabeled data to pinpoint relevant patches, and a dynamic pipeline that groups salient patches into complete semantic regions during inference.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art on six benchmarks: improves retrieval accuracy by 10.02% in R@1 on average, increases QA accuracy by 3.56% while using only 71.42% visual tokens compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: RegionRAG enables generators to focus on concise relevant visual content, improving both efficiency and accuracy by delegating region identification to the retriever.

Abstract: Multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a critical method
for empowering LLMs by leveraging candidate visual documents. However, current
methods consider the entire document as the basic retrieval unit, introducing
substantial irrelevant visual content in two ways: 1) Relevant documents often
contain large regions unrelated to the query, diluting the focus on salient
information; 2) Retrieving multiple documents to increase recall further
introduces redundant and irrelevant documents. These redundant contexts
distract the model's attention and further degrade the performance. To address
this challenge, we propose \modelname, a novel framework that shifts the
retrieval paradigm from the document level to the region level. During
training, we design a hybrid supervision strategy from both labeled data and
unlabeled data to pinpoint relevant patches. During inference, we propose a
dynamic pipeline that intelligently groups salient patches into complete
semantic regions. By delegating the task of identifying relevant regions to the
retriever, \modelname enables the generator to focus solely on concise visual
content relevant to queries, improving both efficiency and accuracy.
Experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that RegionRAG achieves
state-of-the-art performance. Improves retrieval accuracy by 10.02\% in R@1 on
average and increases question answering accuracy by 3.56\% while using only
71.42\% visual tokens compared to prior methods. The code will be available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: T^3 is a test-time adaptive merging framework for medical vision-language models that dynamically combines pretrained and fine-tuned models using Jensen-Shannon divergence, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse medical modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of existing model-merging techniques in medical imaging: pretrained models lack modality-specific characteristics while fine-tuned models fail under modality shift, with current methods being too static for varied clinical tasks.

Method: Propose T^3 framework that computes per-sample interpolation coefficients via Jensen-Shannon divergence between model output distributions, with T^3_B extension for batch-wise merging to reduce computational costs.

Result: T^3 achieves new state-of-the-art in Top-1 accuracy and error reduction across four medical modalities, outperforming strong baselines while maintaining efficiency in cross-evaluation protocols.

Conclusion: T^3 enables adaptive medical vision-language model deployment in clinical settings by dynamically balancing specialist precision and generalist robustness, with code publicly available.

Abstract: In medical imaging, vision-language models face a critical duality:
pretrained networks offer broad robustness but lack subtle, modality-specific
characteristics, while fine-tuned expert models achieve high in-distribution
accuracy yet falter under modality shift. Existing model-merging techniques,
designed for natural-image benchmarks, are simple and efficient but fail to
deliver consistent gains across diverse medical modalities; their static
interpolation limits reliability in varied clinical tasks. To address this, we
introduce Test-Time Task adaptive merging (T^3), a backpropagation-free
framework that computes per-sample interpolation coefficients via the
Jensen-Shannon divergence between the two models' output distributions. T^3
dynamically preserves local precision when models agree and defers to
generalist robustness under drift. To overcome the inference costs of
sample-wise merging, we further propose a batch-wise extension, T^3_B, that
computes a merging coefficient across a batch of samples, dramatically reducing
computational bottleneck. Recognizing the lack of a standardized
medical-merging benchmark, we present a rigorous cross-evaluation protocol
spanning in-domain, base-to-novel, and corruptions across four modalities.
Empirically, T^3 sets new state-of-the-art in Top-1 accuracy and error
reduction, outperforming strong baselines while maintaining efficiency, paving
the way for adaptive MVLM deployment in clinical settings. Our code is

TL;DR: HyperClick is a framework that improves GUI agent reliability by calibrating uncertainty through dual rewards and spatial confidence modeling, reducing overconfidence in GUI grounding tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GUI agents lack self-awareness of their capability boundaries, leading to overconfidence and unreliable predictions in dynamic GUI automation where single errors can cause task failure.

Method: Proposes HyperClick with dual reward mechanism: binary reward for correct actions and truncated Gaussian-based spatial confidence modeling calibrated using Brier score, jointly optimizing grounding accuracy and confidence reliability.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on seven challenge benchmarks while providing well-calibrated confidence, reducing overconfidence and supporting more reliable GUI automation.

Conclusion: HyperClick enables explicit confidence calibration and introspective self-criticism, making GUI agents more reliable by aligning confidence with actual accuracy.

Abstract: Autonomous Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents rely on accurate GUI
grounding, which maps language instructions to on-screen coordinates, to
execute user commands. However, current models, whether trained via supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), lack self-awareness of
their capability boundaries, leading to overconfidence and unreliable
predictions. We first systematically evaluate probabilistic and verbalized
confidence in general and GUI-specific models, revealing a misalignment between
confidence and actual accuracy, which is particularly critical in dynamic GUI
automation tasks, where single errors can cause task failure. To address this,
we propose HyperClick, a novel framework that enhances reliable GUI grounding
through uncertainty calibration. HyperClick introduces a dual reward mechanism,
combining a binary reward for correct actions with a truncated Gaussian-based
spatial confidence modeling, calibrated using the Brier score. This approach
jointly optimizes grounding accuracy and confidence reliability, fostering
introspective self-criticism. Extensive experiments on seven challenge
benchmarks show that HyperClick achieves state-of-the-art performance while
providing well-calibrated confidence. By enabling explicit confidence
calibration and introspective self-criticism, HyperClick reduces overconfidence
and supports more reliable GUI automation.

Motivation: Existing keyframe selection methods for multimodal large language models either uniformly subsample frames or use retrieval-style scoring with pre-filtering, which can miss important moments and inflate token usage beyond practical limits for long videos.

Method: FOCUS formulates keyframe selection as a combinatorial pure-exploration problem using multi-armed bandits. It treats short temporal clips as arms and uses empirical means with Bernstein confidence radius to identify informative regions while exploring uncertain areas through a two-stage exploration-exploitation procedure.

Result: On long-video question-answering benchmarks, FOCUS achieves substantial accuracy improvements while processing less than 2% of video frames. For videos longer than 20 minutes, it achieves 11.9% accuracy gain on LongVideoBench.

Conclusion: FOCUS provides an effective and general solution for scalable long-video understanding with MLLMs, demonstrating significant improvements in accuracy with minimal frame processing.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) represent images and video frames as
visual tokens. Scaling from single images to hour-long videos, however,
inflates the token budget far beyond practical limits. Popular pipelines
therefore either uniformly subsample or apply keyframe selection with
retrieval-style scoring using smaller vision-language models. However, these
keyframe selection methods still rely on pre-filtering before selection to
reduce the inference cost and can miss the most informative moments.
  We propose FOCUS, Frame-Optimistic Confidence Upper-bound Selection, a
training-free, model-agnostic keyframe selection module that selects
query-relevant frames under a strict token budget. FOCUS formulates keyframe
selection as a combinatorial pure-exploration (CPE) problem in multi-armed
bandits: it treats short temporal clips as arms, and uses empirical means and
Bernstein confidence radius to identify informative regions while preserving
exploration of uncertain areas. The resulting two-stage
exploration-exploitation procedure reduces from a sequential policy with
theoretical guarantees, first identifying high-value temporal regions, then
selecting top-scoring frames within each region On two long-video
question-answering benchmarks, FOCUS delivers substantial accuracy improvements
while processing less than 2% of video frames. For videos longer than 20
minutes, it achieves an 11.9% gain in accuracy on LongVideoBench, demonstrating
its effectiveness as a keyframe selection method and providing a simple and
general solution for scalable long-video understanding with MLLMs.

### [41] [Rethinking Robust Adversarial Concept Erasure in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27285)
*Qinghong Yin,Yu Tian,Yue Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: S-GRACE is a novel concept erasure method for diffusion models that uses semantic guidance to generate better adversarial samples, improving erasure performance by 26% while reducing training time by 90% compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing concept erasure methods in diffusion models use adversarial training but neglect the specificity of concept spaces, leading to partial mitigation and disruption of non-target concepts due to poor semantic guidance in adversarial sample generation.

Method: S-GRACE (Semantics-Guided Robust Adversarial Concept Erasure) leverages semantic guidance within concept spaces to generate adversarial samples and perform erasure training, addressing the limitations of existing methods that fail to properly fit concept spaces.

Result: Experiments show S-GRACE significantly improves erasure performance by 26%, better preserves non-target concepts, and reduces training time by 90% compared to seven state-of-the-art methods across various diffusion model unlearning scenarios.

Conclusion: S-GRACE demonstrates that proper semantic guidance in adversarial sample generation is crucial for effective concept erasure in diffusion models, achieving superior performance while being more efficient and preserving non-target concepts better.

Abstract: Concept erasure aims to selectively unlearning undesirable content in
diffusion models (DMs) to reduce the risk of sensitive content generation. As a
novel paradigm in concept erasure, most existing methods employ adversarial
training to identify and suppress target concepts, thus reducing the likelihood
of sensitive outputs. However, these methods often neglect the specificity of
adversarial training in DMs, resulting in only partial mitigation. In this
work, we investigate and quantify this specificity from the perspective of
concept space, i.e., can adversarial samples truly fit the target concept
space? We observe that existing methods neglect the role of conceptual
semantics when generating adversarial samples, resulting in ineffective fitting
of concept spaces. This oversight leads to the following issues: 1) when there
are few adversarial samples, they fail to comprehensively cover the object
concept; 2) conversely, they will disrupt other target concept spaces.
Motivated by the analysis of these findings, we introduce S-GRACE
(Semantics-Guided Robust Adversarial Concept Erasure), which grace leveraging
semantic guidance within the concept space to generate adversarial samples and
perform erasure training. Experiments conducted with seven state-of-the-art
methods and three adversarial prompt generation strategies across various DM
unlearning scenarios demonstrate that S-GRACE significantly improves erasure
performance 26%, better preserves non-target concepts, and reduces training
time by 90%. Our code is available at https://github.com/Qhong-522/S-GRACE.

TL;DR: FGMamba is a lightweight medical image super-resolution method that combines frequency-aware state-space modeling with attention mechanisms to achieve superior performance with minimal parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image super-resolution needs to enhance diagnostic accuracy while reducing costs, but current methods struggle to model both long-range anatomical structures and fine-grained frequency details efficiently.

Method: Proposes FGMamba with two key components: Gated Attention-enhanced State-Space Module (GASM) for global dependency modeling, and Pyramid Frequency Fusion Module (PFFM) for multi-resolution high-frequency detail capture using FFT-guided fusion.

Result: Achieves superior PSNR/SSIM across five medical imaging modalities (Ultrasound, OCT, MRI, CT, Endoscopic) with compact parameter footprint (<0.75M), outperforming CNN-based and Transformer-based state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Frequency-aware state-space modeling is effective for scalable and accurate medical image enhancement, providing a lightweight yet powerful solution for medical image super-resolution.

Abstract: Medical image super-resolution (SR) is essential for enhancing diagnostic
accuracy while reducing acquisition cost and scanning time. However, modeling
both long-range anatomical structures and fine-grained frequency details with
low computational overhead remains challenging. We propose FGMamba, a novel
frequency-aware gated state-space model that unifies global dependency modeling
and fine-detail enhancement into a lightweight architecture. Our method
introduces two key innovations: a Gated Attention-enhanced State-Space Module
(GASM) that integrates efficient state-space modeling with dual-branch spatial
and channel attention, and a Pyramid Frequency Fusion Module (PFFM) that
captures high-frequency details across multiple resolutions via FFT-guided
fusion. Extensive evaluations across five medical imaging modalities
(Ultrasound, OCT, MRI, CT, and Endoscopic) demonstrate that FGMamba achieves
superior PSNR/SSIM while maintaining a compact parameter footprint ($<$0.75M),
outperforming CNN-based and Transformer-based SOTAs. Our results validate the
effectiveness of frequency-aware state-space modeling for scalable and accurate
medical image enhancement.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CASR-Net is a three-stage pipeline for coronary artery segmentation that uses multichannel preprocessing, a UNet with DenseNet121 encoder and Self-ONN decoder, and contour refinement to achieve superior segmentation performance on stenotic arteries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of coronary artery disease is critical but poor X-ray image quality can impede diagnosis. Automated segmentation of coronary arteries from angiographic images can support clinicians in diagnosis and treatment planning.

Method: Three-stage pipeline: 1) Multichannel preprocessing combining CLAHE and improved Ben Graham method, 2) Segmentation network with UNet architecture using DenseNet121 encoder and Self-ONN decoder to preserve vessel continuity, 3) Contour refinement module to suppress false positives.

Result: Achieved IoU of 61.43%, DSC of 76.10%, and clDice of 79.36% on combined public datasets with both healthy and stenotic arteries, outperforming state-of-the-art models. Preprocessing provided 0.31-0.89% DSC and 0.40-1.16% IoU improvements.

Conclusion: CASR-Net provides a robust automated coronary artery segmentation approach that can support clinicians in CAD diagnosis and treatment planning, particularly for detecting narrow and stenotic vessel branches.

Abstract: Early detection of coronary artery disease (CAD) is critical for reducing
mortality and improving patient treatment planning. While angiographic image
analysis from X-rays is a common and cost-effective method for identifying
cardiac abnormalities, including stenotic coronary arteries, poor image quality
can significantly impede clinical diagnosis. We present the Coronary Artery
Segmentation and Refinement Network (CASR-Net), a three-stage pipeline
comprising image preprocessing, segmentation, and refinement. A novel
multichannel preprocessing strategy combining CLAHE and an improved Ben Graham
method provides incremental gains, increasing Dice Score Coefficient (DSC) by
0.31-0.89% and Intersection over Union (IoU) by 0.40-1.16% compared with using
the techniques individually. The core innovation is a segmentation network
built on a UNet with a DenseNet121 encoder and a Self-organized Operational
Neural Network (Self-ONN) based decoder, which preserves the continuity of
narrow and stenotic vessel branches. A final contour refinement module further
suppresses false positives. Evaluated with 5-fold cross-validation on a
combination of two public datasets that contain both healthy and stenotic
arteries, CASR-Net outperformed several state-of-the-art models, achieving an
IoU of 61.43%, a DSC of 76.10%, and clDice of 79.36%. These results highlight a
robust approach to automated coronary artery segmentation, offering a valuable
tool to support clinicians in diagnosis and treatment planning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: P²IOD introduces parameterized prompts using neural networks for incremental object detection, addressing co-occurrence issues in detection images by adaptively consolidating knowledge across tasks with constrained updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt-based approaches assume disjoint class sets across tasks, which is unsuitable for object detection due to co-occurrence of objects from previous tasks in current images, causing confusion in prompts pool.

Method: P²IOD uses neural networks as parameterized prompts to adaptively consolidate knowledge across tasks, with a parameterized prompts fusion strategy to constrain structure updates and prevent catastrophic forgetting.

Result: Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC2007 and MS COCO datasets demonstrate P²IOD's effectiveness in incremental object detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance among existing baselines.

Conclusion: Parameterized prompts with adaptive consolidation and constrained updates effectively address co-occurrence challenges in incremental object detection, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that incorporating trainable prompts into
pretrained models enables effective incremental learning. However, the
application of prompts in incremental object detection (IOD) remains
underexplored. Existing prompts pool based approaches assume disjoint class
sets across incremental tasks, which are unsuitable for IOD as they overlook
the inherent co-occurrence phenomenon in detection images. In co-occurring
scenarios, unlabeled objects from previous tasks may appear in current task
images, leading to confusion in prompts pool. In this paper, we hold that
prompt structures should exhibit adaptive consolidation properties across
tasks, with constrained updates to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Motivated
by this, we introduce Parameterized Prompts for Incremental Object Detection
(P$^2$IOD). Leveraging neural networks global evolution properties, P$^2$IOD
employs networks as the parameterized prompts to adaptively consolidate
knowledge across tasks. To constrain prompts structure updates, P$^2$IOD
further engages a parameterized prompts fusion strategy. Extensive experiments
on PASCAL VOC2007 and MS COCO datasets demonstrate that P$^2$IOD's
effectiveness in IOD and achieves the state-of-the-art performance among
existing baselines.

TL;DR: SAGS is a self-adaptive alias-free Gaussian splatting framework that improves deformable tissue reconstruction in endoscopic surgery by addressing aliasing and artifacts caused by tissue movement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reconstructing deformable endoscopic scenes is challenging due to aliasing and artifacts from tissue movement, which degrade visualization quality. Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting methods prioritize speed but neglect these critical issues.

Method: Proposed SAGS framework with attention-driven, dynamically weighted 4D deformation decoder, using 3D smoothing filters and 2D Mip filters to mitigate artifacts and capture fine tissue movement details.

Result: Superior performance on EndoNeRF and SCARED benchmarks, achieving better PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics compared to state-of-the-art methods, with improved visualization quality.

Conclusion: SAGS effectively addresses aliasing and artifact issues in deformable tissue reconstruction while maintaining high-quality visualization, outperforming existing methods across multiple evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Surgical reconstruction of dynamic tissues from endoscopic videos is a
crucial technology in robot-assisted surgery. The development of Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRFs) has greatly advanced deformable tissue reconstruction,
achieving high-quality results from video and image sequences. However,
reconstructing deformable endoscopic scenes remains challenging due to aliasing
and artifacts caused by tissue movement, which can significantly degrade
visualization quality. The introduction of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has
improved reconstruction efficiency by enabling a faster rendering pipeline.
Nevertheless, existing 3DGS methods often prioritize rendering speed while
neglecting these critical issues. To address these challenges, we propose SAGS,
a self-adaptive alias-free Gaussian splatting framework. We introduce an
attention-driven, dynamically weighted 4D deformation decoder, leveraging 3D
smoothing filters and 2D Mip filters to mitigate artifacts in deformable tissue
reconstruction and better capture the fine details of tissue movement.
Experimental results on two public benchmarks, EndoNeRF and SCARED, demonstrate
that our method achieves superior performance in all metrics of PSNR, SSIM, and
LPIPS compared to the state of the art while also delivering better
visualization quality.

TL;DR: Proposes a method for ultra-low bit rate visual communication by integrating image generation with deep image compression using joint text and coding latent to guide rectified flow models for precise scene reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the need for ultra-low bit rate visual communication in challenging scenarios like deep space exploration and battlefield intelligence, where existing text-to-image models only provide semantic approximations that are insufficient for accurate vision analysis and human interactions.

Method: Seamlessly integrates image generation with deep image compression, using joint text and coding latent to guide rectified flow models. Both semantic text description and coding latent are encoded and transmitted at very small bit rates.

Result: Achieves the same image reconstruction quality and vision analysis accuracy as existing methods while using significantly less bandwidth.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enables accurate visual scene reconstruction and maintains vision analysis performance at ultra-low bit rates, making it suitable for bandwidth-constrained applications.

Abstract: We consider the problem of ultra-low bit rate visual communication for remote
vision analysis, human interactions and control in challenging scenarios with
very low communication bandwidth, such as deep space exploration, battlefield
intelligence, and robot navigation in complex environments. In this paper, we
ask the following important question: can we accurately reconstruct the visual
scene using only a very small portion of the bit rate in existing coding
methods while not sacrificing the accuracy of vision analysis and performance
of human interactions? Existing text-to-image generation models offer a new
approach for ultra-low bitrate image description. However, they can only
achieve a semantic-level approximation of the visual scene, which is far
insufficient for the purpose of visual communication and remote vision analysis
and human interactions. To address this important issue, we propose to
seamlessly integrate image generation with deep image compression, using joint
text and coding latent to guide the rectified flow models for precise
generation of the visual scene. The semantic text description and coding latent
are both encoded and transmitted to the decoder at a very small bit rate.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve the same image
reconstruction quality and vision analysis accuracy as existing methods while
using much less bandwidth. The code will be released upon paper acceptance.

TL;DR: CIELR enables complex image editing by converting complex instructions into simple actions using LLM reasoning, avoiding joint fine-tuning of LLMs and diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with complex editing instructions and require computationally expensive joint fine-tuning of LLMs and diffusion models.

Method: Construct structured semantic representation of input image using foundation models, then use iterative update mechanism to refine into fine-grained visual representation for flexible editing.

Result: Surpasses previous SOTA by 9.955 dB in PSNR on SmartEdit dataset, showing superior preservation of consistent regions. Also outperforms on new CIEBench benchmark.

Conclusion: CIELR provides effective complex image editing without expensive joint fine-tuning, achieving state-of-the-art performance while preserving image consistency.

Abstract: Existing image editing methods can handle simple editing instructions very
well. To deal with complex editing instructions, they often need to jointly
fine-tune the large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models (DMs), which
involves very high computational complexity and training cost. To address this
issue, we propose a new method, called \textbf{C}omplex \textbf{I}mage
\textbf{E}diting via \textbf{L}LM \textbf{R}easoning (CIELR), which converts a
complex user instruction into a set of simple and explicit editing actions,
eliminating the need for jointly fine-tuning the large language models and
diffusion models. Specifically, we first construct a structured semantic
representation of the input image using foundation models. Then, we introduce
an iterative update mechanism that can progressively refine this
representation, obtaining a fine-grained visual representation of the image
scene. This allows us to perform complex and flexible image editing tasks.
Extensive experiments on the SmartEdit Reasoning Scenario Set show that our
method surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by 9.955 dB in PSNR, indicating
its superior preservation of regions that should remain consistent. Due to the
limited number of samples of public datasets of complex image editing with
reasoning, we construct a benchmark named CIEBench, containing 86 image
samples, together with a metric specifically for reasoning-based image editing.
CIELR also outperforms previous methods on this benchmark. The code and dataset

Motivation: Existing CLIP-based MLLMs primarily focus on natural images and offer limited support for other visual modalities like videos and visual documents, creating a gap in multimodal embedding capabilities.

Method: Two-stage training strategy: first stage for foundational text and multimodal retrieval, second stage uses improved InfoNCE loss with hardness-weighted mechanism and false negative mitigation. Also employs learnable temperature parameter and model souping.

Result: Sets new SOTA on MMEB benchmark, achieving best overall score and outperforming all prior work on challenging video and visual document retrieval tasks.

Conclusion: RzenEmbed successfully bridges the modality gap by providing a unified framework for diverse visual modalities while enhancing discriminative power and instruction-following capabilities.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has
extended CLIP-based frameworks to produce powerful, universal embeddings for
retrieval tasks. However, existing methods primarily focus on natural images,
offering limited support for other crucial visual modalities such as videos and
visual documents. To bridge this gap, we introduce RzenEmbed, a unified
framework to learn embeddings across a diverse set of modalities, including
text, images, videos, and visual documents. We employ a novel two-stage
training strategy to learn discriminative representations. The first stage
focuses on foundational text and multimodal retrieval. In the second stage, we
introduce an improved InfoNCE loss, incorporating two key enhancements.
Firstly, a hardness-weighted mechanism guides the model to prioritize
challenging samples by assigning them higher weights within each batch.
Secondly, we implement an approach to mitigate the impact of false negatives
and alleviate data noise. This strategy not only enhances the model's
discriminative power but also improves its instruction-following capabilities.
We further boost performance with learnable temperature parameter and model
souping. RzenEmbed sets a new state-of-the-art on the MMEB benchmark. It not
only achieves the best overall score but also outperforms all prior work on the
challenging video and visual document retrieval tasks. Our models are available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PEFT methods have limitations: addition-based methods cause inference latency and complexity, while selection-based methods require full backward passes with high memory usage like full fine-tuning.

Method: FPS ranks parameters by the product of their magnitudes and corresponding input activations in a single forward pass, leveraging both pre-trained knowledge and downstream data without gradients.

Result: On 24 visual tasks from FGVC and VTAB-1k, FPS achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while reducing peak memory usage by nearly 9x and accelerating parameter selection by about 2x.

Conclusion: FPS offers a genuinely memory-efficient and practical solution for fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained models, addressing the limitations of existing PEFT approaches.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a key strategy for
adapting large-scale pre-trained models to downstream tasks, but existing
approaches face notable limitations. Addition-based methods, such as Adapters
[1], introduce inference latency and engineering complexity, while
selection-based methods like Gradient-based Parameter Selection (GPS) [2]
require a full backward pass, which results in the same peak memory usage as
full fine-tuning. To address this dilemma, we propose Feedforward-based
Parameter Selection (FPS), a gradient-free method that identifies an optimal
parameter subset in a single forward pass. FPS ranks parameters by the product
of their magnitudes and corresponding input activations, leveraging both
pre-trained knowledge and downstream data. Evaluated on $24$ visual tasks from
FGVC and VTAB-1k, FPS achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art
methods while reducing peak memory usage by nearly $9 \times$ and accelerating
parameter selection by about $2 \times$, offering a genuinely memory-efficient

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient synthesis of cinematic scenes for television and film production using small datasets, addressing the need for domain-specific visual style adaptation in video generation.

Method: Two-stage process: 1) Use LoRA modules in cross-attention layers of Wan2.1 I2V-14B model for visual style adaptation from short clips, 2) Generate keyframes and expand them into 720p sequences with temporal coherence. Includes lightweight parallelization and sequence partitioning for faster inference.

Conclusion: The pipeline enables practical cinematic scene synthesis from small datasets with measurable quality improvements, and the complete training/inference pipeline is released for reproducibility across cinematic domains.

Abstract: We present a practical pipeline for fine-tuning open-source video diffusion
transformers to synthesize cinematic scenes for television and film production
from small datasets. The proposed two-stage process decouples visual style
learning from motion generation. In the first stage, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
modules are integrated into the cross-attention layers of the Wan2.1 I2V-14B
model to adapt its visual representations using a compact dataset of short
clips from Ay Yapim's historical television film El Turco. This enables
efficient domain transfer within hours on a single GPU. In the second stage,
the fine-tuned model produces stylistically consistent keyframes that preserve
costume, lighting, and color grading, which are then temporally expanded into
coherent 720p sequences through the model's video decoder. We further apply
lightweight parallelization and sequence partitioning strategies to accelerate
inference without quality degradation. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations
using FVD, CLIP-SIM, and LPIPS metrics, supported by a small expert user study,
demonstrate measurable improvements in cinematic fidelity and temporal
stability over the base model. The complete training and inference pipeline is
released to support reproducibility and adaptation across cinematic domains.

TL;DR: Proposes Alignment across Trees method for symmetric hierarchical feature alignment between vision and language modalities using hyperbolic manifolds with different curvatures and an intermediate manifold for cross-modal alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs extract hierarchical text features but represent images with single features, creating asymmetric and suboptimal modality alignment.

Method: Constructs tree-like hierarchical features for both images and text using semantic-aware visual feature extraction with cross-attention, embeds features in hyperbolic manifolds with distinct curvatures, and aligns them using KL distance minimization on an intermediate manifold.

Result: Outperforms strong baselines on taxonomic open-set classification tasks across multiple image datasets under few-shot and cross-domain settings.

Conclusion: The proposed symmetric hierarchical alignment approach effectively addresses modality asymmetry in VLMs and improves cross-modal integration.

Abstract: Modality alignment is critical for vision-language models (VLMs) to
effectively integrate information across modalities. However, existing methods
extract hierarchical features from text while representing each image with a
single feature, leading to asymmetric and suboptimal alignment. To address
this, we propose Alignment across Trees, a method that constructs and aligns
tree-like hierarchical features for both image and text modalities.
Specifically, we introduce a semantic-aware visual feature extraction framework
that applies a cross-attention mechanism to visual class tokens from
intermediate Transformer layers, guided by textual cues to extract visual
features with coarse-to-fine semantics. We then embed the feature trees of the
two modalities into hyperbolic manifolds with distinct curvatures to
effectively model their hierarchical structures. To align across the
heterogeneous hyperbolic manifolds with different curvatures, we formulate a KL
distance measure between distributions on heterogeneous manifolds, and learn an
intermediate manifold for manifold alignment by minimizing the distance. We
prove the existence and uniqueness of the optimal intermediate manifold.
Experiments on taxonomic open-set classification tasks across multiple image
datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines
under few-shot and cross-domain settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing deepfake detection methods - deep learning approaches suffer from poor generalization and vulnerability to distortions, while forensic analysis is interpretable but limited against new manipulation techniques.

Method: Proposes a hybrid framework that fuses forensic features (noise residuals, JPEG compression traces, frequency-domain descriptors) with deep learning representations from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs).

Result: Achieved F1-scores of 0.96, 0.82, and 0.77 on FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF v2, and DFDC datasets respectively. Demonstrated robustness under compression (F1=0.87 at QF=50), adversarial perturbations (AUC=0.84), and unseen manipulations (F1=0.79). Explainability analysis showed 82% overlap between Grad-CAM/forensic heatmaps and ground-truth manipulated regions.

Conclusion: Hybrid approaches provide a balanced solution combining the adaptability of deep models with the interpretability of forensic cues, enabling development of resilient and trustworthy deepfake detection systems.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion
models has made synthetic media increasingly realistic, raising societal
concerns around misinformation, identity fraud, and digital trust. Existing
deepfake detection methods either rely on deep learning, which suffers from
poor generalization and vulnerability to distortions, or forensic analysis,
which is interpretable but limited against new manipulation techniques. This
study proposes a hybrid framework that fuses forensic features, including noise
residuals, JPEG compression traces, and frequency-domain descriptors, with deep
learning representations from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision
transformers (ViTs). Evaluated on benchmark datasets (FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF
v2, DFDC), the proposed model consistently outperformed single-method baselines
and demonstrated superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art
hybrid approaches, achieving F1-scores of 0.96, 0.82, and 0.77, respectively.
Robustness tests demonstrated stable performance under compression (F1 = 0.87
at QF = 50), adversarial perturbations (AUC = 0.84), and unseen manipulations
(F1 = 0.79). Importantly, explainability analysis showed that Grad-CAM and
forensic heatmaps overlapped with ground-truth manipulated regions in 82
percent of cases, enhancing transparency and user trust. These findings confirm
that hybrid approaches provide a balanced solution, combining the adaptability
of deep models with the interpretability of forensic cues, to develop resilient
and trustworthy deepfake detection systems.

*Aditya Parikh,Sneha Das,Aasa Feragen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper audits fairness in breast cancer tumor segmentation, revealing age-related bias against younger patients and showing how data aggregation affects ethnic biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fairness evaluation in deep learning for medical imaging is underexplored beyond classification, particularly in segmentation tasks where bias can lead to healthcare disparities.

Method: Audited the fairness of automated segmentation labels in the MAMA-MIA breast cancer dataset by evaluating segmentation quality across age, ethnicity, and data source variables.

Result: Found intrinsic age-related bias against younger patients that persists after controlling for confounders, and showed data aggregation influences site-specific ethnic biases.

Conclusion: Investigating data at granular levels is necessary to address segmentation biases that could compound across clinical decision points and iterative model development.

Abstract: Deep learning models aim to improve diagnostic workflows, but fairness
evaluation remains underexplored beyond classification, e.g., in image
segmentation. Unaddressed segmentation bias can lead to disparities in the
quality of care for certain populations, potentially compounded across clinical
decision points and amplified through iterative model development. Here, we
audit the fairness of the automated segmentation labels provided in the breast
cancer tumor segmentation dataset MAMA-MIA. We evaluate automated segmentation
quality across age, ethnicity, and data source. Our analysis reveals an
intrinsic age-related bias against younger patients that continues to persist
even after controlling for confounding factors, such as data source. We
hypothesize that this bias may be linked to physiological factors, a known
challenge for both radiologists and automated systems. Finally, we show how
aggregating data from multiple data sources influences site-specific ethnic
biases, underscoring the necessity of investigating data at a granular level.

### [55] [Mitigating Semantic Collapse in Partially Relevant Video Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27432)
*WonJun Moon,MinSeok Jung,Gilhan Park,Tae-Young Kim,Cheol-Ho Cho,Woojin Jun,Jae-Pil Heo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses semantic collapse in Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) by proposing methods to preserve semantic relationships in text embeddings and disentangle hierarchical video representations across temporal scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PRVR methods treat text-video pairs as binary positives/negatives, ignoring semantic variation within videos and across videos. This causes embeddings of queries and video segments for distinct events to collapse together, limiting retrieval performance for videos with multiple diverse events.

Method: Proposes Text Correlation Preservation Learning to preserve semantic relationships in text queries, and Cross-Branch Video Alignment (CBVA) with contrastive learning to disentangle hierarchical video representations across temporal scales. Also introduces order-preserving token merging and adaptive CBVA to enhance alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments on PRVR benchmarks demonstrate that the framework effectively prevents semantic collapse and substantially improves retrieval accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed methods successfully address semantic collapse in both text and video embedding spaces, leading to significant improvements in partially relevant video retrieval performance.

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) seeks videos where only part of the
content matches a text query. Existing methods treat every annotated text-video
pair as a positive and all others as negatives, ignoring the rich semantic
variation both within a single video and across different videos. Consequently,
embeddings of both queries and their corresponding video-clip segments for
distinct events within the same video collapse together, while embeddings of
semantically similar queries and segments from different videos are driven
apart. This limits retrieval performance when videos contain multiple, diverse
events. This paper addresses the aforementioned problems, termed as semantic
collapse, in both the text and video embedding spaces. We first introduce Text
Correlation Preservation Learning, which preserves the semantic relationships
encoded by the foundation model across text queries. To address collapse in
video embeddings, we propose Cross-Branch Video Alignment (CBVA), a contrastive
alignment method that disentangles hierarchical video representations across
temporal scales. Subsequently, we introduce order-preserving token merging and
adaptive CBVA to enhance alignment by producing video segments that are
internally coherent yet mutually distinctive. Extensive experiments on PRVR
benchmarks demonstrate that our framework effectively prevents semantic
collapse and substantially improves retrieval accuracy.

*Yanlong Yang,Guanxiong Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeblurSDI is a zero-shot, self-supervised blind image deconvolution framework that uses iterative reverse self-diffusion without pre-training, achieving superior performance in recovering sharp images and blur kernels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional blind deconvolution methods rely on handcrafted priors, while deep learning approaches need extensive pre-training on external datasets, limiting adaptability to real-world scenarios.

Method: Formulates blind deconvolution as iterative reverse self-diffusion starting from noise, using two randomly-initialized neural networks optimized continuously with data consistency and L1-norm sparsity, plus noise scheduling for stability.

Result: Extensive experiments show DeblurSDI achieves superior performance, recovering sharp images and accurate kernels even in highly degraded scenarios with remarkable robustness to blur kernel size variations.

Conclusion: DeblurSDI provides a zero-shot, self-supervised solution that dynamically learns instance-specific priors without external training, offering robust blind image deconvolution.

Abstract: Blind image deconvolution is a challenging ill-posed inverse problem, where
both the latent sharp image and the blur kernel are unknown. Traditional
methods often rely on handcrafted priors, while modern deep learning approaches
typically require extensive pre-training on large external datasets, limiting
their adaptability to real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose DeblurSDI,
a zero-shot, self-supervised framework based on self-diffusion (SDI) that
requires no prior training. DeblurSDI formulates blind deconvolution as an
iterative reverse self-diffusion process that starts from pure noise and
progressively refines the solution. At each step, two randomly-initialized
neural networks are optimized continuously to refine the sharp image and the
blur kernel. The optimization is guided by an objective function combining data
consistency with a sparsity-promoting L1-norm for the kernel. A key innovation
is our noise scheduling mechanism, which stabilizes the optimization and
provides remarkable robustness to variations in blur kernel size. These allow
DeblurSDI to dynamically learn an instance-specific prior tailored to the input
image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeblurSDI consistently achieves
superior performance, recovering sharp images and accurate kernels even in
highly degraded scenarios.

Result: Matches or outperforms deeper CNN and ViT variants across twelve MedMNIST datasets, with Grad-CAM analyses showing consistent attention to clinically relevant regions.

Conclusion: Principled ViT redesign enables efficient and interpretable models for low-resource medical imaging settings.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated strong potential in medical
imaging; however, their high computational demands and tendency to overfit on
small datasets limit their applicability in real-world clinical scenarios. In
this paper, we present CoMViT, a compact and generalizable Vision Transformer
architecture optimized for resource-constrained medical image analysis. CoMViT
integrates a convolutional tokenizer, diagonal masking, dynamic temperature
scaling, and pooling-based sequence aggregation to improve performance and
generalization. Through systematic architectural optimization, CoMViT achieves
robust performance across twelve MedMNIST datasets while maintaining a
lightweight design with only ~4.5M parameters. It matches or outperforms deeper
CNN and ViT variants, offering up to 5-20x parameter reduction without
sacrificing accuracy. Qualitative Grad-CAM analyses show that CoMViT
consistently attends to clinically relevant regions despite its compact size.
These results highlight the potential of principled ViT redesign for developing
efficient and interpretable models in low-resource medical imaging settings.

### [58] [From Pixels to Paths: A Multi-Agent Framework for Editable Scientific Illustration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27452)
*Jianwen Sun,Fanrui Zhang,Yukang Feng,Chuanhao Li,Zizhen Li,Jiaxin Ai,Yifan Chang,Yu Dai,Kaipeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisPainter is a multi-agent framework for scientific illustration that provides element-level control and post-editability through three specialized modules, addressing limitations of current raster image generation and code-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative models for scientific illustrations have limitations: raster images lack semantic structure and post-editability, while code-based methods are cumbersome and lack intuitive manipulation, failing to meet efficiency and iterative modification needs.

Method: VisPainter uses a multi-agent framework with three modules (Manager, Designer, Toolbox) based on model context protocol to collaboratively produce vector graphics diagrams with explicit element representation and manipulation.

Result: The framework enables true element-level control where any element can be added or modified later. A benchmark called VisBench was created with seven-dimensional metrics to evaluate scientific illustration quality across content, layout, visual perception, and interaction cost.

Conclusion: VisPainter bridges the gap between intuitive manipulation and element-level control in scientific illustration generation, providing a modular solution that supports iterative modification while maintaining compatibility with standard vector graphics software.

Abstract: Scientific illustrations demand both high information density and
post-editability. However, current generative models have two major
limitations: Frist, image generation models output rasterized images lacking
semantic structure, making it impossible to access, edit, or rearrange
independent visual components in the images. Second, code-based generation
methods (TikZ or SVG), although providing element-level control, force users
into the cumbersome cycle of "writing-compiling-reviewing" and lack the
intuitiveness of manipulation. Neither of these two approaches can well meet
the needs for efficiency, intuitiveness, and iterative modification in
scientific creation. To bridge this gap, we introduce VisPainter, a multi-agent
framework for scientific illustration built upon the model context protocol.
VisPainter orchestrates three specialized modules-a Manager, a Designer, and a
Toolbox-to collaboratively produce diagrams compatible with standard vector
graphics software. This modular, role-based design allows each element to be
explicitly represented and manipulated, enabling true element-level control and
any element can be added and modified later. To systematically evaluate the
quality of scientific illustrations, we introduce VisBench, a benchmark with
seven-dimensional evaluation metrics. It assesses high-information-density
scientific illustrations from four aspects: content, layout, visual perception,
and interaction cost. To this end, we conducted extensive ablation experiments
to verify the rationality of our architecture and the reliability of our
evaluation methods. Finally, we evaluated various vision-language models,
presenting fair and credible model rankings along with detailed comparisons of
their respective capabilities. Additionally, we isolated and quantified the
impacts of role division, step control,and description on the quality of
illustrations.

TL;DR: A multi-tiered human-in-the-loop framework for interactive school mapping that combines machine learning analysis, satellite imagery, and human validation to improve educational facility records in developing regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the scarcity and infrequent updates of educational facility records in developing regions, where accurate school data is crucial for planning and resource allocation.

Method: Three-tier approach: 1) ML analysis of population density, land cover, and infrastructure to identify gaps; 2) Medium-resolution satellite imagery (later removed); 3) Very high-resolution imagery with deep learning models to generate candidate locations, combined with interactive human validation interface.

Result: The medium-resolution approach was removed due to insignificant improvements. The framework builds upon global pre-trained models for better generalization.

Conclusion: Preliminary evaluations show the multi-tiered strategy provides a scalable and cost-effective solution for educational infrastructure mapping to support planning and resource allocation.

Abstract: This paper presents a multi-tiered human-in-the-loop framework for
interactive school mapping designed to improve the accuracy and completeness of
educational facility records, particularly in developing regions where such
data may be scarce and infrequently updated. The first tier involves a machine
learning based analysis of population density, land cover, and existing
infrastructure compared with known school locations. The first tier identifies
potential gaps and "mislabelled" schools. In subsequent tiers,
medium-resolution satellite imagery (Sentinel-2) is investigated to pinpoint
regions with a high likelihood of school presence, followed by the application
of very high-resolution (VHR) imagery and deep learning models to generate
detailed candidate locations for schools within these prioritised areas. The
medium-resolution approach was later removed due to insignificant improvements.
The medium and VHR resolution models build upon global pre-trained steps to
improve generalisation. A key component of the proposed approach is an
interactive interface to allow human operators to iteratively review, validate,
and refine the mapping results. Preliminary evaluations indicate that the
multi-tiered strategy provides a scalable and cost-effective solution for
educational infrastructure mapping to support planning and resource allocation.

Conclusion: Highlights the importance of cross-modal identity verification for future deepfake detection, with code publicly available.

Abstract: Since deepfakes generated by advanced generative models have rapidly posed
serious threats, existing audiovisual deepfake detection approaches struggle to

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces NAUTILUS, an underwater large multimodal model for scene understanding, built on a new dataset NautData with 1.45M image-text pairs across 8 tasks, and featuring a vision feature enhancement module to address underwater image degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater exploration is important for resource exploration and national security, but lacks large-scale multi-task datasets and suffers from image degradation issues that hinder automated scene understanding.

Method: Constructed NautData dataset with 1.45M image-text pairs for 8 underwater tasks, and developed a plug-and-play vision feature enhancement (VFE) module using physical priors from underwater imaging models to restore clear information.

Result: NAUTILUS consistently improves performance of baseline models (LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen2.5-VL) on most supported tasks across NautData and public underwater datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the VFE module.

Conclusion: NAUTILUS achieves superior performance in underwater scene understanding by addressing dataset scarcity and image degradation challenges through the proposed VFE module and comprehensive dataset.

Abstract: Underwater exploration offers critical insights into our planet and attracts
increasing attention for its broader applications in resource exploration,
national security, etc. We study the underwater scene understanding methods,
which aim to achieve automated underwater exploration. The underwater scene
understanding task demands multi-task perceptions from multiple granularities.
However, the absence of large-scale underwater multi-task instruction-tuning
datasets hinders the progress of this research. To bridge this gap, we
construct NautData, a dataset containing 1.45 M image-text pairs supporting
eight underwater scene understanding tasks. It enables the development and
thorough evaluation of the underwater scene understanding models. Underwater
image degradation is a widely recognized challenge that interferes with
underwater tasks. To improve the robustness of underwater scene understanding,
we introduce physical priors derived from underwater imaging models and propose
a plug-and-play vision feature enhancement (VFE) module, which explicitly
restores clear underwater information. We integrate this module into renowned
baselines LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen2.5-VL and build our underwater LMM, NAUTILUS.
Experiments conducted on the NautData and public underwater datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of the VFE module, consistently improving the
performance of both baselines on the majority of supported tasks, thus ensuring
the superiority of NAUTILUS in the underwater scene understanding area. Data

TL;DR: ThinkMorph is a unified multimodal model that generates interleaved text-image reasoning chains where text and vision complement each other to advance reasoning, achieving significant performance gains and emergent multimodal intelligence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unclear nature of meaningful interleaved multimodal reasoning chains and explore how text and vision should function as complementary rather than isomorphic modalities.

Method: Fine-tuned a unified model on 24K high-quality interleaved reasoning traces spanning tasks with varying visual engagement, learning to generate progressive text-image reasoning steps that manipulate visual content while maintaining verbal logic.

Result: Delivered 34.7% average gains on vision-centric benchmarks, matched or surpassed larger proprietary VLMs on out-of-domain tasks, and exhibited emergent multimodal intelligence including visual manipulation skills and adaptive reasoning mode switching.

Conclusion: The findings suggest promising directions for characterizing emergent capabilities of unified multimodal reasoning models and demonstrate the value of complementary text-image reasoning chains.

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning requires iterative coordination between language and
vision, yet it remains unclear what constitutes a meaningful interleaved chain
of thought. We posit that text and image thoughts should function as
complementary, rather than isomorphic, modalities that mutually advance
reasoning. Guided by this principle, we build ThinkMorph, a unified model
fine-tuned on 24K high-quality interleaved reasoning traces spanning tasks with
varying visual engagement. ThinkMorph learns to generate progressive text-image
reasoning steps that concretely manipulate visual content while maintaining
coherent verbal logic. It delivers large gains on vision-centric benchmarks
(averaging 34.7% over the base model) and generalizes to out-of-domain tasks,
matching or surpassing larger and proprietary VLMs. Beyond performance,
ThinkMorph exhibits emergent multimodal intelligence, including unseen visual
manipulation skills, adaptive switching between reasoning modes, and better
test-time scaling through diversified multimodal thoughts.These findings
suggest promising directions for characterizing the emergent capabilities of
unified models for multimodal reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A robust deep neural watermarking framework for 3D point cloud copyright protection that embeds watermarks using SVD and extracts them using PointNet++ neural network, achieving superior performance against various attacks compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D point clouds are vulnerable to geometric and non-geometric attacks that degrade conventional watermarks, requiring robust copyright protection solutions for digital media.

Method: Embed binary watermarks into singular values of 3D point cloud blocks using SVD, and extract watermarks using PointNet++ neural network trained to withstand various attacks like rotation, scaling, noise, cropping, and signal distortions.

Result: Deep learning-based extraction significantly outperforms traditional SVD methods, achieving bitwise accuracy up to 0.83 and IoU of 0.80 vs SVD's 0.58 accuracy and 0.26 IoU for Crop (70%) attack - the most severe geometric distortion.

Conclusion: The proposed deep learning-based watermarking framework demonstrates superior watermark recovery and maintains high fidelity even under severe distortions, providing effective copyright protection for 3D point clouds.

Abstract: The protection of intellectual property has become critical due to the rapid
growth of three-dimensional content in digital media. Unlike traditional images
or videos, 3D point clouds present unique challenges for copyright enforcement,
as they are especially vulnerable to a range of geometric and non-geometric
attacks that can easily degrade or remove conventional watermark signals. In
this paper, we address these challenges by proposing a robust deep neural
watermarking framework for 3D point cloud copyright protection and ownership
verification. Our approach embeds binary watermarks into the singular values of
3D point cloud blocks using spectral decomposition, i.e. Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD), and leverages the extraction capabilities of Deep Learning
using PointNet++ neural network architecture. The network is trained to
reliably extract watermarks even after the data undergoes various attacks such
as rotation, scaling, noise, cropping and signal distortions. We validated our
method using the publicly available ModelNet40 dataset, demonstrating that deep
learning-based extraction significantly outperforms traditional SVD-based
techniques under challenging conditions. Our experimental evaluation
demonstrates that the deep learning-based extraction approach significantly
outperforms existing SVD-based methods with deep learning achieving bitwise
accuracy up to 0.83 and Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.80, compared to SVD
achieving a bitwise accuracy of 0.58 and IoU of 0.26 for the Crop (70%) attack,
which is the most severe geometric distortion in our experiment. This
demonstrates our method's ability to achieve superior watermark recovery and
maintain high fidelity even under severe distortions.

TL;DR: MapSAM2 is a unified framework for segmenting historical map images and time series by treating them as videos, enabling improved geometric accuracy and temporal association learning with limited supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated analysis of historical maps is challenging due to stylistic variability and scarce annotated data. Building linked spatio-temporal datasets from historical map time series is labor-intensive but essential for applications like dating buildings and analyzing environmental changes.

Method: Built on a visual foundation model, MapSAM2 treats historical map images and time series as videos. For images, it processes tiles as videos to leverage memory attention for contextual cues. For time series, it introduces the Siegfried Building Time Series Dataset and generates pseudo time series from single-year maps by simulating temporal transformations.

Result: Experimental results show MapSAM2 effectively learns temporal associations and accurately segments and links buildings in time series under limited supervision or using pseudo videos.

Conclusion: MapSAM2 provides an effective solution for historical map segmentation with limited data, and the authors will release both dataset and code to support future research.

Abstract: Historical maps are unique and valuable archives that document geographic
features across different time periods. However, automated analysis of
historical map images remains a significant challenge due to their wide
stylistic variability and the scarcity of annotated training data. Constructing
linked spatio-temporal datasets from historical map time series is even more
time-consuming and labor-intensive, as it requires synthesizing information
from multiple maps. Such datasets are essential for applications such as dating
buildings, analyzing the development of road networks and settlements, studying
environmental changes etc. We present MapSAM2, a unified framework for
automatically segmenting both historical map images and time series. Built on a
visual foundation model, MapSAM2 adapts to diverse segmentation tasks with
few-shot fine-tuning. Our key innovation is to treat both historical map images
and time series as videos. For images, we process a set of tiles as a video,
enabling the memory attention mechanism to incorporate contextual cues from
similar tiles, leading to improved geometric accuracy, particularly for areal
features. For time series, we introduce the annotated Siegfried Building Time
Series Dataset and, to reduce annotation costs, propose generating pseudo time
series from single-year maps by simulating common temporal transformations.
Experimental results show that MapSAM2 learns temporal associations effectively
and can accurately segment and link buildings in time series under limited
supervision or using pseudo videos. We will release both our dataset and code
to support future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a co-designed framework for universal video retrieval, including a comprehensive benchmark (UVRB), scalable data synthesis, and a novel training curriculum (Modality Pyramid) that achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video retrieval systems are misaligned due to narrow benchmarks that incentivize limited data and single-task training, suppressing universal capability. There's a need for diagnostic evaluation that demands multi-dimensional generalization.

Method: 1) Created Universal Video Retrieval Benchmark (UVRB) with 16 datasets to diagnose capability gaps; 2) Developed scalable synthesis workflow generating 1.55M high-quality pairs; 3) Designed Modality Pyramid curriculum to train General Video Embedder (GVE) by leveraging data interconnections.

Result: GVE achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization on UVRB. Analysis reveals popular benchmarks are poor predictors of general ability, and partially relevant retrieval is a dominant but overlooked scenario.

Conclusion: The co-designed framework provides a practical path to escape limited scope and advance toward truly universal video retrieval by addressing evaluation, data, and modeling simultaneously.

Abstract: The prevailing video retrieval paradigm is structurally misaligned, as narrow
benchmarks incentivize correspondingly limited data and single-task training.
Therefore, universal capability is suppressed due to the absence of a
diagnostic evaluation that defines and demands multi-dimensional
generalization. To break this cycle, we introduce a framework built on the
co-design of evaluation, data, and modeling. First, we establish the Universal
Video Retrieval Benchmark (UVRB), a suite of 16 datasets designed not only to
measure performance but also to diagnose critical capability gaps across tasks
and domains. Second, guided by UVRB's diagnostics, we introduce a scalable
synthesis workflow that generates 1.55 million high-quality pairs to populate
the semantic space required for universality. Finally, we devise the Modality
Pyramid, a curriculum that trains our General Video Embedder (GVE) by
explicitly leveraging the latent interconnections within our diverse data.
Extensive experiments show GVE achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot
generalization on UVRB. In particular, our analysis reveals that popular
benchmarks are poor predictors of general ability and that partially relevant
retrieval is a dominant but overlooked scenario. Overall, our co-designed
framework provides a practical path to escape the limited scope and advance
toward truly universal video retrieval.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CroVCA introduces a simple unified principle for learning binary codes that remain consistent across semantically aligned views, achieving state-of-the-art hashing performance with exceptional training efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models provide powerful embeddings but nearest neighbor search in high-dimensional spaces is computationally expensive. Hashing offers efficient search but existing approaches have complex pipelines, multi-term objectives, and long training times.

Method: Uses Cross-View Code Alignment (CroVCA) with single binary cross-entropy loss for alignment and coding-rate maximization as anti-collapse regularizer. Implements HashCoder - lightweight MLP with batch normalization for balanced codes, usable as probing head on frozen embeddings or via LoRA fine-tuning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results in just 5 training epochs. Unsupervised hashing on COCO completes in under 2 minutes, supervised hashing on ImageNet100 in about 3 minutes on single GPU. Particularly strong at 16 bits.

Conclusion: CroVCA demonstrates exceptional efficiency, adaptability, and broad applicability for large-scale retrieval with compact binary codes.

Abstract: Efficient large-scale retrieval requires representations that are both
compact and discriminative. Foundation models provide powerful visual and
multimodal embeddings, but nearest neighbor search in these high-dimensional
spaces is computationally expensive. Hashing offers an efficient alternative by
enabling fast Hamming distance search with binary codes, yet existing
approaches often rely on complex pipelines, multi-term objectives, designs
specialized for a single learning paradigm, and long training times. We
introduce CroVCA (Cross-View Code Alignment), a simple and unified principle
for learning binary codes that remain consistent across semantically aligned
views. A single binary cross-entropy loss enforces alignment, while coding-rate
maximization serves as an anti-collapse regularizer to promote balanced and
diverse codes. To implement this, we design HashCoder, a lightweight MLP
hashing network with a final batch normalization layer to enforce balanced
codes. HashCoder can be used as a probing head on frozen embeddings or to adapt
encoders efficiently via LoRA fine-tuning. Across benchmarks, CroVCA achieves
state-of-the-art results in just 5 training epochs. At 16 bits, it particularly
well-for instance, unsupervised hashing on COCO completes in under 2 minutes
and supervised hashing on ImageNet100 in about 3 minutes on a single GPU. These
results highlight CroVCA's efficiency, adaptability, and broad applicability.

### [68] [ANCHOR: Integrating Adversarial Training with Hard-mined Supervised Contrastive Learning for Robust Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27599)
*Samarup Bhattacharya,Anubhab Bhattacharya,Abir Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ANCHOR is a framework that uses supervised contrastive learning with hard positive mining to create robust neural networks resistant to adversarial attacks by clustering similar images and their perturbed versions in embedding space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that exploit gradients to cause wrong predictions with imperceptible input changes. Current methods need better robustness while maintaining accuracy.

Method: Uses supervised contrastive learning with explicit hard positive mining to cluster embeddings of images, their augmentations, and perturbed versions together while separating different classes.

Result: Achieves impressive results on CIFAR-10 for both clean and robust accuracy under PGD-20 attacks (epsilon=0.031), outperforming standard adversarial training methods.

Conclusion: Combining adversarial guidance with hard-mined contrastive supervision helps models learn more structured and robust representations, narrowing the gap between accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Neural networks have changed the way machines interpret the world. At their
core, they learn by following gradients, adjusting their parameters step by
step until they identify the most discriminant patterns in the data. This
process gives them their strength, yet it also opens the door to a hidden flaw.
The very gradients that help a model learn can also be used to produce small,
imperceptible tweaks that cause the model to completely alter its decision.
Such tweaks are called adversarial attacks. These attacks exploit this
vulnerability by adding tiny, imperceptible changes to images that, while
leaving them identical to the human eye, cause the model to make wrong
predictions. In this work, we propose Adversarially-trained Contrastive
Hard-mining for Optimized Robustness (ANCHOR), a framework that leverages the
power of supervised contrastive learning with explicit hard positive mining to
enable the model to learn representations for images such that the embeddings
for the images, their augmentations, and their perturbed versions cluster
together in the embedding space along with those for other images of the same
class while being separated from images of other classes. This alignment helps
the model focus on stable, meaningful patterns rather than fragile gradient
cues. On CIFAR-10, our approach achieves impressive results for both clean and
robust accuracy under PGD-20 (epsilon = 0.031), outperforming standard
adversarial training methods. Our results indicate that combining adversarial
guidance with hard-mined contrastive supervision helps models learn more
structured and robust representations, narrowing the gap between accuracy and
robustness.

Abstract: The rapid progress of generative diffusion models has enabled the creation of
synthetic images that are increasingly difficult to distinguish from real ones,
raising concerns about authenticity, copyright, and misinformation. Existing

TL;DR: Spatial-SSRL introduces self-supervised reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards for spatial understanding in LVLMs, using five pretext tasks derived from ordinary images without human annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for spatial understanding in LVLMs rely on costly supervision, specialized tools, or constrained environments that limit scalability.

Method: Automatically formulates five pretext tasks: shuffled patch reordering, flipped patch recognition, cropped patch inpainting, regional depth ordering, and relative 3D position prediction, using verifiable signals from RGB or RGB-D images.

Result: Achieves average accuracy gains of 4.63% (3B) and 3.89% (7B) over Qwen2.5-VL baselines on seven spatial understanding benchmarks in image and video settings.

Conclusion: Simple, intrinsic supervision enables RLVR at scale and provides a practical route to stronger spatial intelligence in LVLMs.

Abstract: Spatial understanding remains a weakness of Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs). Existing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and recent reinforcement
learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) pipelines depend on costly supervision,
specialized tools, or constrained environments that limit scale. We introduce
Spatial-SSRL, a self-supervised RL paradigm that derives verifiable signals
directly from ordinary RGB or RGB-D images. Spatial-SSRL automatically
formulates five pretext tasks that capture 2D and 3D spatial structure:
shuffled patch reordering, flipped patch recognition, cropped patch inpainting,
regional depth ordering, and relative 3D position prediction. These tasks
provide ground-truth answers that are easy to verify and require no human or
LVLM annotation. Training on our tasks substantially improves spatial reasoning
while preserving general visual capabilities. On seven spatial understanding
benchmarks in both image and video settings, Spatial-SSRL delivers average
accuracy gains of 4.63% (3B) and 3.89% (7B) over the Qwen2.5-VL baselines. Our
results show that simple, intrinsic supervision enables RLVR at scale and
provides a practical route to stronger spatial intelligence in LVLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenge of jointly predicting next-state observations and action sequences in Vision-Language-Action models due to inherent modality differences, and improve robotic policy learning through world modeling.

Method: Proposes a multimodal diffusion transformer with separate modality streams, independent noise perturbations for each modality, decoupled flow-matching loss, and joint sampling with test-time scaling where action and vision tokens evolve asynchronously.

Result: Achieves up to 6% gains over baselines on RoboCasa and GR-1 benchmarks, with additional 2-5% boost from test-time scaling. On real-world Franka Research 3 tasks, improves success rates by 13%. Pre-training on BridgeV2 videos yields significant transfer gains.

Conclusion: DUST effectively handles modality conflicts in VLAs, demonstrates strong performance across simulation and real-world tasks, and shows potential for large-scale VLA pretraining through its dual-stream architecture.

Abstract: Recently, augmenting Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) with world modeling
has shown promise in improving robotic policy learning. However, it remains
challenging to jointly predict next-state observations and action sequences
because of the inherent difference between the two modalities. To address this,
we propose DUal-STream diffusion (DUST), a world-model augmented VLA framework
that handles the modality conflict and enhances the performance of VLAs across
diverse tasks. Specifically, we propose a multimodal diffusion transformer
architecture that explicitly maintains separate modality streams while still
enabling cross-modal knowledge sharing. In addition, we introduce independent
noise perturbations for each modality and a decoupled flow-matching loss. This
design enables the model to learn the joint distribution in a bidirectional
manner while avoiding the need for a unified latent space. Based on the
decoupling of modalities during training, we also introduce a joint sampling
method that supports test-time scaling, where action and vision tokens evolve
asynchronously at different rates. Through experiments on simulated benchmarks
such as RoboCasa and GR-1, DUST achieves up to 6% gains over baseline methods,
while our test-time scaling approach provides an additional 2-5% boost. On
real-world tasks with the Franka Research 3, DUST improves success rates by
13%, confirming its effectiveness beyond simulation. Furthermore, pre-training
on action-free videos from BridgeV2 yields significant transfer gains on
RoboCasa, underscoring DUST's potential for large-scale VLA pretraining.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a sketch-to-layout approach that uses user sketches as intuitive constraints for graphic layout generation, outperforming existing constraint-based methods while improving usability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current layout generation methods require complex constraint specifications that reduce usability. The authors aim to provide a more intuitive approach using sketches as constraints.

Method: Proposed a multimodal transformer-based solution that takes sketches and content assets as inputs. Introduced a novel method to synthetically generate training sketches at scale to avoid costly human annotation.

Result: The model outperforms state-of-the-art constraint-based methods on three datasets (PubLayNet, DocLayNet, SlidesVQA) while offering more intuitive design experience. Released O(200k) synthetic sketches for future research.

Conclusion: Sketch-to-layout is a promising research direction that provides intuitive constraints for layout generation, with the proposed method demonstrating effectiveness and releasing synthetic datasets to facilitate future work.

Abstract: Graphic layout generation is a growing research area focusing on generating
aesthetically pleasing layouts ranging from poster designs to documents. While
recent research has explored ways to incorporate user constraints to guide the
layout generation, these constraints often require complex specifications which
reduce usability. We introduce an innovative approach exploiting user-provided
sketches as intuitive constraints and we demonstrate empirically the
effectiveness of this new guidance method, establishing the sketch-to-layout
problem as a promising research direction, which is currently under-explored.
To tackle the sketch-to-layout problem, we propose a multimodal
transformer-based solution using the sketch and the content assets as inputs to
produce high quality layouts. Since collecting sketch training data from human
annotators to train our model is very costly, we introduce a novel and
efficient method to synthetically generate training sketches at scale. We train
and evaluate our model on three publicly available datasets: PubLayNet,
DocLayNet and SlidesVQA, demonstrating that it outperforms state-of-the-art
constraint-based methods, while offering a more intuitive design experience. In
order to facilitate future sketch-to-layout research, we release O(200k)
synthetically-generated sketches for the public datasets above. The datasets

TL;DR: VessShape generates synthetic 2D datasets with tubular geometries to instill shape bias in segmentation models, improving few-shot and zero-shot performance on real-world blood vessel datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address data scarcity in medical image analysis and poor model generalization across imaging modalities by leveraging geometric priors of vessel shapes rather than texture-based features.

Method: Introduce VessShape methodology for generating large-scale 2D synthetic datasets with procedurally generated tubular geometries combined with various foreground/background textures to encourage shape-based learning.

Result: Model pre-trained on VessShape achieves strong few-shot segmentation performance (4-10 samples for fine-tuning) on real-world datasets and exhibits notable zero-shot capabilities in unseen domains.

Conclusion: Pre-training with strong shape bias is an effective strategy to overcome data scarcity and improve model generalization in blood vessel segmentation.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of blood vessels is an important task in medical image
analysis, but its progress is often hindered by the scarcity of large annotated
datasets and the poor generalization of models across different imaging
modalities. A key aspect is the tendency of Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) to learn texture-based features, which limits their performance when
applied to new domains with different visual characteristics. We hypothesize
that leveraging geometric priors of vessel shapes, such as their tubular and
branching nature, can lead to more robust and data-efficient models. To
investigate this, we introduce VessShape, a methodology for generating
large-scale 2D synthetic datasets designed to instill a shape bias in
segmentation models. VessShape images contain procedurally generated tubular
geometries combined with a wide variety of foreground and background textures,
encouraging models to learn shape cues rather than textures. We demonstrate
that a model pre-trained on VessShape images achieves strong few-shot
segmentation performance on two real-world datasets from different domains,
requiring only four to ten samples for fine-tuning. Furthermore, the model
exhibits notable zero-shot capabilities, effectively segmenting vessels in
unseen domains without any target-specific training. Our results indicate that
pre-training with a strong shape bias can be an effective strategy to overcome
data scarcity and improve model generalization in blood vessel segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NegoCollab proposes a negotiated common representation approach for heterogeneous collaborative perception, using a negotiator to derive common representations from local agent representations and employing sender-receiver pairs with multiple alignment losses to reduce domain gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address immutable heterogeneity in collaborative perception where agents use different fixed perception models, creating domain gaps in shared features that degrade performance. Existing methods using specific agent representations as common representations struggle with agents having significant domain discrepancies.

Method: Introduces a negotiator during training to derive common representation from local representations. Uses sender-receiver pairs for mutual feature transformation between local and common spaces. Employs structural, pragmatic, and distribution alignment losses to supervise training and distill knowledge into the sender.

Result: Effectively reduces inherent domain gaps with various local representations, enabling better alignment of heterogeneous agents in collaborative perception systems.

Conclusion: NegoCollab provides an effective solution for heterogeneous collaboration by negotiating common representations and employing comprehensive alignment strategies, overcoming limitations of existing methods that use specific agent representations as common references.

Abstract: Collaborative perception improves task performance by expanding the
perception range through information sharing among agents. . Immutable
heterogeneity poses a significant challenge in collaborative perception, as
participating agents may employ different and fixed perception models. This
leads to domain gaps in the intermediate features shared among agents,
consequently degrading collaborative performance. Aligning the features of all
agents to a common representation can eliminate domain gaps with low training
cost. However, in existing methods, the common representation is designated as
the representation of a specific agent, making it difficult for agents with
significant domain discrepancies from this specific agent to achieve proper
alignment. This paper proposes NegoCollab, a heterogeneous collaboration method
based on the negotiated common representation. It introduces a negotiator
during training to derive the common representation from the local
representations of each modality's agent, effectively reducing the inherent
domain gap with the various local representations. In NegoCollab, the mutual
transformation of features between the local representation space and the
common representation space is achieved by a pair of sender and receiver. To
better align local representations to the common representation containing
multimodal information, we introduce structural alignment loss and pragmatic
alignment loss in addition to the distribution alignment loss to supervise the
training. This enables the knowledge in the common representation to be fully
distilled into the sender.

TL;DR: GCD is a new similarity metric for object detection that addresses limitations of IoU and Wasserstein Distance, particularly for small objects, by providing scale invariance and joint optimization capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current IoU-based metrics perform poorly on small objects due to sensitivity to minor positional deviations, while Wasserstein Distance lacks scale invariance and has slow convergence when used as a loss function.

Method: Proposed Gaussian Combined Distance (GCD) as an alternative similarity metric that provides scale invariance and facilitates joint optimization through analytical examination of its gradient properties.

Result: GCD achieves state-of-the-art performance on AI-TOD-v2 for tiny object detection, and shows superior generalizability on MS-COCO-2017 and Visdrone-2019 datasets compared to Wasserstein Distance.

Conclusion: GCD effectively addresses the limitations of existing similarity metrics, providing better performance for small object detection and improved generalization across different dataset scales.

Abstract: In object detection, a well-defined similarity metric can significantly
enhance model performance. Currently, the IoU-based similarity metric is the
most commonly preferred choice for detectors. However, detectors using IoU as a
similarity metric often perform poorly when detecting small objects because of
their sensitivity to minor positional deviations. To address this issue, recent
studies have proposed the Wasserstein Distance as an alternative to IoU for
measuring the similarity of Gaussian-distributed bounding boxes. However, we
have observed that the Wasserstein Distance lacks scale invariance, which
negatively impacts the model's generalization capability. Additionally, when
used as a loss function, its independent optimization of the center attributes
leads to slow model convergence and unsatisfactory detection precision. To
address these challenges, we introduce the Gaussian Combined Distance (GCD).
Through analytical examination of GCD and its gradient, we demonstrate that GCD
not only possesses scale invariance but also facilitates joint optimization,
which enhances model localization performance. Extensive experiments on the
AI-TOD-v2 dataset for tiny object detection show that GCD, as a bounding box
regression loss function and label assignment metric, achieves state-of-the-art
performance across various detectors. We further validated the generalizability
of GCD on the MS-COCO-2017 and Visdrone-2019 datasets, where it outperforms the
Wasserstein Distance across diverse scales of datasets. Code is available at

Method: Unsupervised deep learning denoising integrated into microscopy workflows, validated with simulated data using PDE-constrained optimization, and applied to STXM, optical microscopy, and neutron radiography.

Result: Denoising revealed nanoscale heterogeneity in STXM of LFP, enabled automated particle segmentation in optical microscopy, and reduced noise-induced variability by nearly 80% in neutron radiography for resolving lithium transport.

Conclusion: Deep denoising is a powerful, modality-agnostic enhancement that advances quantitative operando imaging and extends the capabilities of previously noise-limited microscopy techniques.

Abstract: Operando microscopy provides direct insight into the dynamic chemical and
physical processes that govern functional materials, yet measurement noise
limits the effective resolution and undermines quantitative analysis. Here, we
present a general framework for integrating unsupervised deep learning-based
denoising into quantitative microscopy workflows across modalities and length
scales. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that deep denoising preserves
physical fidelity, introduces minimal bias, and reduces uncertainty in model
learning with partial differential equation (PDE)-constrained optimization.
Applied to experiments, denoising reveals nanoscale chemical and structural
heterogeneity in scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) of lithium iron
phosphate (LFP), enables automated particle segmentation and phase
classification in optical microscopy of graphite electrodes, and reduces
noise-induced variability by nearly 80% in neutron radiography to resolve
heterogeneous lithium transport. Collectively, these results establish deep
denoising as a powerful, modality-agnostic enhancement that advances
quantitative operando imaging and extends the reach of previously noise-limited
techniques.

Conclusion: The work advances 3D medical vision-language understanding by enabling spatially grounded report generation for PET/CT imaging.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled impressive

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Phased DMD is a multi-step distillation framework that combines phase-wise distillation with Mixture-of-Experts to improve generation quality while maintaining diversity, addressing limitations of one-step DMD and traditional multi-step approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: One-step DMD models underperform on complex tasks due to limited capacity, while direct multi-step extension causes memory issues and instability. Stochastic gradient truncation reduces diversity, making multi-step models no better than one-step ones.

Method: Divides SNR range into subintervals for progressive distribution matching and uses score matching within each subinterval. Combines phase-wise distillation with Mixture-of-Experts to reduce learning difficulty while enhancing model capacity.

Result: Successfully distilled state-of-the-art image and video models (Qwen-Image 20B, Wan2.2 28B). Preserves output diversity better than DMD while retaining key generative capabilities.

Conclusion: Phased DMD effectively bridges the gap between one-step and multi-step distillation, providing better generation quality without sacrificing diversity or efficiency.

Abstract: Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) distills score-based generative
models into efficient one-step generators, without requiring a one-to-one
correspondence with the sampling trajectories of their teachers. However,
limited model capacity causes one-step distilled models underperform on complex
generative tasks, e.g., synthesizing intricate object motions in text-to-video
generation. Directly extending DMD to multi-step distillation increases memory
usage and computational depth, leading to instability and reduced efficiency.
While prior works propose stochastic gradient truncation as a potential
solution, we observe that it substantially reduces the generation diversity of
multi-step distilled models, bringing it down to the level of their one-step
counterparts. To address these limitations, we propose Phased DMD, a multi-step
distillation framework that bridges the idea of phase-wise distillation with
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), reducing learning difficulty while enhancing model
capacity. Phased DMD is built upon two key ideas: progressive distribution
matching and score matching within subintervals. First, our model divides the
SNR range into subintervals, progressively refining the model to higher SNR
levels, to better capture complex distributions. Next, to ensure the training
objective within each subinterval is accurate, we have conducted rigorous
mathematical derivations. We validate Phased DMD by distilling state-of-the-art
image and video generation models, including Qwen-Image (20B parameters) and
Wan2.2 (28B parameters). Experimental results demonstrate that Phased DMD
preserves output diversity better than DMD while retaining key generative
capabilities. We will release our code and models.

lifting and inverse lifting units to adaptively capture radar signal features
and synthesize physiologically meaningful ECG waveforms. To improve
reconstruction fidelity, we introduce a multi-resolution short-time Fourier
transform (STFT) loss, that enforces consistency with the ground-truth ECG in
both temporal and spectral domains. Evaluations on two public datasets
demonstrate that LifWavNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in ECG
reconstruction and downstream vital sign estimation (heart rate and heart rate
variability). Furthermore, intermediate feature visualization highlights the
interpretability of multi-resolution decomposition and synthesis in
radar-to-ECG reconstruction. These results establish LifWavNet as a robust
framework for radar-based non-contact ECG measurement.
