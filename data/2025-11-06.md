*Ivan Zvonkov,Gabriel Tseng,Inbal Becker-Reshef,Hannah Kerner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Geospatial embeddings from Presto and AlphaEarth enable efficient, high-accuracy cropland mapping in Togo, simplifying workflows for land use change assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate land cover maps are essential for understanding land use change as a climate change driver, but current methods using geospatial embeddings remain underexplored in real-world applications.

Method: Used geospatial embeddings from Presto and AlphaEarth to produce cropland maps for Togo, evaluating their utility for classification tasks.

Result: Geospatial embeddings achieved high-accuracy cropland classification and simplified mapping workflows.

Conclusion: Geospatial embeddings can effectively support better assessments of land use change and its climate impacts through efficient cropland mapping.

Abstract: Accurate and up-to-date land cover maps are essential for understanding land
use change, a key driver of climate change. Geospatial embeddings offer a more
efficient and accessible way to map landscape features, yet their use in
real-world mapping applications remains underexplored. In this work, we
evaluated the utility of geospatial embeddings for cropland mapping in Togo. We
produced cropland maps using embeddings from Presto and AlphaEarth. Our
findings show that geospatial embeddings can simplify workflows, achieve
high-accuracy cropland classification and ultimately support better assessments
of land use change and its climate impacts.

### [2] [Generative Hints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02933)
*Andy Dimnaku,Abdullah Yusuf Kavranoğlu,Yaser Abu-Mostafa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Generative hints is a training method that enforces known invariances in the entire input space using generative models to create virtual examples, outperforming standard data augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data augmentation alone doesn't fully capture invariant properties since it only learns from transformations of training data, not the entire input space.

Method: Leverage generative models trained on training data to create unlabeled virtual examples, then train models semi-supervised using both classification and hint objectives on these examples.

Result: Consistently outperforms standard data augmentation across datasets, architectures and loss functions. Achieved up to 1.78% top-1 accuracy improvement on fine-grained classification and 1.286% average boost on CheXpert X-ray dataset.

Conclusion: Generative hints effectively enforce known invariances throughout the input space, providing better performance than data augmentation alone for learning invariant properties.

Abstract: Data augmentation is widely used in vision to introduce variation and
mitigate overfitting, through enabling models to learn invariant properties,
such as spatial invariance. However, these properties are not fully captured by
data augmentation alone, since it attempts to learn the property on
transformations of the training data only. We propose generative hints, a
training methodology that directly enforces known invariances in the entire
input space. Our approach leverages a generative model trained on the training
set to approximate the input distribution and generate unlabeled images, which
we refer to as virtual examples. These virtual examples are used to enforce
functional properties known as hints. In generative hints, although the
training dataset is fully labeled, the model is trained in a semi-supervised
manner on both the classification and hint objectives, using the unlabeled
virtual examples to guide the model in learning the desired hint. Across
datasets, architectures, and loss functions, generative hints consistently
outperform standard data augmentation when learning the same property. On
popular fine-grained visual classification benchmarks, we achieved up to 1.78%
top-1 accuracy improvement (0.63% on average) over fine-tuned models with data
augmentation and an average performance boost of 1.286% on the CheXpert X-ray
dataset.

### [3] [ProM3E: Probabilistic Masked MultiModal Embedding Model for Ecology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02946)
*Srikumar Sastry,Subash Khanal,Aayush Dhakal,Jiayu Lin,Dan Cher,Phoenix Jarosz,Nathan Jacobs*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProM3E is a probabilistic masked multimodal embedding model for ecology that learns to infer missing modalities through masked reconstruction, supports modality inversion, and enables cross-modal retrieval with mixed similarity metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a flexible multimodal representation model for ecology that can handle any-to-any generation of multimodal representations and analyze the feasibility of fusing different modalities for downstream tasks.

Method: Based on masked modality reconstruction in embedding space, learning to infer missing modalities given context modalities. Uses probabilistic modeling to analyze modality fusion feasibility and proposes cross-modal retrieval with mixed inter-modal and intra-modal similarities.

Result: Achieves superior performance across all retrieval tasks and demonstrates superior representation learning capability through linear probing tasks using hidden representations.

Conclusion: ProM3E provides an effective probabilistic framework for multimodal representation learning in ecology with capabilities for modality inversion, cross-modal retrieval, and representation analysis, with all code and models being publicly released.

Abstract: We introduce ProM3E, a probabilistic masked multimodal embedding model for
any-to-any generation of multimodal representations for ecology. ProM3E is
based on masked modality reconstruction in the embedding space, learning to
infer missing modalities given a few context modalities. By design, our model
supports modality inversion in the embedding space. The probabilistic nature of
our model allows us to analyse the feasibility of fusing various modalities for
given downstream tasks, essentially learning what to fuse. Using these features
of our model, we propose a novel cross-modal retrieval approach that mixes
inter-modal and intra-modal similarities to achieve superior performance across
all retrieval tasks. We further leverage the hidden representation from our
model to perform linear probing tasks and demonstrate the superior
representation learning capability of our model. All our code, datasets and
model will be released at https://vishu26.github.io/prom3e.

### [4] [EvtSlowTV -- A Large and Diverse Dataset for Event-Based Depth Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02953)
*Sadiq Layi Macaulay,Nimet Kaygusuz,Simon Hadfield*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EvtSlowTV is a large-scale event camera dataset from YouTube footage with 13B+ events, enabling self-supervised depth estimation without frame-based annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing event-based depth estimation methods are limited by small annotated datasets, restricting real-world generalization.

Method: Curated large-scale dataset from YouTube footage across various environments, used for self-supervised learning framework that leverages HDR potential of raw event streams.

Result: EvtSlowTV is an order of magnitude larger than existing datasets, and training with it enhances model generalization to complex scenes and motions.

Conclusion: The approach enables robust event-based depth estimation in challenging environments without frame-based annotations while preserving event data's asynchronous nature.

Abstract: Event cameras, with their high dynamic range (HDR) and low latency, offer a
promising alternative for robust depth estimation in challenging environments.
However, many event-based depth estimation approaches are constrained by
small-scale annotated datasets, limiting their generalizability to real-world
scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce EvtSlowTV, a large-scale event
camera dataset curated from publicly available YouTube footage, which contains
more than 13B events across various environmental conditions and motions,
including seasonal hiking, flying, scenic driving, and underwater exploration.
EvtSlowTV is an order of magnitude larger than existing event datasets,
providing an unconstrained, naturalistic setting for event-based depth
learning. This work shows the suitability of EvtSlowTV for a self-supervised
learning framework to capitalise on the HDR potential of raw event streams. We
further demonstrate that training with EvtSlowTV enhances the model's ability
to generalise to complex scenes and motions. Our approach removes the need for
frame-based annotations and preserves the asynchronous nature of event data.

### [5] [Hybrid Convolution and Vision Transformer NAS Search Space for TinyML Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02992)
*Mikhael Djajapermana,Moritz Reiber,Daniel Mueller-Gritschneder,Ulf Schlichtmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid CNN-ViT neural architecture search space for efficient tinyML image classification models that outperforms ResNet-based approaches under tight size constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hybrid CNN-ViT architectures are too large and computationally expensive for tinyML deployment, creating a need for efficient hybrid models that can learn both local and global information while maintaining small model size.

Method: Created a new hybrid CNN-ViT search space for Neural Architecture Search (NAS) that includes hybrid CNN-ViT blocks for local/global learning and novel searchable pooling layers for efficient feature map reduction.

Result: On CIFAR10 dataset, the search space produced hybrid CNN-ViT architectures with superior accuracy and inference speed compared to ResNet-based tinyML models while maintaining tight model size constraints.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid CNN-ViT NAS search space successfully enables discovery of efficient architectures suitable for tinyML deployment, demonstrating better performance than traditional ResNet approaches.

Abstract: Hybrids of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT)
have outperformed pure CNN or ViT architecture. However, since these
architectures require large parameters and incur large computational costs,
they are unsuitable for tinyML deployment. This paper introduces a new hybrid
CNN-ViT search space for Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to find efficient
hybrid architectures for image classification. The search space covers hybrid
CNN and ViT blocks to learn local and global information, as well as the novel
Pooling block of searchable pooling layers for efficient feature map reduction.
Experimental results on the CIFAR10 dataset show that our proposed search space
can produce hybrid CNN-ViT architectures with superior accuracy and inference
speed to ResNet-based tinyML models under tight model size constraints.

### [6] [SCALE-VLP: Soft-Weighted Contrastive Volumetric Vision-Language Pre-training with Spatial-Knowledge Semantics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02996)
*Ailar Mahdizadeh,Puria Azadi Moghadam,Xiangteng He,Shahriar Mirabbasi,Panos Nasiopoulos,Leonid Sigal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCALE-VLP is a soft-weighted contrastive vision-language pre-training framework for volumetric medical imaging that integrates volumetric spatial semantics and domain-aware knowledge to improve cross-modal alignment and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models are limited to 2D data and binary supervision, overlooking continuous dependencies in volumetric data like CT scans and underutilizing clinical semantics.

Method: Proposes SCALE-VLP framework with (i) volumetric spatial semantics to preserve anatomical structure and (ii) domain-aware, knowledge-infused semantics using radiological ontologies for guided alignment.

Result: Achieves up to 4.3x higher top-1 CT-report retrieval, 10-point improvement in abnormality classification, and ROUGE-L 0.44 / BERT-F1 0.89 for report generation. Shows consistent gains in zero-shot evaluation on external datasets.

Conclusion: SCALE-VLP demonstrates strong cross-task transferability and cross-domain generalizability without fine-tuning, indicating robust generalization capabilities for medical vision-language tasks.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong cross-modal
capabilities, yet most work remains limited to 2D data and assumes binary
supervision (i.e., positive vs. negative pairs), overlooking the continuous and
structured dependencies present in volumetric data such as CT. Existing
approaches often treat volumetric scans as independent 2D slices, compromising
spatial coherence and underutilizing rich clinical semantics. We propose
SCALE-VLP, a soft-weighted contrastive vision-language pre-training framework
that integrates (i) volumetric spatial semantics to preserve anatomical
structure and (ii) domain-aware, knowledge-infused semantics (e.g.,
radiological ontologies) to guide alignment. This yields structurally
consistent and semantically grounded representations under limited supervision,
demonstrating strong cross-task transferability (retrieval, report generation,
and classification), and cross-domain generalizability with consistent gains
without further fine-tuning. In particular, compared to the previous state of
the art, SCALE-VLP achieves up to 4.3x higher top-1 CT-report retrieval,
improves abnormality classification by 10 points, and reaches ROUGE-L 0.44 and
BERT-F1 0.89 for report generation. Further, in zero-shot evaluation on an
out-of-domain external dataset, we observe consistent gains, indicating the
cross-task and cross-domain generalization ability of SCALE-VLP.

### [7] [Learning with less: label-efficient land cover classification at very high spatial resolution using self-supervised deep learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03004)
*Dakota Hester,Vitor S. Martins,Lucas B. Ferreira,Thainara M. A. Lima*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A label-efficient approach using self-supervised learning achieves 87.14% accuracy for statewide 1-m land cover classification with only 1,000 annotated patches, significantly reducing manual annotation requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenge of collecting large volumes of training data for deep learning semantic segmentation in large-scale land cover mapping, which creates a barrier to widespread adoption.

Method: Used BYOL self-supervised pre-training with 377,921 unlabeled aerial images on ResNet-101, then transferred to multiple segmentation architectures (FCN, U-Net, etc.) and fine-tuned with small datasets (250-750 patches).

Result: Achieved 87.14% overall accuracy and 75.58% macro F1 score for 8-class land cover mapping over Mississippi using an ensemble of U-Net models, covering 123+ billion pixels.

Conclusion: Self-supervised learning effectively reduces the need for large manually annotated datasets, addressing a major limitation in high-resolution land cover mapping at scale.

Abstract: Deep learning semantic segmentation methods have shown promising performance
for very high 1-m resolution land cover classification, but the challenge of
collecting large volumes of representative training data creates a significant
barrier to widespread adoption of such models for meter-scale land cover
mapping over large areas. In this study, we present a novel label-efficient
approach for statewide 1-m land cover classification using only 1,000 annotated
reference image patches with self-supervised deep learning. We use the
"Bootstrap Your Own Latent" pre-training strategy with a large amount of
unlabeled color-infrared aerial images (377,921 256x256 1-m pixel patches) to
pre-train a ResNet-101 convolutional encoder. The learned encoder weights were
subsequently transferred into multiple deep semantic segmentation architectures
(FCN, U-Net, Attention U-Net, DeepLabV3+, UPerNet, PAN), which were then
fine-tuned using very small training dataset sizes with cross-validation (250,
500, 750 patches). Among the fine-tuned models, we obtained the 87.14% overall
accuracy and 75.58% macro F1 score using an ensemble of the best performing
U-Net models for comprehensive 1-m, 8-class land cover mapping, covering more
than 123 billion pixels over the state of Mississippi, USA. Detailed
qualitative and quantitative analysis revealed accurate mapping of open water
and forested areas, while highlighting challenges in accurate delineation
between cropland, herbaceous, and barren land cover types. These results show
that self-supervised learning is an effective strategy for reducing the need
for large volumes of manually annotated data, directly addressing a major
limitation to high spatial resolution land cover mapping at scale.

### [8] [A Foundation Model for Brain MRI with Dynamic Modality Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03014)
*Minh Sao Khue Luu,Bair N. Tuchinov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A foundation model for brain MRI that handles different imaging sequence combinations using a single encoder with modality embeddings and masked autoencoding, trained on 60,000 multi-center MRIs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified model that eliminates the need for separate models for each MRI modality and can adapt when some imaging sequences are missing or unseen.

Method: Uses one encoder with learnable modality embeddings, conditional layer normalization, and masked autoencoding objective with variance-covariance regularizer for stable feature learning.

Result: Preliminary results show the method works feasibly across various modality settings for brain tumor and multiple sclerosis segmentation, and lesion classification.

Conclusion: The model provides flexible representations for brain MRI analysis that can handle missing modalities, with code and pretrained models publicly available.

Abstract: We present a foundation model for brain MRI that can work with different
combinations of imaging sequences. The model uses one encoder with learnable
modality embeddings, conditional layer normalization, and a masked autoencoding
objective that accounts for missing modalities. A variance-covariance
regularizer is applied to stabilize feature learning and improve representation
diversity. This design removes the need for separate models for each modality
and allows the network to adapt when some sequences are missing or unseen. It
is trained on about 60,000 multi-center MRIs using self-supervised
reconstruction and modality imputation to learn flexible representations. A
learnable modality embedding guides feature extraction so the encoder can
adjust to different inputs. We describe our planned evaluation on brain tumor
and multiple sclerosis segmentation, as well as lesion classification, under
various modality settings. Preliminary results show that the method works
feasibly, and further experiments are planned to study its performance in more
detail. All code and pretrained models are available at

### [9] [SLIP: Structural-aware Language-Image Pretraining for Vision-Language Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03019)
*Wenbo Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SLIP introduces structural contrastive loss to model relationships between entities in graphs during vision-language pretraining, outperforming CLIP on retrieval and classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLP methods treat image-text pairs as isolated examples, ignoring rich relational structures in domains like e-commerce and social networks, while human cognition encodes knowledge as relationship maps.

Method: Integrates structural contrastive loss to align modalities while modeling relationships between neighboring entities in structured graphs, using a large-scale Amazon Product Co-purchase Multimodal Graph Dataset.

Result: SLIP consistently outperforms CLIP on cross-modal retrieval and classification tasks in both zero-shot and few-shot settings.

Conclusion: Relational supervision provides significant value for cross-modal alignment, demonstrating the importance of modeling structural relationships in vision-language pretraining.

Abstract: Vision-Language Pretraining (VLP) has achieved remarkable success across
various downstream tasks, but such gains are largely driven by scaling up on
training data. Yet, literature methods treat image-text pairs as isolated
training examples; this neglects the rich relational structure naturally
present in many domains, such as e-commerce product co-purchase graphs and
social recommendation networks. Inspired by neuroscientific evidence that human
encodes knowledge as relationship cognitive maps, we introduce Structure-aware
Language-Image Pretraining (SLIP). SLIP integrates a structural contrastive
loss to align modalities while also modeling relationships between neighboring
entities in a structured graph. To support this paradigm, we construct a
large-scale Amazon Product Co-purchase Multimodal Graph Dataset, enabling
structured cross-modality supervision at scale. Experiment results show that
SLIP consistently outperforms CLIP on cross-modal retrieval and classification
tasks in both zero-shot and few-shot settings, showing the value of relational
supervision for cross-modal alignment.

### [10] [From Propagation to Prediction: Point-level Uncertainty Evaluation of MLS Point Clouds under Limited Ground Truth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03053)
*Ziyang Xu,Olaf Wysocki,Christoph Holst*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A learning-based framework for Mobile Laser Scanning point clouds that uses geometric features to predict point-level uncertainty without ground truth, achieving comparable accuracy to Random Forest with 3x faster efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ground truth for uncertainty evaluation in MLS point clouds is costly and often infeasible in real-world applications, creating a need for GT-free evaluation methods.

Method: Learning-based framework integrating optimal neighborhood estimation with geometric feature extraction, using XGBoost model to predict uncertainty quantified by C2C distance.

Result: Framework is feasible and XGBoost delivers comparable accuracy to Random Forest with 3x faster efficiency, showing geometric features can predict point-level uncertainty.

Conclusion: MLS point clouds' uncertainty is learnable, offering a novel learning-based approach to uncertainty evaluation research without ground truth dependency.

Abstract: Evaluating uncertainty is critical for reliable use of Mobile Laser Scanning
(MLS) point clouds in many high-precision applications such as Scan-to-BIM,
deformation analysis, and 3D modeling. However, obtaining the ground truth (GT)
for evaluation is often costly and infeasible in many real-world applications.
To reduce this long-standing reliance on GT in uncertainty evaluation research,
this study presents a learning-based framework for MLS point clouds that
integrates optimal neighborhood estimation with geometric feature extraction.
Experiments on a real-world dataset show that the proposed framework is
feasible and the XGBoost model delivers fully comparable accuracy to Random
Forest while achieving substantially higher efficiency (about 3 times faster),
providing initial evidence that geometric features can be used to predict
point-level uncertainty quantified by the C2C distance. In summary, this study
shows that MLS point clouds' uncertainty is learnable, offering a novel
learning-based viewpoint towards uncertainty evaluation research.

### [11] [A Plug-and-Play Framework for Volumetric Light-Sheet Image Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03093)
*Yi Gong,Xinyuan Zhang,Jichen Chai,Yichen Ding,Yifei Lou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A computational imaging framework combining Compressive Sensing with Light-Sheet Microscopy for high-speed, low-phototoxic cardiac imaging using random binary mask coding and Plug-and-Play reconstruction with temporal regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional optical imaging struggles with the trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution needed to capture dynamic cellular structure in beating hearts on millisecond timescales.

Method: Uses compressed acquisition via DMD random binary masks, with Plug-and-Play ADMM framework incorporating Tikhonov, TV, and BM3D denoisers, plus temporal regularization for structural continuity between z-slices.

Result: Successfully reconstructs zebrafish heart cellular structures under high compression ratios with excellent denoising performance and image clarity.

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective and robust for real-world high-speed, low-light biological imaging scenarios, overcoming traditional imaging limitations.

Abstract: Cardiac contraction is a rapid, coordinated process that unfolds across
three-dimensional tissue on millisecond timescales. Traditional optical imaging
is often inadequate for capturing dynamic cellular structure in the beating
heart because of a fundamental trade-off between spatial and temporal
resolution. To overcome these limitations, we propose a high-performance
computational imaging framework that integrates Compressive Sensing (CS) with
Light-Sheet Microscopy (LSM) for efficient, low-phototoxic cardiac imaging. The
system performs compressed acquisition of fluorescence signals via random
binary mask coding using a Digital Micromirror Device (DMD). We propose a
Plug-and-Play (PnP) framework, solved using the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM), which flexibly incorporates advanced denoisers, including
Tikhonov, Total Variation (TV), and BM3D. To preserve structural continuity in
dynamic imaging, we further introduce temporal regularization enforcing
smoothness between adjacent z-slices. Experimental results on zebrafish heart
imaging under high compression ratios demonstrate that the proposed method
successfully reconstructs cellular structures with excellent denoising
performance and image clarity, validating the effectiveness and robustness of
our algorithm in real-world high-speed, low-light biological imaging scenarios.

### [12] [ISC-Perception: A Hybrid Computer Vision Dataset for Object Detection in Novel Steel Assembly](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03098)
*Miftahur Rahman,Samuel Adebayo,Dorian A. Acevedo-Mejia,David Hester,Daniel McPolin,Karen Rafferty,Debra F. Laefer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ISC-Perception is a hybrid dataset combining synthetic CAD images, photorealistic game-engine scenes, and real photos for detecting Intermeshed Steel Connection components, reducing human labeling time by 81.7% while achieving high detection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for dependable perception in construction robotics for steel-frame assembly is hampered by the difficulty of collecting real images on active construction sites due to logistical, safety, and privacy concerns.

Method: Created a hybrid dataset blending procedurally rendered CAD images, game-engine photorealistic scenes, and curated real photographs, enabling fully automatic labeling of synthetic portions and significantly reducing human effort.

Result: Detectors trained on ISC-Perception achieved mean Average Precision of 0.756 at IoU 0.50, substantially outperforming models trained on synthetic-only or photorealistic-only data. On a 1,200-frame test, achieved mAP@0.50/mAP@[0.50:0.95] of 0.943/0.823.

Conclusion: ISC-Perception successfully bridges the data gap for construction-robotics perception, facilitating rapid development of custom object detectors while being freely available for research and industrial use.

Abstract: The Intermeshed Steel Connection (ISC) system, when paired with robotic
manipulators, can accelerate steel-frame assembly and improve worker safety by
eliminating manual assembly. Dependable perception is one of the initial stages
for ISC-aware robots. However, this is hampered by the absence of a dedicated
image corpus, as collecting photographs on active construction sites is
logistically difficult and raises safety and privacy concerns. In response, we
introduce ISC-Perception, the first hybrid dataset expressly designed for ISC
component detection. It blends procedurally rendered CAD images, game-engine
photorealistic scenes, and a limited, curated set of real photographs, enabling
fully automatic labelling of the synthetic portion. We explicitly account for
all human effort to produce the dataset, including simulation engine and scene
setup, asset preparation, post-processing scripts and quality checks; our total
human time to generate a 10,000-image dataset was 30.5,h versus 166.7,h for
manual labelling at 60,s per image (-81.7%). A manual pilot on a representative
image with five instances of ISC members took 60,s (maximum 80,s), anchoring
the manual baseline. Detectors trained on ISC-Perception achieved a mean
Average Precision at IoU 0.50 of 0.756, substantially surpassing models trained
on synthetic-only or photorealistic-only data. On a 1,200-frame bench test, we
report mAP@0.50/mAP@[0.50:0.95] of 0.943/0.823. By bridging the data gap for
construction-robotics perception, ISC-Perception facilitates rapid development
of custom object detectors and is freely available for research and industrial
use upon request.

### [13] [DentalSplat: Dental Occlusion Novel View Synthesis from Sparse Intra-Oral Photographs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03099)
*Yiyi Miao,Taoyu Wu,Tong Chen,Sihao Li,Ji Jiang,Youpeng Yang,Angelos Stefanidis,Limin Yu,Jionglong Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DentalSplat enables 3D reconstruction from sparse orthodontic images using 3D Gaussian Splatting with prior-guided initialization and geometric constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Orthodontic telemedicine needs 3D reconstruction from sparse dental images (typically 3 views) for clinical decision-making, but conventional 3DGS requires dense inputs and precise camera poses.

Method: Uses prior-guided stereo reconstruction for point cloud initialization, scale-adaptive pruning for efficiency, and incorporates optical flow constraints with gradient regularization for sparse views.

Result: Validated on 950 clinical cases and 195 video test cases, achieving superior novel view synthesis quality for dental occlusion visualization compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: DentalSplat effectively handles sparse orthodontic imagery and enables high-quality 3D reconstruction suitable for telemedicine applications.

Abstract: In orthodontic treatment, particularly within telemedicine contexts,
observing patients' dental occlusion from multiple viewpoints facilitates
timely clinical decision-making. Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) have shown strong potential in 3D reconstruction and novel view
synthesis. However, conventional 3DGS pipelines typically rely on densely
captured multi-view inputs and precisely initialized camera poses, limiting
their practicality. Orthodontic cases, in contrast, often comprise only three
sparse images, specifically, the anterior view and bilateral buccal views,
rendering the reconstruction task especially challenging. The extreme sparsity
of input views severely degrades reconstruction quality, while the absence of
camera pose information further complicates the process. To overcome these
limitations, we propose DentalSplat, an effective framework for 3D
reconstruction from sparse orthodontic imagery. Our method leverages a
prior-guided dense stereo reconstruction model to initialize the point cloud,
followed by a scale-adaptive pruning strategy to improve the training
efficiency and reconstruction quality of 3DGS. In scenarios with extremely
sparse viewpoints, we further incorporate optical flow as a geometric
constraint, coupled with gradient regularization, to enhance rendering
fidelity. We validate our approach on a large-scale dataset comprising 950
clinical cases and an additional video-based test set of 195 cases designed to
simulate real-world remote orthodontic imaging conditions. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method effectively handles sparse input scenarios and
achieves superior novel view synthesis quality for dental occlusion
visualization, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.

### [14] [Image-Intrinsic Priors for Integrated Circuit Defect Detection and Novel Class Discovery via Self-Supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03120)
*Botong. Zhao,Xubin. Wang,Shujing. Lyu,Yue. Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IC DefectNCD is a support set free framework for IC defect detection and novel class discovery that leverages image intrinsic priors in SEM images without requiring human annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised methods require extensive human annotation and struggle with emergent and rare defects, while clustering-based unsupervised methods have unstable performance due to missing priors.

Method: Uses Self Normal Information Guided defect detection with learnable normal feature extractor, adaptive binarization for stable subimages, and Self Defect Information Guided classification with soft mask guided attention mechanism in teacher-student model.

Result: Validated on real-world dataset spanning three fabrication stages and 15 defect types, demonstrating robust performance on both defect detection and unseen defect classification.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively handles defect detection and classification of unseen defects without requiring support sets or extensive human annotations.

Abstract: Integrated circuit manufacturing is highly complex, comprising hundreds of
process steps. Defects can arise at any stage, causing yield loss and
ultimately degrading product reliability. Supervised methods require extensive
human annotation and struggle with emergent categories and rare, data scarce
defects. Clustering-based unsupervised methods often exhibit unstable
performance due to missing priors. We propose IC DefectNCD, a support set free
framework that leverages Image Intrinsic Priors in IC SEM images for defect
detection and novel class discovery. We first develop Self Normal Information
Guided IC Defect Detection, aggregating representative normal features via a
learnable normal information extractor and using reconstruction residuals to
coarsely localize defect regions. To handle saliency variations across defects,
we introduce an adaptive binarization strategy that produces stable subimages
focused on core defective areas. Finally, we design Self Defect Information
Guided IC Defect Classification, which incorporates a soft mask guided
attention mechanism to inject spatial defect priors into the teacher student
model. This enhances sensitivity to defective regions, suppresses background
interference, and enables recognition and classification of unseen defects. We
validate the approach on a real world dataset spanning three key fabrication
stages and covering 15 defect types. Experiments demonstrate robust performance
on both defect detection and unseen defect classification.

*Hongbo Lan,Zhenlin An,Haoyu Li,Vaibhav Singh,Longfei Shangguan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: \sysname accelerates vision-guided physical property reasoning from 10-20 minutes to under 6 seconds through geometric 3D reconstruction, semantic feature fusion, and parallel view encoding optimizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable augmented visual cognition by minimizing latency in vision-guided physical property reasoning for real-world applications like smart glasses.

Method: Combines algorithmic and systematic optimizations including rapid geometric 3D reconstruction, efficient semantic feature fusion, and parallel view encoding.

Result: Achieves 62.9x-287.2x speedup on ABO dataset while maintaining or slightly improving object-level physical property estimation accuracy, with superior material segmentation and voxel-level inference compared to SOTA baselines.

Conclusion: \sysname provides robust physical property estimations in real-world scenarios, demonstrated through successful deployment on Meta Aria Glasses in an IKEA store environment with consistently high performance.

Abstract: This paper introduces \sysname, a system that accelerates vision-guided
physical property reasoning to enable augmented visual cognition. \sysname
minimizes the run-time latency of this reasoning pipeline through a combination
of both algorithmic and systematic optimizations, including rapid geometric 3D
reconstruction, efficient semantic feature fusion, and parallel view encoding.
Through these simple yet effective optimizations, \sysname reduces the
end-to-end latency of this reasoning pipeline from 10--20 minutes to less than
6 seconds. A head-to-head comparison on the ABO dataset shows that \sysname
achieves this 62.9$\times$--287.2$\times$ speedup while not only reaching
on-par (and sometimes slightly better) object-level physical property
estimation accuracy(e.g. mass), but also demonstrating superior performance in
material segmentation and voxel-level inference than two SOTA baselines. We
further combine gaze-tracking with \sysname to localize the object of interest
in cluttered, real-world environments, streamlining the physical property
reasoning on smart glasses. The case study with Meta Aria Glasses conducted at
an IKEA furniture store demonstrates that \sysname achives consistently high
performance compared to controlled captures, providing robust property
estimations even with fewer views in real-world scenarios.

### [16] [Deploying Rapid Damage Assessments from sUAS Imagery for Disaster Response](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03132)
*Thomas Manzini,Priyankari Perali,Robin R. Murphy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First operational AI/ML system for automated building damage assessment using sUAS imagery deployed during Hurricanes Debby and Helene, processing 415 buildings in 18 minutes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the data avalanche problem in disaster response where sUAS teams deliver 47GB-369GB of imagery per day that exceeds human processing capacity, delaying critical response efforts.

Method: Developed models trained on largest known dataset of post-disaster sUAS imagery (21,716 building damage labels) and operationally trained 91 disaster practitioners. Deployed best performing model during actual disaster responses.

Result: Successfully deployed during Hurricanes Debby and Helene, assessing 415 buildings in approximately 18 minutes, establishing the state of practice for sUAS-based damage assessment systems.

Conclusion: This work contributes the first documented operational use of AI/ML for damage assessment during disasters and provides valuable lessons learned for both AI/ML research and user communities.

Abstract: This paper presents the first AI/ML system for automating building damage
assessment in uncrewed aerial systems (sUAS) imagery to be deployed
operationally during federally declared disasters (Hurricanes Debby and
Helene). In response to major disasters, sUAS teams are dispatched to collect
imagery of the affected areas to assess damage; however, at recent disasters,
teams collectively delivered between 47GB and 369GB of imagery per day,
representing more imagery than can reasonably be transmitted or interpreted by
subject matter experts in the disaster scene, thus delaying response efforts.
To alleviate this data avalanche encountered in practice, computer vision and
machine learning techniques are necessary. While prior work has been deployed
to automatically assess damage in satellite imagery, there is no current state
of practice for sUAS-based damage assessment systems, as all known work has
been confined to academic settings. This work establishes the state of practice
via the development and deployment of models for building damage assessment
with sUAS imagery. The model development involved training on the largest known
dataset of post-disaster sUAS aerial imagery, containing 21,716 building damage
labels, and the operational training of 91 disaster practitioners. The best
performing model was deployed during the responses to Hurricanes Debby and
Helene, where it assessed a combined 415 buildings in approximately 18 minutes.
This work contributes documentation of the actual use of AI/ML for damage
assessment during a disaster and lessons learned to the benefit of the AI/ML
research and user communities.

*Sagar Shrestha,Gopal Sharma,Luowei Zhou,Suren Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A fine-tuning-free personalization method using Hypernetworks that predict LoRA-adapted weights directly from subject images, eliminating per-subject optimization while maintaining subject fidelity and prompt alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional subject-specific fine-tuning methods like DreamBooth are computationally expensive and slow at inference. Recent adapter- and encoder-based methods still require additional fine-tuning or large backbone models.

Method: Uses Hypernetworks to predict LoRA-adapted weights from subject images with end-to-end training objective stabilized by output regularization. Introduces Hybrid-Model Classifier-Free Guidance (HM-CFG) for enhanced compositional generalization during sampling.

Result: Achieves strong personalization performance on CelebA-HQ, AFHQ-v2, and DreamBench benchmarks, demonstrating reliable and effective hypernetworks without per-subject optimization.

Conclusion: The approach shows promise of hypernetworks as a scalable and effective direction for open-category personalization, removing the need for per-subject optimization while preserving subject fidelity and prompt alignment.

Abstract: Personalizing text-to-image diffusion models has traditionally relied on
subject-specific fine-tuning approaches such as
DreamBooth~\cite{ruiz2023dreambooth}, which are computationally expensive and
slow at inference. Recent adapter- and encoder-based methods attempt to reduce
this overhead but still depend on additional fine-tuning or large backbone
models for satisfactory results. In this work, we revisit an orthogonal
direction: fine-tuning-free personalization via Hypernetworks that predict
LoRA-adapted weights directly from subject images. Prior hypernetwork-based
approaches, however, suffer from costly data generation or unstable attempts to
mimic base model optimization trajectories. We address these limitations with
an end-to-end training objective, stabilized by a simple output regularization,
yielding reliable and effective hypernetworks. Our method removes the need for
per-subject optimization at test time while preserving both subject fidelity
and prompt alignment. To further enhance compositional generalization at
inference time, we introduce Hybrid-Model Classifier-Free Guidance (HM-CFG),
which combines the compositional strengths of the base diffusion model with the
subject fidelity of personalized models during sampling. Extensive experiments
on CelebA-HQ, AFHQ-v2, and DreamBench demonstrate that our approach achieves
strong personalization performance and highlights the promise of hypernetworks
as a scalable and effective direction for open-category personalization.

*Yun-Chen Lin,Jiayuan Huang,Hanyuan Zhang,Sergi Kavtaradze,Matthew J. Clarkson,Mobarak I. Hoque*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A depth-guided liver landmark segmentation framework using SAM2 and Depth Anything V2 encoders with SRFT-GaLore fine-tuning method achieves improved segmentation accuracy and cross-dataset generalization in laparoscopic surgery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate anatomical structure detection in laparoscopic liver surgery is challenging due to limited depth perception in 2D video streams, requiring better fusion of RGB and depth features and efficient adaptation of large vision models to surgical domains.

Method: Proposes a dual-encoder framework using SAM2 for RGB features and Depth Anything V2 for depth features, integrated via cross-attention fusion. Introduces SRFT-GaLore for efficient fine-tuning using Subsampled Randomized Fourier Transform instead of SVD.

Result: Achieves 4.85% improvement in Dice Similarity Coefficient and 11.78-point reduction in Average Symmetric Surface Distance on L3D dataset. Maintains competitive performance on new LLSD dataset, demonstrating strong cross-dataset robustness.

Conclusion: The SRFT-GaLore-enhanced dual-encoder framework enables scalable and precise segmentation under real-time, depth-constrained surgical settings with strong generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Accurate detection and delineation of anatomical structures in medical
imaging are critical for computer-assisted interventions, particularly in
laparoscopic liver surgery where 2D video streams limit depth perception and
complicate landmark localization. While recent works have leveraged monocular
depth cues for enhanced landmark detection, challenges remain in fusing RGB and
depth features and in efficiently adapting large-scale vision models to
surgical domains. We propose a depth-guided liver landmark segmentation
framework integrating semantic and geometric cues via vision foundation
encoders. We employ Segment Anything Model V2 (SAM2) encoder to extract RGB
features and Depth Anything V2 (DA2) encoder to extract depth-aware features.
To efficiently adapt SAM2, we introduce SRFT-GaLore, a novel low-rank gradient
projection method that replaces the computationally expensive SVD with a
Subsampled Randomized Fourier Transform (SRFT). This enables efficient
fine-tuning of high-dimensional attention layers without sacrificing
representational power. A cross-attention fusion module further integrates RGB
and depth cues. To assess cross-dataset generalization, we also construct a new
Laparoscopic Liver Surgical Dataset (LLSD) as an external validation benchmark.
On the public L3D dataset, our method achieves a 4.85% improvement in Dice
Similarity Coefficient and a 11.78-point reduction in Average Symmetric Surface
Distance compared to the D2GPLand. To further assess generalization capability,
we evaluate our model on LLSD dataset. Our model maintains competitive
performance and significantly outperforms SAM-based baselines, demonstrating
strong cross-dataset robustness and adaptability to unseen surgical
environments. These results demonstrate that our SRFT-GaLore-enhanced
dual-encoder framework enables scalable and precise segmentation under
real-time, depth-constrained surgical settings.

*Shreyas C. Dhake,Jiayuan Huang,Runlong He,Danyal Z. Khan,Evangelos B. Mazomenos,Sophia Bano,Hani J. Marcus,Danail Stoyanov,Matthew J. Clarkson,Mobarak I. Hoque*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new surgical VQA dataset (PitVQA-Anticipation) and model (SurgAnt-ViVQA) for anticipating future surgical events, using temporal modeling and gated cross-attention to predict phases, steps, instruments, and duration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current surgical VQA systems focus on static scene description rather than forecasting future events, which is crucial for real-time assistance in endonasal surgery where visibility is limited and workflow changes rapidly.

Method: Proposed SurgAnt-ViVQA model with GRU Gated Temporal Cross-Attention module that encodes frame-to-frame dynamics using bidirectional GRU and injects visual context into language stream via adaptive gating, with parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

Result: SurgAnt-ViVQA outperforms image and video baselines on PitVQA-Anticipation and EndoVis datasets, with temporal recurrence and gated fusion driving most performance gains. 8 frames maximize fluency while 32 frames improve numeric time estimation.

Conclusion: The approach advances surgical VQA from retrospective description to proactive anticipation, highlighting the importance of targeted temporal modeling for reliable future-aware surgical assistance.

Abstract: Anticipating forthcoming surgical events is vital for real-time assistance in
endonasal transsphenoidal pituitary surgery, where visibility is limited and
workflow changes rapidly. Most visual question answering (VQA) systems reason
on isolated frames with static vision language alignment, providing little
support for forecasting next steps or instrument needs. Existing surgical VQA
datasets likewise center on the current scene rather than the near future. We
introduce PitVQA-Anticipation, the first VQA dataset designed for forward
looking surgical reasoning. It comprises 33.5 hours of operative video and
734,769 question answer pairs built from temporally grouped clips and expert
annotations across four tasks: predicting the future phase, next step, upcoming
instrument, and remaining duration. We further propose SurgAnt-ViVQA, a video
language model that adapts a large language model using a GRU Gated Temporal
Cross-Attention module. A bidirectional GRU encodes frame to frame dynamics,
while an adaptive gate injects visual context into the language stream at the
token level. Parameter efficient fine tuning customizes the language backbone
to the surgical domain. SurgAnt-ViVQA tested upon on PitVQA-Anticipation and
EndoVis datasets, surpassing strong image and video based baselines. Ablations
show that temporal recurrence and gated fusion drive most of the gains. A frame
budget study indicates a trade-off: 8 frames maximize fluency, whereas 32
frames slightly reduce BLEU but improve numeric time estimation. By pairing a
temporally aware encoder with fine grained gated cross-attention, SurgAnt-ViVQA
advances surgical VQA from retrospective description to proactive anticipation.
PitVQA-Anticipation offers a comprehensive benchmark for this setting and
highlights the importance of targeted temporal modeling for reliable, future
aware surgical assistance.

*Kuei-Chun Kao,Hsu Tzu-Yin,Yunqi Hong,Ruochen Wang,Cho-Jui Hsieh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes QG-CoC, a zero-shot prompting method that improves MLLMs' fine-grained perception and reasoning across multiple images by using question-guided chain-of-captions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs lack fine-grained perception across disparate images and struggle to reason over multiple visual inputs, with existing methods focusing mainly on single-image scenarios.

Method: QG-CoC uses question-guided chain-of-captions to handle arbitrary numbers of images, improving attention to needed clues and integrating perception with reasoning.

Result: QG-CoC shows competitive performance across multi-image and single-image benchmarks, with robust improvements in challenging scenarios where other methods fail.

Conclusion: The proposed QG-CoC method effectively addresses multi-image reasoning gaps in MLLMs and demonstrates strong generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) encounter two key issues
in multi-image contexts: (1) a lack of fine-grained perception across disparate
images, and (2) a diminished capability to effectively reason over and
synthesize information from multiple visual inputs. However, while various
prompting methods aim to describe visual content, many existing studies focus
primarily on single-image settings or specific, constrained scenarios. This
leaves a critical gap in understanding and addressing how MLLMs tackle more
general and complex multi-image reasoning tasks. Thus, we first extensively
investigate how current prompting methods perceive fine-grained visual details
and process visual information when dealing with multiple images. Our findings
reveal that existing prompting methods fall short in attending to needed clues
and seamlessly integrating perception and reasoning. Inspired by the findings,
we propose a new zero-shot prompting method, Question-Guided Chain-of-Captions
(QG-CoC), a generalized prompting approach that effectively handles problems
with an arbitrary number of images. We evaluate our method on various
open-source and closed-source MLLMs for multi-image and single-image
benchmarks. Experimental results indicate that QG-CoC demonstrates competitive
performance across tasks and exhibits robust improvements in the challenging
scenarios where existing prompting methods fail.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes MvBody, a multi-view Transformer network that uses 3D body shape scans and self-reported medical data to predict cesarean section risk with 84.62% accuracy and 0.724 AUC-ROC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for early CS risk prediction in resource-limited settings where traditional hospital-based models are unavailable, enabling better prenatal care decisions.

Method: Multi-view Transformer network (MvBody) using 3D optical body scans and self-reported medical data with metric learning loss for data-scarce environments; includes Integrated Gradients for explainability.

Result: Achieved 84.62% accuracy and 0.724 AUC-ROC on independent test set, outperforming existing machine learning and 3D analysis methods.

Conclusion: 3D body shape combined with medical data can effectively predict CS risk; key factors include pre-pregnancy weight, maternal age, obstetric history, and body shape around head/shoulders.

Abstract: Accurately assessing the risk of cesarean section (CS) delivery is critical,
especially in settings with limited medical resources, where access to
healthcare is often restricted. Early and reliable risk prediction allows
better-informed prenatal care decisions and can improve maternal and neonatal
outcomes. However, most existing predictive models are tailored for in-hospital
use during labor and rely on parameters that are often unavailable in
resource-limited or home-based settings. In this study, we conduct a pilot
investigation to examine the feasibility of using 3D body shape for CS risk
assessment for future applications with more affordable general devices. We
propose a novel multi-view-based Transformer network, MvBody, which predicts CS
risk using only self-reported medical data and 3D optical body scans obtained
between the 31st and 38th weeks of gestation. To enhance training efficiency
and model generalizability in data-scarce environments, we incorporate a metric
learning loss into the network. Compared to widely used machine learning models
and the latest advanced 3D analysis methods, our method demonstrates superior
performance, achieving an accuracy of 84.62% and an Area Under the Receiver
Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.724 on the independent test set.
To improve transparency and trust in the model's predictions, we apply the
Integrated Gradients algorithm to provide theoretically grounded explanations
of the model's decision-making process. Our results indicate that pre-pregnancy
weight, maternal age, obstetric history, previous CS history, and body shape,
particularly around the head and shoulders, are key contributors to CS risk
prediction.

*Pengyu Jie,Wanquan Liu,Rui He,Yihui Wen,Deyu Meng,Chenqiang Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes MCPMix with RLA for endoscopic segmentation, combining diffusion synthesis and mask-consistent mixing to enhance diversity while preserving pixel-level semantics, achieving SOTA results across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing augmentation methods: sample mixing causes soft label ambiguity from misaligned masks, while diffusion synthesis introduces domain shift and overlooks structural benefits of mask conditioning.

Method: MCPMix generates synthetic counterparts for real images under same masks, then mixes only image appearance while using original hard masks for supervision. RLA adaptively adjusts mixing strength and loss weights to gradually re-anchor optimization to real data.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance across Kvasir-SEG, PICCOLO, CVC-ClinicDB, private NPC-LES cohort, and ISIC 2017 datasets, with consistent gains over baselines.

Conclusion: Combining label-preserving mixing with diffusion-driven diversity and adaptive re-anchoring yields robust and generalizable endoscopic segmentation.

Abstract: Augmentation for dense prediction typically relies on either sample mixing or
generative synthesis. Mixing improves robustness but misaligned masks yield
soft label ambiguity. Diffusion synthesis increases apparent diversity but,
when trained as common samples, overlooks the structural benefit of mask
conditioning and introduces synthetic-real domain shift. We propose a paired,
diffusion-guided paradigm that fuses the strengths of both. For each real
image, a synthetic counterpart is generated under the same mask and the pair is
used as a controllable input for Mask-Consistent Paired Mixing (MCPMix), which
mixes only image appearance while supervision always uses the original hard
mask. This produces a continuous family of intermediate samples that smoothly
bridges synthetic and real appearances under shared geometry, enlarging
diversity without compromising pixel-level semantics. To keep learning aligned
with real data, Real-Anchored Learnable Annealing (RLA) adaptively adjusts the
mixing strength and the loss weight of mixed samples over training, gradually
re-anchoring optimization to real data and mitigating distributional bias.
Across Kvasir-SEG, PICCOLO, CVC-ClinicDB, a private NPC-LES cohort, and ISIC
2017, the approach achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance and
consistent gains over baselines. The results show that combining
label-preserving mixing with diffusion-driven diversity, together with adaptive
re-anchoring, yields robust and generalizable endoscopic segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Mamba-based SR methods lack fine-grained transitions across different modeling scales, limiting feature representation efficiency, despite their ability to capture global receptive fields with linear complexity.

Method: Integrates window-based self-attention with Progressive Mamba to enable interactions among receptive fields of different scales, and introduces an Adaptive High-Frequency Refinement Module (AHFRM) to recover lost high-frequency details.

Result: Extensive experiments show T-PMambaSR progressively enhances receptive field and expressiveness, achieving better performance than recent Transformer- or Mamba-based methods with lower computational cost.

Conclusion: The proposed framework establishes a fine-grained modeling paradigm that progressively enhances feature representation with linear complexity, outperforming existing approaches while being computationally efficient.

Abstract: Recently, Mamba-based super-resolution (SR) methods have demonstrated the
ability to capture global receptive fields with linear complexity, addressing
the quadratic computational cost of Transformer-based SR approaches. However,
existing Mamba-based methods lack fine-grained transitions across different
modeling scales, which limits the efficiency of feature representation. In this
paper, we propose T-PMambaSR, a lightweight SR framework that integrates
window-based self-attention with Progressive Mamba. By enabling interactions
among receptive fields of different scales, our method establishes a
fine-grained modeling paradigm that progressively enhances feature
representation with linear complexity. Furthermore, we introduce an Adaptive
High-Frequency Refinement Module (AHFRM) to recover high-frequency details lost
during Transformer and Mamba processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
T-PMambaSR progressively enhances the model's receptive field and
expressiveness, yielding better performance than recent Transformer- or
Mamba-based methods while incurring lower computational cost. Our codes will be
released after acceptance.

TL;DR: DMPO is a method that decouples low-level representative and high-level discriminative abilities in early stages of multi-stage predictors for efficient inference through architectural modifications and two-phase optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of early stages providing both fundamental features to deep stages and discriminative features to early-stage predictors simultaneously, enabling more efficient inference in large-scale pre-trained models.

Method: Introduces lightweight bypass module for functional decomposition of shallow features, develops high-order statistics-based predictor for early stages, and uses decoupled two-phase optimization with weighted losses for multi-stage predictors.

Result: Experiments across various datasets and pre-trained backbones show DMPO clearly outperforms counterparts when reducing computational cost.

Conclusion: DMPO effectively decouples representative and discriminative abilities in early stages through both architectural design and model optimization, achieving improved inference efficiency.

Abstract: Recently, remarkable progress has been made in large-scale pre-trained model
tuning, and inference efficiency is becoming more crucial for practical
deployment. Early exiting in conjunction with multi-stage predictors, when
cooperated with a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy, offers a
straightforward way to achieve an inference-efficient model. However, a key
challenge remains unresolved: How can early stages provide low-level
fundamental features to deep stages while simultaneously supplying high-level
discriminative features to early-stage predictors? To address this problem, we
propose a Decoupled Multi-Predictor Optimization (DMPO) method to effectively
decouple the low-level representative ability and high-level discriminative
ability in early stages. First, in terms of architecture, we introduce a
lightweight bypass module into multi-stage predictors for functional
decomposition of shallow features from early stages, while a high-order
statistics-based predictor is developed for early stages to effectively enhance
their discriminative ability. To reasonably train our multi-predictor
architecture, a decoupled optimization is proposed to allocate two-phase loss
weights for multi-stage predictors during model tuning, where the initial
training phase enables the model to prioritize the acquisition of
discriminative ability of deep stages via emphasizing representative ability of
early stages, and the latter training phase drives discriminative ability
towards earlier stages as much as possible. As such, our DMPO can effectively
decouple representative and discriminative abilities in early stages in terms
of architecture design and model optimization. Experiments across various
datasets and pre-trained backbones demonstrate that DMPO clearly outperforms
its counterparts when reducing computational cost.

TL;DR: A generative method for translating between color flow doppler and greyscale ultrasound videos that produces realistic synthetic data indistinguishable from real videos in clinical evaluation and downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address data imbalance and missingness in ultrasound studies where different sub-modalities (greyscale vs color flow doppler) are often imbalanced, limiting deep learning applications in medical imaging.

Method: Leveraged pixel-wise, adversarial, and perceptual losses with two networks: one for reconstructing anatomic structures and one for denoising. Trained on 54,975 videos and tested on 8,368 videos.

Result: Achieved average SSIM of 0.91±0.04 between synthetic and ground truth videos. Synthetic videos performed indistinguishably from real ones in classification (F1: 0.89 vs 0.9) and segmentation (Dice: 0.97). Clinicians could only distinguish real vs synthetic with 54±6% accuracy.

Conclusion: The method successfully generates realistic synthetic ultrasound videos that expand utility of retrospective imaging data and augment dataset design for medical imaging, demonstrating foundational capabilities across clinical domains.

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has the potential to revolutionize image acquisition and
interpretation across medicine, however, attention to data imbalance and
missingness is required. Ultrasound data presents a particular challenge
because in addition to different views and structures, it includes several
sub-modalities-such as greyscale and color flow doppler (CFD)-that are often
imbalanced in clinical studies. Image translation can help balance datasets but
is challenging for ultrasound sub-modalities to date. Here, we present a
generative method for ultrasound CFD-greyscale video translation, trained on
54,975 videos and tested on 8,368. The method developed leveraged pixel-wise,
adversarial, and perceptual loses and utilized two networks: one for
reconstructing anatomic structures and one for denoising to achieve realistic
ultrasound imaging. Average pairwise SSIM between synthetic videos and ground
truth was 0.91+/-0.04. Synthetic videos performed indistinguishably from real
ones in DL classification and segmentation tasks and when evaluated by blinded
clinical experts: F1 score was 0.9 for real and 0.89 for synthetic videos; Dice
score between real and synthetic segmentation was 0.97. Overall clinician
accuracy in distinguishing real vs synthetic videos was 54+/-6% (42-61%),
indicating realistic synthetic videos. Although trained only on heart videos,
the model worked well on ultrasound spanning several clinical domains (average
SSIM 0.91+/-0.05), demonstrating foundational abilities. Together, these data
expand the utility of retrospectively collected imaging and augment the dataset
design toolbox for medical imaging.

Motivation: Existing 3D datasets like Real3D-AD and MVTec 3D-AD fail to capture the complexities and subtle defects of real industrial environments, limiting precise anomaly detection research for industrial equipment components such as bearings, rings, and bolts.

Method: Developed IEC3D-AD dataset collected from actual production lines, and introduced GMANet paradigm that generates synthetic point cloud samples based on geometric morphological analysis, then reduces margin and increases overlap between normal and abnormal features through spatial discrepancy optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on both IEC3D-AD and other datasets, with improved point cloud resolution and defect annotation granularity compared to existing datasets.

Conclusion: The IEC3D-AD dataset and GMANet method address limitations of existing 3D anomaly detection approaches for industrial applications, providing higher fidelity data and more effective detection capabilities for real industrial scenarios.

Abstract: 3D anomaly detection (3D-AD) plays a critical role in industrial
manufacturing, particularly in ensuring the reliability and safety of core
equipment components. Although existing 3D datasets like Real3D-AD and MVTec
3D-AD offer broad application support, they fall short in capturing the
complexities and subtle defects found in real industrial environments. This
limitation hampers precise anomaly detection research, especially for
industrial equipment components (IEC) such as bearings, rings, and bolts. To
address this challenge, we have developed a point cloud anomaly detection
dataset (IEC3D-AD) specific to real industrial scenarios. This dataset is
directly collected from actual production lines, ensuring high fidelity and
relevance. Compared to existing datasets, IEC3D-AD features significantly
improved point cloud resolution and defect annotation granularity, facilitating
more demanding anomaly detection tasks. Furthermore, inspired by generative
2D-AD methods, we introduce a novel 3D-AD paradigm (GMANet) on IEC3D-AD. This
paradigm generates synthetic point cloud samples based on geometric
morphological analysis, then reduces the margin and increases the overlap
between normal and abnormal point-level features through spatial discrepancy
optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method
on both IEC3D-AD and other datasets.

*Shuangquan Lyu,Steven Mao,Yue Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified approach for long video inpainting and outpainting using LoRA-fine-tuned diffusion models with overlap-and-blend temporal co-denoising to generate arbitrarily long videos without seams or drift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the fundamental challenge of generating long videos with high controllability in video inpainting and outpainting, which prior methods struggle with due to fixed-length clips and stitching artifacts.

Method: Extends text-to-video diffusion models using LoRA for efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained models like Wan 2.1, combined with overlap-and-blend temporal co-denoising strategy with high-order solvers for long-sequence consistency.

Result: Achieves superior performance over baseline methods (Wan 2.1, VACE) in quality metrics (PSNR/SSIM) and perceptual realism (LPIPS), enabling editing over hundreds of frames without noticeable seams or drift.

Conclusion: The method enables practical long-range video editing with minimal overhead, achieving a balance between parameter efficiency and superior performance for arbitrarily long video generation and editing.

Abstract: Generating long videos remains a fundamental challenge, and achieving high
controllability in video inpainting and outpainting is particularly demanding.
To address both of these challenges simultaneously and achieve controllable
video inpainting and outpainting for long video clips, we introduce a novel and
unified approach for long video inpainting and outpainting that extends
text-to-video diffusion models to generate arbitrarily long, spatially edited
videos with high fidelity. Our method leverages LoRA to efficiently fine-tune a
large pre-trained video diffusion model like Alibaba's Wan 2.1 for masked
region video synthesis, and employs an overlap-and-blend temporal co-denoising
strategy with high-order solvers to maintain consistency across long sequences.
In contrast to prior work that struggles with fixed-length clips or exhibits
stitching artifacts, our system enables arbitrarily long video generation and
editing without noticeable seams or drift. We validate our approach on
challenging inpainting/outpainting tasks including editing or adding objects
over hundreds of frames and demonstrate superior performance to baseline
methods like Wan 2.1 model and VACE in terms of quality (PSNR/SSIM), and
perceptual realism (LPIPS). Our method enables practical long-range video
editing with minimal overhead, achieved a balance between parameter efficient
and superior performance.

*Minghao Fu,Guo-Hua Wang,Tianyu Cui,Qing-Guo Chen,Zhao Xu,Weihua Luo,Kaifu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diffusion-SDPO introduces a safeguarded update rule for diffusion-based DPO that prevents degradation of preferred outputs by adaptively scaling loser gradients, improving alignment with human preferences in text-to-image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Diffusion-DPO suffers from pathology where enlarging preference margin can increase reconstruction errors for both winner and loser branches, degrading generation quality despite preference optimization.

Method: Proposes Diffusion-SDPO with safeguarded update rule that preserves winner quality by adaptively scaling loser gradient based on its alignment with winner gradient, using closed-form scaling coefficient from first-order analysis.

Result: Outperforms preference-learning baselines on automated preference, aesthetic, and prompt alignment metrics across standard text-to-image benchmarks with only marginal computational overhead.

Conclusion: Diffusion-SDPO provides simple, model-agnostic solution that guarantees non-increasing error for preferred outputs while maintaining compatibility with existing DPO frameworks.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models deliver high-quality images, yet aligning them
with human preferences remains challenging. We revisit diffusion-based Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) for these models and identify a critical
pathology: enlarging the preference margin does not necessarily improve
generation quality. In particular, the standard Diffusion-DPO objective can
increase the reconstruction error of both winner and loser branches.
Consequently, degradation of the less-preferred outputs can become sufficiently
severe that the preferred branch is also adversely affected even as the margin
grows. To address this, we introduce Diffusion-SDPO, a safeguarded update rule
that preserves the winner by adaptively scaling the loser gradient according to
its alignment with the winner gradient. A first-order analysis yields a
closed-form scaling coefficient that guarantees the error of the preferred
output is non-increasing at each optimization step. Our method is simple,
model-agnostic, broadly compatible with existing DPO-style alignment frameworks
and adds only marginal computational overhead. Across standard text-to-image
benchmarks, Diffusion-SDPO delivers consistent gains over preference-learning
baselines on automated preference, aesthetic, and prompt alignment metrics.

TL;DR: SurgViVQA is a surgical VideoQA model that extends visual reasoning from static images to dynamic surgical scenes using temporal cues, outperforming existing methods on colonoscopic datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current surgical VideoQA approaches are limited to static image features and lack temporal annotations, ignoring critical dynamics needed for accurate procedural interpretation.

Method: Uses a Masked Video-Text Encoder to fuse video and question features capturing temporal cues like motion and tool-tissue interactions, then decodes with a fine-tuned LLM.

Result: Outperforms existing image-based VQA models by +11% on REAL-Colon-VQA and +9% on EndoVis18-VQA, with improved robustness to question phrasing variations.

Conclusion: SurgViVQA provides a framework for temporally-aware understanding in surgical VideoQA, enabling more effective interpretation of dynamic procedural contexts.

Abstract: Video Question Answering (VideoQA) in the surgical domain aims to enhance
intraoperative understanding by enabling AI models to reason over temporally
coherent events rather than isolated frames. Current approaches are limited to
static image features, and available datasets often lack temporal annotations,
ignoring the dynamics critical for accurate procedural interpretation. We
propose SurgViVQA, a surgical VideoQA model that extends visual reasoning from
static images to dynamic surgical scenes. It uses a Masked Video--Text Encoder
to fuse video and question features, capturing temporal cues such as motion and
tool--tissue interactions, which a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) then
decodes into coherent answers. To evaluate its performance, we curated
REAL-Colon-VQA, a colonoscopic video dataset that includes motion-related
questions and diagnostic attributes, as well as out-of-template questions with
rephrased or semantically altered formulations to assess model robustness.
Experimental validation on REAL-Colon-VQA and the public EndoVis18-VQA dataset
shows that SurgViVQA outperforms existing image-based VQA benchmark models,
particularly in keyword accuracy, improving over PitVQA by +11\% on
REAL-Colon-VQA and +9\% on EndoVis18-VQA. A perturbation study on the questions
further confirms improved generalizability and robustness to variations in
question phrasing. SurgViVQA and the REAL-Colon-VQA dataset provide a framework
for temporally-aware understanding in surgical VideoQA, enabling AI models to
interpret dynamic procedural contexts more effectively. Code and dataset

Grounding (MOT25-StAG) Challenge. The aim of this challenge is to accurately
localize and track multiple objects that match specific and free-form language
queries, using video data of complex real-world scenes as input. We model the
underlying task as a video retrieval problem and present a two-stage, zero-shot
approach, combining the advantages of the SOTA tracking model FastTracker and
Multi-modal Large Language Model LLaVA-Video. On the MOT25-StAG test set, our

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniAVGen is a unified framework for joint audio-video generation that addresses lip synchronization and semantic consistency issues through dual-branch Diffusion Transformers with cross-modal interaction mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing open-source audio-video generation methods suffer from compromised lip synchronization and insufficient semantic consistency due to lack of effective cross-modal modeling.

Method: Uses dual-branch joint synthesis with parallel Diffusion Transformers, Asymmetric Cross-Modal Interaction for bidirectional cross-attention, Face-Aware Modulation for prioritizing salient regions, and Modality-Aware Classifier-Free Guidance during inference.

Result: Achieves overall advantages in audio-video synchronization, timbre consistency, and emotion consistency with far fewer training samples (1.3M vs 30.1M).

Conclusion: UniAVGen provides a robust joint synthesis design that unifies multiple audio-video tasks in a single model while delivering superior cross-modal consistency.

Abstract: Due to the lack of effective cross-modal modeling, existing open-source
audio-video generation methods often exhibit compromised lip synchronization
and insufficient semantic consistency. To mitigate these drawbacks, we propose
UniAVGen, a unified framework for joint audio and video generation. UniAVGen is
anchored in a dual-branch joint synthesis architecture, incorporating two
parallel Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) to build a cohesive cross-modal latent
space. At its heart lies an Asymmetric Cross-Modal Interaction mechanism, which
enables bidirectional, temporally aligned cross-attention, thus ensuring
precise spatiotemporal synchronization and semantic consistency. Furthermore,
this cross-modal interaction is augmented by a Face-Aware Modulation module,
which dynamically prioritizes salient regions in the interaction process. To
enhance generative fidelity during inference, we additionally introduce
Modality-Aware Classifier-Free Guidance, a novel strategy that explicitly
amplifies cross-modal correlation signals. Notably, UniAVGen's robust joint
synthesis design enables seamless unification of pivotal audio-video tasks
within a single model, such as joint audio-video generation and continuation,
video-to-audio dubbing, and audio-driven video synthesis. Comprehensive
experiments validate that, with far fewer training samples (1.3M vs. 30.1M),
UniAVGen delivers overall advantages in audio-video synchronization, timbre
consistency, and emotion consistency.

*Gahyeon Kim,Sohee Kim,Seokju Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AAPL improves prompt learning by using image augmentations with adversarial token embeddings to focus on class-relevant visual features, outperforming existing methods across multiple settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt learning methods struggle with generalization to unseen categories and lack explicit guidance for learning semantically meaningful visual features, while image-based augmentation potential remains unexplored.

Method: Proposed AAPL method introduces adversarial token embeddings to decouple superficial visual variations from class-relevant semantic representations, enabling prompts to focus on visually discriminative features.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on 11 benchmark datasets show AAPL consistently outperforms existing methods in few-shot, zero-shot, cross-dataset, and domain generalization settings.

Conclusion: AAPL effectively enhances prompt learning by leveraging image-level augmentations with adversarial guidance, improving generalization capabilities across various learning scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale vision and language models have led to
significant progress in zero-shot learning tasks. Methods such as CoOp and
CoCoOp have shown that replacing handcrafted prompts with learnable vectors,
known as prompt learning, can result in improved performance. However, these
models often struggle to generalize to entirely unseen categories. While
traditional zero-shot learning techniques benefit from various data
augmentation strategies, prompt learning has primarily focused on text-based
modifications, leaving the potential of image-based augmentation largely
unexplored. In this work, we explore how image-level augmentations,
particularly those that introduce attribute-specific variations, can support
and enhance prompt learning. Our analysis examines the interaction between
these augmentations and soft prompt frameworks, revealing their potential to
improve generalization. We also identify a limitation in existing methods, such
as CoCoOp, which do not provide explicit guidance for learning prompts that
focus on semantically meaningful visual features. To address this, we propose
Adding Attributes to Prompt Learning, AAPL, a novel method that introduces
adversarial token embeddings to decouple superficial visual variations
introduced by augmentation from class-relevant semantic representations. This
decoupling enables the learned prompts to concentrate on visually
discriminative features that align with the target categories. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on eleven benchmark datasets, and AAPL consistently
outperforms existing methods across few-shot, zero-shot, cross-dataset, and
domain generalization settings. Our source code is publicly available at:

TL;DR: Automated method for standardizing embryo alignment in 3D ultrasound images using PCA and multiple selection strategies, achieving high accuracy for prenatal growth monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standardized alignment of embryos in 3D ultrasound images facilitates prenatal growth monitoring by enabling standard plane detection, improving landmark visualization, and accentuating differences between scans.

Method: Uses PCA on embryo segmentation masks to extract principal axes, generating four candidate orientations. Three selection strategies are employed: Pearson correlation heuristic, atlas-based image matching via normalized cross-correlation, and Random Forest classifier.

Result: Tested on 2166 3D ultrasound scans from 1043 pregnancies (7+0 to 12+6 weeks gestational age). PCA correctly extracted principal axes in 99.0% of images. Selection accuracy: Pearson Heuristic 97.4%, Atlas-based 95.8%, Random Forest 98.4%. Majority Vote achieved 98.5% accuracy.

Conclusion: The pipeline enables consistent embryonic alignment in the first trimester with high accuracy, supporting scalable analysis in clinical and research settings. Code is publicly available.

Abstract: Standardized alignment of the embryo in three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound
images aids prenatal growth monitoring by facilitating standard plane
detection, improving visualization of landmarks and accentuating differences
between different scans. In this work, we propose an automated method for
standardizing this alignment. Given a segmentation mask of the embryo,
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to the mask extracting the
embryo's principal axes, from which four candidate orientations are derived.
The candidate in standard orientation is selected using one of three
strategies: a heuristic based on Pearson's correlation assessing shape, image
matching to an atlas through normalized cross-correlation, and a Random Forest
classifier. We tested our method on 2166 images longitudinally acquired 3D
ultrasound scans from 1043 pregnancies from the Rotterdam Periconceptional
Cohort, ranging from 7+0 to 12+6 weeks of gestational age. In 99.0% of images,
PCA correctly extracted the principal axes of the embryo. The correct candidate
was selected by the Pearson Heuristic, Atlas-based and Random Forest in 97.4%,
95.8%, and 98.4% of images, respectively. A Majority Vote of these selection
methods resulted in an accuracy of 98.5%. The high accuracy of this pipeline
enables consistent embryonic alignment in the first trimester, enabling
scalable analysis in both clinical and research settings. The code is publicly

*Kevin Manogue,Tomasz M Schang,Dilara Kuş,Jonas Müller,Stefan Zachow,Agniva Sengupta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method that extends Shape-from-Template (SfT) to handle topological changes like tears and cuts during 3D surface reconstruction from 2D images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SfT methods fail when objects undergo topological changes during deformation, limiting their practical applicability.

Method: Initialize with classical SfT solution, then iteratively adapt the template by partitioning its spatial domain to minimize an energy functional combining physical plausibility and reprojection consistency.

Result: Robustly captures topological events including tears and cuts on bounded 2D surfaces, outperforming baseline methods on both synthetic and real data.

Conclusion: Establishes the first general framework for topological-change-aware SfT, enabling reconstruction in the presence of topological changes.

Abstract: Reconstructing the surfaces of deformable objects from correspondences
between a 3D template and a 2D image is well studied under Shape-from-Template
(SfT) methods; however, existing approaches break down when topological changes
accompany the deformation. We propose a principled extension of SfT that
enables reconstruction in the presence of such changes. Our approach is
initialized with a classical SfT solution and iteratively adapts the template
by partitioning its spatial domain so as to minimize an energy functional that
jointly encodes physical plausibility and reprojection consistency. We
demonstrate that the method robustly captures a wide range of practically
relevant topological events including tears and cuts on bounded 2D surfaces,
thereby establishing the first general framework for topological-change-aware
SfT. Experiments on both synthetic and real data confirm that our approach
consistently outperforms baseline methods.

TL;DR: Anny is a scan-free, differentiable human body model based on anthropometric knowledge that provides interpretable shape control across diverse demographics, calibrated with WHO statistics for realistic human variation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing parametric body models rely on costly 3D scans and proprietary shape spaces that are demographically narrow, limiting accessibility and representation.

Method: Anny defines a continuous, interpretable shape space using phenotype parameters (gender, age, height, weight) to control blendshapes, calibrated with WHO population statistics. It's fully differentiable and scan-free.

Result: Anny supports millimeter-accurate scan fitting, synthetic data generation, and HMR. Anny-One dataset of 800k photorealistic humans shows HMR models trained with Anny match scan-based model performance while being interpretable and broadly representative.

Conclusion: Anny provides an accessible, open foundation for human-centric 3D modeling with semantic control and demographic diversity, released under Apache 2.0 license.

Abstract: Parametric body models are central to many human-centric tasks, yet existing
models often rely on costly 3D scans and learned shape spaces that are
proprietary and demographically narrow. We introduce Anny, a simple, fully
differentiable, and scan-free human body model grounded in anthropometric
knowledge from the MakeHuman community. Anny defines a continuous,
interpretable shape space, where phenotype parameters (e.g. gender, age,
height, weight) control blendshapes spanning a wide range of human forms --
across ages (from infants to elders), body types, and proportions. Calibrated
using WHO population statistics, it provides realistic and demographically
grounded human shape variation within a single unified model. Thanks to its
openness and semantic control, Anny serves as a versatile foundation for 3D
human modeling -- supporting millimeter-accurate scan fitting, controlled
synthetic data generation, and Human Mesh Recovery (HMR). We further introduce
Anny-One, a collection of 800k photorealistic humans generated with Anny,
showing that despite its simplicity, HMR models trained with Anny can match the
performance of those trained with scan-based body models, while remaining
interpretable and broadly representative. The Anny body model and its code are
released under the Apache 2.0 license, making Anny an accessible foundation for

*Vittal L. Rao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes intensity-weighted coordinate channels that scale coordinates by local signal intensity, improving localization performance in biomedical signals compared to standard coordinate channels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Localization tasks in biomedical data require learning spatial/temporal relationships from signals with complex intensity distributions. Standard approaches like CoordConv use pure coordinate channels, but lack intensity-position coupling.

Method: Replace pure coordinate channels with signal intensity-weighted coordinate representation - coordinates are scaled by local signal intensity, embedding intensity-position coupling directly in input representation.

Result: Evaluated on ECG signal transition time prediction and nuclear center localization in cytological images. Shows faster convergence and higher generalization performance than conventional coordinate-channel approaches.

Conclusion: The intensity-weighted coordinate representation is effective across 1D and 2D biomedical signals, providing a simple modality-agnostic inductive bias that improves localization performance.

Abstract: Localisation tasks in biomedical data often require models to learn
meaningful spatial or temporal relationships from signals with complex
intensity distributions. A common strategy, exemplified by CoordConv layers, is
to append coordinate channels to convolutional inputs, enabling networks to
learn absolute positions. In this work, we propose a signal intensity-weighted
coordinate representation that replaces the pure coordinate channels with
channels scaled by local signal intensity. This modification embeds an
intensity-position coupling directly in the input representation, introducing a
simple and modality-agnostic inductive bias. We evaluate the approach on two
distinct localisation problems: (i) predicting the time of morphological
transition in 20-second, two-lead ECG signals, and (ii) regressing the
coordinates of nuclear centres in cytological images from the SiPaKMeD dataset.
In both cases, the proposed representation yields faster convergence and higher
generalisation performance relative to conventional coordinate-channel
approaches, demonstrating its effectiveness across both one-dimensional and
two-dimensional biomedical signals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy preservation in human monitoring systems, as conventional cameras capture identifiable information while event cameras only record pixel intensity changes.

Method: Lightweight 3DCNN modeling spatial-temporal dynamics with focal loss, class reweighting, and data augmentation for class imbalance and generalization.

Result: F1-score of 0.9415 and overall accuracy of 94.17%, outperforming C3D, ResNet3D, and MC3_18 benchmarks by up to 3%.

Conclusion: Event-based deep learning enables accurate, efficient, privacy-aware human action recognition suitable for real-world edge applications.

Abstract: This paper presents a lightweight three-dimensional convolutional neural
network (3DCNN) for human activity recognition (HAR) using event-based vision
data. Privacy preservation is a key challenge in human monitoring systems, as
conventional frame-based cameras capture identifiable personal information. In
contrast, event cameras record only changes in pixel intensity, providing an
inherently privacy-preserving sensing modality. The proposed network
effectively models both spatial and temporal dynamics while maintaining a
compact design suitable for edge deployment. To address class imbalance and
enhance generalization, focal loss with class reweighting and targeted data
augmentation strategies are employed. The model is trained and evaluated on a
composite dataset derived from the Toyota Smart Home and ETRI datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate an F1-score of 0.9415 and an overall accuracy
of 94.17%, outperforming benchmark 3D-CNN architectures such as C3D, ResNet3D,
and MC3_18 by up to 3%. These results highlight the potential of event-based
deep learning for developing accurate, efficient, and privacy-aware human

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A part-aware bottom-up framework for fine-grained social interaction detection that uses body part features and interpersonal relations to infer social groups, outperforming prior methods on the NVI dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods overlook subtle cues like facial expressions and gestures, relying on holistic representations and directly detecting groups without modeling underlying interactions, limiting their ability to capture localized social signals.

Method: Detects individuals and enhances features using part-aware cues, then infers group configuration via similarity-based reasoning that considers both spatial relations and subtle social cues signaling interactions.

Result: Outperforms prior methods on the NVI dataset, achieving new state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The proposed part-aware bottom-up framework effectively captures fine-grained social interactions by modeling body part features and interpersonal relations, leading to more accurate group inference.

Abstract: Social interactions often emerge from subtle, fine-grained cues such as
facial expressions, gaze, and gestures. However, existing methods for social
interaction detection overlook such nuanced cues and primarily rely on holistic
representations of individuals. Moreover, they directly detect social groups
without explicitly modeling the underlying interactions between individuals.
These drawbacks limit their ability to capture localized social signals and
introduce ambiguity when group configurations should be inferred from social
interactions grounded in nuanced cues. In this work, we propose a part-aware
bottom-up group reasoning framework for fine-grained social interaction
detection. The proposed method infers social groups and their interactions
using body part features and their interpersonal relations. Our model first
detects individuals and enhances their features using part-aware cues, and then
infers group configuration by associating individuals via similarity-based
reasoning, which considers not only spatial relations but also subtle social
cues that signal interactions, leading to more accurate group inference.
Experiments on the NVI dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms prior
methods, achieving the new state of the art.

*Jongseo Lee,Wooil Lee,Gyeong-Moon Park,Seong Tae Kim,Jinwoo Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DANCE is a framework for video action recognition that provides disentangled explanations by separating motion dynamics from spatial context using concept bottlenecks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video explanation methods produce entangled explanations that don't clearly distinguish between motion and spatial context, while language-based approaches struggle to explain tacit motions that are hard to verbalize.

Method: Uses disentangled concept types: motion dynamics (human pose sequences), objects, and scenes. Employs large language models to extract object/scene concepts and uses ante-hoc concept bottleneck design to enforce prediction through these concepts.

Result: Significantly improves explanation clarity with competitive performance on KTH, Penn Action, HAA500, and UCF-101 datasets. User study validates superior interpretability, and framework is beneficial for model debugging, editing, and failure analysis.

Conclusion: DANCE successfully addresses the disentanglement challenge in video action recognition explanations by separating motion dynamics from spatial context through concept-based bottlenecks, providing clearer and more interpretable explanations.

Abstract: Effective explanations of video action recognition models should disentangle
how movements unfold over time from the surrounding spatial context. However,
existing methods based on saliency produce entangled explanations, making it
unclear whether predictions rely on motion or spatial context. Language-based
approaches offer structure but often fail to explain motions due to their tacit
nature -- intuitively understood but difficult to verbalize. To address these
challenges, we propose Disentangled Action aNd Context concept-based
Explainable (DANCE) video action recognition, a framework that predicts actions
through disentangled concept types: motion dynamics, objects, and scenes. We
define motion dynamics concepts as human pose sequences. We employ a large
language model to automatically extract object and scene concepts. Built on an
ante-hoc concept bottleneck design, DANCE enforces prediction through these
concepts. Experiments on four datasets -- KTH, Penn Action, HAA500, and UCF-101
-- demonstrate that DANCE significantly improves explanation clarity with
competitive performance. We validate the superior interpretability of DANCE
through a user study. Experimental results also show that DANCE is beneficial
for model debugging, editing, and failure analysis.
