Existing approaches,\nsuch as retrieval augmented generation (RAG) methods, search agents, and search\nequipped MLLMs, often suffer from rigid pipelines, excessive search calls, and\npoorly constructed search queries, which result in inefficiencies and\nsuboptimal outcomes. To address these limitations, we present DeepMMSearch-R1,\nthe first multimodal LLM capable of performing on-demand, multi-turn web\nsearches and dynamically crafting queries for both image and text search tools.\nSpecifically, DeepMMSearch-R1 can initiate web searches based on relevant crops\nof the input image making the image search more effective, and can iteratively\nadapt text search queries based on retrieved information, thereby enabling\nself-reflection and self-correction. Our approach relies on a two-stage\ntraining pipeline: a cold start supervised finetuning phase followed by an\nonline reinforcement learning optimization. For training, we introduce\nDeepMMSearchVQA, a novel multimodal VQA dataset created through an automated\npipeline intermixed with real-world information from web search tools. This\ndataset contains diverse, multi-hop queries that integrate textual and visual\ninformation, teaching the model when to search, what to search for, which\nsearch tool to use and how to reason over the retrieved information. We conduct\nextensive experiments across a range of knowledge-intensive benchmarks to\ndemonstrate the superiority of our approach. Finally, we analyze the results\nand provide insights that are valuable for advancing multimodal web-search.", "AI": {"tldr": "DeepMMSearch-R1 is a multimodal LLM that performs on-demand web searches using both image crops and text queries, with iterative query refinement through a two-stage training pipeline using a novel multimodal VQA dataset.", "motivation": "Existing MLLM approaches suffer from rigid pipelines, excessive search calls, and poorly constructed queries, leading to inefficiencies in handling information-seeking and knowledge-intensive queries in dynamic real-world environments.", "method": "Two-stage training: supervised finetuning followed by online reinforcement learning, using DeepMMSearchVQA dataset with multi-hop queries that teach when/what/how to search and reason over retrieved information.", "result": "Extensive experiments show superiority across knowledge-intensive benchmarks, with capabilities for effective image search using relevant crops and iterative text query adaptation.", "conclusion": "The approach provides valuable insights for advancing multimodal web-search, enabling self-reflection and self-correction through dynamic query crafting and multi-turn search capabilities."}}
