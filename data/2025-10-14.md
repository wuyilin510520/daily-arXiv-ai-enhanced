*Khartik Uppalapati,Bora Yimenicioglu,Shakeel Abdulkareem,Adan Eftekhari,Bhavya Uppalapati,Viraj Kamath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TinyViT-Batten is a few-shot Vision Transformer framework that detects early Batten disease from pediatric brain MRI with high accuracy using limited training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early MRI signs of Batten disease are subtle and often missed, creating a need for automated detection methods that work with limited training cases.

Method: Distill a large teacher ViT into a 5M-parameter TinyViT and fine-tune using metric-based few-shot learning with prototypical loss and 5-shot episodes.

Result: Achieves ~91% accuracy and AUC ≥0.95 on multi-site dataset of 79 Batten disease MRIs and 90 controls, outperforming 3D-ResNet and Swin-Tiny baselines. Sensitivity >90%, specificity ~90%.

Conclusion: The model's small size and strong performance demonstrate a practical AI solution for early Batten disease detection, with explainable predictions via Grad-CAM.

Abstract: Batten disease (neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis) is a rare pediatric
neurodegenerative disorder whose early MRI signs are subtle and often missed.
We propose TinyViT-Batten, a few-shot Vision Transformer (ViT) framework to
detect early Batten disease from pediatric brain MRI with limited training
cases. We distill a large teacher ViT into a 5 M-parameter TinyViT and
fine-tune it using metric-based few-shot learning (prototypical loss with
5-shot episodes). Our model achieves high accuracy (approximately 91%) and area
under ROC of at least 0.95 on a multi-site dataset of 79 genetically confirmed
Batten-disease MRIs (27 CLN3 from the Hochstein natural-history study, 32 CLN2
from an international longitudinal cohort, 12 early-manifestation CLN2 cases
reported by Cokal et al., and 8 public Radiopaedia scans) together with 90
age-matched controls, outperforming a 3D-ResNet and Swin-Tiny baseline. We
further integrate Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to
highlight disease-relevant brain regions, enabling explainable predictions. The
model's small size and strong performance (sensitivity greater than 90%,
specificity approximately 90%) demonstrates a practical AI solution for early
Batten disease detection.

*Zeshan Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TreeNet is a novel layered decision ensemble learning method for medical image analysis that combines neural networks, ensemble learning, and tree-based models to address data scarcity challenges while maintaining high performance and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image analysis faces challenges with limited data availability and data confidence, while existing methods like Neural Networks, Decision Trees, and Ensemble Learning require substantial data volumes for optimal performance.

Method: TreeNet integrates pivotal features from neural networks, ensemble learning, and tree-based decision models into a layered decision ensemble learning methodology, designed specifically for medical image analysis with limited data.

Result: Achieved F1-score of 0.85 with full training data and 0.77 with 50% training data (only 0.08 reduction), with 32 FPS performance suitable for real-time applications.

Conclusion: TreeNet demonstrates efficiency and usability in medical image analysis, particularly for real-time applications, offering superior performance, adaptability, and interpretability even with limited data.

Abstract: Within the domain of medical image analysis, three distinct methodologies
have demonstrated commendable accuracy: Neural Networks, Decision Trees, and
Ensemble-Based Learning Algorithms, particularly in the specialized context of
genstro institutional track abnormalities detection. These approaches exhibit
efficacy in disease detection scenarios where a substantial volume of data is
available. However, the prevalent challenge in medical image analysis pertains
to limited data availability and data confidence. This paper introduces
TreeNet, a novel layered decision ensemble learning methodology tailored for
medical image analysis. Constructed by integrating pivotal features from neural
networks, ensemble learning, and tree-based decision models, TreeNet emerges as
a potent and adaptable model capable of delivering superior performance across
diverse and intricate machine learning tasks. Furthermore, its interpretability
and insightful decision-making process enhance its applicability in complex
medical scenarios. Evaluation of the proposed approach encompasses key metrics
including Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and training and evaluation time. The
methodology resulted in an F1-score of up to 0.85 when using the complete
training data, with an F1-score of 0.77 when utilizing 50\% of the training
data. This shows a reduction of F1-score of 0.08 while in the reduction of 50\%
of the training data and training time. The evaluation of the methodology
resulted in the 32 Frame per Second which is usable for the realtime
applications. This comprehensive assessment underscores the efficiency and
usability of TreeNet in the demanding landscape of medical image analysis
specially in the realtime analysis.

### [4] [OmniSAT: Compact Action Token, Faster Auto Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09667)
*Huaihai Lyu,Chaofan Chen,Senwei Xie,Pengwei Wang,Xiansheng Chen,Shanghang Zhang,Changsheng Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Omni Swift Action Tokenizer (OmniSAT), a method for learning compact, transferable action representations that significantly compress action sequences while maintaining reconstruction quality, enabling faster auto-regressive training convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing auto-regressive VLA models face efficiency issues with extended high-dimensional action sequences. Prior compression methods struggled with poor reconstruction or inefficient compression, motivating the development of a better action tokenization approach.

Method: OmniSAT uses B-Spline encoding for consistent representation, then applies multi-stage residual quantization to position, rotation, and gripper subspaces to produce compressed discrete tokens with coarse-to-fine granularity. A cross-embodiment learning strategy leverages both robot and human demonstrations.

Result: The tokenization shortens training sequences by 6.8× and lowers target entropy. It achieves higher compression while preserving reconstruction quality, enabling faster AR training convergence and improved model performance across diverse real-robot and simulation experiments.

Conclusion: OmniSAT provides an efficient and effective action tokenization method that overcomes limitations of prior approaches, enabling scalable VLA model training with better compression and performance.

Abstract: Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models can be broadly categorized into
diffusion-based and auto-regressive (AR) approaches: diffusion models capture
continuous action distributions but rely on computationally heavy iterative
denoising. In contrast, AR models enable efficient optimization and flexible
sequence construction, making them better suited for large-scale pretraining.
To further improve AR efficiency, particularly when action chunks induce
extended and high-dimensional sequences, prior work applies entropy-guided and
token-frequency techniques to shorten the sequence length. However, such
compression struggled with \textit{poor reconstruction or inefficient
compression}. Motivated by this, we introduce an Omni Swift Action Tokenizer,
which learns a compact, transferable action representation. Specifically, we
first normalize value ranges and temporal horizons to obtain a consistent
representation with B-Spline encoding. Then, we apply multi-stage residual
quantization to the position, rotation, and gripper subspaces, producing
compressed discrete tokens with coarse-to-fine granularity for each part. After
pre-training on the large-scale dataset Droid, the resulting discrete
tokenization shortens the training sequence by 6.8$\times$, and lowers the
target entropy. To further explore the potential of OmniSAT, we develop a
cross-embodiment learning strategy that builds on the unified action-pattern
space and jointly leverages robot and human demonstrations. It enables scalable
auxiliary supervision from heterogeneous egocentric videos. Across diverse
real-robot and simulation experiments, OmniSAT encompasses higher compression
while preserving reconstruction quality, enabling faster AR training
convergence and model performance.

### [5] [Knowledge-Aware Mamba for Joint Change Detection and Classification from MODIS Times Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09679)
*Zhengsen Xu,Yimin Zhu,Zack Dewis,Mabel Heffring,Motasem Alkayid,Saeid Taleghanidoozdoozan,Lincoln Linlin Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KAMamba is a novel knowledge-aware Mamba model for MODIS change detection that uses knowledge-driven transition matrices, multi-task learning, and specialized Mamba modules to address MODIS challenges like mixed pixels and information coupling, achieving 1.5-6% F1 improvements in change detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MODIS change detection faces challenges including mixed pixels, spatial-spectral-temporal information coupling effects, and background class heterogeneity, which limit detection accuracy.

Method: Proposes KAMamba with four key components: 1) knowledge-driven transition-matrix-guided approach with KAT-loss, 2) multi-task learning with PreC-loss, PostC-loss, and Chg-loss, 3) SSTMamba modules to disentangle information coupling, and 4) SDMamba backbone for efficiency.

Result: On Saskatchewan MODIS dataset: 1.5-6% gains in average F1 for change detection over baselines, and about 2% improvements in OA, AA, and Kappa for LULC classification.

Conclusion: KAMamba effectively addresses MODIS challenges through knowledge-aware design and specialized Mamba modules, demonstrating significant improvements in both change detection and land classification tasks.

Abstract: Although change detection using MODIS time series is critical for
environmental monitoring, it is a highly challenging task due to key MODIS
difficulties, e.g., mixed pixels, spatial-spectral-temporal information
coupling effect, and background class heterogeneity. This paper presents a
novel knowledge-aware Mamba (KAMamba) for enhanced MODIS change detection, with
the following contributions. First, to leverage knowledge regarding class
transitions, we design a novel knowledge-driven transition-matrix-guided
approach, leading to a knowledge-aware transition loss (KAT-loss) that can
enhance detection accuracies. Second, to improve model constraints, a
multi-task learning approach is designed, where three losses, i.e., pre-change
classification loss (PreC-loss), post-change classification loss (PostC-loss),
and change detection loss (Chg-loss) are used for improve model learning.
Third, to disentangle information coupling in MODIS time series, novel
spatial-spectral-temporal Mamba (SSTMamba) modules are designed. Last, to
improve Mamba model efficiency and remove computational cost, a sparse and
deformable Mamba (SDMamba) backbone is used in SSTMamba. On the MODIS
time-series dataset for Saskatchewan, Canada, we evaluate the method on
land-cover change detection and LULC classification; results show about 1.5-6%
gains in average F1 for change detection over baselines, and about 2%
improvements in OA, AA, and Kappa for LULC classification.

### [6] [NNDM: NN_UNet Diffusion Model for Brain Tumor Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09681)
*Sashank Makanaboyina*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NNDM combines NN-UNet with diffusion models to improve brain tumor segmentation in MRI by iteratively refining segmentation masks through denoising.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CNN models like U-Net struggle with generalization, boundary precision, and limited data diversity in brain tumor segmentation.

Method: Hybrid framework integrating NN-UNet's feature extraction with diffusion models that learn residual error distribution between predicted and ground-truth masks through iterative denoising.

Result: Superior performance on BraTS 2021 datasets with improvements in Dice coefficient and Hausdorff distance metrics, enhanced robustness across modalities and tumor subregions.

Conclusion: NNDM establishes a new direction for combining deterministic segmentation networks with stochastic diffusion models, advancing automated brain tumor analysis.

Abstract: Accurate detection and segmentation of brain tumors in magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) are critical for effective diagnosis and treatment planning.
Despite advances in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as U-Net,
existing models often struggle with generalization, boundary precision, and
limited data diversity. To address these challenges, we propose NNDM (NN\_UNet
Diffusion Model)a hybrid framework that integrates the robust feature
extraction of NN-UNet with the generative capabilities of diffusion
probabilistic models. In our approach, the diffusion model progressively
refines the segmentation masks generated by NN-UNet by learning the residual
error distribution between predicted and ground-truth masks. This iterative
denoising process enables the model to correct fine structural inconsistencies
and enhance tumor boundary delineation. Experiments conducted on the BraTS 2021
datasets demonstrate that NNDM achieves superior performance compared to
conventional U-Net and transformer-based baselines, yielding improvements in
Dice coefficient and Hausdorff distance metrics. Moreover, the diffusion-guided
refinement enhances robustness across modalities and tumor subregions. The
proposed NNDM establishes a new direction for combining deterministic
segmentation networks with stochastic diffusion models, advancing the state of
the art in automated brain tumor analysis.

### [7] [Adaptive Fusion Network with Temporal-Ranked and Motion-Intensity Dynamic Images for Micro-expression Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09730)
*Thi Bich Phuong Man,Luu Tu Nguyen,Vu Tram Anh Khuong,Thanh Ha Le,Thi Duyen Ngo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a novel micro-expression recognition method with two complementary representations (temporal-ranked and motion-intensity dynamic images) and an adaptive fusion network that achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Micro-expressions are subtle facial changes that reveal genuine emotions but are difficult to detect with the naked eye, making them valuable for lie detection, behavioral analysis, and psychological assessment.

Method: Uses two complementary representations: Temporal-ranked dynamic image (emphasizes temporal progression) and Motion-intensity dynamic image (highlights subtle motions through frame reordering). Combines them with an Adaptive fusion network that automatically learns optimal integration.

Result: Achieves 93.95% Accuracy and 0.897 UF1 on CASME-II (new SOTA), 82.47% Accuracy and 0.665 UF1 on SAMM, and 76.00% Accuracy on MMEW, demonstrating strong generalization across datasets.

Conclusion: Both the input representations and proposed architecture significantly improve micro-expression recognition performance, providing a solid foundation for applications in affective computing, lie detection, and human-computer interaction.

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are subtle, transient facial changes with very low
intensity, almost imperceptible to the naked eye, yet they reveal a person
genuine emotion. They are of great value in lie detection, behavioral analysis,
and psychological assessment. This paper proposes a novel MER method with two
main contributions. First, we propose two complementary representations -
Temporal-ranked dynamic image, which emphasizes temporal progression, and
Motion-intensity dynamic image, which highlights subtle motions through a frame
reordering mechanism incorporating motion intensity. Second, we propose an
Adaptive fusion network, which automatically learns to optimally integrate
these two representations, thereby enhancing discriminative ME features while
suppressing noise. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (CASME-II, SAMM and
MMEW) demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. Specifically, AFN
achieves 93.95 Accuracy and 0.897 UF1 on CASME-II, setting a new
state-of-the-art benchmark. On SAMM, the method attains 82.47 Accuracy and
0.665 UF1, demonstrating more balanced recognition across classes. On MMEW, the
model achieves 76.00 Accuracy, further confirming its generalization ability.
The obtained results show that both the input and the proposed architecture
play important roles in improving the performance of MER. Moreover, they
provide a solid foundation for further research and practical applications in
the fields of affective computing, lie detection, and human-computer
interaction.

*Muhammad Munsif,Waqas Ahmad,Amjid Ali,Mohib Ullah,Adnan Hussain,Sung Wook Baik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This survey provides the first comprehensive review of Connected Vision Systems (CVS) that unifies multi-view multi-camera tracking, re-identification, and action understanding into a single framework, addressing integration gaps in existing literature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing surveys focus on isolated tasks like tracking, Re-ID, and action understanding separately, neglecting their integration into cohesive systems and overlooking multi-camera collaboration complexities. There's a need for unified understanding of CVS in real-world dynamic environments.

Method: Proposes a unique taxonomy dividing CVS into four key components: MVMC tracking, Re-ID, action understanding, and combined methods. Systematically organizes state-of-the-art datasets, methodologies, results, and evaluation metrics.

Result: Provides structured view of field progression and identifies open research questions, challenges, and emerging technologies like lifelong learning, privacy, and federated learning that need addressing.

Conclusion: Outlines key research directions for enhancing robustness, efficiency, and adaptability of CVS in complex real-world applications, aiming to inspire innovative solutions and guide future research toward next-generation intelligent CVS.

Abstract: Connected Vision Systems (CVS) are transforming a variety of applications,
including autonomous vehicles, smart cities, surveillance, and human-robot
interaction. These systems harness multi-view multi-camera (MVMC) data to
provide enhanced situational awareness through the integration of MVMC
tracking, re-identification (Re-ID), and action understanding (AU). However,
deploying CVS in real-world, dynamic environments presents a number of
challenges, particularly in addressing occlusions, diverse viewpoints, and
environmental variability. Existing surveys have focused primarily on isolated
tasks such as tracking, Re-ID, and AU, often neglecting their integration into
a cohesive system. These reviews typically emphasize single-view setups,
overlooking the complexities and opportunities provided by multi-camera
collaboration and multi-view data analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this
survey is the first to offer a comprehensive and integrated review of MVMC that
unifies MVMC tracking, Re-ID, and AU into a single framework. We propose a
unique taxonomy to better understand the critical components of CVS, dividing
it into four key parts: MVMC tracking, Re-ID, AU, and combined methods. We
systematically arrange and summarize the state-of-the-art datasets,
methodologies, results, and evaluation metrics, providing a structured view of
the field's progression. Furthermore, we identify and discuss the open research
questions and challenges, along with emerging technologies such as lifelong
learning, privacy, and federated learning, that need to be addressed for future
advancements. The paper concludes by outlining key research directions for
enhancing the robustness, efficiency, and adaptability of CVS in complex,
real-world applications. We hope this survey will inspire innovative solutions
and guide future research toward the next generation of intelligent and
adaptive CVS.

### [9] [Constructive Distortion: Improving MLLMs with Attention-Guided Image Warping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09741)
*Dwip Dalal,Gautam Vashishtha,Utkarsh Mishra,Jeonghwan Kim,Madhav Kanda,Hyeonjeong Ha,Svetlana Lazebnik,Heng Ji,Unnat Jain*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AttWarp is a lightweight method that uses MLLM's cross-modal attention to warp input images, reallocating resolution to query-relevant regions while preserving global context, improving accuracy and reducing hallucinations across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs often miss small details and spatial relations in cluttered scenes, leading to errors in fine-grained perceptual grounding.

Method: Uses MLLM's cross-modal attention to perform rectilinear warping of input images, reallocating spatial resolution toward important regions without changing model weights or architecture.

Result: Consistently improves accuracy across five benchmarks (TextVQA, GQA, DocVQA, POPE, MMMU) and four MLLMs, strengthens compositional reasoning, reduces hallucinations, and outperforms four competitive baselines.

Conclusion: Attention-guided warping effectively prioritizes query-relevant information while preserving context, and MLLMs perform better when given such warped inputs.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often miss small details and spatial
relations in cluttered scenes, leading to errors in fine-grained perceptual
grounding. We introduce AttWarp, a lightweight method that allocates more
resolution to query-relevant content while compressing less informative areas,
all while preserving global context. At test time, the approach uses an MLLM's
cross-modal attention to perform rectilinear warping of the input image,
reallocating spatial resolution toward regions the model deems important,
without changing model weights or architecture. This attention-guided warping
preserves all original image information but redistributes it non-uniformly, so
small objects and subtle relationships become easier for the same model to read
while the global layout remains intact. Across five benchmarks (TextVQA, GQA,
DocVQA, POPE, MMMU) and four MLLMs (LLaVA, Qwen-VL, InternVL, and
InstructBLIP), AttWarp consistently improves accuracy, strengthens
compositional reasoning, and reduces hallucinations, outperforming four
competitive baselines that manipulate raw images at test time. Together, these
results show that attention-guided warping prioritizes information relevant to
the query while preserving context, and that the same MLLMs perform better when
given such warped inputs.

*Yufei Wang,Adriana Kovashka,Loretta Fernández,Marc N. Coutanche,Seth Wiener*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Study examines how learners infer unfamiliar words using multimodal context (images + sentences), analyzing features that aid learning and AI's ability to predict success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how multimodal contexts help foreign language learners infer word meanings and identify predictive features for success.

Method: Conducted studies with human participants using image-text pairs, analyzed data features and participant language backgrounds.

Result: Only some intuitive features strongly correlate with performance; AI shows potential but needs improvement in predicting success.

Conclusion: Need further investigation of predictive features and improvement in AI reasoning for multimodal language learning tasks.

Abstract: We investigate a new setting for foreign language learning, where learners
infer the meaning of unfamiliar words in a multimodal context of a sentence
describing a paired image. We conduct studies with human participants using
different image-text pairs. We analyze the features of the data (i.e., images
and texts) that make it easier for participants to infer the meaning of a
masked or unfamiliar word, and what language backgrounds of the participants
correlate with success. We find only some intuitive features have strong
correlations with participant performance, prompting the need for further
investigating of predictive features for success in these tasks. We also
analyze the ability of AI systems to reason about participant performance, and
discover promising future directions for improving this reasoning ability.

### [11] [Task-Aware Resolution Optimization for Visual Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09822)
*Weiqing Luo,Zhen Tan,Yifan Li,Xinyu Zhao,Kwonjoon Lee,Behzad Dariush,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to determine optimal image resolution for vision-language tasks and extends VLLMs to handle varying resolutions efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLLMs use fixed image resolutions, which leads to suboptimal performance across different vision-language tasks that require varying perceptual granularity.

Method: 1) Investigated resolution preferences correlated with image complexity and VLLM uncertainty variance; 2) Proposed empirical formula for optimal resolution; 3) Developed parameter-efficient fine-tuning to extend VLLMs to optimal resolutions.

Result: Extensive experiments on various vision-language tasks validated the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving performance.

Conclusion: The approach successfully addresses resolution limitations in VLLMs by providing task-specific optimal resolutions and efficient adaptation methods.

Abstract: Real-world vision-language applications demand varying levels of perceptual
granularity. However, most existing visual large language models (VLLMs), such
as LLaVA, pre-assume a fixed resolution for downstream tasks, which leads to
subpar performance. To address this problem, we first conduct a comprehensive
and pioneering investigation into the resolution preferences of different
vision-language tasks, revealing a correlation between resolution preferences
with image complexity, and uncertainty variance of the VLLM at different image
input resolutions. Building on this insight, we propose an empirical formula to
determine the optimal resolution for a given vision-language task, combining
these two factors. Second, based on rigorous experiments, we propose a novel
parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique to extend the visual input resolution
of pre-trained VLLMs to the identified optimal resolution. Extensive
experiments on various vision-language tasks validate the effectiveness of our
method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Satellite image segmentation often produces unclear results due to low-quality features, requiring better CRF models to achieve improved clarity.

Method: Tested various CRF types on two datasets: low-quality satellite imagery and high-quality aerial photographs, comparing their performance.

Result: Identified which CRF models work best for different image types, revealing both pitfalls and potentials of various approaches.

Conclusion: Different CRF models have varying effectiveness depending on image quality, with some performing better on low-quality satellite images than others.

Abstract: The output of image the segmentation process is usually not very clear due to
low quality features of Satellite images. The purpose of this study is to find
a suitable Conditional Random Field (CRF) to achieve better clarity in a
segmented image. We started with different types of CRFs and studied them as to
why they are or are not suitable for our purpose. We evaluated our approach on
two different datasets - Satellite imagery having low quality features and high
quality Aerial photographs. During the study we experimented with various CRFs
to find which CRF gives the best results on images and compared our results on
these datasets to show the pitfalls and potentials of different approaches.

### [13] [Exploration of Incremental Synthetic Non-Morphed Images for Single Morphing Attack Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09836)
*David Benavente-Rios,Juan Ruiz Rodriguez,Gustavo Gatica*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Using synthetic face data can improve Single-Morphing Attack Detection (S-MAD) when carefully incorporated, but indiscriminate use or relying solely on synthetic data leads to sub-optimal performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of large-scale bona fide image datasets due to privacy concerns by exploring synthetic face data for S-MAD enhancement.

Method: Used various morphing tools and cross-dataset evaluation schemes with incremental testing protocol to assess generalization as synthetic images are added.

Result: Generalization improves with controlled synthetic image incorporation or gradual bona fide image addition during training, but synthetic-only approach achieves highest EER.

Conclusion: Synthetic data can enhance S-MAD when used carefully, but operational scenarios should not rely solely on synthetic data due to sub-optimal performance.

Abstract: This paper investigates the use of synthetic face data to enhance
Single-Morphing Attack Detection (S-MAD), addressing the limitations of
availability of large-scale datasets of bona fide images due to privacy
concerns. Various morphing tools and cross-dataset evaluation schemes were
utilized to conduct this study. An incremental testing protocol was implemented
to assess the generalization capabilities as more and more synthetic images
were added. The results of the experiments show that generalization can be
improved by carefully incorporating a controlled number of synthetic images
into existing datasets or by gradually adding bona fide images during training.
However, indiscriminate use of synthetic data can lead to sub-optimal
performance. Evenmore, the use of only synthetic data (morphed and non-morphed
images) achieves the highest Equal Error Rate (EER), which means in operational
scenarios the best option is not relying only on synthetic data for S-MAD.

### [14] [Cell Instance Segmentation: The Devil Is in the Boundaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09848)
*Peixian Liang,Yifan Ding,Yizhe Zhang,Jianxu Chen,Hao Zheng,Hongxiao Wang,Yejia Zhang,Guangyu Meng,Tim Weninger,Michael Niemier,X. Sharon Hu,Danny Z Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ceb is a novel pixel clustering method for cell instance segmentation that leverages boundary features instead of pixel-wise objectives, achieving competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for cell instance segmentation use pixel-wise objectives that lose important geometric properties like shape and curvature, requiring a new approach that preserves these features.

Method: Ceb extracts potential foreground-foreground boundaries using revised Watershed algorithm, constructs boundary signatures by sampling pixels from boundaries, uses a boundary classifier to predict boundary labels, and then divides/merges regions based on predicted labels.

Result: Extensive experiments on six datasets show Ceb outperforms existing pixel clustering methods on semantic segmentation probability maps and achieves highly competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art cell instance segmentation methods.

Conclusion: Ceb effectively addresses the limitations of pixel-wise objectives by leveraging boundary features, providing a robust method for cell instance segmentation that preserves geometric properties.

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for cell instance segmentation are based on
deep learning (DL) semantic segmentation approaches, focusing on distinguishing
foreground pixels from background pixels. In order to identify cell instances
from foreground pixels (e.g., pixel clustering), most methods decompose
instance information into pixel-wise objectives, such as distances to
foreground-background boundaries (distance maps), heat gradients with the
center point as heat source (heat diffusion maps), and distances from the
center point to foreground-background boundaries with fixed angles (star-shaped
polygons). However, pixel-wise objectives may lose significant geometric
properties of the cell instances, such as shape, curvature, and convexity,
which require a collection of pixels to represent. To address this challenge,
we present a novel pixel clustering method, called Ceb (for Cell boundaries),
to leverage cell boundary features and labels to divide foreground pixels into
cell instances. Starting with probability maps generated from semantic
segmentation, Ceb first extracts potential foreground-foreground boundaries
with a revised Watershed algorithm. For each boundary candidate, a boundary
feature representation (called boundary signature) is constructed by sampling
pixels from the current foreground-foreground boundary as well as the
neighboring background-foreground boundaries. Next, a boundary classifier is
used to predict its binary boundary label based on the corresponding boundary
signature. Finally, cell instances are obtained by dividing or merging
neighboring regions based on the predicted boundary labels. Extensive
experiments on six datasets demonstrate that Ceb outperforms existing pixel
clustering methods on semantic segmentation probability maps. Moreover, Ceb
achieves highly competitive performance compared to SOTA cell instance
segmentation methods.

### [15] [Cluster-Aware Prompt Ensemble Learning for Few-Shot Vision-Language Model Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09867)
*Zhi Chen,Xin Yu,Xiaohui Tao,Yan Li,Zi Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAPEL is a cluster-aware prompt ensemble framework that addresses limitations of conventional prompt ensembling by preserving cluster nature of context prompts and performing ensembling in logits space rather than feature space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional prompt ensembling that averages textual features often yields suboptimal results because feature averaging shifts class centroids away from true class distribution, failing to preserve the cluster nature of context prompts.

Method: CAPEL classifies images into class clusters with distinct prompts, performs ensembling in classification logits space, uses cluster-preserving regularization to maintain prompt distinctiveness, and employs adaptive prompt weighting to handle flawed/ambiguous prompts.

Result: The framework aligns better with visual feature distribution and ensures robust performance across diverse datasets and tasks by maintaining cluster-specific discriminative power.

Conclusion: CAPEL provides an effective solution for prompt ensembling in vision-language models by preserving cluster structure and optimizing through logits-space ensembling with regularization and adaptive weighting.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP achieve zero-shot transfer across
various tasks by pre-training on numerous image-text pairs. These models often
benefit from using an ensemble of context prompts to represent a class. Despite
being effective, conventional prompt ensembling that averages textual features
of context prompts often yields suboptimal results. This is because feature
averaging shifts the class centroids away from the true class distribution. To
address this issue, we propose the Cluster-Aware Prompt Ensemble Learning
(CAPEL) framework, which preserves the cluster nature of context prompts. CAPEL
classifies images into one of several class clusters, each represented by a
distinct prompt. Instead of ensembling prompts in the feature space, we perform
ensembling in the classification logits space, aligning better with the visual
feature distribution. To further optimize prompt fine-tuning while maintaining
cluster-specific discriminative power, we introduce a cluster-preserving
regularization term. This ensures that prompts remain distinct and specialized
for different clusters, preventing collapse into a uniform direction.
Additionally, we integrate an adaptive prompt weighting technique to
dynamically adjust the attention weights for flawed or ambiguous prompts,
ensuring robust performance across diverse datasets and tasks.

### [16] [Fast Self-Supervised depth and mask aware Association for Multi-Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09878)
*Milad Khanchi,Maria Amer,Charalambos Poullis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-object tracking method that uses depth and mask features with a self-supervised encoder instead of computing segmentation IoU, achieving state-of-the-art performance on challenging benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MOT methods rely on IoU for association, which becomes unreliable with similar or occluded objects, and computing segmentation IoU is computationally expensive.

Method: Fuse depth and mask features through a compact self-supervised encoder to produce stable object representations, using them alongside bounding box IoU and re-identification features for matching. Depth maps from zero-shot depth estimator and object masks from promptable visual segmentation model provide fine-grained spatial cues.

Result: Outperforms TBD state-of-the-art on most metrics in challenging benchmarks with non-linear motion, occlusion, and crowded scenes (SportsMOT, DanceTrack), while achieving competitive performance on simpler benchmarks with linear motion (MOT17).

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses limitations of IoU-based association by using depth and mask features with self-supervised encoding, providing more reliable tracking in complex scenarios without expensive segmentation IoU computations.

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) methods often rely on Intersection-over-Union
(IoU) for association. However, this becomes unreliable when objects are
similar or occluded. Also, computing IoU for segmentation masks is
computationally expensive. In this work, we use segmentation masks to capture
object shapes, but we do not compute segmentation IoU. Instead, we fuse depth
and mask features and pass them through a compact encoder trained
self-supervised. This encoder produces stable object representations, which we
use as an additional similarity cue alongside bounding box IoU and
re-identification features for matching. We obtain depth maps from a zero-shot
depth estimator and object masks from a promptable visual segmentation model to
obtain fine-grained spatial cues. Our MOT method is the first to use the
self-supervised encoder to refine segmentation masks without computing masks
IoU. MOT can be divided into joint detection-ReID (JDR) and
tracking-by-detection (TBD) models. The latter are computationally more
efficient. Experiments of our TBD method on challenging benchmarks with
non-linear motion, occlusion, and crowded scenes, such as SportsMOT and
DanceTrack, show that our method outperforms the TBD state-of-the-art on most
metrics, while achieving competitive performance on simpler benchmarks with
linear motion, such as MOT17.

Motivation: Existing HDR-VQA datasets primarily focus on professionally generated content, leaving a gap in understanding real-world UGC-HDR degradations from diverse capture conditions, editing artifacts, and compression distortions.

Method: Created CHUG dataset with 856 UGC-HDR source videos transcoded across multiple resolutions and bitrates (totaling 5,992 videos), and conducted large-scale subjective study via Amazon Mechanical Turk collecting 211,848 perceptual ratings.

Conclusion: CHUG will advance No-Reference HDR-VQA research by offering the first comprehensive dataset for user-generated HDR video quality assessment.

Abstract: High Dynamic Range (HDR) videos enhance visual experiences with superior
brightness, contrast, and color depth. The surge of User-Generated Content
(UGC) on platforms like YouTube and TikTok introduces unique challenges for HDR
video quality assessment (VQA) due to diverse capture conditions, editing
artifacts, and compression distortions. Existing HDR-VQA datasets primarily
focus on professionally generated content (PGC), leaving a gap in understanding
real-world UGC-HDR degradations. To address this, we introduce CHUG:

*Minkwan Kim,Changwoon Choi,Young Min Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Scene-adaptive strategies for efficient representation capacity allocation in indoor environment generation from incomplete observations, using geometric priors and optimal basis placement to improve upon uniform NeRF arrangements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Indoor scenes with multiple rooms have irregular layouts with varying complexity, clutter, occlusion, and flat walls, requiring efficient resource utilization for immersive experiences from incomplete observations.

Method: Use geometric priors from pre-processing to guide optimal basis placement on estimated geometric scaffold, and employ scene-adaptive virtual viewpoints to compensate for geometric deficiencies in input trajectory.

Result: Significant enhancements in rendering quality and memory requirements compared to baselines with regular placements, demonstrated through comprehensive analysis in large-scale indoor scenes.

Conclusion: Scene-adaptive strategies with geometric guidance and optimal basis placement substantially improve efficiency and quality of indoor scene generation from incomplete observations.

Abstract: We propose scene-adaptive strategies to efficiently allocate representation
capacity for generating immersive experiences of indoor environments from
incomplete observations. Indoor scenes with multiple rooms often exhibit
irregular layouts with varying complexity, containing clutter, occlusion, and
flat walls. We maximize the utilization of limited resources with guidance from
geometric priors, which are often readily available after pre-processing
stages. We record observation statistics on the estimated geometric scaffold
and guide the optimal placement of bases, which greatly improves upon the
uniform basis arrangements adopted by previous scalable Neural Radiance Field
(NeRF) representations. We also suggest scene-adaptive virtual viewpoints to
compensate for geometric deficiencies inherent in view configurations in the
input trajectory and impose the necessary regularization. We present a
comprehensive analysis and discussion regarding rendering quality and memory
requirements in several large-scale indoor scenes, demonstrating significant
enhancements compared to baselines that employ regular placements.

### [19] [LTGS: Long-Term Gaussian Scene Chronology From Sparse View Updates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09881)
*Minkwan Kim,Seungmin Lee,Junho Kim,Young Min Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LTGS is a novel scene representation that models long-term scene changes from sparse casual captures using Gaussian splatting with object templates and temporal refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current novel-view synthesis struggles with everyday environments due to frequent scene changes that require dense spatial and temporal observations, which are impractical for casual captures.

Method: Uses Gaussian splatting with object templates as structural priors, followed by refinement pipeline that adapts templates to temporal variations using few-shot observations. Enables generalization across time steps through simple transformations.

Result: Achieves superior reconstruction quality compared to baselines while enabling fast and lightweight updates. Validated on real-world datasets collected specifically for long-term sparse capture evaluation.

Conclusion: LTGS provides an efficient and scalable solution for modeling long-term scene chronology from highly under-constrained casual captures, significantly enhancing temporal 3D environment evolution.

Abstract: Recent advances in novel-view synthesis can create the photo-realistic
visualization of real-world environments from conventional camera captures.
However, acquiring everyday environments from casual captures faces challenges
due to frequent scene changes, which require dense observations both spatially
and temporally. We propose long-term Gaussian scene chronology from sparse-view
updates, coined LTGS, an efficient scene representation that can embrace
everyday changes from highly under-constrained casual captures. Given an
incomplete and unstructured Gaussian splatting representation obtained from an
initial set of input images, we robustly model the long-term chronology of the
scene despite abrupt movements and subtle environmental variations. We
construct objects as template Gaussians, which serve as structural, reusable
priors for shared object tracks. Then, the object templates undergo a further
refinement pipeline that modulates the priors to adapt to temporally varying
environments based on few-shot observations. Once trained, our framework is
generalizable across multiple time steps through simple transformations,
significantly enhancing the scalability for a temporal evolution of 3D
environments. As existing datasets do not explicitly represent the long-term
real-world changes with a sparse capture setup, we collect real-world datasets
to evaluate the practicality of our pipeline. Experiments demonstrate that our
framework achieves superior reconstruction quality compared to other baselines
while enabling fast and light-weight updates.

*Lenny Aharon,Keemin Lee,Karan Sikka,Selmaan Chettih,Cole Hurwitz,Liam Paninski,Matthew R Whiteway*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A comprehensive framework for multi-view animal pose estimation that combines novel training techniques, post-processing methods, and model distillation to achieve accurate tracking with limited labeled data and improved uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-view pose estimation methods struggle with limited labeled data and poor uncertainty estimates, which hinders reliable animal behavior quantification in scientific research.

Method: Developed multi-view transformer (MVT) with pretrained backbones, patch masking for cross-view correspondence without calibration, geometric consistency for calibrated setups, extended Ensemble Kalman Smoother (EKS) for nonlinear cases, variance inflation for uncertainty, and distillation using EKS predictions for pseudo-labels.

Result: Framework components consistently outperform existing methods across three animal species (flies, mice, chickadees), with each component providing complementary benefits for reliable pose estimation.

Conclusion: The framework provides a practical, uncertainty-aware system for reliable pose estimation that enables downstream behavioral analyses under real-world data constraints, reducing dependence on manual labels.

Abstract: Multi-view pose estimation is essential for quantifying animal behavior in
scientific research, yet current methods struggle to achieve accurate tracking
with limited labeled data and suffer from poor uncertainty estimates. We
address these challenges with a comprehensive framework combining novel
training and post-processing techniques, and a model distillation procedure
that leverages the strengths of these techniques to produce a more efficient
and effective pose estimator. Our multi-view transformer (MVT) utilizes
pretrained backbones and enables simultaneous processing of information across
all views, while a novel patch masking scheme learns robust cross-view
correspondences without camera calibration. For calibrated setups, we
incorporate geometric consistency through 3D augmentation and a triangulation
loss. We extend the existing Ensemble Kalman Smoother (EKS) post-processor to
the nonlinear case and enhance uncertainty quantification via a variance
inflation technique. Finally, to leverage the scaling properties of the MVT, we
design a distillation procedure that exploits improved EKS predictions and
uncertainty estimates to generate high-quality pseudo-labels, thereby reducing
dependence on manual labels. Our framework components consistently outperform
existing methods across three diverse animal species (flies, mice, chickadees),
with each component contributing complementary benefits. The result is a
practical, uncertainty-aware system for reliable pose estimation that enables
downstream behavioral analyses under real-world data constraints.

TL;DR: Developed a deep learning architecture integrating hyperspectral imaging into UAV perception using a modified Mobile 3D Vision Transformer with SpectralCA block for improved navigation, object detection, and terrain classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing demand for UAVs capable of operating in complex environments where conventional navigation fails due to interference, poor visibility, or camouflage. Hyperspectral imaging enables fine-grained material recognition critical for navigation, surveillance, agriculture, and environmental monitoring.

Method: Modified Mobile 3D Vision Transformer (MDvT) by introducing SpectralCA block that uses bi-directional cross-attention to fuse spectral and spatial features, reducing parameters and inference time while enhancing accuracy.

Result: Experimental evaluation on WHU-Hi-HongHu dataset showed improved UAV perception efficiency with real-time operation capabilities for navigation, object recognition, and environmental monitoring tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture successfully integrates hyperspectral imaging into UAV perception systems, enabling reliable operation in complex environments through enhanced spectral-spatial feature fusion.

Abstract: The relevance of this research lies in the growing demand for unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs) capable of operating reliably in complex environments where
conventional navigation becomes unreliable due to interference, poor
visibility, or camouflage. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides unique
opportunities for UAV-based computer vision by enabling fine-grained material
recognition and object differentiation, which are critical for navigation,
surveillance, agriculture, and environmental monitoring. The aim of this work
is to develop a deep learning architecture integrating HSI into UAV perception
for navigation, object detection, and terrain classification. Objectives
include: reviewing existing HSI methods, designing a hybrid 2D/3D convolutional
architecture with spectral-spatial cross-attention, training, and benchmarking.
The methodology is based on the modification of the Mobile 3D Vision
Transformer (MDvT) by introducing the proposed SpectralCA block. This block
employs bi-directional cross-attention to fuse spectral and spatial features,
enhancing accuracy while reducing parameters and inference time. Experimental
evaluation was conducted on the WHU-Hi-HongHu dataset, with results assessed
using Overall Accuracy, Average Accuracy, and the Kappa coefficient. The
findings confirm that the proposed architecture improves UAV perception
efficiency, enabling real-time operation for navigation, object recognition,
and environmental monitoring tasks.

### [22] [HeadsUp! High-Fidelity Portrait Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09924)
*Renjie Li,Zihao Zhu,Xiaoyu Wang,Zhengzhong Tu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HeadsUp is a single-step diffusion model for portrait image super-resolution that handles both faces and backgrounds seamlessly in one step, eliminating blending artifacts from traditional multi-model approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ISR techniques either focus on generic images or aligned faces separately, requiring blending approaches that introduce boundary artifacts around facial regions, which is problematic since human perception is sensitive to facial fidelity.

Method: Built on a single-step diffusion model with face supervision mechanism to focus on facial regions, integrated reference-based mechanism for identity restoration, and trained on a new PortraitSR-4K dataset of high-quality 4K portrait images.

Result: HeadsUp achieves state-of-the-art performance on portrait image super-resolution while maintaining comparable or higher performance on both general image and aligned face datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed single-step approach effectively handles portrait image super-resolution without blending artifacts, demonstrating superior performance across different image types.

Abstract: Portrait pictures, which typically feature both human subjects and natural
backgrounds, are one of the most prevalent forms of photography on social
media. Existing image super-resolution (ISR) techniques generally focus either
on generic real-world images or strictly aligned facial images (i.e., face
super-resolution). In practice, separate models are blended to handle portrait
photos: the face specialist model handles the face region, and the general
model processes the rest. However, these blending approaches inevitably
introduce blending or boundary artifacts around the facial regions due to
different model training recipes, while human perception is particularly
sensitive to facial fidelity. To overcome these limitations, we study the
portrait image supersolution (PortraitISR) problem, and propose HeadsUp, a
single-step diffusion model that is capable of seamlessly restoring and
upscaling portrait images in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, we build our
model on top of a single-step diffusion model and develop a face supervision
mechanism to guide the model in focusing on the facial region. We then
integrate a reference-based mechanism to help with identity restoration,
reducing face ambiguity in low-quality face restoration. Additionally, we have
built a high-quality 4K portrait image ISR dataset dubbed PortraitSR-4K, to
support model training and benchmarking for portrait images. Extensive
experiments show that HeadsUp achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
PortraitISR task while maintaining comparable or higher performance on both
general image and aligned face datasets.

### [23] [Denoising Diffusion as a New Framework for Underwater Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09934)
*Nilesh Jain,Elie Alhajjar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using denoising diffusion models to expand underwater image datasets with diverse image types (stereo, wide-angled, macro, close-up) and Controlnet to enhance image quality, addressing limitations in current underwater image enhancement research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater images are crucial for ocean research but suffer from poor quality due to complex environments. Existing image enhancement methods have limitations like poor generalization and reliance on limited datasets that lack diversity and contain mostly monocular images.

Method: Two-pronged approach: 1) Use denoising diffusion models to expand datasets with diverse image types (stereo, wide-angled, macro, close-up), 2) Apply Controlnet to enhance image quality and evaluate dataset quality.

Result: Not specified in the abstract - this appears to be a proposed methodology rather than completed research with reported results.

Conclusion: The proposed approach aims to overcome current limitations in underwater image enhancement by diversifying datasets and improving image quality, ultimately benefiting marine ecosystem studies.

Abstract: Underwater images play a crucial role in ocean research and marine
environmental monitoring since they provide quality information about the
ecosystem. However, the complex and remote nature of the environment results in
poor image quality with issues such as low visibility, blurry textures, color
distortion, and noise. In recent years, research in image enhancement has
proven to be effective but also presents its own limitations, like poor
generalization and heavy reliance on clean datasets. One of the challenges
herein is the lack of diversity and the low quality of images included in these
datasets. Also, most existing datasets consist only of monocular images, a fact
that limits the representation of different lighting conditions and angles. In
this paper, we propose a new plan of action to overcome these limitations. On
one hand, we call for expanding the datasets using a denoising diffusion model
to include a variety of image types such as stereo, wide-angled, macro, and
close-up images. On the other hand, we recommend enhancing the images using
Controlnet to evaluate and increase the quality of the corresponding datasets,
and hence improve the study of the marine ecosystem.

*Agampreet Aulakh,Nils D. Forkert,Matthias Wilms*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method using Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) to model brain aging trajectories from longitudinal MRI data, achieving 81.3% accuracy in classifying healthy vs dementia-like aging patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Longitudinal MRI data analysis is challenging due to discrete sampling patterns and spatial-temporal variations across individuals, which traditional deep learning methods struggle to handle for continuous biological processes.

Method: Developed a novel INR architecture that partially disentangles spatial and temporal parameters, creating continuous representations of brain aging trajectories from T1-weighted MRI data, with a framework operating directly on the INR parameter space for classification.

Result: In experiments with simulated data (450 subjects), the INR-based method achieved 81.3% accuracy for brain aging trajectory classification under irregular sampling conditions, outperforming a standard deep learning baseline (73.7%).

Conclusion: INRs provide an effective framework for modeling continuous brain aging trajectories from longitudinal neuroimaging data, handling irregular sampling patterns better than traditional deep learning approaches.

Abstract: The human brain undergoes dynamic, potentially pathology-driven, structural
changes throughout a lifespan. Longitudinal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
and other neuroimaging data are valuable for characterizing trajectories of
change associated with typical and atypical aging. However, the analysis of
such data is highly challenging given their discrete nature with different
spatial and temporal image sampling patterns within individuals and across
populations. This leads to computational problems for most traditional deep
learning methods that cannot represent the underlying continuous biological
process. To address these limitations, we present a new, fully data-driven
method for representing aging trajectories across the entire brain by modelling
subject-specific longitudinal T1-weighted MRI data as continuous functions
using Implicit Neural Representations (INRs). Therefore, we introduce a novel
INR architecture capable of partially disentangling spatial and temporal
trajectory parameters and design an efficient framework that directly operates
on the INRs' parameter space to classify brain aging trajectories. To evaluate
our method in a controlled data environment, we develop a biologically grounded
trajectory simulation and generate T1-weighted 3D MRI data for 450 healthy and
dementia-like subjects at regularly and irregularly sampled timepoints. In the
more realistic irregular sampling experiment, our INR-based method achieves
81.3% accuracy for the brain aging trajectory classification task,
outperforming a standard deep learning baseline model (73.7%).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Human-in-the-loop interactive framework for segmentation that uses targeted human corrections as interventional signals to steer models away from spurious correlations and toward robust features, improving accuracy and reducing annotation effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Segmentation models often fail in real-world domains by relying on spurious correlations rather than true object boundaries, leading to poor generalization.

Method: Interactive framework that treats human corrections as interventional signals, propagates correction-informed edits across visually similar images, and iteratively learns from human feedback to develop robust representations.

Result: Improves segmentation accuracy by up to 9 mIoU points (12-15% relative improvement) on challenging cubemap data, with 3-4x reductions in annotation effort compared to standard retraining while maintaining competitive benchmark performance.

Conclusion: Provides a practical framework for building accurate, robust, data-efficient segmentation systems that adapt well to real-world domains like urban climate monitoring and autonomous driving.

Abstract: Segmentation models achieve high accuracy on benchmarks but often fail in
real-world domains by relying on spurious correlations instead of true object
boundaries. We propose a human-in-the-loop interactive framework that enables
interventional learning through targeted human corrections of segmentation
outputs. Our approach treats human corrections as interventional signals that
show when reliance on superficial features (e.g., color or texture) is
inappropriate. The system learns from these interventions by propagating
correction-informed edits across visually similar images, effectively steering
the model toward robust, semantically meaningful features rather than
dataset-specific artifacts. Unlike traditional annotation approaches that
simply provide more training data, our method explicitly identifies when and
why the model fails and then systematically corrects these failure modes across
the entire dataset. Through iterative human feedback, the system develops
increasingly robust representations that generalize better to novel domains and
resist artifactual correlations. We demonstrate that our framework improves
segmentation accuracy by up to 9 mIoU points (12-15\% relative improvement) on
challenging cubemap data and yields 3-4$\times$ reductions in annotation effort
compared to standard retraining, while maintaining competitive performance on
benchmark datasets. This work provides a practical framework for researchers
and practitioners seeking to build segmentation systems that are accurate,
robust to dataset biases, data-efficient, and adaptable to real-world domains
such as urban climate monitoring and autonomous driving.

*Pan Wang,Yihao Hu,Xiaodong Bai,Aiping Yang,Xiangxiang Li,Meiping Ding,Jianguo Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-strategy framework for automated Shatian pomelo detection addresses challenges from imaging devices, lighting, scale variation, and occlusion using a multi-scenario dataset, data augmentation, and the REAS-Det network with specialized modules for improved detection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shatian pomelo requires automated detection for accurate quantity assessment and lean production, but existing methods degrade in real-world conditions due to imaging devices, lighting, scale variation, and occlusion challenges.

Method: Proposed multi-strategy framework includes: 1) STP-AgriData multi-scenario dataset combining real orchard and internet data, 2) Data augmentation for lighting variations, 3) REAS-Det network with RFAConv and C3RFEM modules for scale variation, and MultiSEAM with soft-NMS for occlusion handling.

Result: Achieved precision of 87.6%, recall of 74.9%, mAP@.50 of 82.8%, and mAP@.50:.95 of 53.3%, demonstrating superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art detection methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses key challenges in real-world Shatian pomelo detection through comprehensive dataset construction, targeted data augmentation, and specialized network design, achieving high detection accuracy suitable for commercial applications.

Abstract: As a specialty agricultural product with a large market scale, Shatian pomelo
necessitates the adoption of automated detection to ensure accurate quantity
and meet commercial demands for lean production. Existing research often
involves specialized networks tailored for specific theoretical or dataset
scenarios, but these methods tend to degrade performance in real-world. Through
analysis of factors in this issue, this study identifies four key challenges
that affect the accuracy of Shatian pomelo detection: imaging devices, lighting
conditions, object scale variation, and occlusion. To mitigate these
challenges, a multi-strategy framework is proposed in this paper. Firstly, to
effectively solve tone variation introduced by diverse imaging devices and
complex orchard environments, we utilize a multi-scenario dataset,
STP-AgriData, which is constructed by integrating real orchard images with
internet-sourced data. Secondly, to simulate the inconsistent illumination
conditions, specific data augmentations such as adjusting contrast and changing
brightness, are applied to the above dataset. Thirdly, to address the issues of
object scale variation and occlusion in fruit detection, an REAS-Det network is
designed in this paper. For scale variation, RFAConv and C3RFEM modules are
designed to expand and enhance the receptive fields. For occlusion variation, a
multi-scale, multi-head feature selection structure (MultiSEAM) and soft-NMS
are introduced to enhance the handling of occlusion issues to improve detection
accuracy. The results of these experiments achieved a precision(P) of 87.6%, a
recall (R) of 74.9%, a mAP@.50 of 82.8%, and a mAP@.50:.95 of 53.3%. Our
proposed network demonstrates superior performance compared to other
state-of-the-art detection methods.

### [27] [J-RAS: Enhancing Medical Image Segmentation via Retrieval-Augmented Joint Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09953)
*Salma J. Ahmed,Emad A. Mohammed,Azam Asilian Bidgoli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: J-RAS is a joint training method that combines segmentation and retrieval models to improve medical image segmentation by leveraging retrieved image-mask pairs for better anatomical understanding and boundary delineation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual medical image segmentation is time-consuming and variable, while AI methods require large annotated datasets and struggle with generalization across diverse imaging conditions and rare cases.

Method: Joint training of segmentation and retrieval models where both are optimized together - segmentation model uses retrieved image-mask pairs for anatomical context, while retrieval model learns segmentation-relevant features beyond visual similarity.

Result: Consistent improvements across multiple segmentation backbones (U-Net, TransUNet, SAM, SegFormer) on ACDC and M&Ms datasets. On ACDC, SegFormer with J-RAS improved Dice score from 0.8708±0.042 to 0.9115±0.031 and reduced Hausdorff Distance from 1.8130±2.49 to 1.1489±0.30.

Conclusion: J-RAS effectively enhances segmentation performance by enabling retrieval to provide meaningful contextual cues for boundary delineation, demonstrating strong generalizability across architectures and datasets.

Abstract: Image segmentation, the process of dividing images into meaningful regions,
is critical in medical applications for accurate diagnosis, treatment planning,
and disease monitoring. Although manual segmentation by healthcare
professionals produces precise outcomes, it is time-consuming, costly, and
prone to variability due to differences in human expertise. Artificial
intelligence (AI)-based methods have been developed to address these
limitations by automating segmentation tasks; however, they often require
large, annotated datasets that are rarely available in practice and frequently
struggle to generalize across diverse imaging conditions due to inter-patient
variability and rare pathological cases. In this paper, we propose Joint
Retrieval Augmented Segmentation (J-RAS), a joint training method for guided
image segmentation that integrates a segmentation model with a retrieval model.
Both models are jointly optimized, enabling the segmentation model to leverage
retrieved image-mask pairs to enrich its anatomical understanding, while the
retrieval model learns segmentation-relevant features beyond simple visual
similarity. This joint optimization ensures that retrieval actively contributes
meaningful contextual cues to guide boundary delineation, thereby enhancing the
overall segmentation performance. We validate J-RAS across multiple
segmentation backbones, including U-Net, TransUNet, SAM, and SegFormer, on two
benchmark datasets: ACDC and M&Ms, demonstrating consistent improvements. For
example, on the ACDC dataset, SegFormer without J-RAS achieves a mean Dice
score of 0.8708$\pm$0.042 and a mean Hausdorff Distance (HD) of
1.8130$\pm$2.49, whereas with J-RAS, the performance improves substantially to
a mean Dice score of 0.9115$\pm$0.031 and a mean HD of 1.1489$\pm$0.30. These
results highlight the method's effectiveness and its generalizability across
architectures and datasets.

*Fan Zuo,Donglin Zhou,Jingqin Gao,Kaan Ozbay*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An AI framework using traffic cameras for real-time traffic monitoring, featuring YOLOv11 for vehicle detection, graph-based viewpoint normalization, and LLM for automated traffic pattern summaries, validated on NYC congestion pricing rollout data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for scalable traffic monitoring during disruptions like congestion pricing, with limited sensor deployment due to high costs and challenges with existing video analytics handling dynamic viewpoints and large data volumes.

Method: End-to-end AI framework with fine-tuned YOLOv11 for real-time traffic density/classification, graph-based viewpoint normalization for camera inconsistencies, and domain-specific LLM for automated data summarization from 24/7 video streams.

Result: 9% decline in weekday passenger vehicles in NYC Congestion Relief Zone, early truck volume reductions with rebound signs, increased pedestrian/cyclist activity, and improved LLM accuracy with example-based prompts reducing hallucinations.

Conclusion: The framework provides a practical, infrastructure-ready solution for large-scale policy-relevant traffic monitoring with minimal human intervention, demonstrating effectiveness during real-world policy implementation.

Abstract: Accurate, scalable traffic monitoring is critical for real-time and long-term
transportation management, particularly during disruptions such as natural
disasters, large construction projects, or major policy changes like New York
City's first-in-the-nation congestion pricing program. However, widespread
sensor deployment remains limited due to high installation, maintenance, and
data management costs. While traffic cameras offer a cost-effective
alternative, existing video analytics struggle with dynamic camera viewpoints
and massive data volumes from large camera networks. This study presents an
end-to-end AI-based framework leveraging existing traffic camera infrastructure
for high-resolution, longitudinal analysis at scale. A fine-tuned YOLOv11
model, trained on localized urban scenes, extracts multimodal traffic density
and classification metrics in real time. To address inconsistencies from
non-stationary pan-tilt-zoom cameras, we introduce a novel graph-based
viewpoint normalization method. A domain-specific large language model was also
integrated to process massive data from a 24/7 video stream to generate
frequent, automated summaries of evolving traffic patterns, a task far
exceeding manual capabilities. We validated the system using over 9 million
images from roughly 1,000 traffic cameras during the early rollout of NYC
congestion pricing in 2025. Results show a 9% decline in weekday passenger
vehicle density within the Congestion Relief Zone, early truck volume
reductions with signs of rebound, and consistent increases in pedestrian and
cyclist activity at corridor and zonal scales. Experiments showed that
example-based prompts improved LLM's numerical accuracy and reduced
hallucinations. These findings demonstrate the framework's potential as a
practical, infrastructure-ready solution for large-scale, policy-relevant
traffic monitoring with minimal human intervention.

### [29] [FlareX: A Physics-Informed Dataset for Lens Flare Removal via 2D Synthesis and 3D Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09995)
*Lishen Qu,Zhihao Liu,Jinshan Pan,Shihao Zhou,Jinglei Shi,Duosheng Chen,Jufeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed FlareX dataset with physics-informed flare generation using 2D templates and 3D rendering to address real-world generalization issues in lens flare removal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing flare datasets use artificial templates that lack diversity and ignore physical principles, leading to poor generalization to real-world scenarios.

Method: Three-stage physics-informed flare generation: parameterized template creation, illumination-aware 2D synthesis, and physical engine-based 3D rendering, plus masking approach for real-world flare-free images.

Result: Created FlareX dataset with 9,500 2D templates from 95 patterns and 3,000 flare image pairs from 60 3D scenes, with extensive experiments showing effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed physics-informed flare generation method and FlareX dataset significantly improve real-world generalization for lens flare removal tasks.

Abstract: Lens flare occurs when shooting towards strong light sources, significantly
degrading the visual quality of images. Due to the difficulty in capturing
flare-corrupted and flare-free image pairs in the real world, existing datasets
are typically synthesized in 2D by overlaying artificial flare templates onto
background images. However, the lack of flare diversity in templates and the
neglect of physical principles in the synthesis process hinder models trained
on these datasets from generalizing well to real-world scenarios. To address
these challenges, we propose a new physics-informed method for flare data
generation, which consists of three stages: parameterized template creation,
the laws of illumination-aware 2D synthesis, and physical engine-based 3D
rendering, which finally gives us a mixed flare dataset that incorporates both
2D and 3D perspectives, namely FlareX. This dataset offers 9,500 2D templates
derived from 95 flare patterns and 3,000 flare image pairs rendered from 60 3D
scenes. Furthermore, we design a masking approach to obtain real-world
flare-free images from their corrupted counterparts to measure the performance
of the model on real-world images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method and dataset.

### [30] [BurstDeflicker: A Benchmark Dataset for Flicker Removal in Dynamic Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09996)
*Lishen Qu,Zhihao Liu,Shihao Zhou,Yaqi Luo,Jie Liang,Hui Zeng,Lei Zhang,Jufeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BurstDeflicker is a scalable benchmark for flicker removal in images, addressing the lack of realistic datasets through three data acquisition strategies: Retinex-based synthesis, real-world capture, and green-screen motion incorporation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flicker artifacts from AC-powered lighting and rolling shutter cameras degrade image quality and affect high-level computer vision tasks. The lack of large-scale, realistic datasets has hindered flicker removal research.

Method: Three complementary data acquisition strategies: 1) Retinex-based synthesis pipeline for controllable flicker pattern generation, 2) Capture of 4,000 real-world flicker images from different scenes, 3) Green-screen method to incorporate motion while preserving real flicker degradation.

Result: Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the BurstDeflicker dataset in advancing flicker removal research and improving model generalization to real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: BurstDeflicker provides a scalable benchmark that addresses the dataset gap in flicker removal research, enabling better understanding of flicker characteristics and improved model performance in wild scenarios.

Abstract: Flicker artifacts in short-exposure images are caused by the interplay
between the row-wise exposure mechanism of rolling shutter cameras and the
temporal intensity variations of alternating current (AC)-powered lighting.
These artifacts typically appear as uneven brightness distribution across the
image, forming noticeable dark bands. Beyond compromising image quality, this
structured noise also affects high-level tasks, such as object detection and
tracking, where reliable lighting is crucial. Despite the prevalence of
flicker, the lack of a large-scale, realistic dataset has been a significant
barrier to advancing research in flicker removal. To address this issue, we
present BurstDeflicker, a scalable benchmark constructed using three
complementary data acquisition strategies. First, we develop a Retinex-based
synthesis pipeline that redefines the goal of flicker removal and enables
controllable manipulation of key flicker-related attributes (e.g., intensity,
area, and frequency), thereby facilitating the generation of diverse flicker
patterns. Second, we capture 4,000 real-world flicker images from different
scenes, which help the model better understand the spatial and temporal
characteristics of real flicker artifacts and generalize more effectively to
wild scenarios. Finally, due to the non-repeatable nature of dynamic scenes, we
propose a green-screen method to incorporate motion into image pairs while
preserving real flicker degradation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our dataset and its potential to advance research in flicker
removal.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MIMO is a medical vision language model that addresses limitations of existing models by supporting visual referring multimodal input and pixel grounding multimodal output, enabling better understanding of medical images and grounding medical terminologies in visual content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical vision language models only use text instructions without direct visual understanding, and only provide text answers without connecting to key image areas, limiting their effectiveness in medical applications.

Method: Proposed MIMO model with visual referring multimodal input and pixel grounding multimodal output, along with MIMOSeg dataset containing 895K samples covering various multimodal scenarios from four perspectives.

Result: Experiments on medical multimodal tasks show MIMO uniquely combines visual referring and pixel grounding capabilities not available in previous models.

Conclusion: MIMO successfully addresses the input and output limitations of existing medical vision language models by enabling direct visual understanding and connecting textual output to image regions.

Abstract: Currently, medical vision language models are widely used in medical vision
question answering tasks. However, existing models are confronted with two
issues: for input, the model only relies on text instructions and lacks direct
understanding of visual clues in the image; for output, the model only gives
text answers and lacks connection with key areas in the image. To address these
issues, we propose a unified medical vision language model MIMO, with visual
referring Multimodal Input and pixel grounding Multimodal Output. MIMO can not
only combine visual clues and textual instructions to understand complex
medical images and semantics, but can also ground medical terminologies in
textual output within the image. To overcome the scarcity of relevant data in
the medical field, we propose MIMOSeg, a comprehensive medical multimodal
dataset including 895K samples. MIMOSeg is constructed from four different
perspectives, covering basic instruction following and complex question
answering with multimodal input and multimodal output. We conduct experiments
on several downstream medical multimodal tasks. Extensive experimental results
verify that MIMO can uniquely combine visual referring and pixel grounding
capabilities, which are not available in previous models.

### [32] [Q-Adapter: Visual Query Adapter for Extracting Textually-related Features in Video Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10022)
*Junan Chen,Trung Thanh Nguyen,Takahiro Komamizu,Ichiro Ide*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Q-Adapter is a lightweight visual adapter module that enables parameter-efficient fine-tuning for video captioning, achieving state-of-the-art performance among PEFT methods while using only 1.4% of parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard full fine-tuning of large pretrained models for video captioning is computationally prohibitive, and existing PEFT methods primarily focus on language components while lacking sufficient understanding of visual information during fine-tuning.

Method: Q-Adapter introduces learnable query tokens and a gating layer into the Vision Encoder to extract sparse, caption-relevant features without external textual supervision, enabling efficient fine-tuning for video captioning.

Result: Q-Adapter achieves state-of-the-art performance among PEFT methods on MSR-VTT and MSVD datasets across BLEU@4, METEOR, ROUGE-L, and CIDEr metrics, and competitive performance compared to full fine-tuning approaches.

Conclusion: Q-Adapter demonstrates strong potential in balancing caption quality and parameter efficiency, showing scalability for video-language modeling while providing insights into optimization strategies for adapter-based learning.

Abstract: Recent advances in video captioning are driven by large-scale pretrained
models, which follow the standard "pre-training followed by fine-tuning"
paradigm, where the full model is fine-tuned for downstream tasks. Although
effective, this approach becomes computationally prohibitive as the model size
increases. The Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) approach offers a
promising alternative, but primarily focuses on the language components of
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Despite recent progress, PEFT remains
underexplored in multimodal tasks and lacks sufficient understanding of visual
information during fine-tuning the model. To bridge this gap, we propose
Query-Adapter (Q-Adapter), a lightweight visual adapter module designed to
enhance MLLMs by enabling efficient fine-tuning for the video captioning task.
Q-Adapter introduces learnable query tokens and a gating layer into Vision
Encoder, enabling effective extraction of sparse, caption-relevant features
without relying on external textual supervision. We evaluate Q-Adapter on two
well-known video captioning datasets, MSR-VTT and MSVD, where it achieves
state-of-the-art performance among the methods that take the PEFT approach
across BLEU@4, METEOR, ROUGE-L, and CIDEr metrics. Q-Adapter also achieves
competitive performance compared to methods that take the full fine-tuning
approach while requiring only 1.4% of the parameters. We further analyze the
impact of key hyperparameters and design choices on fine-tuning effectiveness,
providing insights into optimization strategies for adapter-based learning.
These results highlight the strong potential of Q-Adapter in balancing caption
quality and parameter efficiency, demonstrating its scalability for
video-language modeling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: P-4DGS is a compressed dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting representation that achieves up to 90x compression with state-of-the-art reconstruction quality and real-time rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dynamic 3DGS algorithms overlook substantial temporal and spatial redundancies in dynamic scenes, leading to prohibitive memory consumption.

Method: Uses 3D anchor point-based spatial-temporal prediction inspired by video compression, combined with adaptive quantization and context-based entropy coding to reduce anchor point size.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality and fastest rendering speed with remarkably low storage footprint (~1MB average), achieving up to 40x and 90x compression on synthetic and real-world scenes respectively.

Conclusion: P-4DGS provides an efficient solution for compact 4D scene modeling with superior compression efficiency while maintaining high reconstruction quality and real-time performance.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has garnered significant attention due to its
superior scene representation fidelity and real-time rendering performance,
especially for dynamic 3D scene reconstruction (\textit{i.e.}, 4D
reconstruction). However, despite achieving promising results, most existing
algorithms overlook the substantial temporal and spatial redundancies inherent
in dynamic scenes, leading to prohibitive memory consumption. To address this,
we propose P-4DGS, a novel dynamic 3DGS representation for compact 4D scene
modeling. Inspired by intra- and inter-frame prediction techniques commonly
used in video compression, we first design a 3D anchor point-based
spatial-temporal prediction module to fully exploit the spatial-temporal
correlations across different 3D Gaussian primitives. Subsequently, we employ
an adaptive quantization strategy combined with context-based entropy coding to
further reduce the size of the 3D anchor points, thereby achieving enhanced
compression efficiency. To evaluate the rate-distortion performance of our
proposed P-4DGS in comparison with other dynamic 3DGS representations, we
conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art
reconstruction quality and the fastest rendering speed, with a remarkably low
storage footprint (around \textbf{1MB} on average), achieving up to
\textbf{40$\times$} and \textbf{90$\times$} compression on synthetic and
real-world scenes, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CCFormer is a novel Transformer-based framework for Audio-Visual Segmentation that enhances cross-modal complementarity through parallel bilateral architecture, dynamic audio queries, and contrastive learning, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CNN methods have limited receptive fields, while existing Transformer approaches struggle with extracting multimodal coefficients and temporal dynamics effectively in audio-visual segmentation tasks.

Method: Proposes CCFormer with three key components: Early Integration Module for multi-scale visual-audio fusion, Multi-query Transformer Module for spatial-temporal modeling with dynamic audio queries, and Bi-modal Contrastive Learning for cross-modal alignment.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art benchmarks across S4, MS3 and AVSS datasets, demonstrating superior performance in audio-visual segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: CCFormer effectively addresses limitations of previous methods by comprehensively capturing spatial-temporal context and enhancing cross-modal complementarity through its novel architectural design.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) aims to generate pixel-wise segmentation maps
that correlate with the auditory signals of objects. This field has seen
significant progress with numerous CNN and Transformer-based methods enhancing
the segmentation accuracy and robustness. Traditional CNN approaches manage
audio-visual interactions through basic operations like padding and
multiplications but are restricted by CNNs' limited local receptive field. More
recently, Transformer-based methods treat auditory cues as queries, utilizing
attention mechanisms to enhance audio-visual cooperation within frames.
Nevertheless, they typically struggle to extract multimodal coefficients and
temporal dynamics adequately. To overcome these limitations, we present the
Complementary and Contrastive Transformer (CCFormer), a novel framework adept
at processing both local and global information and capturing spatial-temporal
context comprehensively. Our CCFormer initiates with the Early Integration
Module (EIM) that employs a parallel bilateral architecture, merging
multi-scale visual features with audio data to boost cross-modal
complementarity. To extract the intra-frame spatial features and facilitate the
perception of temporal coherence, we introduce the Multi-query Transformer
Module (MTM), which dynamically endows audio queries with learning capabilities
and models the frame and video-level relations simultaneously. Furthermore, we
propose the Bi-modal Contrastive Learning (BCL) to promote the alignment across
both modalities in the unified feature space. Through the effective combination
of those designs, our method sets new state-of-the-art benchmarks across the
S4, MS3 and AVSS datasets. Our source code and model weights will be made
publicly available at https://github.com/SitongGong/CCFormer

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViTAR is a medical vision-language model that mimics human expert diagnostic reasoning through iterative "think-act-rethink-answer" cycles, outperforming state-of-the-art models by focusing on clinically critical regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical VLMs use single-pass reasoning that misses localized visual cues, unlike human experts who iteratively scan and refine regions of interest before diagnosis. This creates a machine-human perception gap.

Method: ViTAR framework with cognitive chain of "think-act-rethink-answer" that treats medical images as interactive objects. Uses curated 1K interactive examples and 16K VQA data, with two-stage training: supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning.

Result: ViTAR outperforms strong state-of-the-art models. Visual attention analysis shows increasing focus on clinically critical regions from "think" to "rethink" rounds, with high attention to visual tokens during reasoning.

Conclusion: Embedding expert-style iterative thinking chains into VLMs enhances both performance and trustworthiness of medical AI by providing mechanistic insight into improved diagnostic reasoning.

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) excel at image-text understanding but
typically rely on a single-pass reasoning that neglects localized visual cues.
In clinical practice, however, human experts iteratively scan, focus, and
refine the regions of interest before reaching a final diagnosis. To narrow
this machine-human perception gap, we introduce ViTAR, a novel VLM framework
that emulates the iterative reasoning process of human experts through a
cognitive chain of "think-act-rethink-answer". ViTAR treats medical images as
interactive objects, enabling models to engage multi-step visual reasoning. To
support this approach, we curate a high-quality instruction dataset comprising
1K interactive examples that encode expert-like diagnostic behaviors. In
addition, a 16K visual question answering training data has been curated
towards fine-grained visual diagnosis. We introduce a two-stage training
strategy that begins with supervised fine-tuning to guide cognitive
trajectories, followed by the reinforcement learning to optimize
decision-making. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that ViTAR outperforms
strong state-of-the-art models. Visual attention analysis reveals that from the
"think" to "rethink" rounds, ViTAR increasingly anchors visual grounding to
clinically critical regions and maintains high attention allocation to visual
tokens during reasoning, providing mechanistic insight into its improved
performance. These findings demonstrate that embedding expert-style iterative
thinking chains into VLMs enhances both performance and trustworthiness of
medical AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current research focuses on objective deepfake detection, but subjective perception modeling of deepfake realism is understudied. Visual realism assessment is important for evaluating deepfake quality, deceptiveness, and potential impact.

Method: Created DREAM benchmark with: diverse deepfake video dataset, 140,000 realism scores and descriptions from 3,500 human annotators, evaluated 16 realism assessment methods including large vision-language models and a new description-aligned CLIP method.

Result: Established a comprehensive benchmark for deepfake realism assessment with extensive human annotations and systematic evaluation of multiple assessment approaches.

Conclusion: The DREAM benchmark lays foundation for future research in deepfake visual realism assessment and related areas, addressing the gap in computational modeling of subjective deepfake perception.

Abstract: Deep learning based face-swap videos, widely known as deepfakes, have drawn
wide attention due to their threat to information credibility. Recent works
mainly focus on the problem of deepfake detection that aims to reliably tell
deepfakes apart from real ones, in an objective way. On the other hand, the
subjective perception of deepfakes, especially its computational modeling and
imitation, is also a significant problem but lacks adequate study. In this
paper, we focus on the visual realism assessment of deepfakes, which is defined
as the automatic assessment of deepfake visual realism that approximates human
perception of deepfakes. It is important for evaluating the quality and
deceptiveness of deepfakes which can be used for predicting the influence of
deepfakes on Internet, and it also has potentials in improving the deepfake
generation process by serving as a critic. This paper prompts this new
direction by presenting a comprehensive benchmark called DREAM, which stands
for Deepfake REalism AssessMent. It is comprised of a deepfake video dataset of
diverse quality, a large scale annotation that includes 140,000 realism scores
and textual descriptions obtained from 3,500 human annotators, and a
comprehensive evaluation and analysis of 16 representative realism assessment
methods, including recent large vision language model based methods and a newly

TL;DR: CLSL is a collaborative learning method that unifies semantic-aware feature learning and missing label recovery for multi-label image recognition with incomplete labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address two core challenges in multi-label image recognition with incomplete labels: semantic-aware feature learning and missing label recovery.

Method: Three modules: semantic-related feature learning to discover semantic information and label correlations, semantic-guided feature enhancement to align visual and semantic features, and collaborative learning framework that integrates both processes in a mutually reinforced loop.

Result: Extensive experiments on MS-COCO, VOC2007, and NUS-WIDE datasets show CLSL outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: CLSL effectively addresses incomplete label challenges through unified collaborative learning of semantic features and label recovery.

Abstract: Multi-label image recognition with incomplete labels is a critical learning
task and has emerged as a focal topic in computer vision. However, this task is
confronted with two core challenges: semantic-aware feature learning and
missing label recovery. In this paper, we propose a novel Collaborative
Learning of Semantic-aware feature learning and Label recovery (CLSL) method
for multi-label image recognition with incomplete labels, which unifies the two
aforementioned challenges into a unified learning framework. More specifically,
we design a semantic-related feature learning module to learn robust
semantic-related features by discovering semantic information and label
correlations. Then, a semantic-guided feature enhancement module is proposed to
generate high-quality discriminative semantic-aware features by effectively
aligning visual and semantic feature spaces. Finally, we introduce a
collaborative learning framework that integrates semantic-aware feature
learning and label recovery, which can not only dynamically enhance the
discriminability of semantic-aware features but also adaptively infer and
recover missing labels, forming a mutually reinforced loop between the two
processes. Extensive experiments on three widely used public datasets (MS-COCO,
VOC2007, and NUS-WIDE) demonstrate that CLSL outperforms the state-of-the-art
multi-label image recognition methods with incomplete labels.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PHG-MAE is a novel model that combines neural graphs with masked autoencoders, enabling multi-modal learning through random modality masking, unified training loop, and inference-time ensembles for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage self-supervised pre-training without manual labels and address multi-modal learning challenges in computer vision, particularly for UAV scenes with multiple interpretations and modalities.

Method: Probabilistic Hyper-Graphs with Masked Autoencoders (PHG-MAE) that randomly masks entire modalities (not just patches), combines pre-training and fine-tuning in one loop, creates inference ensembles, and applies knowledge distillation.

Result: The approach enables creation of inference-time ensembles that boost prediction performance and consistency, with knowledge distillation working effectively even on models under 1M parameters.

Conclusion: PHG-MAE provides a unified framework for multi-modal learning that can be applied to various domains like autonomous driving and robotics, with released code, dataset extensions, and reproducible methodology.

Abstract: The computer vision domain has greatly benefited from an abundance of data
across many modalities to improve on various visual tasks. Recently, there has
been a lot of focus on self-supervised pre-training methods through Masked
Autoencoders (MAE) \cite{he2022masked,bachmann2022multimae}, usually used as a
first step before optimizing for a downstream task, such as classification or
regression. This is very useful as it doesn't require any manually labeled
data. In this work, we introduce Probabilistic Hyper-Graphs using Masked
Autoencoders (PHG-MAE): a novel model that unifies the classical work on neural
graphs \cite{leordeanu2021semi} with the modern approach of masked autoencoders
under a common theoretical framework. Through random masking of entire
modalities, not just patches, the model samples from the distribution of
hyper-edges on each forward pass. Additionally, the model adapts the standard
MAE algorithm by combining pre-training and fine-tuning into a single training
loop. Moreover, our approach enables the creation of inference-time ensembles
which, through aggregation, boost the final prediction performance and
consistency. Lastly, we show that we can apply knowledge distillation on top of
the ensembles with little loss in performance, even with models that have fewer
than 1M parameters. While our work mostly focuses on outdoor UAV scenes that
contain multiple world interpretations and modalities, the same steps can be
followed in other similar domains, such as autonomous driving or indoor
robotics. In order to streamline the process of integrating external
pre-trained experts for computer vision multi-modal multi-task learning (MTL)
scenarios, we developed a data-pipeline software. Using this tool, we have
created and released a fully-automated extension of the Dronescapes dataset.
All the technical details, code and reproduction steps are publicly released.

TL;DR: A framework using vision foundation models to track spatiotemporal evolution of large-scale landslide scars by converting discrete optical remote sensing images into continuous video sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing studies focus on single-phase or dual-phase landslide identification but cannot track spatiotemporal evolution of landslide scars, which is critical for understanding evolution mechanisms and failure precursors for early warning.

Method: Reconstructs discrete optical remote sensing images into continuous video sequences, enabling vision foundation models (developed for video segmentation) to track landslide scar evolution through knowledge-guided, auto-propagation, and interactive refinement paradigm.

Result: Successfully validated on Baige landslide (post-failure) and Sela landslide (2017-2025 active), enabling continuous tracking that captures failure precursors for early warning and post-failure evolution for secondary hazard assessment.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a universal approach for continuous spatiotemporal tracking of landslide scars, supporting both early warning through precursor detection and long-term stability assessment through post-failure evolution monitoring.

Abstract: Tracking the spatiotemporal evolution of large-scale landslide scars is
critical for understanding the evolution mechanisms and failure precursors,
enabling effective early-warning. However, most existing studies have focused
on single-phase or pre- and post-failure dual-phase landslide identification.
Although these approaches delineate post-failure landslide boundaries, it is
challenging to track the spatiotemporal evolution of landslide scars. To
address this problem, this study proposes a novel and universal framework for
tracking the spatiotemporal evolution of large-scale landslide scars using a
vision foundation model. The key idea behind the proposed framework is to
reconstruct discrete optical remote sensing images into a continuous video
sequence. This transformation enables a vision foundation model, which is
developed for video segmentation, to be used for tracking the evolution of
landslide scars. The proposed framework operates within a knowledge-guided,
auto-propagation, and interactive refinement paradigm to ensure the continuous
and accurate identification of landslide scars. The proposed framework was
validated through application to two representative cases: the post-failure
Baige landslide and the active Sela landslide (2017-2025). Results indicate
that the proposed framework enables continuous tracking of landslide scars,
capturing both failure precursors critical for early warning and post-failure
evolution essential for assessing secondary hazards and long-term stability.

Motivation: NeRF and 3DGS depend heavily on accurate camera poses and dense viewpoint coverage, limiting their applicability in sparse-view settings where pose estimation becomes unreliable and supervision is insufficient.

Method: Uses VGGT foundation model for reliable initial poses and dense point clouds; integrates hybrid Gaussian representation with dual position-shape optimization, graph-guided attribute refinement, and flow-based depth regularization.

Result: Achieves more robust performance on both forward-facing and large-scale complex datasets compared to other pose-free methods, as demonstrated through comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments.

Conclusion: Gesplat successfully overcomes the limitations of traditional methods in sparse-view settings by providing a robust framework for novel view synthesis and geometrically consistent reconstruction from unposed sparse images.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have advanced
3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis, but remain heavily dependent on
accurate camera poses and dense viewpoint coverage. These requirements limit
their applicability in sparse-view settings, where pose estimation becomes
unreliable and supervision is insufficient. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce Gesplat, a 3DGS-based framework that enables robust novel view
synthesis and geometrically consistent reconstruction from unposed sparse
images. Unlike prior works that rely on COLMAP for sparse point cloud
initialization, we leverage the VGGT foundation model to obtain more reliable
initial poses and dense point clouds. Our approach integrates several key
innovations: 1) a hybrid Gaussian representation with dual position-shape
optimization enhanced by inter-view matching consistency; 2) a graph-guided
attribute refinement module to enhance scene details; and 3) flow-based depth
regularization that improves depth estimation accuracy for more effective
supervision. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate
that our approach achieves more robust performance on both forward-facing and
large-scale complex datasets compared to other pose-free methods.

*Kuangpu Guo,Lijun Sheng,Yongcan Yu,Jian Liang,Zilei Wang,Ran He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedCoPL extends Unsupervised Federated Learning to classification tasks using CLIP, addressing global class imbalance through pseudo label distribution adjustment and partial prompt aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous UFL works focused on representation learning and clustering, but recent advances in vision-language models like CLIP enable new opportunities for classification in UFL settings that remain unexplored.

Method: FedCoPL uses pseudo label distribution estimation and adjustment between clients and server to handle global class imbalance, plus partial prompt aggregation where visual prompts are aggregated globally while text prompts remain local for personalization.

Result: Extensive experiments show FedCoPL achieves superior performance compared to baseline methods in unsupervised federated classification tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed FedCoPL successfully enables classification in UFL using CLIP, demonstrating effective handling of class imbalance and collaborative learning through pseudo label adjustment and partial prompt aggregation.

Abstract: Unsupervised Federated Learning (UFL) aims to collaboratively train a global
model across distributed clients without sharing data or accessing label
information. Previous UFL works have predominantly focused on representation
learning and clustering tasks. Recently, vision language models (e.g., CLIP)
have gained significant attention for their powerful zero-shot prediction
capabilities. Leveraging this advancement, classification problems that were
previously infeasible under the UFL paradigm now present promising new
opportunities, yet remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we extend UFL to
the classification problem with CLIP for the first time and propose a novel
method, \underline{\textbf{Fed}}erated \underline{\textbf{Co}}operative
\underline{\textbf{P}}seudo \underline{\textbf{L}}abeling (\textbf{FedCoPL}).
Specifically, clients estimate and upload their pseudo label distribution, and
the server adjusts and redistributes them to avoid global imbalance among
classes. Moreover, we introduce a partial prompt aggregation protocol for
effective collaboration and personalization. In particular, visual prompts
containing general image features are aggregated at the server, while text
prompts encoding personalized knowledge are retained locally. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our FedCoPL compared to
baseline methods. Our code is available at

### [42] [Answer-Consistent Chain-of-thought Reinforcement Learning For Multi-modal Large Langauge Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10104)
*Minbin Huang,Runhui Huang,Chuanyang Zheng,Jingyao Li,Guoxuan Chen,Han Shi,Hong Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ACRE improves reasoning consistency in multimodal LLMs by adding a consistency check to GRPO, penalizing mismatches between reasoning traces and final answers through answer shuffling and verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RLVR methods improve answer accuracy but often create inconsistency between reasoning steps and final answers, with only 79.7% consistency observed in experiments.

Method: Modifies GRPO with auxiliary consistency check: after generating chain of thought and initial answer, shuffles answer options and prompts model again with same reasoning trace to predict second answer, then assigns rewards based on consistency and correctness.

Result: Achieves 2.2% improvement on Video Reasoning benchmarks and 1.5% improvement on multimodal math reasoning benchmarks over GRPO baseline.

Conclusion: ACRE effectively addresses reasoning-answer misalignment and reduces reliance on spurious patterns like option ordering biases, improving both accuracy and consistency in multimodal reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated that
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can significantly enhance
reasoning abilities by directly optimizing correctness, rather than relying
solely on supervised imitation. This paradigm has been extended to multimodal
LLMs for complex video and image understanding tasks. However, while
outcome-driven RL improves answer accuracy, it can inadvertently decouple the
reasoning chain from the final answer, leading to situations where models
produce inconsistency between the reasoning trace and final answer. In our
experiments on multiple-choice visual question-answering tasks, the standard
GRPO method yields only 79.7\% consistency on MMVU between the reasoning steps
and the chosen answers, indicating frequent mismatches between answers and
reasoning. To this end, we propose Answer-Consistent Reinforcement Learning
(ACRE) that modifies the GRPO algorithm with an auxiliary consistency check.
After the model generates a chain of thought and an initial answer for a given
question, we shuffle the answer options and prompt the model again with the
same reasoning trace to predict a second answer. We design a
consistency-verification reward that grants a high reward only if both the
original and the post-shuffle answers agree and are correct; otherwise, a lower
reward is assigned accordingly. This mechanism penalizes reasoning-answer
misalignment and discourages the model from relying on spurious patterns, such
as option ordering biases. We evaluate ACRE on challenging Video Reasoning
benchmarks and multimodal math reasoning benchmarks, achieving an average 2.2\%
and 1.5\% improvement for Video Reasoning and Math Reasoning tasks over the
GRPO baseline.

*Aniruddha Srinivas Joshi,Godwyn James William,Shreyas Srinivas Joshi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an uncertainty-aware post-detection framework that rescales detection confidences using statistical uncertainty and visual cues to improve fire/smoke detection in compact deep learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing compact models like YOLOv5n/YOLOv8n face false positives and missed detections, while conventional post-detection methods relying only on spatial overlap are insufficient for cluttered fire scenes.

Method: Lightweight Confidence Refinement Network that integrates uncertainty estimates with color, edge, and texture features to adjust detection scores without modifying the base model.

Result: Experiments on D-Fire dataset show improved precision, recall, and mean average precision compared to existing baselines with modest computational overhead.

Conclusion: Post-detection rescoring effectively enhances robustness of compact deep learning models for real-world fire and smoke detection applications.

Abstract: Accurate fire and smoke detection is critical for safety and disaster
response, yet existing vision-based methods face challenges in balancing
efficiency and reliability. Compact deep learning models such as YOLOv5n and
YOLOv8n are widely adopted for deployment on UAVs, CCTV systems, and IoT
devices, but their reduced capacity often results in false positives and missed
detections. Conventional post-detection methods such as Non-Maximum Suppression
and Soft-NMS rely only on spatial overlap, which can suppress true positives or
retain false alarms in cluttered or ambiguous fire scenes. To address these
limitations, we propose an uncertainty aware post-detection framework that
rescales detection confidences using both statistical uncertainty and domain
relevant visual cues. A lightweight Confidence Refinement Network integrates
uncertainty estimates with color, edge, and texture features to adjust
detection scores without modifying the base model. Experiments on the D-Fire
dataset demonstrate improved precision, recall, and mean average precision
compared to existing baselines, with only modest computational overhead. These
results highlight the effectiveness of post-detection rescoring in enhancing
the robustness of compact deep learning models for real-world fire and smoke
detection.

TL;DR: ICFC is a training-free framework that uses multi-modal LLMs for interpretable image manipulation localization, achieving state-of-the-art performance without requiring pixel-level annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address security threats from image tampering by providing effective manipulation localization without costly pixel-level annotations, overcoming limitations of existing weakly supervised and training-free methods.

Method: Uses In-Context Forensic Chain with objectified rule construction, adaptive filtering for reliable knowledge base, and multi-step progressive reasoning pipeline that mimics expert forensic workflows from coarse to fine-grained analysis.

Result: Surpasses state-of-the-art training-free methods and achieves competitive or superior performance compared to weakly and fully supervised approaches across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: ICFC enables systematic exploitation of MLLM reasoning for image classification, pixel localization, and text interpretability, providing an effective training-free solution for image manipulation detection.

Abstract: Advances in image tampering pose serious security threats, underscoring the
need for effective image manipulation localization (IML). While supervised IML
achieves strong performance, it depends on costly pixel-level annotations.
Existing weakly supervised or training-free alternatives often underperform and
lack interpretability. We propose the In-Context Forensic Chain (ICFC), a
training-free framework that leverages multi-modal large language models
(MLLMs) for interpretable IML tasks. ICFC integrates an objectified rule
construction with adaptive filtering to build a reliable knowledge base and a
multi-step progressive reasoning pipeline that mirrors expert forensic
workflows from coarse proposals to fine-grained forensics results. This design
enables systematic exploitation of MLLM reasoning for image-level
classification, pixel-level localization, and text-level interpretability.
Across multiple benchmarks, ICFC not only surpasses state-of-the-art
training-free methods but also achieves competitive or superior performance
compared to weakly and fully supervised approaches.

*Yuxi Mi,Qiuyang Yuan,Zhizhou Zhong,Xuan Zhao,Jiaogen Zhou,Fubao Zhu,Jihong Guan,Shuigeng Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ImmerIris is a large-scale VR headset dataset for off-axis iris recognition, showing current methods fail due to normalization issues and proposing a simple normalization-free approach that outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Immersive applications like AR/VR need iris recognition but face challenges with off-axis acquisition (perspective distortion, quality issues, texture variations), and existing datasets are scarce.

Method: Created ImmerIris dataset (499,791 images from 564 subjects) via VR headsets, established evaluation protocols, and proposed a normalization-free paradigm that learns directly from ocular images.

Result: Current on-axis iris recognition methods perform poorly on immersive setup due to fallible normalization. The proposed normalization-free approach consistently outperforms normalization-based methods.

Conclusion: Normalization-free paradigm is a promising direction for robust immersive iris recognition, addressing the limitations of traditional methods in off-axis scenarios.

Abstract: In egocentric applications such as augmented and virtual reality, immersive
iris recognition is emerging as an accurate and seamless way to identify
persons. While classic systems acquire iris images on-axis, i.e., via dedicated
frontal sensors in controlled settings, the immersive setup primarily captures
off-axis irises through tilt-placed headset cameras, with only mild control in
open scenes. This yields unique challenges, including perspective distortion,
intensified quality degradations, and intra-class variations in iris texture.
Datasets capturing these challenges remain scarce. To fill this gap, this paper
introduces ImmerIris, a large-scale dataset collected via VR headsets,
containing 499,791 ocular images from 564 subjects. It is, to the best of
current knowledge, the largest public dataset and among the first dedicated to
off-axis acquisition. Based on ImmerIris, evaluation protocols are constructed
to benchmark recognition methods under different challenging factors. Current
methods, primarily designed for classic on-axis imagery, perform
unsatisfactorily on the immersive setup, mainly due to reliance on fallible
normalization. To this end, this paper further proposes a normalization-free
paradigm that directly learns from ocular images with minimal adjustment.
Despite its simplicity, this approach consistently outperforms
normalization-based counterparts, pointing to a promising direction for robust
immersive recognition.

*Abu Saleh Musa Miah,Najmul Hassan,Md Maruf Al Hossain,Yuichi Okuyama,Jungpil Shin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-class Parkinson's Disease severity detection system using finger tapping videos with attention-enhanced CNN-BiLSTM architecture achieves strong performance in classifying five severity levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current gesture-based PD recognition systems have unsatisfactory accuracy, and accurate PD severity evaluation is crucial for clinical management and intervention development.

Method: Collected finger tapping videos and extracted temporal, frequency, and amplitude features from wrist/hand movements. Used hybrid CNN-BiLSTM with attention mechanisms: Conv1D MaxPooling for spatial features, BiLSTM for temporal dynamics, attention mechanism to focus on informative features, and concatenated CNN-BiLSTM outputs for final classification.

Result: The model demonstrated strong performance in distinguishing between five PD severity classes, showing improved automated PD severity detection.

Conclusion: Integrating spatial-temporal representations with attention mechanisms improves automated PD severity detection, making it a promising non-invasive tool to support clinicians in PD monitoring and progression tracking.

Abstract: Effective clinical management and intervention development depend on accurate
evaluation of Parkinsons disease (PD) severity. Many researchers have worked on
developing gesture-based PD recognition systems; however, their performance
accuracy is not satisfactory. In this study, we propose a multi-class Parkinson
Disease detection system based on finger tapping using an attention-enhanced
CNN BiLSTM. We collected finger tapping videos and derived temporal, frequency,
and amplitude based features from wrist and hand movements. Then, we proposed a
hybrid deep learning framework integrating CNN, BiLSTM, and attention
mechanisms for multi-class PD severity classification from video-derived motion
features. First, the input sequence is reshaped and passed through a Conv1D
MaxPooling block to capture local spatial dependencies. The resulting feature
maps are fed into a BiLSTM layer to model temporal dynamics. An attention
mechanism focuses on the most informative temporal features, producing a
context vector that is further processed by a second BiLSTM layer. CNN-derived
features and attention-enhanced BiLSTM outputs are concatenated, followed by
dense and dropout layers, before the final softmax classifier outputs the
predicted PD severity level. The model demonstrated strong performance in
distinguishing between the five severity classes, suggesting that integrating
spatial temporal representations with attention mechanisms can improve
automated PD severity detection, making it a promising non-invasive tool to
support clinicians in PD monitoring and progression tracking.

*Halil Hüseyin Çalışkan,Talha Koruk*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepFusionNet is a lightweight autoencoder architecture that addresses both low-light image enhancement and super-resolution tasks with significantly fewer parameters than existing methods, achieving high SSIM and PSNR scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for low-light image enhancement and super-resolution suffer from low SSIM/PSNR scores and high computational requirements due to large parameter counts. There's a need for more efficient architectures that maintain performance while reducing computational complexity.

Method: Developed DeepFusionNet architecture using autoencoder-based approach for both tasks. For low-light enhancement: approximately 2.5M parameters. For super-resolution: approximately 100K parameters. Both methods avoid GAN-based approaches in favor of more efficient autoencoder designs.

Result: Low-light enhancement on LOL-v1 dataset: SSIM 92.8%, PSNR 26.30. Super-resolution: PSNR 25.30, SSIM 80.7%. Both methods achieved competitive performance with significantly reduced parameter counts compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: DeepFusionNet provides an efficient solution for both low-light image enhancement and super-resolution tasks, demonstrating that high performance can be achieved with substantially fewer parameters than current state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Computer vision and image processing applications suffer from dark and
low-light images, particularly during real-time image transmission. Currently,
low light and dark images are converted to bright and colored forms using
autoencoders; however, these methods often achieve low SSIM and PSNR scores and
require high computational power due to their large number of parameters. To
address these challenges, the DeepFusionNet architecture has been developed.
According to the results obtained with the LOL-v1 dataset, DeepFusionNet
achieved an SSIM of 92.8% and a PSNR score of 26.30, while containing only
approximately 2.5 million parameters. On the other hand, conversion of blurry
and low-resolution images into high-resolution and blur-free images has gained
importance in image processing applications. Unlike GAN-based super-resolution
methods, an autoencoder-based super resolution model has been developed that
contains approximately 100 thousand parameters and uses the DeepFusionNet
architecture. According to the results of the tests, the DeepFusionNet based
super-resolution method achieved a PSNR of 25.30 and a SSIM score of 80.7
percent according to the validation set.

Conclusion: YOLOv11-Litchi is suitable for UAV-based litchi detection in complex orchard environments and shows potential for broader precision agriculture applications.

Abstract: Litchi is a high-value fruit, yet traditional manual selection methods are
increasingly inadequate for modern production demands. Integrating UAV-based
aerial imagery with deep learning offers a promising solution to enhance
efficiency and reduce costs. This paper introduces YOLOv11-Litchi, a
lightweight and robust detection model specifically designed for UAV-based
litchi detection. Built upon the YOLOv11 framework, the proposed model
addresses key challenges such as small target size, large model parameters
hindering deployment, and frequent target occlusion. To tackle these issues,
three major innovations are incorporated: a multi-scale residual module to
improve contextual feature extraction across scales, a lightweight feature
fusion method to reduce model size and computational costs while maintaining
high accuracy, and a litchi occlusion detection head to mitigate occlusion
effects by emphasizing target regions and suppressing background interference.
Experimental results validate the model's effectiveness. YOLOv11-Litchi
achieves a parameter size of 6.35 MB - 32.5% smaller than the YOLOv11 baseline
- while improving mAP by 2.5% to 90.1% and F1-Score by 1.4% to 85.5%.
Additionally, the model achieves a frame rate of 57.2 FPS, meeting real-time

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Color3D is a flexible framework for colorizing static and dynamic 3D scenes from monochrome inputs, enabling user-guided control while maintaining cross-view and cross-time consistency through personalized colorizer fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods sacrifice chromatic richness and controllability by averaging color variations for multi-view consistency, focusing only on static scenarios without addressing dynamic scenes or user control.

Method: Colorizes a single key view and fine-tunes a personalized colorizer to propagate colors to novel views and time steps, learning scene-specific deterministic color mapping and using Lab color space Gaussian splatting for 3D reconstruction.

Result: Extensive experiments show Color3D delivers more consistent and chromatically rich renderings with precise user control across diverse static and dynamic 3D colorization benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework successfully recasts complex 3D colorization as a tractable single-image paradigm, enabling seamless integration of arbitrary image colorization models with enhanced flexibility and controllability.

Abstract: In this work, we present Color3D, a highly adaptable framework for colorizing
both static and dynamic 3D scenes from monochromatic inputs, delivering
visually diverse and chromatically vibrant reconstructions with flexible
user-guided control. In contrast to existing methods that focus solely on
static scenarios and enforce multi-view consistency by averaging color
variations which inevitably sacrifice both chromatic richness and
controllability, our approach is able to preserve color diversity and
steerability while ensuring cross-view and cross-time consistency. In
particular, the core insight of our method is to colorize only a single key
view and then fine-tune a personalized colorizer to propagate its color to
novel views and time steps. Through personalization, the colorizer learns a
scene-specific deterministic color mapping underlying the reference view,
enabling it to consistently project corresponding colors to the content in
novel views and video frames via its inherent inductive bias. Once trained, the
personalized colorizer can be applied to infer consistent chrominance for all
other images, enabling direct reconstruction of colorful 3D scenes with a
dedicated Lab color space Gaussian splatting representation. The proposed
framework ingeniously recasts complicated 3D colorization as a more tractable
single image paradigm, allowing seamless integration of arbitrary image
colorization models with enhanced flexibility and controllability. Extensive
experiments across diverse static and dynamic 3D colorization benchmarks
substantiate that our method can deliver more consistent and chromatically rich
renderings with precise user control. Project Page

*Benjia Zhou,Bin Fu,Pei Cheng,Yanru Wang,Jiayuan Fan,Tao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReMix is a unified framework for character-consistent generation and editing that combines a ReMix Module for semantic feature editing and IP-ControlNet for pixel-level consistency and pose control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to unify character generation and editing tasks - generation approaches lack fine-grained identity consistency, while editing methods lose spatial controllability and instruction alignment.

Method: ReMix consists of two components: (1) ReMix Module that uses MLLMs to edit semantic features and adapt instruction embeddings to DiT backbone without fine-tuning, and (2) IP-ControlNet that extends ControlNet to decouple semantic/layout cues and introduces an ε-equivariant latent space for joint denoising in shared noise space.

Result: The framework enables consistent character generation while preserving identity, supporting personalized generation, image editing, style transfer, and multi-condition synthesis.

Conclusion: ReMix provides an effective and efficient unified framework for character-consistent image generation and editing, validated through extensive experiments.

Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., FLUX.1)
have greatly improved visual fidelity in consistent character generation and
editing. However, existing methods rarely unify these tasks within a single
framework. Generation-based approaches struggle with fine-grained identity
consistency across instances, while editing-based methods often lose spatial
controllability and instruction alignment. To bridge this gap, we propose
ReMix, a unified framework for character-consistent generation and editing. It
constitutes two core components: the ReMix Module and IP-ControlNet. The ReMix
Module leverages the multimodal reasoning ability of MLLMs to edit semantic
features of input images and adapt instruction embeddings to the native DiT
backbone without fine-tuning. While this ensures coherent semantic layouts,
pixel-level consistency and pose controllability remain challenging. To address
this, IP-ControlNet extends ControlNet to decouple semantic and layout cues
from reference images and introduces an {\epsilon}-equivariant latent space
that jointly denoises the reference and target images within a shared noise
space. Inspired by convergent evolution and quantum decoherence,i.e., where
environmental noise drives state convergence, this design promotes feature
alignment in the hidden space, enabling consistent object generation while
preserving identity. ReMix supports a wide range of tasks, including
personalized generation, image editing, style transfer, and multi-condition
synthesis. Extensive experiments validate its effectiveness and efficiency as a
unified framework for character-consistent image generation and editing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SaFiRe is a novel framework for Referring Image Segmentation that addresses ambiguous expressions through a two-phase cognitive process, using Mamba's scan-then-update property for efficient multi-cycle refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RIS methods focus on simple expressions and reduce the task to keyword matching, failing to handle referential ambiguity in complex real-world scenarios like object-distracting and category-implicit expressions.

Method: Proposes SaFiRe framework that mimics human two-phase cognition: global understanding followed by detail-oriented inspection, leveraging Mamba's scan-then-update property for efficient multi-cycle refinement with linear complexity.

Result: Extensive experiments on standard and proposed datasets (including new aRefCOCO benchmark) demonstrate SaFiRe's superiority over state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: SaFiRe effectively handles ambiguous referring expressions through its phased cognitive approach and efficient refinement process, advancing RIS capabilities beyond simple expression matching.

Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) aims to segment the target object in an
image given a natural language expression. While recent methods leverage
pre-trained vision backbones and more training corpus to achieve impressive
results, they predominantly focus on simple expressions--short, clear noun
phrases like "red car" or "left girl". This simplification often reduces RIS to
a key word/concept matching problem, limiting the model's ability to handle
referential ambiguity in expressions. In this work, we identify two challenging
real-world scenarios: object-distracting expressions, which involve multiple
entities with contextual cues, and category-implicit expressions, where the
object class is not explicitly stated. To address the challenges, we propose a
novel framework, SaFiRe, which mimics the human two-phase cognitive
process--first forming a global understanding, then refining it through
detail-oriented inspection. This is naturally supported by Mamba's
scan-then-update property, which aligns with our phased design and enables
efficient multi-cycle refinement with linear complexity. We further introduce
aRefCOCO, a new benchmark designed to evaluate RIS models under ambiguous
referring expressions. Extensive experiments on both standard and proposed
datasets demonstrate the superiority of SaFiRe over state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SparseUWSeg is a framework for underwater semantic segmentation that uses active sampling to guide point annotation and hybrid label propagation combining SAM2 and superpixels, achieving +5% mIoU improvement over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-grained underwater scene analysis is challenging due to the high cost of obtaining dense expert annotations, while sparse point-labels are easier to obtain but create challenges in annotation selection and label propagation.

Method: Uses active sampling strategy to guide annotators for optimal point label selection, then propagates sparse labels with a hybrid approach leveraging both SAM2 and superpixel-based methods.

Result: Experiments on two diverse underwater datasets show SparseUWSeg outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving up to +5% mIoU improvement over D+NN baseline.

Conclusion: The main contribution is the design and release of an effective interactive annotation tool that enables ecology researchers to efficiently generate high-quality segmentation masks using foundation models and computer vision.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is essential to automate underwater imagery analysis
with ecology monitoring purposes. Unfortunately, fine grained underwater scene
analysis is still an open problem even for top performing segmentation models.
The high cost of obtaining dense, expert-annotated, segmentation labels hinders
the supervision of models in this domain. While sparse point-labels are easier
to obtain, they introduce challenges regarding which points to annotate and how
to propagate the sparse information. We present SparseUWSeg, a novel framework
that addresses both issues. SparseUWSeg employs an active sampling strategy to
guide annotators, maximizing the value of their point labels. Then, it
propagates these sparse labels with a hybrid approach leverages both the best
of SAM2 and superpixel-based methods. Experiments on two diverse underwater
datasets demonstrate the benefits of SparseUWSeg over state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving up to +5\% mIoU over D+NN. Our main contribution is the

*Cristiano Patrício,Luís F. Teixeira,João C. Neves*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViConEx-Med is a transformer-based framework that jointly predicts and localizes visual concepts using multi-concept learnable tokens and specialized attention layers, outperforming prior concept-based models in medical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing concept-based models treat concepts as numerical attributes without visual explanations, limiting their utility in real-world applications, especially in high-stakes medical scenarios where visual localization of concepts is crucial.

Method: Proposes a transformer-based framework with multi-concept learnable tokens and specialized attention layers for processing visual and text-based concept tokens to jointly predict and localize visual concepts.

Result: Outperforms prior concept-based models and achieves competitive performance with black-box models in both concept detection and localization precision on synthetic and real-world medical datasets.

Conclusion: ViConEx-Med represents a promising direction for building inherently interpretable models grounded in visual concepts, with publicly available code for further development and application.

Abstract: Concept-based models aim to explain model decisions with human-understandable
concepts. However, most existing approaches treat concepts as numerical
attributes, without providing complementary visual explanations that could
localize the predicted concepts. This limits their utility in real-world
applications and particularly in high-stakes scenarios, such as medical
use-cases. This paper proposes ViConEx-Med, a novel transformer-based framework
for visual concept explainability, which introduces multi-concept learnable
tokens to jointly predict and localize visual concepts. By leveraging
specialized attention layers for processing visual and text-based concept
tokens, our method produces concept-level localization maps while maintaining
high predictive accuracy. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world medical
datasets demonstrate that ViConEx-Med outperforms prior concept-based models
and achieves competitive performance with black-box models in terms of both
concept detection and localization precision. Our results suggest a promising
direction for building inherently interpretable models grounded in visual
concepts. Code is publicly available at

### [55] [HccePose(BF): Predicting Front \& Back Surfaces to Construct Ultra-Dense 2D-3D Correspondences for Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10177)
*Yulin Wang,Mengting Hu,Hongli Li,Chen Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel pose estimation method that predicts 3D coordinates for both front and back surfaces of objects and creates ultra-dense 2D-3D correspondences, outperforming SOTA methods on BOP datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pose estimation methods focus only on the object's front surface, overlooking the potential benefits of incorporating the back surface and interior for more accurate pose estimation.

Method: Predicts 3D coordinates of both front and back surfaces, densely samples 3D coordinates between them to create ultra-dense 2D-3D correspondences, and uses Hierarchical Continuous Coordinate Encoding (HCCE) for accurate representation.

Result: Outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across seven classic BOP core datasets, demonstrating improved pose estimation accuracy.

Conclusion: Incorporating both front and back surfaces with ultra-dense sampling significantly enhances pose estimation performance compared to methods that only use front surface information.

Abstract: In pose estimation for seen objects, a prevalent pipeline involves using
neural networks to predict dense 3D coordinates of the object surface on 2D
images, which are then used to establish dense 2D-3D correspondences. However,
current methods primarily focus on more efficient encoding techniques to
improve the precision of predicted 3D coordinates on the object's front
surface, overlooking the potential benefits of incorporating the back surface
and interior of the object. To better utilize the full surface and interior of
the object, this study predicts 3D coordinates of both the object's front and
back surfaces and densely samples 3D coordinates between them. This process
creates ultra-dense 2D-3D correspondences, effectively enhancing pose
estimation accuracy based on the Perspective-n-Point (PnP) algorithm.
Additionally, we propose Hierarchical Continuous Coordinate Encoding (HCCE) to
provide a more accurate and efficient representation of front and back surface
coordinates. Experimental results show that, compared to existing
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on the BOP website, the proposed approach
outperforms across seven classic BOP core datasets. Code is available at

*Zixu Zhao,Yang Zhan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces DVTMD, a new drone video-text dataset with fine-grained captions, and proposes TCMA framework for text-video retrieval in UAV domains, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UAVs produce massive aerial videos, but efficient content retrieval is challenging due to limitations in existing datasets with coarse and redundant captions. The drone domain for text-video retrieval remains underexplored.

Method: Constructed DVTMD dataset with 2,864 videos and 14,320 fine-grained captions. Proposed TCMA framework with global video-sentence alignment, sentence-guided frame aggregation, word-guided patch alignment, Word and Patch Selection module, and Text-Adaptive Dynamic Temperature Mechanism.

Result: Achieved 45.5% R@1 in text-to-video and 42.8% R@1 in video-to-text retrieval on DVTMD and CapERA datasets, establishing the first complete benchmark for drone text-video retrieval.

Conclusion: The proposed dataset and TCMA framework effectively address the challenges of drone video-text retrieval, demonstrating superior performance and providing a solid foundation for future research in this domain.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become powerful platforms for real-time,
high-resolution data collection, producing massive volumes of aerial videos.
Efficient retrieval of relevant content from these videos is crucial for
applications in urban management, emergency response, security, and disaster
relief. While text-video retrieval has advanced in natural video domains, the
UAV domain remains underexplored due to limitations in existing datasets, such
as coarse and redundant captions. Thus, in this work, we construct the Drone
Video-Text Match Dataset (DVTMD), which contains 2,864 videos and 14,320
fine-grained, semantically diverse captions. The annotations capture multiple
complementary aspects, including human actions, objects, background settings,
environmental conditions, and visual style, thereby enhancing text-video
correspondence and reducing redundancy. Building on this dataset, we propose
the Text-Conditioned Multi-granularity Alignment (TCMA) framework, which
integrates global video-sentence alignment, sentence-guided frame aggregation,
and word-guided patch alignment. To further refine local alignment, we design a
Word and Patch Selection module that filters irrelevant content, as well as a
Text-Adaptive Dynamic Temperature Mechanism that adapts attention sharpness to
text type. Extensive experiments on DVTMD and CapERA establish the first
complete benchmark for drone text-video retrieval. Our TCMA achieves
state-of-the-art performance, including 45.5% R@1 in text-to-video and 42.8%
R@1 in video-to-text retrieval, demonstrating the effectiveness of our dataset
and method. The code and dataset will be released.

*Haohua Dong,Ana Manzano Rodríguez,Camille Guinaudeau,Shin'ichi Satoh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pseudo-balancing is a semi-supervised method that improves gender classification fairness by enforcing demographic balance during pseudo-label selection using unlabeled race-balanced data, achieving significant accuracy gains and fairness improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face gender classification models often reflect and amplify demographic biases from training data, leading to uneven performance across gender and racial subgroups.

Method: Pseudo-balancing enforces demographic balance during pseudo-label selection using only unlabeled images from a race-balanced dataset without requiring ground-truth annotations. Evaluated through fine-tuning biased classifiers and stress-testing with imbalanced data.

Result: Achieved 79.81% overall accuracy (6.53% improvement over baseline), reduced gender accuracy gap by 44.17%, and narrowed East Asian subgroup disparity from over 49% to just 5.01%.

Conclusion: Even without label supervision, access to demographically balanced unlabeled datasets can effectively debias existing computer vision models while preserving or enhancing accuracy.

Abstract: Face gender classification models often reflect and amplify demographic
biases present in their training data, leading to uneven performance across
gender and racial subgroups. We introduce pseudo-balancing, a simple and
effective strategy for mitigating such biases in semi-supervised learning. Our
method enforces demographic balance during pseudo-label selection, using only
unlabeled images from a race-balanced dataset without requiring access to
ground-truth annotations.
  We evaluate pseudo-balancing under two conditions: (1) fine-tuning a biased
gender classifier using unlabeled images from the FairFace dataset, and (2)
stress-testing the method with intentionally imbalanced training data to
simulate controlled bias scenarios. In both cases, models are evaluated on the
All-Age-Faces (AAF) benchmark, which contains a predominantly East Asian
population. Our results show that pseudo-balancing consistently improves
fairness while preserving or enhancing accuracy. The method achieves 79.81%
overall accuracy - a 6.53% improvement over the baseline - and reduces the
gender accuracy gap by 44.17%. In the East Asian subgroup, where baseline
disparities exceeded 49%, the gap is narrowed to just 5.01%. These findings
suggest that even in the absence of label supervision, access to a
demographically balanced or moderately skewed unlabeled dataset can serve as a
powerful resource for debiasing existing computer vision models.

*Feng Xiao,Hongbin Xu,Hai Ci,Wenxiong Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel progressive relational learning framework for 3D object grounding that extends from binary to n-ary relationships to better handle complex spatial descriptions involving multiple objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods only model pairwise object relationships, ignoring the global perceptual significance of n-ary combinations in multi-modal relational understanding, which is essential for handling complex natural language descriptions involving multiple spatial relationships.

Method: Proposed a progressive relational learning framework that extends from binary to n-ary relationships, uses grouped supervision loss for n-ary relational learning, and employs a multi-modal network with hybrid attention mechanisms within scene graphs created with n-ary relationships.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on ReferIt3D and ScanRefer benchmarks, demonstrating the advantages of n-ary relational perception in 3D localization.

Conclusion: The n-ary relational learning approach effectively addresses the limitations of pairwise relationship modeling and proves superior for 3D object grounding with complex natural language descriptions.

Abstract: Localizing 3D objects using natural language is essential for robotic scene
understanding. The descriptions often involve multiple spatial relationships to
distinguish similar objects, making 3D-language alignment difficult. Current
methods only model relationships for pairwise objects, ignoring the global
perceptual significance of n-ary combinations in multi-modal relational
understanding. To address this, we propose a novel progressive relational
learning framework for 3D object grounding. We extend relational learning from
binary to n-ary to identify visual relations that match the referential
description globally. Given the absence of specific annotations for referred
objects in the training data, we design a grouped supervision loss to
facilitate n-ary relational learning. In the scene graph created with n-ary
relationships, we use a multi-modal network with hybrid attention mechanisms to
further localize the target within the n-ary combinations. Experiments and
ablation studies on the ReferIt3D and ScanRefer benchmarks demonstrate that our
method outperforms the state-of-the-art, and proves the advantages of the n-ary
relational perception in 3D localization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CerS-Path is a cervical subspecialty pathology diagnostic system that uses two-stage pretraining (self-supervised learning on 190M tissue patches and multimodal enhancement with 2.5M image-text pairs) to support eight diagnostic functions, achieving 99.38% screening sensitivity in multi-center testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cervical cancer requires complex histopathological assessments, but current deep learning models lack accuracy and generalizability, while general foundation models fail to capture subspecialty-specific features and task adaptability.

Method: Two synergistic pretraining stages: self-supervised learning on ~190M tissue patches from 140K slides to build cervical-specific feature extractor, and multimodal enhancement with 2.5M image-text pairs, followed by integration with multiple downstream diagnostic functions.

Result: CerS-Path surpasses prior foundation models in scope and clinical applicability, achieving 99.38% screening sensitivity in prospective testing on 3,173 cases across five centers with excellent generalizability.

Conclusion: The system represents a significant advance in cervical pathology with potential for subspecialty diagnostic translation and cervical cancer screening.

Abstract: Cervical cancer remains a major malignancy, necessitating extensive and
complex histopathological assessments and comprehensive support tools. Although
deep learning shows promise, these models still lack accuracy and
generalizability. General foundation models offer a broader reach but remain
limited in capturing subspecialty-specific features and task adaptability. We
introduce the Cervical Subspecialty Pathology (CerS-Path) diagnostic system,
developed through two synergistic pretraining stages: self-supervised learning
on approximately 190 million tissue patches from 140,000 slides to build a
cervical-specific feature extractor, and multimodal enhancement with 2.5
million image-text pairs, followed by integration with multiple downstream
diagnostic functions. Supporting eight diagnostic functions, including rare
cancer classification and multimodal Q&A, CerS-Path surpasses prior foundation
models in scope and clinical applicability. Comprehensive evaluations
demonstrate a significant advance in cervical pathology, with prospective
testing on 3,173 cases across five centers maintaining 99.38% screening
sensitivity and excellent generalizability, highlighting its potential for

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes SEDD metric and framework to quantify synthetic-to-real gap in autonomous driving perception systems, enabling systematic evaluation of synthetic dataset utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world testing of autonomous driving systems is impractical, while synthetic datasets suffer from domain gap issues that limit model generalization. Quantifying this gap is essential for dataset evaluation and training pipeline design.

Method: Uses Gram matrix-based style extraction combined with metric learning optimized for intra-class compactness and inter-class separation to extract style embeddings, then measures distribution discrepancy.

Result: Experiments on various datasets and sim-to-real methods show the proposed SEDD metric effectively quantifies synthetic-to-real gap.

Conclusion: Provides a standardized quality control tool for systematic diagnosis and enhancement of synthetic datasets, advancing data-driven autonomous driving development.

Abstract: Ensuring the reliability of autonomous driving perception systems requires
extensive environment-based testing, yet real-world execution is often
impractical. Synthetic datasets have therefore emerged as a promising
alternative, offering advantages such as cost-effectiveness, bias free
labeling, and controllable scenarios. However, the domain gap between synthetic
and real-world datasets remains a critical bottleneck for the generalization of
AI-based autonomous driving models. Quantifying this synthetic-to-real gap is
thus essential for evaluating dataset utility and guiding the design of more
effective training pipelines. In this paper, we establish a systematic
framework for quantifying the synthetic-to-real gap in autonomous driving
systems, and propose Style Embedding Distribution Discrepancy (SEDD) as a novel
evaluation metric. Our framework combines Gram matrix-based style extraction
with metric learning optimized for intra-class compactness and inter-class
separation to extract style embeddings. Furthermore, we establish a benchmark
using publicly available datasets. Experiments are conducted on a variety of
datasets and sim-to-real methods, and the results show that our method is
capable of quantifying the synthetic-to-real gap. This work provides a
standardized quality control tool that enables systematic diagnosis and
targeted enhancement of synthetic datasets, advancing future development of
data-driven autonomous driving systems.

TL;DR: AnomReason is a large-scale benchmark for semantic anomaly detection in AI-generated images, featuring structured quadruple annotations and a multi-agent annotation pipeline called AnomAgent. Models fine-tuned on this dataset show improved performance in detecting semantic inconsistencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-generated images often contain subtle semantic anomalies like unrealistic object configurations, physical law violations, and commonsense inconsistencies that compromise plausibility. Detecting these semantic-level anomalies is crucial for assessing AIGC trustworthiness in applications like explainable deepfake detection and semantic authenticity assessment.

Method: Introduced AnomReason benchmark with structured quadruple annotations (Name, Phenomenon, Reasoning, Severity) created using AnomAgent - a modular multi-agent pipeline with lightweight human-in-the-loop verification. Processed ~4.17B GPT-4o tokens for scale. Proposed semantic matching metrics (SemAP and SemF1) for evaluation.

Result: Models fine-tuned on AnomReason achieve consistent performance gains over strong vision-language baselines. The approach demonstrates practical utility in explainable deepfake detection and semantic reasonableness assessment of image generators.

Conclusion: AnomReason and AnomAgent provide a foundation for measuring and improving semantic plausibility of AI-generated images. The framework supports reproducible research on semantic authenticity and interpretable AIGC forensics through released code, metrics, data, and task-aligned models.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of
  AI-generated content (AIGC) has enabled the synthesis of visually convincing
images; however, many such outputs exhibit subtle \textbf{semantic anomalies},
including unrealistic object configurations, violations of physical laws, or
commonsense inconsistencies, which compromise the overall plausibility of the
generated scenes. Detecting these semantic-level anomalies
  is essential for assessing the trustworthiness of AIGC media, especially in
AIGC image analysis, explainable deepfake detection and semantic authenticity
assessment. In this paper,
  we formalize \textbf{semantic anomaly detection and reasoning} for AIGC
images and
  introduce \textbf{AnomReason}, a large-scale benchmark with structured
annotations as quadruples \emph{(Name, Phenomenon, Reasoning, Severity)}.
Annotations are produced by
  a modular multi-agent pipeline (\textbf{AnomAgent}) with lightweight
human-in-the-loop verification, enabling scale while preserving quality.
  At construction time, AnomAgent processed approximately 4.17\,B GPT-4o
tokens, providing scale evidence for the resulting structured annotations. We
further
  show that models fine-tuned on AnomReason achieve consistent gains over
strong vision-language baselines under our proposed semantic matching metric
(\textit{SemAP} and \textit{SemF1}).
  Applications to {explainable deepfake detection} and {semantic reasonableness
assessment of image generators} demonstrate practical utility. In summary,
AnomReason and AnomAgent
  serve as a foundation for measuring and improving the semantic plausibility
of AI-generated images. We will release code, metrics, data, and task-aligned

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A large vision model (LVM) demonstrates strong zero-shot performance on medical imaging tasks including organ segmentation, denoising, super-resolution, and motion prediction, despite no prior training on medical data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether autoregressive video modeling principles can be directly applied to medical imaging tasks without domain-specific training, leveraging the zero-shot generalization capabilities of large generative models.

Method: Evaluated a large vision model (LVM) in zero-shot setting across four medical imaging tasks using 4D CT data from 122 patients (over 1,820 3D CT volumes), testing organ segmentation, denoising, super-resolution, and motion prediction without fine-tuning.

Result: The LVM successfully delineated anatomical structures in CT scans and achieved competitive performance on segmentation, denoising, and super-resolution. Most notably, it produced anatomically consistent predictions for radiotherapy motion prediction, capturing patient-specific respiratory dynamics with realistic temporal coherence, surpassing specialized baselines and achieving state-of-the-art spatial accuracy.

Conclusion: Large vision models exhibit emergent zero-shot capabilities in medical video modeling, demonstrating potential as unified learners and reasoners for medical foundation models built on video modeling principles.

Abstract: Recent advances in large generative models have shown that simple
autoregressive formulations, when scaled appropriately, can exhibit strong
zero-shot generalization across domains. Motivated by this trend, we
investigate whether autoregressive video modeling principles can be directly
applied to medical imaging tasks, despite the model never being trained on
medical data. Specifically, we evaluate a large vision model (LVM) in a
zero-shot setting across four representative tasks: organ segmentation,
denoising, super-resolution, and motion prediction. Remarkably, even without
domain-specific fine-tuning, the LVM can delineate anatomical structures in CT
scans and achieve competitive performance on segmentation, denoising, and
super-resolution. Most notably, in radiotherapy motion prediction, the model
forecasts future 3D CT phases directly from prior phases of a 4D CT scan,
producing anatomically consistent predictions that capture patient-specific
respiratory dynamics with realistic temporal coherence. We evaluate the LVM on
4D CT data from 122 patients, totaling over 1,820 3D CT volumes. Despite no
prior exposure to medical data, the model achieves strong performance across
all tasks and surpasses specialized DVF-based and generative baselines in
motion prediction, achieving state-of-the-art spatial accuracy. These findings
reveal the emergence of zero-shot capabilities in medical video modeling and
highlight the potential of general-purpose video models to serve as unified
learners and reasoners laying the groundwork for future medical foundation
models built on video models.

*Abdelrhman Elrawy,Emad A. Mohammed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework that improves 3D Gaussian Splatting efficiency in few-shot scenarios by replacing positional gradient heuristic with opacity gradient-based densification trigger and conservative pruning, achieving 40-70% reduction in primitives with minimal quality trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting struggles with overfitting and bloated reconstructions in few-shot scenarios, and existing methods like FSGS improve quality but significantly increase primitive count, lacking efficiency.

Method: Replaces standard positional gradient heuristic with opacity gradient as densification trigger, implements conservative pruning schedule to prevent destructive optimization cycles, and uses depth-correlation loss for geometric guidance.

Result: Achieves over 40% more compactness (32k vs 57k primitives) on 3-view LLFF dataset and ~70% reduction on Mip-NeRF 360 dataset with modest trade-off in reconstruction metrics.

Conclusion: Establishes new state-of-the-art on quality-vs-efficiency Pareto frontier for few-shot view synthesis by fundamentally improving 3DGS optimization efficiency.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) struggles in few-shot scenarios, where its
standard adaptive density control (ADC) can lead to overfitting and bloated
reconstructions. While state-of-the-art methods like FSGS improve quality, they
often do so by significantly increasing the primitive count. This paper
presents a framework that revises the core 3DGS optimization to prioritize
efficiency. We replace the standard positional gradient heuristic with a novel
densification trigger that uses the opacity gradient as a lightweight proxy for
rendering error. We find this aggressive densification is only effective when
paired with a more conservative pruning schedule, which prevents destructive
optimization cycles. Combined with a standard depth-correlation loss for
geometric guidance, our framework demonstrates a fundamental improvement in
efficiency. On the 3-view LLFF dataset, our model is over 40% more compact (32k
vs. 57k primitives) than FSGS, and on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset, it achieves a
reduction of approximately 70%. This dramatic gain in compactness is achieved
with a modest trade-off in reconstruction metrics, establishing a new
state-of-the-art on the quality-vs-efficiency Pareto frontier for few-shot view
synthesis.

TL;DR: VividAnimator is an end-to-end framework for high-quality half-body human animation driven by audio and sparse hand poses, addressing stiff head movements and blurry hands through three innovations: Hand Clarity Codebook, Dual-Stream Audio-Aware Module, and Pose Calibration Trick.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing audio- and pose-driven human animation methods suffer from stiff head movements and blurry hands due to weak audio-head correlation and hand structural complexity.

Method: Three key components: 1) Pre-trained Hand Clarity Codebook (HCC) for high-fidelity hand texture priors, 2) Dual-Stream Audio-Aware Module (DSAA) for separate modeling of lip sync and head pose dynamics with interaction, 3) Pose Calibration Trick (PCT) for refining pose conditions with relaxed constraints.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior hand detail, gesture realism, and identity consistency, validated by quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations.

Conclusion: VividAnimator effectively addresses key challenges in human animation by combining pre-trained hand priors, dual-stream audio modeling, and pose refinement, producing high-quality animations with natural movements and clear hand details.

Abstract: Existing for audio- and pose-driven human animation methods often struggle
with stiff head movements and blurry hands, primarily due to the weak
correlation between audio and head movements and the structural complexity of
hands. To address these issues, we propose VividAnimator, an end-to-end
framework for generating high-quality, half-body human animations driven by
audio and sparse hand pose conditions. Our framework introduces three key
innovations. First, to overcome the instability and high cost of online
codebook training, we pre-train a Hand Clarity Codebook (HCC) that encodes
rich, high-fidelity hand texture priors, significantly mitigating hand
degradation. Second, we design a Dual-Stream Audio-Aware Module (DSAA) to model
lip synchronization and natural head pose dynamics separately while enabling
interaction. Third, we introduce a Pose Calibration Trick (PCT) that refines
and aligns pose conditions by relaxing rigid constraints, ensuring smooth and
natural gesture transitions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Vivid
Animator achieves state-of-the-art performance, producing videos with superior
hand detail, gesture realism, and identity consistency, validated by both
quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations.

Motivation: Current approaches rely exclusively on either perspective-view or bird's-eye-view features, limiting their ability to leverage both fine-grained object details and spatially structured scene representations.

Method: Proposes a hybrid framework that incorporates both PV and BEV camera image features, introduces BEV maps guided by foundation models using DINOv2 features, and employs a novel distillation process with deformable aggregation to integrate PV features with enriched BEV representations.

Result: Extensive experiments on nuScenes and Argoverse 2 benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in 3D object detection and tracking.

Conclusion: The approach showcases the potential of foundation model BEV maps to enable more reliable perception for autonomous driving, with code and pre-trained models made publicly available.

Abstract: Camera-based 3D object detection and tracking are essential for perception in
autonomous driving. Current state-of-the-art approaches often rely exclusively
on either perspective-view (PV) or bird's-eye-view (BEV) features, limiting
their ability to leverage both fine-grained object details and spatially
structured scene representations. In this work, we propose DualViewDistill, a
hybrid detection and tracking framework that incorporates both PV and BEV
camera image features to leverage their complementary strengths. Our approach
introduces BEV maps guided by foundation models, leveraging descriptive DINOv2
features that are distilled into BEV representations through a novel
distillation process. By integrating PV features with BEV maps enriched with
semantic and geometric features from DINOv2, our model leverages this hybrid
representation via deformable aggregation to enhance 3D object detection and
tracking. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 benchmarks
demonstrate that DualViewDistill achieves state-of-the-art performance. The
results showcase the potential of foundation model BEV maps to enable more

TL;DR: SAM2LoRA is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that adapts SAM2 for fundus image segmentation using low-rank adapters, achieving state-of-the-art performance with less than 5% trainable parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While SAM2 enables rapid inference for medical image segmentation, fine-tuning remains challenging due to computational constraints. The goal is to efficiently adapt SAM2 for fundus image segmentation tasks.

Method: Integrates low-rank adapters (LoRA) into both image encoder and mask decoder of SAM2. Uses composite loss function combining segmentationBCE, SoftDice, and FocalTversky losses for optimal tuning.

Result: Achieves Dice scores of 0.86 for blood vessel and 0.93 for optic disc segmentation, with AUC values up to 0.98 and 0.99 respectively. Outperforms existing methods on 11 fundus datasets while reducing training parameters by over 95%.

Conclusion: SAM2LoRA provides an effective parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy for adapting SAM2 to fundus segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art performance with significantly reduced computational overhead.

Abstract: We propose SAM2LoRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy that adapts
the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) for fundus image segmentation. SAM2 employs
a masked autoencoder-pretrained Hierarchical Vision Transformer for multi-scale
feature decoding, enabling rapid inference in low-resource settings; however,
fine-tuning remains challenging. To address this, SAM2LoRA integrates a
low-rank adapter into both the image encoder and mask decoder, requiring fewer
than 5\% of the original trainable parameters. Our analysis indicates that for
cross-dataset fundus segmentation tasks, a composite loss function combining
segmentationBCE, SoftDice, and FocalTversky losses is essential for optimal
network tuning. Evaluated on 11 challenging fundus segmentation datasets,
SAM2LoRA demonstrates high performance in both blood vessel and optic disc
segmentation under cross-dataset training conditions. It achieves Dice scores
of up to 0.86 and 0.93 for blood vessel and optic disc segmentation,
respectively, and AUC values of up to 0.98 and 0.99, achieving state-of-the-art
performance while substantially reducing training overhead.

*Joy Hsu,Emily Jin,Jiajun Wu,Niloy J. Mitra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FactoredScenes is a framework that generates realistic 3D scenes by decomposing them into hierarchical concepts of room programs and object poses, using learned layout patterns and program-conditioned pose prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world scenes are difficult to capture with limited data available, and generating realistic scenes with varied object poses remains a challenging task.

Method: Uses a factored representation that decomposes scenes into room programs and object poses, learns a library of layout patterns, employs large language models to generate programs, and uses program-conditioned models to hierarchically predict object poses.

Result: Generates realistic, real-world rooms that are difficult to distinguish from real ScanNet scenes.

Conclusion: FactoredScenes successfully synthesizes realistic 3D scenes by leveraging room structure and learning object pose variations from lived-in scenes.

Abstract: Real-world scenes, such as those in ScanNet, are difficult to capture, with
highly limited data available. Generating realistic scenes with varied object
poses remains an open and challenging task. In this work, we propose
FactoredScenes, a framework that synthesizes realistic 3D scenes by leveraging
the underlying structure of rooms while learning the variation of object poses
from lived-in scenes. We introduce a factored representation that decomposes
scenes into hierarchically organized concepts of room programs and object
poses. To encode structure, FactoredScenes learns a library of functions
capturing reusable layout patterns from which scenes are drawn, then uses large
language models to generate high-level programs, regularized by the learned
library. To represent scene variations, FactoredScenes learns a
program-conditioned model to hierarchically predict object poses, and retrieves
and places 3D objects in a scene. We show that FactoredScenes generates
realistic, real-world rooms that are difficult to distinguish from real ScanNet
scenes.

Abstract: Accurate traffic congestion classification is essential for intelligent
transportation systems and real-time urban traffic management. This paper
presents a multimodal framework combining open-vocabulary visual-language
reasoning (CLIP), object detection (YOLO-World), and motion analysis via
MOG2-based background subtraction. The system predicts congestion levels on an

demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in preserving ordinal structure and
leveraging visual-language and motion modalities. Future enhancements include
incorporating vehicle sizing and refined density metrics.

*Rugved Katole,Christopher Stewart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ortho-Fuse enables reliable orthomosaic generation from sparse aerial imagery with 20% reduced overlap requirements using optical flow-based transitional image synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-driven crop health mapping faces adoption barriers due to technical limitations in orthomosaic generation from sparse imagery, requiring 70-80% overlap that resource-constrained systems cannot consistently achieve.

Method: Uses optical flow-based framework with intermediate flow estimation to synthesize transitional imagery between consecutive aerial frames, artificially augmenting feature correspondences for improved geometric reconstruction.

Result: Experimental validation demonstrates 20% reduction in minimum overlap requirements for reliable orthomosaic generation.

Conclusion: The approach addresses key adoption barriers in precision agriculture and enables enhanced integration of AI-driven monitoring systems under resource-constrained conditions.

Abstract: AI-driven crop health mapping systems offer substantial advantages over
conventional monitoring approaches through accelerated data acquisition and
cost reduction. However, widespread farmer adoption remains constrained by
technical limitations in orthomosaic generation from sparse aerial imagery
datasets. Traditional photogrammetric reconstruction requires 70-80\%
inter-image overlap to establish sufficient feature correspondences for
accurate geometric registration. AI-driven systems operating under
resource-constrained conditions cannot consistently achieve these overlap
thresholds, resulting in degraded reconstruction quality that undermines user
confidence in autonomous monitoring technologies. In this paper, we present
Ortho-Fuse, an optical flow-based framework that enables the generation of a
reliable orthomosaic with reduced overlap requirements. Our approach employs
intermediate flow estimation to synthesize transitional imagery between
consecutive aerial frames, artificially augmenting feature correspondences for
improved geometric reconstruction. Experimental validation demonstrates a 20\%
reduction in minimum overlap requirements. We further analyze adoption barriers
in precision agriculture to identify pathways for enhanced integration of
AI-driven monitoring systems.

*Linlian Jiang,Rui Ma,Li Gu,Ziqiang Wang,Xinxin Zuo,Yang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PointMAC is a meta-learned framework for test-time adaptation in point cloud completion that enables sample-specific refinement without additional supervision through self-supervised auxiliary objectives and meta-auxiliary learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing point cloud completion models perform static inference and rely heavily on inductive biases from training, limiting their ability to adapt to novel structural patterns and sensor-induced distortions at test time.

Method: Proposes PointMAC with meta-auxiliary learning based on MAML, using two self-supervised auxiliary objectives that simulate structural and sensor-level incompleteness. Features Adaptive λ-Calibration for gradient balancing and adapts only the shared encoder during inference while keeping decoder fixed.

Result: Extensive experiments on synthetic, simulated, and real-world datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art results by refining each sample individually to produce high-quality completions.

Conclusion: PointMAC is the first work to apply meta-auxiliary test-time adaptation to point cloud completion, achieving robust performance through sample-specific refinement without requiring additional supervision.

Abstract: Point cloud completion is essential for robust 3D perception in
safety-critical applications such as robotics and augmented reality. However,
existing models perform static inference and rely heavily on inductive biases
learned during training, limiting their ability to adapt to novel structural
patterns and sensor-induced distortions at test time. To address this
limitation, we propose PointMAC, a meta-learned framework for robust test-time
adaptation in point cloud completion. It enables sample-specific refinement
without requiring additional supervision. Our method optimizes the completion
model under two self-supervised auxiliary objectives that simulate structural
and sensor-level incompleteness. A meta-auxiliary learning strategy based on
Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) ensures that adaptation driven by auxiliary
objectives is consistently aligned with the primary completion task. During
inference, we adapt the shared encoder on-the-fly by optimizing auxiliary
losses, with the decoder kept fixed. To further stabilize adaptation, we
introduce Adaptive $\lambda$-Calibration, a meta-learned mechanism for
balancing gradients between primary and auxiliary objectives. Extensive
experiments on synthetic, simulated, and real-world datasets demonstrate that
PointMAC achieves state-of-the-art results by refining each sample individually
to produce high-quality completions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first work to apply meta-auxiliary test-time adaptation to point cloud
completion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) can achieve state-of-the-art performance on PPG signal analysis by transforming 1D signals into 2D image representations like STFT, outperforming specialized time-series models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether Vision Foundation Models can be effectively applied to PPG signal analysis, potentially providing better performance than specialized time-series models while offering computational efficiency.

Method: Transform 1D PPG signals into 2D image representations (STFT, recurrence plots), then fine-tune Vision Foundation Models (DINOv3, SIGLIP-2) using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning techniques.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on blood pressure estimation and promising results on other vital signs and blood lab measurements, with good generalization across different 2D representations.

Conclusion: Vision Foundation Models provide a powerful new approach for PPG analysis that outperforms specialized time-series models while being computationally efficient through PEFT techniques.

Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor in wearable and clinical devices provides
valuable physiological insights in a non-invasive and real-time fashion.
Specialized Foundation Models (FM) or repurposed time-series FMs are used to
benchmark physiological tasks. Our experiments with fine-tuning FMs reveal that
Vision FM (VFM) can also be utilized for this purpose and, in fact,
surprisingly leads to state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on many tasks,
notably blood pressure estimation. We leverage VFMs by simply transforming
one-dimensional PPG signals into image-like two-dimensional representations,
such as the Short-Time Fourier transform (STFT). Using the latest VFMs, such as
DINOv3 and SIGLIP-2, we achieve promising performance on other vital signs and
blood lab measurement tasks as well. Our proposal, Vision4PPG, unlocks a new
class of FMs to achieve SOTA performance with notable generalization to other
2D input representations, including STFT phase and recurrence plots. Our work
improves upon prior investigations of vision models for PPG by conducting a
comprehensive study, comparing them to state-of-the-art time-series FMs, and
demonstrating the general PPG processing ability by reporting results on six
additional tasks. Thus, we provide clinician-scientists with a new set of
powerful tools that is also computationally efficient, thanks to
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of costly and time-intensive pixel-level annotations in pavement crack detection, enabling scalable and cost-effective infrastructure monitoring.

Method: Developed Crack-Segmenter with three modules: Scale-Adaptive Embedder for multi-scale feature extraction, Directional Attention Transformer for maintaining crack continuity, and Attention-Guided Fusion for adaptive feature integration.

Result: Outperformed 13 state-of-the-art supervised methods on ten public datasets across all major metrics including mIoU, Dice score, XOR, and Hausdorff Distance.

Conclusion: Annotation-free crack detection is not only feasible but superior, enabling scalable infrastructure monitoring and advancing self-supervised learning in pavement crack detection.

Abstract: Pavement crack detection has long depended on costly and time-intensive
pixel-level annotations, which limit its scalability for large-scale
infrastructure monitoring. To overcome this barrier, this paper examines the
feasibility of achieving effective pixel-level crack segmentation entirely
without manual annotations. Building on this objective, a fully self-supervised
framework, Crack-Segmenter, is developed, integrating three complementary
modules: the Scale-Adaptive Embedder (SAE) for robust multi-scale feature
extraction, the Directional Attention Transformer (DAT) for maintaining linear
crack continuity, and the Attention-Guided Fusion (AGF) module for adaptive
feature integration. Through evaluations on ten public datasets,
Crack-Segmenter consistently outperforms 13 state-of-the-art supervised methods
across all major metrics, including mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), Dice
score, XOR, and Hausdorff Distance (HD). These findings demonstrate that
annotation-free crack detection is not only feasible but also superior,
enabling transportation agencies and infrastructure managers to conduct
scalable and cost-effective monitoring. This work advances self-supervised
learning and motivates pavement cracks detection research.

### [74] [Identifying bias in CNN image classification using image scrambling and transforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10383)
*Sai Teja Erukude*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the "black box" problem in CNNs by proposing methods to identify hidden biases and distinguish between contextual information and background noise in image classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNNs operate as black boxes, making it difficult to understand which features influence decisions, potentially leading to biased results based on background information that users cannot detect.

Method: Two approaches: 1) Dividing images into smaller non-overlapping tiles and shuffling them randomly, 2) Applying image transforms (Fourier, Wavelet, Median filter) and their combinations to recover background noise information used by CNNs.

Result: The methods effectively distinguish between contextual information and background noise, and can detect background noise presence even without using background information, tested on six different datasets including natural, synthetic, and hybrid datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed techniques provide effective ways to identify dataset bias and separate foreground information from background noise, addressing the CNN black box problem and helping detect when models learn from irrelevant features.

Abstract: CNNs are now prevalent as the primary choice for most machine vision problems
due to their superior rate of classification and the availability of
user-friendly libraries. These networks effortlessly identify and select
features in a non-intuitive data-driven manner, making it difficult to
determine which features were most influential. That leads to a ``black box",
where users cannot know how the image data are analyzed but rely on empirical
results. Therefore the decision-making process can be biased by background
information that is difficult to detect. Here we discuss examples of such
hidden biases and propose techniques for identifying them, methods to
distinguish between contextual information and background noise, and explore
whether CNNs learn from irrelevant features. One effective approach to identify
dataset bias is to classify blank background parts of the images. However, in
some situations a blank background in the images is not available, making it
more difficult to separate the foreground information from the blank
background. Such parts of the image can also be considered contextual learning,
not necessarily bias. To overcome this, we propose two approaches that were
tested on six different datasets, including natural, synthetic, and hybrid
datasets. The first method involves dividing images into smaller,
non-overlapping tiles of various sizes, which are then shuffled randomly,
making classification more challenging. The second method involves the
application of several image transforms, including Fourier, Wavelet transforms,
and Median filter, and their combinations. These transforms help recover
background noise information used by CNN to classify images. Results indicate
that this method can effectively distinguish between contextual information and
background noise, and alert on the presence of background noise even without
the need to use background information.

Conclusion: AVoCaDO demonstrates the effectiveness of temporal orchestration between audio and visual modalities for audiovisual video captioning, with strong performance across multiple evaluation benchmarks.

Abstract: Audiovisual video captioning aims to generate semantically rich descriptions
with temporal alignment between visual and auditory events, thereby benefiting
both video understanding and generation. In this paper, we present AVoCaDO, a
powerful audiovisual video captioner driven by the temporal orchestration
between audio and visual modalities. We propose a two-stage post-training
pipeline: (1) AVoCaDO SFT, which fine-tunes the model on a newly curated
dataset of 107K high-quality, temporally-aligned audiovisual captions; and (2)
AVoCaDO GRPO, which leverages tailored reward functions to further enhance

*Zhao-Yang Wang,Jieneng Chen,Jiang Liu,Yuxiang Guo,Rama Chellappa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mesh-Gait is a novel multi-modal gait recognition framework that reconstructs 3D heatmaps from 2D silhouettes to combine the strengths of both 2D and 3D representations, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing gait recognition methods using 2D representations struggle with viewpoint variations, occlusions, and noise, while multi-modal approaches with 3D body shape are computationally expensive and impractical for real-time applications.

Method: Mesh-Gait reconstructs 3D heatmaps as intermediate representations from 2D silhouettes, enabling effective capture of 3D geometric information while maintaining computational efficiency. It uses supervised learning with loss calculated between reconstructed 3D joints, virtual markers, meshes and their ground truth.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mesh-Gait achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in gait recognition while avoiding the heavy computational overhead of direct 3D reconstruction from RGB videos.

Conclusion: Mesh-Gait provides an effective solution for robust gait recognition by combining 2D silhouette advantages with 3D geometric information through efficient intermediate 3D heatmap reconstruction, making it suitable for practical applications.

Abstract: Gait recognition, a fundamental biometric technology, leverages unique
walking patterns for individual identification, typically using 2D
representations such as silhouettes or skeletons. However, these methods often
struggle with viewpoint variations, occlusions, and noise. Multi-modal
approaches that incorporate 3D body shape information offer improved robustness
but are computationally expensive, limiting their feasibility for real-time
applications. To address these challenges, we introduce Mesh-Gait, a novel
end-to-end multi-modal gait recognition framework that directly reconstructs 3D
representations from 2D silhouettes, effectively combining the strengths of
both modalities. Compared to existing methods, directly learning 3D features
from 3D joints or meshes is complex and difficult to fuse with silhouette-based
gait features. To overcome this, Mesh-Gait reconstructs 3D heatmaps as an
intermediate representation, enabling the model to effectively capture 3D
geometric information while maintaining simplicity and computational
efficiency. During training, the intermediate 3D heatmaps are gradually
reconstructed and become increasingly accurate under supervised learning, where
the loss is calculated between the reconstructed 3D joints, virtual markers,
and 3D meshes and their corresponding ground truth, ensuring precise spatial
alignment and consistent 3D structure. Mesh-Gait extracts discriminative
features from both silhouettes and reconstructed 3D heatmaps in a
computationally efficient manner. This design enables the model to capture
spatial and structural gait characteristics while avoiding the heavy overhead
of direct 3D reconstruction from RGB videos, allowing the network to focus on
motion dynamics rather than irrelevant visual details. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Mesh-Gait achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. The code will be
released upon acceptance of the paper.

### [77] [Guided Image Feature Matching using Feature Spatial Order](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10414)
*Chin-Hung Teng,Ben-Jian Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes an efficient feature matching method that integrates feature spatial order with epipolar geometry in a progressive framework to improve matching speed and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional feature matching is time-consuming, especially for images with many features. Feature spatial order provides an independent concept from epipolar geometry that can complement it to guide feature matching more efficiently.

Method: The method uses initially matched features to build a computational model of feature spatial order, which calculates possible spatial ranges for subsequent matches to filter unnecessary comparisons. It integrates with epipolar geometry and includes image alignment to handle rotation effects.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets, simulated images, and real images show the proposed method is significantly more efficient and achieves more accurate feature matching than traditional methods.

Conclusion: Integrating feature spatial order with epipolar geometry in a progressive matching framework effectively improves both efficiency and accuracy of image feature matching.

Abstract: Image feature matching plays a vital role in many computer vision tasks.
Although many image feature detection and matching techniques have been
proposed over the past few decades, it is still time-consuming to match feature
points in two images, especially for images with a large number of detected
features. Feature spatial order can estimate the probability that a pair of
features is correct. Since it is a completely independent concept from epipolar
geometry, it can be used to complement epipolar geometry in guiding feature
match in a target region so as to improve matching efficiency. In this paper,
we integrate the concept of feature spatial order into a progressive matching
framework. We use some of the initially matched features to build a
computational model of feature spatial order and employs it to calculates the
possible spatial range of subsequent feature matches, thus filtering out
unnecessary feature matches. We also integrate it with epipolar geometry to
further improve matching efficiency and accuracy. Since the spatial order of
feature points is affected by image rotation, we propose a suitable image
alignment method from the fundamental matrix of epipolar geometry to remove the
effect of image rotation. To verify the feasibility of the proposed method, we
conduct a series of experiments, including a standard benchmark dataset,
self-generated simulated images, and real images. The results demonstrate that
our proposed method is significantly more efficient and has more accurate
feature matching than the traditional method.

TL;DR: A multi-modal framework combining 2D silhouettes and 3D SMPL features for gait recognition and human attribute estimation using unified transformer architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single modality approaches fail to capture full geometric and dynamic complexity of human walking patterns, especially in challenging conditions like long-range distances and extreme angles.

Method: Multi-modal and multi-task framework combining 2D temporal silhouettes with 3D SMPL features, using unified transformer to fuse features and jointly perform gait recognition and attribute estimation (age, BMI, gender).

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on large-scale BRIAR datasets under challenging conditions (1km distance, 50° pitch angles), providing accurate gait recognition and human attribute estimation.

Conclusion: Multi-modal and multitask learning shows promise for advancing gait-based human understanding in real-world scenarios by better capturing complex walking patterns.

Abstract: Gait recognition is an important biometric for human identification at a
distance, particularly under low-resolution or unconstrained environments.
Current works typically focus on either 2D representations (e.g., silhouettes
and skeletons) or 3D representations (e.g., meshes and SMPLs), but relying on a
single modality often fails to capture the full geometric and dynamic
complexity of human walking patterns. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal
and multi-task framework that combines 2D temporal silhouettes with 3D SMPL
features for robust gait analysis. Beyond identification, we introduce a
multitask learning strategy that jointly performs gait recognition and human
attribute estimation, including age, body mass index (BMI), and gender. A
unified transformer is employed to effectively fuse multi-modal gait features
and better learn attribute-related representations, while preserving
discriminative identity cues. Extensive experiments on the large-scale BRIAR
datasets, collected under challenging conditions such as long-range distances
(up to 1 km) and extreme pitch angles (up to 50{\deg}), demonstrate that our
approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in gait recognition and provides
accurate human attribute estimation. These results highlight the promise of
multi-modal and multitask learning for advancing gait-based human understanding
in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: This paper presents a video-based deep learning approach using InceptionV3 and LSTM networks to predict cybersickness severity in VR experiences, achieving 68.4% classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cybersickness remains a major barrier to VR adoption, and while multimodal approaches exist, there's limited research on using video-based features for cybersickness prediction.

Method: Transfer learning with InceptionV3 pretrained on ImageNet to extract visual features from VR gameplay videos, followed by LSTM network to capture temporal dynamics and predict cybersickness severity.

Result: Achieved 68.4% classification accuracy for cybersickness severity, outperforming existing video-only models.

Conclusion: The approach provides a practical tool for VR developers to evaluate and mitigate cybersickness, and establishes foundation for future video-based temporal modeling research in VR comfort enhancement.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of virtual reality (VR) technology, its adoption
across domains such as healthcare, education, and entertainment has grown
significantly. However, the persistent issue of cybersickness, marked by
symptoms resembling motion sickness, continues to hinder widespread acceptance
of VR. While recent research has explored multimodal deep learning approaches
leveraging data from integrated VR sensors like eye and head tracking, there
remains limited investigation into the use of video-based features for
predicting cybersickness. In this study, we address this gap by utilizing
transfer learning to extract high-level visual features from VR gameplay videos
using the InceptionV3 model pretrained on the ImageNet dataset. These features
are then passed to a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture the
temporal dynamics of the VR experience and predict cybersickness severity over
time. Our approach effectively leverages the time-series nature of video data,
achieving a 68.4% classification accuracy for cybersickness severity. This
surpasses the performance of existing models trained solely on video data,
providing a practical tool for VR developers to evaluate and mitigate
cybersickness in virtual environments. Furthermore, this work lays the
foundation for future research on video-based temporal modeling for enhancing
user comfort in VR applications.

### [80] [Taming a Retrieval Framework to Read Images in Humanlike Manner for Augmenting Generation of MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10426)
*Suyang Xi,Chenxi Yang,Hong Ding,Yiqing Ni,Catherine C. Liu,Yunhao Liu,Chengqi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HuLiRAG is a human-like retrieval-augmented generation framework that uses a "what-where-reweight" cascade with open-vocabulary detection, spatial resolution via SAM masks, and adaptive prioritization to improve fine-grained visual question answering and reduce hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs often fail in fine-grained visual QA due to hallucinations about object identities, positions, and relations, as textual queries aren't explicitly anchored to visual referents. Existing RAG methods focus only on global-level information and lack local detail reasoning.

Method: A three-stage cascade: 1) "what" - anchor queries to candidate referents via open-vocabulary detection, 2) "where" - spatially resolve with SAM-derived masks for fine-grained precision, 3) "reweight" - adaptively prioritize through local-global alignment trade-off. Mask-guided fine-tuning injects spatial evidence as explicit constraints.

Result: Extensive experiments show the human-like cascade improves grounding fidelity and factual consistency while reducing hallucinations in multimodal question answering.

Conclusion: HuLiRAG advances multimodal question answering toward trustworthy reasoning by transforming grounding from passive bias into explicit constraints through human-like processing stages.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often fail in fine-grained visual
question answering, producing hallucinations about object identities,
positions, and relations because textual queries are not explicitly anchored to
visual referents. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) alleviates some errors,
but it fails to align with human-like processing at both the retrieval and
augmentation levels. Specifically, it focuses only on global-level image
information but lacks local detail and limits reasoning about fine-grained
interactions. To overcome this limitation, we present Human-Like
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (HuLiRAG), a framework that stages multimodal
reasoning as a ``what--where--reweight'' cascade. Queries are first anchored to
candidate referents via open-vocabulary detection (what), then spatially
resolved with SAM-derived masks to recover fine-grained precision (where), and
adaptively prioritized through the trade-off between local and global alignment
(reweight). Mask-guided fine-tuning further injects spatial evidence into the
generation process, transforming grounding from a passive bias into an explicit
constraint on answer formulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this
human-like cascade improves grounding fidelity and factual consistency while
reducing hallucinations, advancing multimodal question answering toward
trustworthy reasoning.

*Kangjian Zhu,Haobo Jiang,Yigong Zhang,Jianjun Qian,Jian Yang,Jin Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MonoSE(3)-Diffusion is a monocular SE(3) diffusion framework that formulates markerless robot pose estimation as a conditional denoising diffusion process, achieving significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current robot pose estimation methods that use fixed-scale perturbations, which may not generate diverse and in-view training poses, leading to poor generalization capability.

Method: The framework uses a visibility-constrained diffusion process for diverse pose augmentation and a timestep-aware reverse process for progressive pose refinement. It integrates visibility constraints to ensure transformations remain within camera field of view.

Result: Achieves notable AUC of 66.75 on the most challenging dataset (DREAM and RoboKeyGen benchmarks), representing a 32.3% gain over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed diffusion-based approach demonstrates higher robustness than direct prediction methods and significantly improves pose estimation accuracy through its timestep-aware refinement scheme.

Abstract: We propose MonoSE(3)-Diffusion, a monocular SE(3) diffusion framework that
formulates markerless, image-based robot pose estimation as a conditional
denoising diffusion process. The framework consists of two processes: a
visibility-constrained diffusion process for diverse pose augmentation and a
timestep-aware reverse process for progressive pose refinement. The diffusion
process progressively perturbs ground-truth poses to noisy transformations for
training a pose denoising network. Importantly, we integrate visibility
constraints into the process, ensuring the transformations remain within the
camera field of view. Compared to the fixed-scale perturbations used in current
methods, the diffusion process generates in-view and diverse training poses,
thereby improving the network generalization capability. Furthermore, the
reverse process iteratively predicts the poses by the denoising network and
refines pose estimates by sampling from the diffusion posterior of current
timestep, following a scheduled coarse-to-fine procedure. Moreover, the
timestep indicates the transformation scales, which guide the denoising network
to achieve more accurate pose predictions. The reverse process demonstrates
higher robustness than direct prediction, benefiting from its timestep-aware
refinement scheme. Our approach demonstrates improvements across two benchmarks
(DREAM and RoboKeyGen), achieving a notable AUC of 66.75 on the most
challenging dataset, representing a 32.3% gain over the state-of-the-art.

### [82] [On the Problem of Consistent Anomalies in Zero-Shot Industrial Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10456)
*Tai Le-Gia,Ahn Jaehyun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoDeGraph is a novel zero-shot anomaly detection method that identifies and filters consistent anomalies using graph-based community detection, addressing limitations of existing methods that struggle with recurring defects across multiple images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing representation-based methods for zero-shot anomaly classification and segmentation perform poorly on consistent anomalies - similar defects that recur across multiple images, which is common in industrial quality control.

Method: CoDeGraph constructs an image-level graph where images are nodes and edges connect those with shared consistent-anomaly patterns. It uses community detection to filter these anomalies based on the insight that normal patches show stable similarity while consistent-anomaly patches exhibit 'neighbor-burnout' - abrupt similarity spikes after exhausting limited similar matches.

Result: Achieves 98.3% AUROC for anomaly classification and significant improvements in segmentation: 66.8% F1 (+4.2%) and 68.1% AP (+5.4%) over state-of-the-art methods on MVTec AD with ViT-L-14-336 backbone. With DINOv2 backbone, further improves to 69.1% F1 (+6.5%) and 71.9% AP (+9.2%).

Conclusion: CoDeGraph effectively addresses the consistent anomaly problem in zero-shot industrial defect detection, demonstrating robust performance across different architectures and providing theoretical foundation using Extreme Value Theory.

Abstract: Zero-shot image anomaly classification (AC) and segmentation (AS) are vital
for industrial quality control, detecting defects without prior training data.
Existing representation-based methods compare patch features with nearest
neighbors in unlabeled test images but struggle with consistent anomalies --
similar defects recurring across multiple images -- resulting in poor AC/AS
performance. We introduce Consistent-Anomaly Detection Graph (CoDeGraph), a
novel algorithm that identifies and filters consistent anomalies from
similarity computations. Our key insight is that normal patches in industrial
images show stable, gradually increasing similarity to other test images, while
consistent-anomaly patches exhibit abrupt similarity spikes after exhausting a
limited set of similar matches, a phenomenon we term ``neighbor-burnout.''
CoDeGraph constructs an image-level graph, with images as nodes and edges
connecting those with shared consistent-anomaly patterns, using community
detection to filter these anomalies. We provide a theoretical foundation using
Extreme Value Theory to explain the effectiveness of our approach. Experiments
on MVTec AD with the ViT-L-14-336 backbone achieve 98.3% AUROC for AC and AS
performance of 66.8% (+4.2%) F1 and 68.1% (+5.4%) AP over state-of-the-art
zero-shot methods. Using the DINOv2 backbone further improves segmentation,
yielding 69.1% (+6.5%) F1 and 71.9% (+9.2%) AP, demonstrating robustness across
architectures.

TL;DR: A new group decision simulation framework for medical image segmentation that treats expert disagreement as valuable clinical uncertainty rather than noise, achieving state-of-the-art results on CBCT and MRI datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard approaches that average expert labels discard valuable clinical uncertainty revealed in inter-rater variability due to differences in annotator expertise and medical image blurriness.

Method: A framework with Expert Signature Generator (ESG) to learn individual annotator styles in a latent space, and Simulated Consultation Module (SCM) to intelligently generate final segmentation by sampling from this space.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art results with 92.11% and 90.72% Dice scores on challenging CBCT and MRI datasets.

Conclusion: Treating expert disagreement as a useful signal instead of noise provides a clear path toward more robust and trustworthy AI systems for healthcare.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation annotation suffers from inter-rater variability
(IRV) due to differences in annotators' expertise and the inherent blurriness
of medical images. Standard approaches that simply average expert labels are
flawed, as they discard the valuable clinical uncertainty revealed in
disagreements. We introduce a fundamentally new approach with our group
decision simulation framework, which works by mimicking the collaborative
decision-making process of a clinical panel. Under this framework, an Expert
Signature Generator (ESG) learns to represent individual annotator styles in a
unique latent space. A Simulated Consultation Module (SCM) then intelligently
generates the final segmentation by sampling from this space. This method
achieved state-of-the-art results on challenging CBCT and MRI datasets (92.11%
and 90.72% Dice scores). By treating expert disagreement as a useful signal
instead of noise, our work provides a clear path toward more robust and
trustworthy AI systems for healthcare.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MultiTIPS is a novel multimodal framework for TIPS prognosis that addresses challenges in ROI annotation, unimodal limitations, and single-endpoint prediction through dual-option segmentation, multimodal interaction, and multi-task prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TIPS prognostic models face challenges with labor-intensive ROI annotation, poor reliability of unimodal methods, incomplete single-endpoint assessment, and lack of public datasets, necessitating a more robust and comprehensive approach.

Method: Three core modules: (1) dual-option segmentation using semi-supervised and foundation model-based pipelines, (2) multimodal interaction with MGRA, POD, and CGPE techniques for cross-modal feature integration, and (3) multi-task prediction with staged training for survival, PPG, and OHE prediction.

Result: Extensive experiments on MultiTIPS dataset demonstrate superiority over state-of-the-art methods, with strong cross-domain generalization and interpretability, showing promise for clinical application.

Conclusion: The proposed MultiTIPS framework provides a comprehensive solution for TIPS prognosis with robust performance, generalization capabilities, and clinical applicability, supported by the first public multi-center dataset in this field.

Abstract: Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is an established
procedure for portal hypertension, but provides variable survival outcomes and
frequent overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE), indicating the necessity of
accurate preoperative prognostic modeling. Current studies typically build
machine learning models from preoperative CT images or clinical
characteristics, but face three key challenges: (1) labor-intensive
region-of-interest (ROI) annotation, (2) poor reliability and generalizability
of unimodal methods, and (3) incomplete assessment from single-endpoint
prediction. Moreover, the lack of publicly accessible datasets constrains
research in this field. Therefore, we present MultiTIPS, the first public
multi-center dataset for TIPS prognosis, and propose a novel multimodal
prognostic framework based on it. The framework comprises three core modules:
(1) dual-option segmentation, which integrates semi-supervised and foundation
model-based pipelines to achieve robust ROI segmentation with limited
annotations and facilitate subsequent feature extraction; (2) multimodal
interaction, where three techniques, multi-grained radiomics attention (MGRA),
progressive orthogonal disentanglement (POD), and clinically guided prognostic
enhancement (CGPE), are introduced to enable cross-modal feature interaction
and complementary representation integration, thus improving model accuracy and
robustness; and (3) multi-task prediction, where a staged training strategy is
used to perform stable optimization of survival, portal pressure gradient
(PPG), and OHE prediction for comprehensive prognostic assessment. Extensive
experiments on MultiTIPS demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method
over state-of-the-art approaches, along with strong cross-domain generalization
and interpretability, indicating its promise for clinical application. The
dataset and code are available.

*Jinjin Cao,Zhiyang Chen,Zijun Wang,Liyuan Ma,Weijian Luo,Guojun Qi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CMG is a training-free decoding method that reduces hallucinations in Vision-Language Models by leveraging degradation-induced decoding to emphasize visual context perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs suffer from severe hallucinations where they generate fluent but irrelevant responses due to language bias, ignoring visual context.

Method: Cross-Modal Guidance (CMG) adaptively masks attention weights of influential image tokens in selected transformer layers to corrupt visual-language perception, creating degradation-induced decoding that emphasizes visual contexts.

Result: CMG significantly reduces language bias without harming VLM capabilities, improves performance on hallucination-specific benchmarks, and generalizes effectively across different VLMs.

Conclusion: CMG provides superior advantages for reducing hallucinations in VLMs without requiring additional conditions or training costs, effectively addressing the language bias problem.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown solid ability for multimodal
understanding of both visual and language contexts. However, existing VLMs
often face severe challenges of hallucinations, meaning that VLMs tend to
generate responses that are only fluent in the language but irrelevant to
images in previous contexts. To address this issue, we analyze how language
bias contributes to hallucinations and then introduce Cross-Modal
Guidance(CMG), a training-free decoding method that addresses the
hallucinations by leveraging the difference between the output distributions of
the original model and the one with degraded visual-language attention. In
practice, we adaptively mask the attention weight of the most influential image
tokens in selected transformer layers to corrupt the visual-language perception
as a concrete type of degradation. Such a degradation-induced decoding
emphasizes the perception of visual contexts and therefore significantly
reduces language bias without harming the ability of VLMs. In experiment
sections, we conduct comprehensive studies. All results demonstrate the
superior advantages of CMG with neither additional conditions nor training
costs. We also quantitatively show CMG can improve different VLM's performance
on hallucination-specific benchmarks and generalize effectively.

*Chuang Chen,Wenyi Ge*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAGLFNet is a pseudo-image-based semantic segmentation framework for LiDAR point clouds that enhances feature discriminability through global-local fusion, multi-branch feature extraction, and deep feature-guided attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pseudo-image-based methods for LiDAR point cloud processing often overlook structural and semantic details, resulting in limited feature fusion and discriminability, which hinders accurate semantic segmentation.

Method: Proposes DAGLFNet with three key components: Global-Local Feature Fusion Encoding module for local feature correlation and global context, Multi-Branch Feature Extraction network for neighborhood information and contour features, and Feature Fusion via Deep Feature-guided Attention for cross-channel feature fusion.

Result: Achieves 69.83% on SemanticKITTI and 78.65% on nuScenes validation sets, balancing high performance with real-time capability.

Conclusion: DAGLFNet demonstrates great potential for LiDAR-based real-time applications by effectively extracting discriminative features while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Environmental perception systems play a critical role in high-precision
mapping and autonomous navigation, with LiDAR serving as a core sensor that
provides accurate 3D point cloud data. How to efficiently process unstructured
point clouds while extracting structured semantic information remains a
significant challenge, and in recent years, numerous pseudo-image-based
representation methods have emerged to achieve a balance between efficiency and
performance. However, they often overlook the structural and semantic details
of point clouds, resulting in limited feature fusion and discriminability. In
this work, we propose DAGLFNet, a pseudo-image-based semantic segmentation
framework designed to extract discriminative features. First, the Global-Local
Feature Fusion Encoding module is used to enhance the correlation among local
features within a set and capture global contextual information. Second, the
Multi-Branch Feature Extraction network is employed to capture more
neighborhood information and enhance the discriminability of contour features.
Finally, a Feature Fusion via Deep Feature-guided Attention mechanism is
introduced to improve the precision of cross-channel feature fusion.
Experimental evaluations show that DAGLFNet achieves 69.83\% and 78.65\% on the
validation sets of SemanticKITTI and nuScenes, respectively. The method
balances high performance with real-time capability, demonstrating great
potential for LiDAR-based real-time applications.

*Deng Li,Jun Shao,Bohao Xing,Rong Gao,Bihan Wen,Heikki Kälviäinen,Xin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed MSF-Mamba and MSF-Mamba+ models that enhance vanilla Mamba with motion-aware local spatiotemporal modeling for micro-gesture recognition, achieving state-of-the-art performance while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods have limitations: CNNs struggle with long-range dependencies, Transformers have high computational costs, and vanilla Mamba lacks local spatiotemporal modeling and motion-awareness capabilities needed for micro-gesture recognition.

Method: Introduced motion-aware state fusion Mamba (MSF-Mamba) with local contextual state fusion and central frame difference-based motion awareness. Extended to MSF-Mamba+ with multiscale fusion and adaptive scale weighting.

Result: Experiments on two public MGR datasets show that even the lightweight MSF-Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming CNN-, Transformer-, and SSM-based models while maintaining high efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed MSF-Mamba models effectively address vanilla Mamba's limitations by enabling motion-aware local spatiotemporal modeling, making them well-suited for capturing subtle motion cues in micro-gesture recognition tasks.

Abstract: Micro-gesture recognition (MGR) targets the identification of subtle and
fine-grained human motions and requires accurate modeling of both long-range
and local spatiotemporal dependencies. While CNNs are effective at capturing
local patterns, they struggle with long-range dependencies due to their limited
receptive fields. Transformer-based models address this limitation through
self-attention mechanisms but suffer from high computational costs. Recently,
Mamba has shown promise as an efficient model, leveraging state space models
(SSMs) to enable linear-time processing However, directly applying the vanilla
Mamba to MGR may not be optimal. This is because Mamba processes inputs as 1D
sequences, with state updates relying solely on the previous state, and thus
lacks the ability to model local spatiotemporal dependencies. In addition,
previous methods lack a design of motion-awareness, which is crucial in MGR. To
overcome these limitations, we propose motion-aware state fusion mamba
(MSF-Mamba), which enhances Mamba with local spatiotemporal modeling by fusing
local contextual neighboring states. Our design introduces a motion-aware state
fusion module based on central frame difference (CFD). Furthermore, a
multiscale version named MSF-Mamba+ has been proposed. Specifically, MSF-Mamba
supports multiscale motion-aware state fusion, as well as an adaptive scale
weighting module that dynamically weighs the fused states across different
scales. These enhancements explicitly address the limitations of vanilla Mamba
by enabling motion-aware local spatiotemporal modeling, allowing MSF-Mamba and
MSF-Mamba to effectively capture subtle motion cues for MGR. Experiments on two
public MGR datasets demonstrate that even the lightweight version, namely,
MSF-Mamba, achieves SoTA performance, outperforming existing CNN-,
Transformer-, and SSM-based models while maintaining high efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision-Language Models can self-refine without supervised instruction by using a Triangular Consistency principle to generate and filter their own training data, achieving autonomous improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the untapped potential of VLMs trained without supervised instruction and validate their inherent self-refinement capabilities for autonomous learning.

Method: Proposed a self-refinement framework based on Triangular Consistency principle: (1) multi-task instruction tuning to enable instruction generation, (2) generating image-query-answer triplets from unlabeled images with triangular consistency filtering, (3) model updating with filtered synthetic data.

Result: Using LLaVA-1.5 as baseline, the model autonomously achieved consistent improvements across multiple benchmarks without external supervision like human annotations or environmental feedback.

Conclusion: VLMs possess inherent self-refinement capabilities that enable autonomous learning, providing insights that can inspire future research on VLM learning mechanisms.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) integrate visual knowledge with the analytical
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) through supervised visual
instruction tuning, using image-question-answer triplets. However, the
potential of VLMs trained without supervised instruction remains largely
unexplored. This study validates that VLMs possess inherent self-refinement
capabilities, enabling them to generate high-quality supervised data without
external inputs and thereby learn autonomously. Specifically, to stimulate the
self-refinement ability of VLMs, we propose a self-refinement framework based
on a Triangular Consistency principle: within the image-query-answer triangle,
any masked elements should be consistently and accurately reconstructed. The
framework involves three steps: (1) We enable the instruction generation
ability of VLMs by adding multi-task instruction tuning like
image$\rightarrow$question-answer or image-answer$\rightarrow$question. (2) We
generate image-query-answer triplets from unlabeled images and use the
Triangular Consistency principle for filtering. (3) The model is further
updated using the filtered synthetic data. To investigate the underlying
mechanisms behind this self-refinement capability, we conduct a theoretical
analysis from a causal perspective. Using the widely recognized LLaVA-1.5 as
our baseline, our experiments reveal that the model can autonomously achieve
consistent, though deliberately modest, improvements across multiple benchmarks
without any external supervision, such as human annotations or environmental
feedback. We expect that the insights of this study on the self-refinement
ability of VLMs can inspire future research on the learning mechanism of VLMs.

TL;DR: HARoPE is a head-wise adaptive extension of Rotary Position Embedding that improves spatial relation modeling in image generation by enabling dynamic frequency reallocation and semantic alignment while preserving RoPE's relative-position properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard multi-dimensional RoPE has limitations in fine-grained spatial relation modeling, color cues, and object counting for image generation due to rigid frequency allocation, axis-wise independence, and uniform head treatment.

Method: Proposes HARoPE which inserts a learnable linear transformation parameterized via SVD before the rotary mapping, enabling dynamic frequency reallocation, semantic alignment of rotary planes, and head-specific positional receptive fields.

Result: Extensive experiments on class-conditional ImageNet and text-to-image generation (Flux and MMDiT) show consistent performance improvements over RoPE baselines and other extensions.

Conclusion: HARoPE serves as an effective drop-in replacement that provides a principled and adaptable solution for enhancing positional awareness in transformer-based image generative models.

Abstract: Transformers rely on explicit positional encoding to model structure in data.
While Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) excels in 1D domains, its application to
image generation reveals significant limitations such as fine-grained spatial
relation modeling, color cues, and object counting. This paper identifies key
limitations of standard multi-dimensional RoPE-rigid frequency allocation,
axis-wise independence, and uniform head treatment-in capturing the complex
structural biases required for fine-grained image generation. We propose
HARoPE, a head-wise adaptive extension that inserts a learnable linear
transformation parameterized via singular value decomposition (SVD) before the
rotary mapping. This lightweight modification enables dynamic frequency
reallocation, semantic alignment of rotary planes, and head-specific positional
receptive fields while rigorously preserving RoPE's relative-position property.
Extensive experiments on class-conditional ImageNet and text-to-image
generation (Flux and MMDiT) demonstrate that HARoPE consistently improves
performance over strong RoPE baselines and other extensions. The method serves
as an effective drop-in replacement, offering a principled and adaptable

TL;DR: Jigsaw3D is a fast 3D style transfer method that uses jigsaw operations to isolate style from content and integrates style cues into multi-view diffusion for view-consistent stylization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D style transfer methods suffer from slow per-scene optimization and entanglement of style with semantic content, requiring a solution that decouples style from content for efficient and consistent stylization.

Method: Uses jigsaw operations (spatial shuffling and random masking of reference patches) to suppress object semantics and isolate stylistic statistics, then integrates style cues via reference-to-view cross-attention in a multi-view diffusion model.

Result: Achieves high style fidelity and multi-view consistency with substantially lower latency compared to existing methods, and generalizes to masked partial reference stylization, multi-object scene styling, and tileable texture generation.

Conclusion: Jigsaw3D provides an efficient and effective approach for 3D style transfer that successfully decouples style from content while maintaining view consistency and enabling fast stylization.

Abstract: Controllable 3D style transfer seeks to restyle a 3D asset so that its
textures match a reference image while preserving the integrity and multi-view
consistency. The prevalent methods either rely on direct reference style token
injection or score-distillation from 2D diffusion models, which incurs heavy
per-scene optimization and often entangles style with semantic content. We
introduce Jigsaw3D, a multi-view diffusion based pipeline that decouples style
from content and enables fast, view-consistent stylization. Our key idea is to
leverage the jigsaw operation - spatial shuffling and random masking of
reference patches - to suppress object semantics and isolate stylistic
statistics (color palettes, strokes, textures). We integrate these style cues
into a multi-view diffusion model via reference-to-view cross-attention,
producing view-consistent stylized renderings conditioned on the input mesh.
The renders are then style-baked onto the surface to yield seamless textures.
Across standard 3D stylization benchmarks, Jigsaw3D achieves high style
fidelity and multi-view consistency with substantially lower latency, and
generalizes to masked partial reference stylization, multi-object scene
styling, and tileable texture generation. Project page is available at:

TL;DR: VR-Thinker is a thinking-with-image framework that enhances multimodal reward models by enabling active visual reasoning operations and configurable visual memory windows, achieving state-of-the-art performance on video preference benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal reward models face limitations: visual inputs consume large context budgets (forcing fewer frames and losing fine details) and packing all visual information into initial prompts exacerbates hallucination and forgetting during reasoning.

Method: Introduces VR-Thinker with visual reasoning operations (e.g., select frame) and configurable visual memory window. Uses reinforcement fine-tuning pipeline: (i) Cold Start with visual chain-of-thought data, (ii) Rejection sampling Fine-Tuning on high-quality traces, and (iii) Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to strengthen reasoning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among open-source models: 80.5% on VideoGen Reward, 82.3% on GenAI-Bench, and 75.6% on MJ-Bench-Video. Particularly effective for longer videos.

Conclusion: The approach validates the effectiveness and promise of thinking-with-image multimodal reward modeling, enabling more reliable and faithful visual reasoning within context limits.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal reward models (RMs) have substantially
improved post-training for visual generative models. However, current RMs face
inherent limitations: (1) visual inputs consume large context budgets, forcing
fewer frames and causing loss of fine-grained details; and (2) all visual
information is packed into the initial prompt, exacerbating hallucination and
forgetting during chain-of-thought reasoning. To overcome these issues, we
introduce VideoReward Thinker (VR-Thinker), a thinking-with-image framework
that equips the RM with visual reasoning operations (e.g., select frame) and a
configurable visual memory window. This allows the RM to actively acquire and
update visual evidence within context limits, improving reasoning fidelity and
reliability. We activate visual reasoning via a reinforcement fine-tuning
pipeline: (i) Cold Start with curated visual chain-of-thought data to distill
basic reasoning skills and operation formatting; (ii) select samples whose
per-dimension and overall judgments are all correct, then conduct Rejection
sampling Fine-Tuning on these high-quality traces to further enhance reasoning;
and (iii) apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to strengthen
reasoning. Our approach delivers state-of-the-art accuracy among open-source
models on video preference benchmarks, especially for longer videos: a 7B
VR-Thinker achieves 80.5% on VideoGen Reward, 82.3% on GenAI-Bench, and 75.6%
on MJ-Bench-Video. These results validate the effectiveness and promise of
thinking-with-image multimodal reward modeling.

TL;DR: A novel approach to expand CNN receptive field with fixed table size using optimal lattice vector quantization, irregular dilated convolutions, and U-shaped cascaded LUT structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LUT methods suffer from limited receptive field due to combinatorial explosion of table size, restricting CNN performance despite speed benefits.

Method: Learning optimal lattice vector quantizer for adaptive resolution allocation, using irregular dilated convolutions, and implementing U-shaped cascaded LUT structure for multi-level context.

Result: Achieves significant improvements over existing LUT methods while maintaining same space complexity.

Conclusion: The proposed innovations effectively balance speed, accuracy, and memory efficiency for fast CNN inference.

Abstract: Recently, several look-up table (LUT) methods were developed to greatly
expedite the inference of CNNs in a classical strategy of trading space for
speed. However, these LUT methods suffer from a common drawback of limited
receptive field of the convolution kernels due to the combinatorial explosion
of table size. This research aims to expand the CNN receptive field with a
fixed table size, thereby enhancing the performance of LUT-driven fast CNN
inference while maintaining the same space complexity. To achieve this goal,
various techniques are proposed. The main contribution is a novel approach of
learning an optimal lattice vector quantizer that adaptively allocates the
quantization resolution across data dimensions based on their significance to
the inference task. In addition, the lattice vector quantizer offers an
inherently more accurate approximation of CNN kernels than scalar quantizer as
used in current practice. Furthermore, we introduce other receptive field
expansion strategies, including irregular dilated convolutions and a U-shaped
cascaded LUT structure, designed to capture multi-level contextual information
without inflating table size. Together, these innovations allow our approach to
effectively balance speed, accuracy, and memory efficiency, demonstrating
significant improvements over existing LUT methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome architectural discrepancies, divergent learning objectives, and distinct representation learning strategies in previous pipelines for open-vocabulary segmentation and in-context segmentation by creating a unified model.

Method: COSINE uses foundation models to extract representations for input images and multi-modal prompts, and a SegDecoder to align these representations, model their interaction, and obtain masks specified by input prompts across different granularities.

Result: Comprehensive experiments demonstrate significant performance improvements in both open-vocabulary and in-context segmentation tasks, with synergistic collaboration between visual and textual prompts leading to improved generalization over single-modality approaches.

Conclusion: COSINE successfully unifies open-vocabulary and in-context segmentation through multi-modal prompt integration, demonstrating superior performance and generalization capabilities compared to previous approaches.

Abstract: In this work, we present COSINE, a unified open-world segmentation model that
consolidates open-vocabulary segmentation and in-context segmentation with
multi-modal prompts (e.g., text and image). COSINE exploits foundation models
to extract representations for an input image and corresponding multi-modal

divergent learning objectives, and distinct representation learning strategies
of previous pipelines for open-vocabulary segmentation and in-context
segmentation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that COSINE has significant
performance improvements in both open-vocabulary and in-context segmentation
tasks. Our exploratory analyses highlight that the synergistic collaboration
between using visual and textual prompts leads to significantly improved
generalization over single-modality approaches.

and challenging real-world conditions. The proposed system consists of a
modern, high-precision detection network followed by a recognition stage that

### [95] [MCE: Towards a General Framework for Handling Missing Modalities under Imbalanced Missing Rates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10534)
*Binyu Zhao,Wei Zhang,Zhaonian Zou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MCE addresses imbalanced missing modalities in multi-modal learning through dynamic learning balancing and representation enhancement, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to handle imbalanced missing rates across modalities, creating a vicious cycle where modalities with higher missing rates degrade further due to fewer updates and inconsistent learning progress.

Method: MCE consists of two components: Learning Capability Enhancement (LCE) with multi-level factors for dynamic modality balancing, and Representation Capability Enhancement (RCE) with subset prediction and cross-modal completion tasks to improve feature quality.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations on four multi-modal benchmarks show MCE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods under various missing modality configurations.

Conclusion: MCE effectively tackles the challenges of imbalanced missing modalities through synergistic learning and representation enhancement, demonstrating superior performance across diverse benchmarks.

Abstract: Multi-modal learning has made significant advances across diverse pattern
recognition applications. However, handling missing modalities, especially
under imbalanced missing rates, remains a major challenge. This imbalance
triggers a vicious cycle: modalities with higher missing rates receive fewer
updates, leading to inconsistent learning progress and representational
degradation that further diminishes their contribution. Existing methods
typically focus on global dataset-level balancing, often overlooking critical
sample-level variations in modality utility and the underlying issue of
degraded feature quality. We propose Modality Capability Enhancement (MCE) to
tackle these limitations. MCE includes two synergistic components: i) Learning
Capability Enhancement (LCE), which introduces multi-level factors to
dynamically balance modality-specific learning progress, and ii) Representation
Capability Enhancement (RCE), which improves feature semantics and robustness
through subset prediction and cross-modal completion tasks. Comprehensive
evaluations on four multi-modal benchmarks show that MCE consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods under various missing configurations. The

TL;DR: GLOFNet is a multimodal dataset for glacial lake outburst flood monitoring and prediction, integrating satellite imagery, glacier velocity data, and temperature records from the Shisper Glacier region.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predictive research on GLOFs is limited by fragmented and unimodal data, with most prior work focusing on post-event mapping rather than forecasting.

Method: Integration of three data sources: Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery, NASA ITS_LIVE velocity products, and MODIS Land Surface Temperature records, with preprocessing including cloud masking, quality filtering, normalization, temporal interpolation, augmentation, and cyclical encoding.

Result: The dataset reveals seasonal glacier velocity cycles, long-term warming of ~0.8 K per decade, and spatial heterogeneity in cryospheric conditions.

Conclusion: GLOFNet provides a structured foundation for benchmarking multimodal deep learning approaches to rare hazard prediction and is publicly available to support future research.

Abstract: Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) are rare but destructive hazards in high
mountain regions, yet predictive research is hindered by fragmented and
unimodal data. Most prior efforts emphasize post-event mapping, whereas
forecasting requires harmonized datasets that combine visual indicators with
physical precursors. We present GLOFNet, a multimodal dataset for GLOF
monitoring and prediction, focused on the Shisper Glacier in the Karakoram. It
integrates three complementary sources: Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery for
spatial monitoring, NASA ITS_LIVE velocity products for glacier kinematics, and
MODIS Land Surface Temperature records spanning over two decades. Preprocessing
included cloud masking, quality filtering, normalization, temporal
interpolation, augmentation, and cyclical encoding, followed by harmonization
across modalities. Exploratory analysis reveals seasonal glacier velocity
cycles, long-term warming of ~0.8 K per decade, and spatial heterogeneity in
cryospheric conditions. The resulting dataset, GLOFNet, is publicly available
to support future research in glacial hazard prediction. By addressing
challenges such as class imbalance, cloud contamination, and coarse resolution,
GLOFNet provides a structured foundation for benchmarking multimodal deep
learning approaches to rare hazard prediction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MRS-YOLO improves YOLO11 for railway transmission line foreign object detection with enhanced feature extraction, multi-level feature fusion, optimized detection head, and channel pruning, achieving higher accuracy with reduced computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address missed detection, false detection, and low detection efficiency in transmission line foreign object detection under railway environments.

Method: Proposed MRS-YOLO with: 1) Multi-scale Adaptive Kernel Depth Feature Fusion (MAKDF) module fused with C3k2, 2) Re-calibration Feature Fusion Pyramid Network (RCFPN) neck structure, 3) Spatial and Channel Reconstruction Detect Head (SC_Detect), and 4) channel pruning for model compression.

Result: mAP50: 94.8% (↑0.7%), mAP50:95: 86.4% (↑2.3%), Parameters reduced by 44.2%, GFLOPs reduced by 17.5% compared to baseline.

Conclusion: The improved algorithm demonstrates better applicability for foreign object detection in railroad transmission lines with enhanced accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Aiming at the problems of missed detection, false detection and low detection
efficiency in transmission line foreign object detection under railway
environment, we proposed an improved algorithm MRS-YOLO based on YOLO11.
Firstly, a multi-scale Adaptive Kernel Depth Feature Fusion (MAKDF) module is
proposed and fused with the C3k2 module to form C3k2_MAKDF, which enhances the
model's feature extraction capability for foreign objects of different sizes
and shapes. Secondly, a novel Re-calibration Feature Fusion Pyramid Network
(RCFPN) is designed as a neck structure to enhance the model's ability to
integrate and utilize multi-level features effectively. Then, Spatial and
Channel Reconstruction Detect Head (SC_Detect) based on spatial and channel
preprocessing is designed to enhance the model's overall detection performance.
Finally, the channel pruning technique is used to reduce the redundancy of the
improved model, drastically reduce Parameters and Giga Floating Point
Operations Per Second (GFLOPs), and improve the detection efficiency. The
experimental results show that the mAP50 and mAP50:95 of the MRS-YOLO algorithm
proposed in this paper are improved to 94.8% and 86.4%, respectively, which are
0.7 and 2.3 percentage points higher compared to the baseline, while Parameters
and GFLOPs are reduced by 44.2% and 17.5%, respectively. It is demonstrated
that the improved algorithm can be better applied to the task of foreign object
detection in railroad transmission lines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep semi-supervised approach combining consistency regularization with similarity learning for weed species classification, showing effectiveness and robustness compared to supervised models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of weed identification due to similarities with crops and field condition variations, and to overcome the limitation of requiring large fully annotated datasets which are time-consuming and laborious to create.

Method: Proposed a deep semi-supervised approach that combines consistency regularization with similarity learning using a developed deep auto-encoder architecture.

Result: Experiments on DeepWeeds dataset and inference in noisy conditions demonstrated the method's effectiveness and robustness compared to state-of-the-art fully supervised deep learning models.

Conclusion: The proposed joint learning strategy provides improved utilization of unlabeled data and achieves robust classification performance under conditions of limited labeled data.

Abstract: Weed species classification represents an important step for the development
of automated targeting systems that allow the adoption of precision agriculture
practices. To reduce costs and yield losses caused by their presence. The
identification of weeds is a challenging problem due to their shared
similarities with crop plants and the variability related to the differences in
terms of their types. Along with the variations in relation to changes in field
conditions. Moreover, to fully benefit from deep learning-based methods, large
fully annotated datasets are needed. This requires time intensive and laborious
process for data labeling, which represents a limitation in agricultural
applications. Hence, for the aim of improving the utilization of the unlabeled
data, regarding conditions of scarcity in terms of the labeled data available
during the learning phase and provide robust and high classification
performance. We propose a deep semi-supervised approach, that combines
consistency regularization with similarity learning. Through our developed deep
auto-encoder architecture, experiments realized on the DeepWeeds dataset and
inference in noisy conditions demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of
our method in comparison to state-of-the-art fully supervised deep learning
models. Furthermore, we carried out ablation studies for an extended analysis
of our proposed joint learning strategy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniFlow is a unified tokenizer that overcomes the performance trade-off between visual understanding and generation through layer-wise adaptive self-distillation and a lightweight patch-wise pixel flow decoder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tokenizers face significant performance trade-offs between understanding and generation due to conflicts between high-level semantic abstraction and low-level pixel reconstruction.

Method: Uses layer-wise adaptive self-distillation on pretrained visual encoders and a lightweight patch-wise pixel flow decoder that models conditional flow from noisy state to pixel domain.

Result: Achieves win-win outcomes across 13 benchmarks in 7 visual tasks - surpasses TokenFlow-XL by 7.75% in understanding and UniTok by 0.15 in rFID and 0.09 in gFID in generation.

Conclusion: UniFlow successfully resolves the conflict between understanding and generation, enabling a unified tokenizer that performs well in both domains without trade-offs.

Abstract: Tokenizer is a crucial component for both visual understanding and
generation. To advance toward the ultimate goal of universal modeling, recent
research has focused on developing a unified tokenizer. However, existing
tokenizers face a significant performance trade-off between understanding and
generation, stemming from the inherent conflict between high-level semantic
abstraction and low-level pixel reconstruction. To tackle this challenge, we
propose a generic and unified tokenizer, namely UniFlow, by flexibly adapting
any visual encoder with a concise reconstruction decoder. Specifically, we
introduce layer-wise adaptive self-distillation applied to the well-pretrained
visual encoders, which enables UniFlow to simultaneously inherit the strong
semantic features for visual understanding and flexibly adapt to model
fine-grained details for visual generation. Moreover, we propose a lightweight
patch-wise pixel flow decoder, which efficiently achieves high-fidelity pixel
reconstruction by modeling a conditional flow from the noisy state back to the
patch-wise pixel domain. By leveraging the semantic features as visual
conditions for the decoder, we effectively alleviate the training conflicts
between understanding and generation. Furthermore, the patch-wise learning
strategy simplifies the data distribution, thereby improving training
efficiency. Extensive experiments across 13 challenging benchmarks spanning 7
widely studied visual understanding and generation tasks demonstrate that
UniFlow achieves a win-win outcome. For instance, our 7B UniFlow-XL not only
surpasses the 14B TokenFlow-XL by 7.75% on average understanding benchmarks,
but also achieves competitive results in both visual reconstruction and
generation, surpassing UniTok by 0.15 in rFID and 0.09 in gFID (without
guidance), respectively.

*Haonan Wang,Hanyu Zhou,Haoyue Liu,Luxin Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Diff-ABFlow, a diffusion-based optical flow estimation framework that fuses frame and event camera data to address challenges in high-speed and low-light scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optical flow estimation struggles in high-speed and low-light scenes due to motion blur and insufficient illumination, which weaken texture and amplify noise. Frame cameras provide dense appearance but sparse boundaries, while event cameras offer sparse appearance but dense boundaries.

Method: Uses diffusion models to learn mapping from noisy flow to clear flow, unaffected by deteriorated visual features. Proposes frame-event appearance-boundary fusion framework called Diff-ABFlow.

Result: Not specified in the abstract.

Conclusion: Diffusion models provide an effective approach for optical flow estimation in degraded scenes by avoiding reliance on deteriorated visual features through learning the mapping from noisy to clear flow.

Abstract: Optical flow estimation has achieved promising results in conventional scenes
but faces challenges in high-speed and low-light scenes, which suffer from
motion blur and insufficient illumination. These conditions lead to weakened
texture and amplified noise and deteriorate the appearance saturation and
boundary completeness of frame cameras, which are necessary for motion feature
matching. In degraded scenes, the frame camera provides dense appearance
saturation but sparse boundary completeness due to its long imaging time and
low dynamic range. In contrast, the event camera offers sparse appearance
saturation, while its short imaging time and high dynamic range gives rise to
dense boundary completeness. Traditionally, existing methods utilize feature
fusion or domain adaptation to introduce event to improve boundary
completeness. However, the appearance features are still deteriorated, which
severely affects the mostly adopted discriminative models that learn the
mapping from visual features to motion fields and generative models that
generate motion fields based on given visual features. So we introduce
diffusion models that learn the mapping from noising flow to clear flow, which
is not affected by the deteriorated visual features. Therefore, we propose a
novel optical flow estimation framework Diff-ABFlow based on diffusion models
with frame-event appearance-boundary fusion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision foundation models like DINOv2 show strong OOD detection capabilities without fine-tuning. Fine-tuning helps but struggles with large semantic spaces. Proposed Mixture of Feature Experts (MoFE) and Dynamic-β Mixup improve performance by handling complex distributions and adapting to category difficulty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the underexplored potential of pre-trained vision foundation models for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and address their limitations in large semantic spaces.

Method: Systematically investigate vision foundation models for OOD detection. Propose Mixture of Feature Experts (MoFE) to partition features into subspaces and Dynamic-β Mixup strategy that adapts interpolation weights based on category learning difficulty.

Result: DINOv2 without fine-tuning achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art OOD detection methods. The proposed MoFE and Dynamic-β Mixup significantly outperform baseline methods in extensive experiments.

Conclusion: Vision foundation models are effective for OOD detection, and the proposed MoFE and Dynamic-β Mixup successfully address challenges in large semantic spaces, achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Pre-trained vision foundation models have transformed many computer vision
tasks. Despite their strong ability to learn discriminative and generalizable
features crucial for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, their impact on this
task remains underexplored. Motivated by this gap, we systematically
investigate representative vision foundation models for OOD detection. Our
findings reveal that a pre-trained DINOv2 model, even without fine-tuning on
in-domain (ID) data, naturally provides a highly discriminative feature space
for OOD detection, achieving performance comparable to existing
state-of-the-art methods without requiring complex designs. Beyond this, we
explore how fine-tuning foundation models on in-domain (ID) data can enhance
OOD detection. However, we observe that the performance of vision foundation
models remains unsatisfactory in scenarios with a large semantic space. This is
due to the increased complexity of decision boundaries as the number of
categories grows, which complicates the optimization process. To mitigate this,
we propose the Mixture of Feature Experts (MoFE) module, which partitions
features into subspaces, effectively capturing complex data distributions and
refining decision boundaries. Further, we introduce a Dynamic-$\beta$ Mixup
strategy, which samples interpolation weights from a dynamic beta distribution.
This adapts to varying levels of learning difficulty across categories,
improving feature learning for more challenging categories. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, significantly
outperforming baseline methods.

### [102] [A Simple and Better Baseline for Visual Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10587)
*Jingchao Wang,Wenlong Zhang,Dingjiang Huang,Hong Wang,Yefeng Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FSVG is a simple yet effective baseline for visual grounding that directly integrates linguistic and visual modalities without iterative procedures, using language-guided feature selection to reduce computational overhead while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual grounding methods that select linguistic-relevant visual regions require iterative processing across different image scales and cache storage, incurring extra computational overhead that complicates implementation.

Method: FSVG encapsulates linguistic and visual modalities into a single network architecture without iterative procedures, using language as parallel guidance for modality interaction. It introduces a similarity-based feature selection mechanism to only exploit language-related visual features for faster prediction.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show FSVG achieves better balance between accuracy and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed FSVG provides an effective baseline for visual grounding that simplifies implementation while maintaining competitive performance through direct modality integration and efficient feature selection.

Abstract: Visual grounding aims to predict the locations of target objects specified by
textual descriptions. For this task with linguistic and visual modalities,
there is a latest research line that focuses on only selecting the
linguistic-relevant visual regions for object localization to reduce the
computational overhead. Albeit achieving impressive performance, it is
iteratively performed on different image scales, and at every iteration,
linguistic features and visual features need to be stored in a cache, incurring
extra overhead. To facilitate the implementation, in this paper, we propose a
feature selection-based simple yet effective baseline for visual grounding,
called FSVG. Specifically, we directly encapsulate the linguistic and visual
modalities into an overall network architecture without complicated iterative
procedures, and utilize the language in parallel as guidance to facilitate the
interaction between linguistic modal and visual modal for extracting effective
visual features. Furthermore, to reduce the computational cost, during the
visual feature learning, we introduce a similarity-based feature selection
mechanism to only exploit language-related visual features for faster
prediction. Extensive experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets
comprehensively substantiate that the proposed FSVG achieves a better balance
between accuracy and efficiency beyond the current state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViSurf is a unified post-training paradigm that combines SFT and RLVR to overcome their individual limitations, using ground-truth labels in RLVR rollouts for simultaneous external supervision and internal reinforcement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SFT leads to sub-optimal performance while RLVR struggles with tasks beyond the model's knowledge base. Existing post-training paradigms have complementary limitations that need addressing.

Method: ViSurf integrates SFT and RLVR in a single stage by injecting ground-truth labels into RLVR rollouts, providing both external supervision and internal reinforcement. It introduces three novel reward control strategies for training stability.

Result: Extensive experiments show ViSurf outperforms individual SFT, RLVR, and two-stage SFT→RLVR across diverse benchmarks. In-depth analysis validates the derivation and design principles.

Conclusion: ViSurf successfully unifies SFT and RLVR paradigms, demonstrating superior performance and providing a comprehensive solution for post-training LVLMs.

Abstract: Typical post-training paradigms for Large Vision-and-Language Models (LVLMs)
include Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable
Rewards (RLVR). SFT leverages external guidance to inject new knowledge,
whereas RLVR utilizes internal reinforcement to enhance reasoning capabilities
and overall performance. However, our analysis reveals that SFT often leads to
sub-optimal performance, while RLVR struggles with tasks that exceed the
model's internal knowledge base. To address these limitations, we propose
ViSurf (\textbf{Vi}sual \textbf{Su}pervised-and-\textbf{R}einforcement
\textbf{F}ine-Tuning), a unified post-training paradigm that integrates the
strengths of both SFT and RLVR within a single stage. We analyze the derivation
of the SFT and RLVR objectives to establish the ViSurf objective, providing a
unified perspective on these two paradigms. The core of ViSurf involves
injecting ground-truth labels into the RLVR rollouts, thereby providing
simultaneous external supervision and internal reinforcement. Furthermore, we
introduce three novel reward control strategies to stabilize and optimize the
training process. Extensive experiments across several diverse benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of ViSurf, outperforming both individual SFT,
RLVR, and two-stage SFT \textrightarrow RLVR. In-depth analysis corroborates
these findings, validating the derivation and design principles of ViSurf.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual evaluation approaches are typically constrained to a single task, lacking a unified framework for multi-task quality assessment.

Method: Constructed reasoning-enhanced reward modeling dataset via rejection sampling, used Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with Gaussian-based reward, and incorporated STD filtering and entropy gating for training stability.

Result: The framework was evaluated on three key IQA tasks: aesthetic quality assessment, technical quality evaluation, and text-image alignment.

Conclusion: OmniQuality-R provides a structured approach for multi-dimensional quality reasoning that generates continuous and interpretable reward signals for policy optimization across multiple visual evaluation tasks.

Abstract: Current visual evaluation approaches are typically constrained to a single
task. To address this, we propose OmniQuality-R, a unified reward modeling
framework that transforms multi-task quality reasoning into continuous and
interpretable reward signals for policy optimization. Inspired by subjective
experiments, where participants are given task-specific instructions outlining
distinct assessment principles prior to evaluation, we propose OmniQuality-R, a
structured reward modeling framework that transforms multi-dimensional
reasoning into continuous and interpretable reward signals. To enable this, we
construct a reasoning-enhanced reward modeling dataset by sampling informative
plan-reason trajectories via rejection sampling, forming a reliable
chain-of-thought (CoT) dataset for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Building on
this, we apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for post-training,
using a Gaussian-based reward to support continuous score prediction. To
further stabilize the training and improve downstream generalization, we
incorporate standard deviation (STD) filtering and entropy gating mechanisms
during reinforcement learning. These techniques suppress unstable updates and
reduce variance in policy optimization. We evaluate OmniQuality-R on three key
IQA tasks: aesthetic quality assessment, technical quality evaluation, and
text-image alignment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a hybrid framework that enhances linear attention in Graph Transformers by adding a gated local graph network branch to increase attention rank and using a learnable log-power function to sharpen attention focus, achieving competitive performance while maintaining linear complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Linear attention mechanisms in Graph Transformers suffer from reduced expressiveness due to low-rank projections and uniform attention distributions, which limit class separability and classification ability.

Method: Hybrid framework combining linear attention with a gated local graph network branch attached to the value matrix to increase attention rank, plus a learnable log-power function applied to attention scores to reduce entropy and sharpen focus.

Result: Extensive experiments on homophilic and heterophilic graph benchmarks show competitive performance while preserving the scalability benefits of linear attention.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses the expressiveness limitations of linear attention in Graph Transformers by enhancing both rank and focus, achieving strong performance without sacrificing computational efficiency.

Abstract: Linear attention mechanisms have emerged as efficient alternatives to full
self-attention in Graph Transformers, offering linear time complexity. However,
existing linear attention models often suffer from a significant drop in
expressiveness due to low-rank projection structures and overly uniform
attention distributions. We theoretically prove that these properties reduce
the class separability of node representations, limiting the model's
classification ability. To address this, we propose a novel hybrid framework
that enhances both the rank and focus of attention. Specifically, we enhance
linear attention by attaching a gated local graph network branch to the value
matrix, thereby increasing the rank of the resulting attention map.
Furthermore, to alleviate the excessive smoothing effect inherent in linear
attention, we introduce a learnable log-power function into the attention
scores to reduce entropy and sharpen focus. We theoretically show that this
function decreases entropy in the attention distribution, enhancing the
separability of learned embeddings. Extensive experiments on both homophilic
and heterophilic graph benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves
competitive performance while preserving the scalability of linear attention.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based talking-head generation methods struggle with temporal coherence and fine-grained motion control, needing better solutions for synchronized, realistic video synthesis.

Method: Uses a motion auto-encoder to create a structured latent space with orthogonalized motion factors, then applies optimal-transport-based flow matching with transformer predictor to generate smooth motion trajectories conditioned on audio.

Result: Outperforms prior methods in video realism, lip-audio synchronization, and motion fidelity across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: Combining fine-grained motion disentanglement with flow-based generative modeling offers a powerful new paradigm for controllable talking-head video synthesis.

Abstract: Audio-driven talking-head generation has advanced rapidly with
diffusion-based generative models, yet producing temporally coherent videos
with fine-grained motion control remains challenging. We propose DEMO, a
flow-matching generative framework for audio-driven talking-portrait video
synthesis that delivers disentangled, high-fidelity control of lip motion, head
pose, and eye gaze. The core contribution is a motion auto-encoder that builds
a structured latent space in which motion factors are independently represented
and approximately orthogonalized. On this disentangled motion space, we apply
optimal-transport-based flow matching with a transformer predictor to generate
temporally smooth motion trajectories conditioned on audio. Extensive
experiments across multiple benchmarks show that DEMO outperforms prior methods
in video realism, lip-audio synchronization, and motion fidelity. These results
demonstrate that combining fine-grained motion disentanglement with flow-based
generative modeling provides a powerful new paradigm for controllable

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel machine learning approach for corner case recognition in autonomous driving that considers data distribution rather than individual examples, achieving strong performance on detection tasks and unifying existing taxonomies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional corner case categorization is not scalable and lacks data coverage perspective, failing to generalize to ML model training data. Safe operation in high-stakes applications like autonomous driving requires better corner case recognition.

Method: Proposed a framework for corner case recognition that takes underlying data distribution into account, extending established out-of-distribution detection benchmarks and introducing fog-augmented Lost & Found dataset.

Result: The approach (i) unifies existing scenario-based corner case taxonomies, (ii) achieves strong performance on corner case detection tasks across standard benchmarks, and (iii) enables analysis of combined corner cases.

Conclusion: The results provide a principled basis for corner case recognition with a manual specification-free definition, offering a scalable solution for safe autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: For high-stakes applications, like autonomous driving, a safe operation is
necessary to prevent harm, accidents, and failures. Traditionally, difficult
scenarios have been categorized into corner cases and addressed individually.
However, this example-based categorization is not scalable and lacks a data
coverage perspective, neglecting the generalization to training data of machine
learning models. In our work, we propose a novel machine learning approach that
takes the underlying data distribution into account. Based on our novel
perspective, we present a framework for effective corner case recognition for
perception on individual samples. In our evaluation, we show that our approach
(i) unifies existing scenario-based corner case taxonomies under a
distributional perspective, (ii) achieves strong performance on corner case
detection tasks across standard benchmarks for which we extend established
out-of-distribution detection benchmarks, and (iii) enables analysis of
combined corner cases via a newly introduced fog-augmented Lost & Found

### [108] [Stability Under Scrutiny: Benchmarking Representation Paradigms for Online HD Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10660)
*Hao Shan,Ruikai Li,Han Jiang,Yizhe Fan,Ziyang Yan,Bohan Li,Xiaoshuai Hao,Hao Zhao,Zhiyong Cui,Yilong Ren,Haiyang Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating temporal stability in online HD mapping models for autonomous driving, proposing novel stability metrics and showing that accuracy and stability are largely independent performance dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing online HD mapping models focus on per-frame accuracy but ignore temporal stability, which is crucial for autonomous driving as sensor displacement in dynamic environments causes mapping instability that challenges downstream tasks.

Method: Proposed a multi-dimensional stability evaluation framework with novel metrics for Presence, Localization, and Shape Stability, integrated into a unified mean Average Stability (mAS) score. Conducted extensive experiments on 42 models and variants.

Result: Accuracy (mAP) and stability (mAS) represent largely independent performance dimensions. Analysis identified architectural and training factors that contribute to high accuracy, high stability, or both.

Conclusion: Temporal stability should be treated as a core evaluation criterion alongside accuracy for online HD mapping models. The work advances development of more reliable autonomous driving systems and includes a public benchmark release.

Abstract: As one of the fundamental modules in autonomous driving, online
high-definition (HD) maps have attracted significant attention due to their
cost-effectiveness and real-time capabilities. Since vehicles always cruise in
highly dynamic environments, spatial displacement of onboard sensors inevitably
causes shifts in real-time HD mapping results, and such instability poses
fundamental challenges for downstream tasks. However, existing online map
construction models tend to prioritize improving each frame's mapping accuracy,
while the mapping stability has not yet been systematically studied. To fill
this gap, this paper presents the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
the temporal stability of online HD mapping models. We propose a
multi-dimensional stability evaluation framework with novel metrics for
Presence, Localization, and Shape Stability, integrated into a unified mean
Average Stability (mAS) score. Extensive experiments on 42 models and variants
show that accuracy (mAP) and stability (mAS) represent largely independent
performance dimensions. We further analyze the impact of key model design
choices on both criteria, identifying architectural and training factors that
contribute to high accuracy, high stability, or both. To encourage broader
focus on stability, we will release a public benchmark. Our work highlights the
importance of treating temporal stability as a core evaluation criterion
alongside accuracy, advancing the development of more reliable autonomous
driving systems. The benchmark toolkit, code, and models will be available at

*Gaojian Wang,Feng Lin,Tong Wu,Zhisheng Yan,Kui Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FS-VFM is a self-supervised pre-training framework that learns robust facial representations by combining masked image modeling and instance discrimination with three learning objectives (3C), achieving state-of-the-art performance across various face security tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To learn robust and transferable facial representations from abundant unlabeled real faces that can generalize across various face security tasks like deepfake detection, face anti-spoofing, and facial forensics.

Method: Proposes FS-VFM framework with three learning objectives (3C): intra-region Consistency, inter-region Coherency via CRFR-P masking strategy, and local-to-global Correspondence via self-distillation that couples masked image modeling with instance discrimination.

Result: Extensive experiments on 11 benchmarks show FS-VFM consistently outperforms diverse vision foundation models across different paradigms and scales, and even surpasses state-of-the-art task-specific methods. FS-Adapter provides efficient transfer learning.

Conclusion: FS-VFM successfully learns fundamental facial representations that generalize well across face security tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining masked image modeling and instance discrimination with the proposed 3C learning objectives.

Abstract: With abundant, unlabeled real faces, how can we learn robust and transferable
facial representations to boost generalization across various face security
tasks? We make the first attempt and propose FS-VFM, a scalable self-supervised
pre-training framework, to learn fundamental representations of real face
images. We introduce three learning objectives, namely 3C, that synergize
masked image modeling (MIM) and instance discrimination (ID), empowering FS-VFM
to encode both local patterns and global semantics of real faces. Specifically,
we formulate various facial masking strategies for MIM and devise a simple yet
effective CRFR-P masking, which explicitly prompts the model to pursue
meaningful intra-region Consistency and challenging inter-region Coherency. We
present a reliable self-distillation mechanism that seamlessly couples MIM with
ID to establish underlying local-to-global Correspondence. After pre-training,
vanilla vision transformers (ViTs) serve as universal Vision Foundation Models
for downstream Face Security tasks: cross-dataset deepfake detection,
cross-domain face anti-spoofing, and unseen diffusion facial forensics. To
efficiently transfer the pre-trained FS-VFM, we further propose FS-Adapter, a
lightweight plug-and-play bottleneck atop the frozen backbone with a novel
real-anchor contrastive objective. Extensive experiments on 11 public
benchmarks demonstrate that our FS-VFM consistently generalizes better than
diverse VFMs, spanning natural and facial domains, fully, weakly, and
self-supervised paradigms, small, base, and large ViT scales, and even
outperforms SOTA task-specific methods, while FS-Adapter offers an excellent
efficiency-performance trade-off. The code and models are available on

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes adapting pre-trained Text-to-Video models for viewpoint planning from 4D scenes using a two-stage approach that injects 4D scene representation and performs camera extrinsic denoising.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage video generation models' capability in simulating real-world geometry and physics for viewpoint planning, since videos naturally contain dynamic scenes with viewpoints.

Method: Two-stage paradigm: 1) Inject 4D scene representation into pre-trained T2V model via adaptive learning branch, 2) Formulate viewpoint extraction as hybrid-condition guided camera extrinsic denoising process with additional diffusion branch.

Result: Experimental results show superiority over existing competitors, with ablation studies validating effectiveness of key technical designs.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the potential of video generation models for 4D interaction in real world applications.

Abstract: Recent Text-to-Video (T2V) models have demonstrated powerful capability in
visual simulation of real-world geometry and physical laws, indicating its
potential as implicit world models. Inspired by this, we explore the
feasibility of leveraging the video generation prior for viewpoint planning
from given 4D scenes, since videos internally accompany dynamic scenes with
natural viewpoints. To this end, we propose a two-stage paradigm to adapt
pre-trained T2V models for viewpoint prediction, in a compatible manner. First,
we inject the 4D scene representation into the pre-trained T2V model via an
adaptive learning branch, where the 4D scene is viewpoint-agnostic and the
conditional generated video embeds the viewpoints visually. Then, we formulate
viewpoint extraction as a hybrid-condition guided camera extrinsic denoising
process. Specifically, a camera extrinsic diffusion branch is further
introduced onto the pre-trained T2V model, by taking the generated video and 4D
scene as input. Experimental results show the superiority of our proposed
method over existing competitors, and ablation studies validate the
effectiveness of our key technical designs. To some extent, this work proves
the potential of video generation models toward 4D interaction in real world.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This survey provides the first comprehensive review of image-to-video transfer learning, where image-language foundation models are extended to video domains to reduce data and computational requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the substantial data and computational demands of training video-language foundation models from scratch by leveraging existing image-language foundation models through transfer learning.

Method: Systematically classifies image-to-video transfer learning strategies into two categories: frozen features (preserving original representations) and modified features (undergoing modifications), and analyzes their applications across various video-text learning tasks.

Result: Presents experimental analysis investigating the efficacy of different transfer learning paradigms on downstream video understanding tasks, establishing a structured roadmap for advancing video-text learning.

Conclusion: Identifies prevailing challenges and highlights promising future research directions for image-to-video transfer learning in the rapidly evolving video-text learning domain.

Abstract: Image-Language Foundation Models (ILFM) have demonstrated remarkable success
in image-text understanding/generation tasks, providing transferable multimodal
representations that generalize across diverse downstream image-based tasks.
The advancement of video-text research has spurred growing interest in
extending image-based models to the video domain. This paradigm, known as
image-to-video transfer learning, succeeds in alleviating the substantial data
and computational requirements associated with training video-language
foundation models from scratch for video-text learning. This survey provides
the first comprehensive review of this emerging field, which begins by
summarizing the widely used ILFM and their capabilities. We then systematically
classify existing image-to-video transfer learning strategies into two
categories: frozen features and modified features, depending on whether the
original representations from ILFM are preserved or undergo modifications.
Building upon the task-specific nature of image-to-video transfer, this survey
methodically elaborates these strategies and details their applications across
a spectrum of video-text learning tasks, ranging from fine-grained (e.g.,
spatio-temporal video grounding) to coarse-grained (e.g., video question
answering). We further present a detailed experimental analysis to investigate
the efficacy of different image-to-video transfer learning paradigms on a range
of downstream video understanding tasks. Finally, we identify prevailing
challenges and highlight promising directions for future research. By offering
a comprehensive and structured overview, this survey aims to establish a
structured roadmap for advancing video-text learning based on existing ILFM,
and to inspire future research directions in this rapidly evolving domain.

*Yuxiang Luo,Qing Xu,Hai Huang,Yuqi Ouyang,Zhen Chen,Wenting Duan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSM-Seg is a novel framework for multi-modal brain tumor segmentation that introduces a dual-memory paradigm with category-agnostic prompts, addressing limitations of existing prompt-based methods by exploiting cross-modal correlations and inter-slice relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt-based segmentation methods ignore cross-modal correlations and rely on labor-intensive category-specific prompts, limiting their applicability in real-world clinical scenarios for multi-modal brain tumor segmentation.

Method: Proposes MSM-Seg framework with three key components: 1) modality-and-slice memory attention (MSMA) to exploit cross-modal and inter-slice relationships, 2) multi-scale category-agnostic prompt encoder (MCP-Encoder) for tumor region guidance, and 3) modality-adaptive fusion decoder (MF-Decoder) that leverages complementary decoding information across modalities.

Result: Extensive experiments on different MRI datasets demonstrate that MSM-Seg outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both multi-modal metastases and glioma tumor segmentation.

Conclusion: The proposed MSM-Seg framework effectively addresses limitations of existing prompt-based methods by synergistically integrating multi-modal and inter-slice information with efficient category-agnostic prompts, achieving superior performance in brain tumor segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Multi-modal brain tumor segmentation is critical for clinical diagnosis, and
it requires accurate identification of distinct internal anatomical subregions.
While the recent prompt-based segmentation paradigms enable interactive
experiences for clinicians, existing methods ignore cross-modal correlations
and rely on labor-intensive category-specific prompts, limiting their
applicability in real-world scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a
MSM-Seg framework for multi-modal brain tumor segmentation. The MSM-Seg
introduces a novel dual-memory segmentation paradigm that synergistically
integrates multi-modal and inter-slice information with the efficient
category-agnostic prompt for brain tumor understanding. To this end, we first
devise a modality-and-slice memory attention (MSMA) to exploit the cross-modal
and inter-slice relationships among the input scans. Then, we propose a
multi-scale category-agnostic prompt encoder (MCP-Encoder) to provide tumor
region guidance for decoding. Moreover, we devise a modality-adaptive fusion
decoder (MF-Decoder) that leverages the complementary decoding information
across different modalities to improve segmentation accuracy. Extensive
experiments on different MRI datasets demonstrate that our MSM-Seg framework
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in multi-modal metastases and glioma tumor
segmentation. The code is available at https://github.com/xq141839/MSM-Seg.

*Xinyu Yang,Zheheng Jiang,Feixiang Zhou,Yihang Zhu,Na Lv,Nan Xing,Huiyu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSM framework unifies action detection and anticipation by compressing video frames into critical states, modeling action dynamics with state-transition graphs, and using cross-temporal interactions to refine features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Untrimmed videos contain redundant information and noise, and current approaches often overlook the influence of agent intention on actions.

Method: Critical State-Based Memory Compression reduces redundancy; Action Pattern Learning constructs state-transition graphs to model dynamics and generate future cues; Cross-Temporal Interaction models mutual influence between intentions and past/current information.

Result: Superior performance on EPIC-Kitchens-100, THUMOS'14, TVSeries, and PDMB datasets compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the importance of action dynamics learning and cross-temporal interactions for action understanding.

Abstract: Action understanding, encompassing action detection and anticipation, plays a
crucial role in numerous practical applications. However, untrimmed videos are
often characterized by substantial redundant information and noise. Moreover,
in modeling action understanding, the influence of the agent's intention on the
action is often overlooked. Motivated by these issues, we propose a novel
framework called the State-Specific Model (SSM), designed to unify and enhance
both action detection and anticipation tasks. In the proposed framework, the
Critical State-Based Memory Compression module compresses frame sequences into
critical states, reducing information redundancy. The Action Pattern Learning
module constructs a state-transition graph with multi-dimensional edges to
model action dynamics in complex scenarios, on the basis of which potential
future cues can be generated to represent intention. Furthermore, our
Cross-Temporal Interaction module models the mutual influence between
intentions and past as well as current information through cross-temporal
interactions, thereby refining present and future features and ultimately
realizing simultaneous action detection and anticipation. Extensive experiments
on multiple benchmark datasets -- including EPIC-Kitchens-100, THUMOS'14,
TVSeries, and the introduced Parkinson's Disease Mouse Behaviour (PDMB) dataset
-- demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed framework compared to
other state-of-the-art approaches. These results highlight the importance of
action dynamics learning and cross-temporal interactions, laying a foundation
for future action understanding research.

*Xuankai Zhang,Junjin Xiao,Qing Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified framework for high-quality dynamic Gaussian Splatting that handles both defocused and motion-blurred monocular videos using blur kernel estimation and dynamic Gaussian densification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods are specialized for either defocus blur or motion blur but cannot handle both simultaneously. Joint modeling as blur kernel convolution faces challenges in accurate kernel estimation.

Method: Uses a blur prediction network to estimate per-pixel blur kernels exploiting blur-related scene/camera information with blur-aware sparsity constraint. Includes dynamic Gaussian densification for incomplete regions and incorporates unseen view information for scene optimization.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating photorealistic novel view synthesis from defocused and motion-blurred monocular videos.

Conclusion: The proposed unified framework successfully handles both defocus and motion blur in monocular videos, achieving superior novel view synthesis quality through effective blur kernel estimation and scene optimization techniques.

Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework that allows high-quality dynamic
Gaussian Splatting from both defocused and motion-blurred monocular videos. Due
to the significant difference between the formation processes of defocus blur
and motion blur, existing methods are tailored for either one of them, lacking
the ability to simultaneously deal with both of them. Although the two can be
jointly modeled as blur kernel-based convolution, the inherent difficulty in
estimating accurate blur kernels greatly limits the progress in this direction.
In this work, we go a step further towards this direction. Particularly, we
propose to estimate per-pixel reliable blur kernels using a blur prediction
network that exploits blur-related scene and camera information and is subject
to a blur-aware sparsity constraint. Besides, we introduce a dynamic Gaussian
densification strategy to mitigate the lack of Gaussians for incomplete
regions, and boost the performance of novel view synthesis by incorporating
unseen view information to constrain scene optimization. Extensive experiments
show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in generating
photorealistic novel view synthesis from defocused and motion-blurred monocular
videos. Our code and trained model will be made publicly available.

Abstract: We present WorldMirror, an all-in-one, feed-forward model for versatile 3D
geometric prediction tasks. Unlike existing methods constrained to image-only
inputs or customized for a specific task, our framework flexibly integrates

Gaussians. This elegant and unified architecture leverages available prior
information to resolve structural ambiguities and delivers geometrically
consistent 3D outputs in a single forward pass. WorldMirror achieves
state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks from camera, point map,

Motivation: VR/AR systems need intelligent adaptation to user behaviors for enhanced interaction experiences, requiring accurate understanding of human intentions and prediction of future situated behaviors like gaze direction and object interactions.

Method: Proposes a hierarchical framework that identifies interaction targets and forecasts fine-grained future behaviors using historical human dynamics and scene contexts. Employs dynamic Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) to capture human-environment relationships.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks and live VR environments demonstrate superior performance across all metrics, enabling proactive VR systems that anticipate user behaviors.

Conclusion: The framework effectively models cognitive processes driving human-environment interactions, achieving practical applications for adaptive VR systems that can anticipate and respond to user behaviors.

Abstract: Virtual and augmented reality systems increasingly demand intelligent
adaptation to user behaviors for enhanced interaction experiences. Achieving
this requires accurately understanding human intentions and predicting future
situated behaviors - such as gaze direction and object interactions - which is
vital for creating responsive VR/AR environments and applications like
personalized assistants. However, accurate behavioral prediction demands
modeling the underlying cognitive processes that drive human-environment
interactions. In this work, we introduce a hierarchical, intention-aware
framework that models human intentions and predicts detailed situated behaviors
by leveraging cognitive mechanisms. Given historical human dynamics and the
observation of scene contexts, our framework first identifies potential
interaction targets and forecasts fine-grained future behaviors. We propose a
dynamic Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to effectively capture
human-environment relationships. Extensive experiments on challenging
real-world benchmarks and live VR environment demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach, achieving superior performance across all metrics and enabling
practical applications for proactive VR systems that anticipate user behaviors

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual inspection of underwater video footage is impractical due to vast volume of uneventful content, requiring automated methods for efficient marine biodiversity assessment.

Method: Introduced AURA benchmark dataset, evaluated four VAD models across two marine scenes, and implemented robust frame selection strategies to extract meaningful video segments.

Result: VAD performance varies dramatically across models, highly sensitive to training data amount and visual content variability defining "normal" scenes. Soft and consensus labels proved valuable.

Conclusion: The approach offers practical support for scientific exploration and scalable biodiversity monitoring through automated anomaly detection in underwater videos.

Abstract: Underwater video monitoring is a promising strategy for assessing marine
biodiversity, but the vast volume of uneventful footage makes manual inspection
highly impractical. In this work, we explore the use of visual anomaly
detection (VAD) based on deep neural networks to automatically identify
interesting or anomalous events. We introduce AURA, the first multi-annotator
benchmark dataset for underwater VAD, and evaluate four VAD models across two
marine scenes. We demonstrate the importance of robust frame selection
strategies to extract meaningful video segments. Our comparison against
multiple annotators reveals that VAD performance of current models varies
dramatically and is highly sensitive to both the amount of training data and
the variability in visual content that defines "normal" scenes. Our results

TL;DR: Proposes an inherently interpretable face similarity metric that breaks down global similarity into patch-level contributions, providing local explanations without post-hoc analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current post-hoc interpretability methods have uncertain fidelity to model reasoning due to lack of reliable evaluation metrics, motivating the design of inherently interpretable models.

Method: Defines face similarity as sum of patch-level similarity scores from restricted receptive fields, providing locally additive explanations without post-hoc analysis.

Result: Achieves competitive verification performance with 28x28 patches in 112x112 images, and surpasses state-of-the-art methods with 56x56 patches.

Conclusion: The proposed inherently interpretable approach provides transparent similarity measurements while maintaining competitive performance, offering a viable alternative to black-box models with post-hoc explanations.

Abstract: Understanding how deep neural networks make decisions is crucial for
analyzing their behavior and diagnosing failure cases. In computer vision, a
common approach to improve interpretability is to assign importance to
individual pixels using post-hoc methods. Although they are widely used to
explain black-box models, their fidelity to the model's actual reasoning is
uncertain due to the lack of reliable evaluation metrics. This limitation
motivates an alternative approach, which is to design models whose decision
processes are inherently interpretable. To this end, we propose a face
similarity metric that breaks down global similarity into contributions from
restricted receptive fields. Our method defines the similarity between two face
images as the sum of patch-level similarity scores, providing a locally
additive explanation without relying on post-hoc analysis. We show that the
proposed approach achieves competitive verification performance even with
patches as small as 28x28 within 112x112 face images, and surpasses
state-of-the-art methods when using 56x56 patches.

Method: Proposes a 2.5D graph-based approach where 3D CT volumes are represented as structured graphs with axial slice triplets as nodes, processed through spectral graph convolution to model inter-slice dependencies efficiently.

Result: Achieves strong cross-dataset generalization across 3 independent institution datasets, shows competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art visual encoders, and demonstrates broader applicability in radiology report generation and abdominal CT data.

Conclusion: The graph-based framework provides an effective alternative to 3D CNNs and Vision Transformers for multi-label CT classification, offering strong generalization capabilities and clinical deployment feasibility without extensive pre-training requirements.

Abstract: With the growing volume of CT examinations, there is an increasing demand for
automated tools such as organ segmentation, abnormality detection, and report
generation to support radiologists in managing their clinical workload.
Multi-label classification of 3D Chest CT scans remains a critical yet
challenging problem due to the complex spatial relationships inherent in
volumetric data and the wide variability of abnormalities. Existing methods
based on 3D convolutional neural networks struggle to capture long-range
dependencies, while Vision Transformers often require extensive pre-training on
large-scale, domain-specific datasets to perform competitively. In this work,
we propose a 2.5D alternative by introducing a new graph-based framework that
represents 3D CT volumes as structured graphs, where axial slice triplets serve
as nodes processed through spectral graph convolution, enabling the model to
reason over inter-slice dependencies while maintaining complexity compatible
with clinical deployment. Our method, trained and evaluated on 3 datasets from
independent institutions, achieves strong cross-dataset generalization, and
shows competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art visual encoders. We
further conduct comprehensive ablation studies to evaluate the impact of
various aggregation strategies, edge-weighting schemes, and graph connectivity
patterns. Additionally, we demonstrate the broader applicability of our
approach through transfer experiments on automated radiology report generation
and abdominal CT data.\\ This work extends our previous contribution presented
at the MICCAI 2025 EMERGE Workshop.

*Sneha Varur,Anirudh R Hanchinamani,Tarun S Bagewadi,Uma Mudenagudi,Chaitra D Desai,Sujata C,Padmashree Desai,Sumit Meharwade*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DISC-GAN is a novel framework for photorealistic underwater image synthesis that combines style-content disentanglement with cluster-specific training to handle diverse underwater environmental conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater image synthesis is challenging due to optical phenomena like color attenuation and turbidity, which create distinct stylistic variations across different waterbodies. Existing generative models struggle to model these non-uniform conditions in diverse underwater environments.

Method: Uses K-means clustering to partition dataset into style-specific domains, employs separate encoders for style and content latent spaces, integrates them via Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN), and trains independently on each style cluster to preserve domain-specific characteristics.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with SSIM of 0.9012, PSNR of 32.5118 dB, and FID of 13.3728.

Conclusion: The DISC-GAN framework successfully addresses the challenges of underwater image synthesis by combining style-content disentanglement with cluster-specific training, demonstrating superior performance in generating photorealistic underwater images.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Disentangled Style-Content GAN
(DISC-GAN), which integrates style-content disentanglement with a
cluster-specific training strategy towards photorealistic underwater image
synthesis. The quality of synthetic underwater images is challenged by optical
due to phenomena such as color attenuation and turbidity. These phenomena are
represented by distinct stylistic variations across different waterbodies, such
as changes in tint and haze. While generative models are well-suited to capture
complex patterns, they often lack the ability to model the non-uniform
conditions of diverse underwater environments. To address these challenges, we
employ K-means clustering to partition a dataset into style-specific domains.
We use separate encoders to get latent spaces for style and content; we further

Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 32.5118 dB, and a Frechet Inception Distance
(FID) of 13.3728.

*Rolandos Alexandros Potamias,Stathis Galanakis,Jiankang Deng,Athanasios Papaioannou,Stefanos Zafeiriou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: imHead is a novel implicit 3D morphable model that represents expressive 3D head avatars and enables localized facial feature editing using a compact identity space and region-specific latent representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3DMMs struggle with complex full-head shapes due to strict topology and linear nature limitations, while existing implicit methods have expensive latent sizes.

Method: Proposes imHead with a single compact identity space and intermediate region-specific latent representation to enable local edits, trained on a large-scale dataset of 4K distinct identities.

Result: Demonstrates superior expressive power for representing diverse identities and expressions compared to previous approaches, while providing localized editing capabilities.

Conclusion: imHead provides an interpretable solution for 3D face manipulation with localized editing, outperforming previous methods in expressive power and efficiency.

Abstract: Over the last years, 3D morphable models (3DMMs) have emerged as a
state-of-the-art methodology for modeling and generating expressive 3D avatars.
However, given their reliance on a strict topology, along with their linear
nature, they struggle to represent complex full-head shapes. Following the
advent of deep implicit functions, we propose imHead, a novel implicit 3DMM
that not only models expressive 3D head avatars but also facilitates localized
editing of the facial features. Previous methods directly divided the latent
space into local components accompanied by an identity encoding to capture the
global shape variations, leading to expensive latent sizes. In contrast, we
retain a single compact identity space and introduce an intermediate
region-specific latent representation to enable local edits. To train imHead,
we curate a large-scale dataset of 4K distinct identities, making a
step-towards large scale 3D head modeling. Under a series of experiments we
demonstrate the expressive power of the proposed model to represent diverse
identities and expressions outperforming previous approaches. Additionally, the
proposed approach provides an interpretable solution for 3D face manipulation,
allowing the user to make localized edits.

*Aleksandra Melnikova,Petr Matula*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper provides comprehensive description of the first publicly available full 3D time-lapse segmentation annotations of migrating cells with complex dynamic shapes, created for MDA231 human breast carcinoma cells from the Cell Tracking Challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality segmentation annotations of volumetric images are critical for advancing image processing but are time-consuming and challenging to create, especially for complex dynamic cell shapes.

Method: Three distinct humans manually annotated two sequences of MDA231 cells from the Cell Tracking Challenge, creating full 3D time-lapse segmentation annotations. The annotations were compared with CTC's tracking markers and automatically created silver truth.

Result: The created annotations are consistent with CTC's tracking markers and segmentation accuracy is within inter-annotator variability margins. The proposed annotations better represent the complexity of input images compared to CTC's automatic silver truth.

Conclusion: The presented 3D segmentation annotations can be used for testing and training cell segmentation algorithms, or for analyzing 3D shapes of highly dynamic objects like migrating cells.

Abstract: High-quality, publicly available segmentation annotations of image and video
datasets are critical for advancing the field of image processing. In
particular, annotations of volumetric images of a large number of targets are
time-consuming and challenging. In (Melnikova, A., & Matula, P., 2025), we
presented the first publicly available full 3D time-lapse segmentation
annotations of migrating cells with complex dynamic shapes. Concretely, three
distinct humans annotated two sequences of MDA231 human breast carcinoma cells
(Fluo-C3DL-MDA231) from the Cell Tracking Challenge (CTC).
  This paper aims to provide a comprehensive description of the dataset and
accompanying experiments that were not included in (Melnikova, A., & Matula,
P., 2025) due to limitations in publication space. Namely, we show that the
created annotations are consistent with the previously published tracking
markers provided by the CTC organizers and the segmentation accuracy measured
based on the 2D gold truth of CTC is within the inter-annotator variability
margins. We compared the created 3D annotations with automatically created
silver truth provided by CTC. We have found the proposed annotations better
represent the complexity of the input images. The presented annotations can be
used for testing and training cell segmentation, or analyzing 3D shapes of
highly dynamic objects.

Conclusion: MSCloudCAM proves effective and practical for large-scale Earth observation tasks, making it suitable for real-world applications in satellite imagery analysis.

Abstract: Clouds remain a critical challenge in optical satellite imagery, hindering
reliable analysis for environmental monitoring, land cover mapping, and climate
research. To overcome this, we propose MSCloudCAM, a Cross-Attention with
Multi-Scale Context Network tailored for multispectral and multi-sensor cloud
segmentation. Our framework exploits the spectral richness of Sentinel-2
(CloudSEN12) and Landsat-8 (L8Biome) data to classify four semantic categories:
clear sky, thin cloud, thick cloud, and cloud shadow. MSCloudCAM combines a
Swin Transformer backbone for hierarchical feature extraction with multi-scale
context modules ASPP and PSP for enhanced scale-aware learning. A
Cross-Attention block enables effective multisensor and multispectral feature
fusion, while the integration of an Efficient Channel Attention Block (ECAB)
and a Spatial Attention Module adaptively refine feature representations.
Comprehensive experiments on CloudSEN12 and L8Biome demonstrate that MSCloudCAM
delivers state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy, surpassing leading baseline
architectures while maintaining competitive parameter efficiency and FLOPs.
These results underscore the model's effectiveness and practicality, making it
well-suited for large-scale Earth observation tasks and real-world
applications.

*Clemence Mottez,Louisa Fay,Maya Varma,Sophie Ostmeier,Curtis Langlotz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework for detecting and mitigating bias in chest X-ray diagnostic models across demographic groups using CNN-XGBoost pipeline with eXtreme Gradient Boosting classifier replacement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models risk perpetuating healthcare disparities when performance varies across demographic groups like sex, age, and race in chest X-ray diagnosis.

Method: Extend CNN-XGBoost pipeline for multi-label classification, replace CNN final layer with XGBoost classifier, validate on DenseNet-121 and ResNet-50 backbones, compare with traditional bias mitigation techniques.

Result: XGBoost replacement improves fairness while maintaining predictive performance, achieves strong results across different backbones, offers competitive bias reduction at lower computational cost, and combining with active learning yields largest bias reduction.

Conclusion: The approach provides practical and effective path toward equitable deep learning deployment in clinical radiology, with model-agnostic design and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Deep learning models have shown promise in improving diagnostic accuracy from
chest X-rays, but they also risk perpetuating healthcare disparities when
performance varies across demographic groups. In this work, we present a
comprehensive bias detection and mitigation framework targeting sex, age, and
race-based disparities when performing diagnostic tasks with chest X-rays. We
extend a recent CNN-XGBoost pipeline to support multi-label classification and
evaluate its performance across four medical conditions. We show that replacing
the final layer of CNN with an eXtreme Gradient Boosting classifier improves
the fairness of the subgroup while maintaining or improving the overall
predictive performance. To validate its generalizability, we apply the method
to different backbones, namely DenseNet-121 and ResNet-50, and achieve
similarly strong performance and fairness outcomes, confirming its
model-agnostic design. We further compare this lightweight adapter training
method with traditional full-model training bias mitigation techniques,
including adversarial training, reweighting, data augmentation, and active
learning, and find that our approach offers competitive or superior bias
reduction at a fraction of the computational cost. Finally, we show that
combining eXtreme Gradient Boosting retraining with active learning yields the
largest reduction in bias across all demographic subgroups, both in and out of
distribution on the CheXpert and MIMIC datasets, establishing a practical and
effective path toward equitable deep learning deployment in clinical radiology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes two merging strategies (ECLM and Mask-ToMe) and a diffusion-based decoder to reduce computational cost in 3D Human Mesh Recovery while maintaining or slightly improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent transformer-based models for 3D Human Mesh Recovery achieve strong performance but suffer from high computational cost and complexity due to deep transformer architectures and redundant tokens.

Method: Two HMR-specific merging strategies: Error-Constrained Layer Merging (ECLM) and Mask-guided Token Merging (Mask-ToMe), plus a diffusion-based decoder that incorporates temporal context and pose priors.

Result: Achieves up to 2.3x speed-up while slightly improving performance over the baseline across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively reduces computational cost in 3D Human Mesh Recovery while maintaining or enhancing performance through targeted merging strategies and diffusion-based decoding.

Abstract: Recent transformer-based models for 3D Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) have
achieved strong performance but often suffer from high computational cost and
complexity due to deep transformer architectures and redundant tokens. In this
paper, we introduce two HMR-specific merging strategies: Error-Constrained
Layer Merging (ECLM) and Mask-guided Token Merging (Mask-ToMe). ECLM
selectively merges transformer layers that have minimal impact on the Mean Per
Joint Position Error (MPJPE), while Mask-ToMe focuses on merging background
tokens that contribute little to the final prediction. To further address the
potential performance drop caused by merging, we propose a diffusion-based
decoder that incorporates temporal context and leverages pose priors learned
from large-scale motion capture datasets. Experiments across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves up to 2.3x speed-up while
slightly improving performance over the baseline.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RareBoost3D is a synthetic point cloud dataset that addresses the long-tail problem in LiDAR perception by providing more instances for rare object classes, complemented by a cross-domain semantic alignment method (CSC loss) to improve segmentation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world point cloud datasets suffer from long-tail problems where rare classes have limited instances, hindering the development of LiDAR-based perception technologies like object segmentation for autonomous driving.

Method: Created RareBoost3D synthetic dataset with more instances for rare classes, and proposed CSC loss method for cross-domain semantic alignment to align feature representations of the same class across synthetic and real-world domains.

Result: Experimental results show that the cross-domain semantic alignment significantly enhances the performance of LiDAR point cloud segmentation models over real-world data.

Conclusion: The combination of synthetic RareBoost3D dataset and CSC loss alignment method effectively addresses the long-tail problem in point cloud datasets and improves segmentation performance for autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Real-world point cloud datasets have made significant contributions to the
development of LiDAR-based perception technologies, such as object segmentation
for autonomous driving. However, due to the limited number of instances in some
rare classes, the long-tail problem remains a major challenge in existing
datasets. To address this issue, we introduce a novel, synthetic point cloud
dataset named RareBoost3D, which complements existing real-world datasets by
providing significantly more instances for object classes that are rare in
real-world datasets. To effectively leverage both synthetic and real-world
data, we further propose a cross-domain semantic alignment method named CSC
loss that aligns feature representations of the same class across different
domains. Experimental results demonstrate that this alignment significantly
enhances the performance of LiDAR point cloud segmentation models over
real-world data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EarthWhere is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating vision-language models' image geolocation capabilities across country-level and street-level tasks, revealing performance gaps, regional biases, and limitations in reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To comprehensively evaluate VLMs' capacity for image-grounded geolocation in open-world conditions, which is challenging and in high demand for real-life applications.

Method: Created EarthWhere benchmark with 810 globally distributed images across two scales: WhereCountry (500 country-level MCQs with panoramas) and WhereStreet (310 street-level tasks requiring multi-step reasoning with optional web search). Used final-prediction metrics (Acc@k for coordinates, hierarchical path scores) and proposed intermediate reasoning scoring with human-verified visual clues and Shapley-reweighted thinking scores.

Result: Gemini-2.5-Pro achieved best average accuracy at 56.32%, while strongest open-weight model GLM-4.5V reached 34.71%. Web search and reasoning don't guarantee improved performance with limited visual clues, and models show regional biases (up to 42.7% higher scores in certain areas).

Conclusion: VLMs show promise but face persistent challenges in mitigating bias and achieving robust, fine-grained localization, highlighting the need for continued development in geolocation capabilities.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced rapidly, yet their capacity for
image-grounded geolocation in open-world conditions, a task that is challenging
and of demand in real life, has not been comprehensively evaluated. We present
EarthWhere, a comprehensive benchmark for VLM image geolocation that evaluates
visual recognition, step-by-step reasoning, and evidence use. EarthWhere
comprises 810 globally distributed images across two complementary geolocation
scales: WhereCountry (i.e., 500 multiple-choice question-answering, with
country-level answer and panoramas) and WhereStreet (i.e., 310 fine-grained
street-level identification tasks requiring multi-step reasoning with optional
web search). For evaluation, we adopt the final-prediction metrics: location
accuracies within k km (Acc@k) for coordinates and hierarchical path scores for
textual localization. Beyond this, we propose to explicitly score intermediate
reasoning chains using human-verified key visual clues and a Shapley-reweighted
thinking score that attributes credit to each clue's marginal contribution. We
benchmark 13 state-of-the-art VLMs with web searching tools on our EarthWhere
and report different types of final answer accuracies as well as the calibrated
model thinking scores. Overall, Gemini-2.5-Pro achieves the best average
accuracy at 56.32%, while the strongest open-weight model, GLM-4.5V, reaches
34.71%. We reveal that web search and reasoning do not guarantee improved
performance when visual clues are limited, and models exhibit regional biases,
achieving up to 42.7% higher scores in certain areas than others. These
findings highlight not only the promise but also the persistent challenges of
models to mitigate bias and achieve robust, fine-grained localization. We
open-source our benchmark at https://github.com/UCSC-VLAA/EarthWhere.

### [129] [Topological Alignment of Shared Vision-Language Embedding Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10889)
*Junwon You,Dasol Kang,Jae-Hun Jung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ToMCLIP introduces topological alignment to improve multilingual CLIP models by preserving the global geometry of embedding spaces, enhancing structural coherence and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multilingual VLMs have biased cross-modal alignment toward English and lack global geometry preservation in shared embedding spaces.

Method: Uses persistent homology to define topological alignment loss and approximates persistence diagrams with graph sparsification for theoretical error bounds.

Result: Improved structural coherence of multilingual representations, higher zero-shot accuracy on CIFAR-100, and stronger multilingual retrieval on xFlickr&CO.

Conclusion: The approach provides a general method for incorporating topological alignment into representation learning beyond VLMs.

Abstract: Contrastive Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong zero-shot
capabilities. However, their cross-modal alignment remains biased toward
English due to limited multilingual multimodal data. Recent multilingual
extensions have alleviated this gap but enforce instance-level alignment while
neglecting the global geometry of the shared embedding space. We address this
problem by introducing ToMCLIP (Topological Alignment for Multilingual CLIP), a
topology-aware framework aligning embedding spaces with topology-preserving
constraints. The proposed method applies persistent homology to define a
topological alignment loss and approximates persistence diagram with
theoretical error bounds using graph sparsification strategy. This work
validates the proposed approach, showing enhanced structural coherence of
multilingual representations, higher zero-shot accuracy on the CIFAR-100, and
stronger multilingual retrieval performance on the xFlickr&CO. Beyond VLMs, the
proposed approach provides a general method for incorporating topological
alignment into representation learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing scene text editing methods are limited to content replacement and simple styles, lacking the ability for free-style transfer. Flexible and localized style editing for scene text remains an unsolved challenge.

Method: Uses diffusion model inversion and self-attention for feature injection, applies distance-based changing mask for region control at each denoising step, and incorporates Fourier transform-based style enhancement module.

Result: Achieves superior performance in scene text style transformation, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods in both visual fidelity and text preservation.

Conclusion: The proposed SceneTextStylizer framework successfully enables flexible and high-fidelity style transfer for scene text while maintaining text readability and stylistic consistency.

Abstract: With the rapid development of diffusion models, style transfer has made
remarkable progress. However, flexible and localized style editing for scene
text remains an unsolved challenge. Although existing scene text editing
methods have achieved text region editing, they are typically limited to
content replacement and simple styles, which lack the ability of free-style
transfer. In this paper, we introduce SceneTextStylizer, a novel training-free
diffusion-based framework for flexible and high-fidelity style transfer of text
in scene images. Unlike prior approaches that either perform global style
transfer or focus solely on textual content modification, our method enables
prompt-guided style transformation specifically for text regions, while
preserving both text readability and stylistic consistency. To achieve this, we
design a feature injection module that leverages diffusion model inversion and
self-attention to transfer style features effectively. Additionally, a region
control mechanism is introduced by applying a distance-based changing mask at
each denoising step, enabling precise spatial control. To further enhance
visual quality, we incorporate a style enhancement module based on the Fourier
transform to reinforce stylistic richness. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method achieves superior performance in scene text style
transformation, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods in both visual
fidelity and text preservation.

diffusion models for superior controllability and precise real-image editing.
DreamMakeup employs early-stopped DDIM inversion to preserve the facial

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models like CLIP have limited fine-grained alignment capabilities, particularly for non-English languages, struggling with object attributes, spatial relations, and bilingual comprehension.

Method: Leverages fine-grained supervision including region-text matching and long-caption modeling, introduces Textual Intra-modal Contrastive (TIC) loss to distinguish semantically similar captions, and uses large-scale bilingual training data.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on 29 datasets across 8 tasks for both English and Chinese, with a new benchmark created for Chinese multimodal understanding.

Conclusion: FG-CLIP 2 successfully advances fine-grained bilingual vision-language alignment and provides resources for future research in this area.

Abstract: Fine-grained vision-language understanding requires precise alignment between
visual content and linguistic descriptions, a capability that remains limited
in current models, particularly in non-English settings. While models like CLIP
perform well on global alignment, they often struggle to capture fine-grained
details in object attributes, spatial relations, and linguistic expressions,
with limited support for bilingual comprehension. To address these challenges,
we introduce FG-CLIP 2, a bilingual vision-language model designed to advance
fine-grained alignment for both English and Chinese. Our approach leverages
rich fine-grained supervision, including region-text matching and long-caption
modeling, alongside multiple discriminative objectives. We further introduce
the Textual Intra-modal Contrastive (TIC) loss to better distinguish
semantically similar captions. Trained on a carefully curated mixture of
large-scale English and Chinese data, FG-CLIP 2 achieves powerful bilingual
performance. To enable rigorous evaluation, we present a new benchmark for
Chinese multimodal understanding, featuring long-caption retrieval and bounding
box classification. Extensive experiments on 29 datasets across 8 tasks show
that FG-CLIP 2 outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results
in both languages. We release the model, code, and benchmark to facilitate
future research on bilingual fine-grained alignment.

Conclusion: The proposed DKPMV pipeline demonstrates effective dense keypoint fusion using only RGB images, achieving superior performance for 6D pose estimation of textureless objects.

Abstract: 6D pose estimation of textureless objects is valuable for industrial robotic

information. Current multi-view methods either rely on depth data or
insufficiently exploit multi-view geometric cues, limiting their performance.
In this paper, we propose DKPMV, a pipeline that achieves dense keypoint-level

### [134] [Towards Distribution-Shift Uncertainty Estimation for Inverse Problems with Generative Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10947)
*Namhoon Kim,Sara Fridovich-Keil*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a calibration-free uncertainty indicator for generative models in inverse problems that detects distribution shift by measuring reconstruction stability under random measurement variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing uncertainty quantification methods require in-distribution calibration datasets, provide heuristic estimates, or fail to specifically address distribution shift risks in generative priors for medical imaging.

Method: Uses reconstruction stability under random measurement variations as a proxy for detecting distribution shift - in-distribution images remain stable while out-of-distribution images show greater variability.

Result: Validated on MNIST digit reconstruction, showing OOD digits exhibit higher reconstruction variability and error when using a model trained only on digit "0".

Conclusion: Enables deployment strategy pairing generative priors with lightweight guardrails that warn when priors are applied out-of-distribution, allowing aggressive measurement reduction for in-distribution cases.

Abstract: Generative models have shown strong potential as data-driven priors for
solving inverse problems such as reconstructing medical images from
undersampled measurements. While these priors improve reconstruction quality
with fewer measurements, they risk hallucinating features when test images lie
outside the training distribution. Existing uncertainty quantification methods
in this setting (i) require an in-distribution calibration dataset, which may
not be available, (ii) provide heuristic rather than statistical estimates, or
(iii) quantify uncertainty from model capacity or limited measurements rather
than distribution shift. We propose an instance-level, calibration-free
uncertainty indicator that is sensitive to distribution shift, requires no
knowledge of the training distribution, and incurs no retraining cost. Our key
hypothesis is that reconstructions of in-distribution images remain stable
under random measurement variations, while reconstructions of
out-of-distribution (OOD) images exhibit greater instability. We use this
stability as a proxy for detecting distribution shift. Our proposed OOD
indicator is efficiently computable for any computational imaging inverse
problem; we demonstrate it on tomographic reconstruction of MNIST digits, where
a learned proximal network trained only on digit "0" is evaluated on all ten
digits. Reconstructions of OOD digits show higher variability and
correspondingly higher reconstruction error, validating this indicator. These
results suggest a deployment strategy that pairs generative priors with
lightweight guardrails, enabling aggressive measurement reduction for
in-distribution cases while automatically warning when priors are applied out
of distribution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs like GPT-4 and DALL-E struggle with preserving logic, object identity, and style in multimodal image-text generation, limiting their generalization in complex scenarios.

Method: Two-stage framework: (1) dynamic IUT-Plug extraction module parses visual scenes into hierarchical symbolic structures, (2) coordinated narrative-flow and image synthesis mechanism ensures cross-modal consistency.

Result: IUT-Plug improves accuracy on established benchmarks and effectively alleviates three critical forms of context drift across diverse multimodal QA scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed IUT-Plug framework successfully addresses context drift issues in VLMs through structured reasoning and enhances multimodal generation capabilities.

Abstract: Existing vision language models (VLMs), including GPT-4 and DALL-E, often
struggle to preserve logic, object identity, and style in multimodal image-text
generation. This limitation significantly hinders the generalization capability
of VLMs in complex image-text input-output scenarios. To address this issue, we
propose IUT-Plug, a module grounded in an Image Understanding Tree (IUT), which
enhances existing interleaved VLMs through explicit structured reasoning,
thereby mitigating context drift in logic, entity identity, and style. The
proposed framework operates in two stages. (1) A dynamic IUT-Plug extraction
module parses visual scenes into hierarchical symbolic structures. (2) A
coordinated narrative-flow and image synthesis mechanism ensures cross-modal
consistency. To evaluate our approach, we construct a novel benchmark based on
3,000 real human-generated question-answer pairs over fine-tuned large models,
introducing a dynamic evaluation protocol for quantifying context drift in
interleaved VLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that IUT-Plug not only
improves accuracy on established benchmarks but also effectively alleviates the
three critical forms of context drift across diverse multimodal question
answering (QA) scenarios.

TL;DR: Chart-RVR is a framework that fine-tunes Large Vision-Language Models to improve robustness and explainability in chart reasoning using Group Relative Policy Optimization with verifiable rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLMs perform well on visual reasoning tasks but struggle with out-of-distribution data and produce unreliable chain-of-thought rationales, limiting explainability.

Method: Fine-tunes LVLMs using Group Relative Policy Optimization with three verifiable rewards: chart-type classification, chart table reconstruction, and process conformity.

Result: Chart-RVR-3B models achieve state-of-the-art results on six chart-reasoning benchmarks, closing the OOD performance gap and improving rationale fidelity compared to standard supervised fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates that verifiable rewards with GRPO can train reliable, interpretable chart-reasoning models that are both accurate and trustworthy.

Abstract: The capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have reached
state-of-the-art on many visual reasoning tasks, including chart reasoning, yet
they still falter on out-of-distribution (OOD) data, and degrade further when
asked to produce their chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales, limiting
explainability. We present Chart-RVR, a general framework that fine-tunes LVLMs
to be more robust and explainable for chart reasoning by coupling Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with automatically verifiable rewards. Our
framework comprises of three rewards that maximize: (i) correct chart-type
classification, (ii) faithful chart table reconstruction, and (iii) process
conformity. Applied to 3-billion-parameter LVLMs, Chart-RVR consistently
outperforms standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution datasets, closing the OOD performance gap while improving
rationale fidelity. The resulting models, the Chart-RVR-3B series, achieve
state-of-the-art results on six chart-reasoning benchmarks spanning in-domain
and OOD settings, surpassing all existing models of comparable size. Beyond
accuracy, Chart-RVR yields more interpretable CoT rationales, strengthening
trust and reliability - showcasing the power of verifiable rewards with GRPO
for training reliable, interpretable chart-reasoning models.

### [137] [Mixup Helps Understanding Multimodal Video Better](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10986)
*Xiaoyu Ma,Ding Ding,Hao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Multimodal Mixup (MM) and Balanced Multimodal Mixup (B-MM) to address overfitting to strong modalities in multimodal video understanding by applying mixup at feature level and dynamically adjusting mixing ratios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal models often overfit to strong modalities, suppressing contributions from weaker ones, which limits their performance in tasks like action recognition and emotion classification.

Method: MM applies mixup strategy at aggregated multimodal feature level to generate virtual feature-label pairs. B-MM extends this by dynamically adjusting mixing ratios for each modality based on their relative contributions.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple datasets show both methods effectively improve generalization and multimodal robustness compared to baseline approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed MM and B-MM methods successfully mitigate modality imbalance and overfitting in multimodal learning, enhancing model generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Multimodal video understanding plays a crucial role in tasks such as action
recognition and emotion classification by combining information from different
modalities. However, multimodal models are prone to overfitting strong
modalities, which can dominate learning and suppress the contributions of
weaker ones. To address this challenge, we first propose Multimodal Mixup (MM),
which applies the Mixup strategy at the aggregated multimodal feature level to
mitigate overfitting by generating virtual feature-label pairs. While MM
effectively improves generalization, it treats all modalities uniformly and
does not account for modality imbalance during training. Building on MM, we
further introduce Balanced Multimodal Mixup (B-MM), which dynamically adjusts
the mixing ratios for each modality based on their relative contributions to
the learning objective. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness of our methods in improving generalization and multimodal
robustness.

TL;DR: A comprehensive survey on Agentic Multimodal Large Language Models (Agentic MLLMs) that explores their conceptual foundations, establishes a three-dimensional framework, compiles resources, and outlines future research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing interest in agentic AI and its potential trajectory toward AGI, with a shift from traditional static AI agents to more dynamic, proactive, and generalizable agentic systems.

Method: Establishes a conceptual framework organizing agentic MLLMs along three dimensions: internal intelligence functions (planning, reasoning, memory), external tool invocation, and environment interaction. Compiles open-source training frameworks and datasets.

Result: Presents a comprehensive survey that delineates agentic MLLMs from conventional MLLM-based agents and provides a structured framework for understanding and developing these systems.

Conclusion: Agentic MLLMs represent an emerging paradigm with significant potential, and the survey aims to accelerate research by providing foundational concepts, resources, and future directions while maintaining an active repository for ongoing developments.

Abstract: With the recent emergence of revolutionary autonomous agentic systems,
research community is witnessing a significant shift from traditional static,
passive, and domain-specific AI agents toward more dynamic, proactive, and
generalizable agentic AI. Motivated by the growing interest in agentic AI and
its potential trajectory toward AGI, we present a comprehensive survey on
Agentic Multimodal Large Language Models (Agentic MLLMs). In this survey, we
explore the emerging paradigm of agentic MLLMs, delineating their conceptual
foundations and distinguishing characteristics from conventional MLLM-based
agents. We establish a conceptual framework that organizes agentic MLLMs along
three fundamental dimensions: (i) Agentic internal intelligence functions as
the system's commander, enabling accurate long-horizon planning through
reasoning, reflection, and memory; (ii) Agentic external tool invocation,
whereby models proactively use various external tools to extend their
problem-solving capabilities beyond their intrinsic knowledge; and (iii)
Agentic environment interaction further situates models within virtual or
physical environments, allowing them to take actions, adapt strategies, and
sustain goal-directed behavior in dynamic real-world scenarios. To further
accelerate research in this area for the community, we compile open-source
training frameworks, training and evaluation datasets for developing agentic
MLLMs. Finally, we review the downstream applications of agentic MLLMs and
outline future research directions for this rapidly evolving field. To
continuously track developments in this rapidly evolving field, we will also
actively update a public repository at
https://github.com/HJYao00/Awesome-Agentic-MLLMs.

Conclusion: PAInpainter demonstrates effectiveness and generalization capability for high-quality 3D Gaussian inpainting through perspective-aware content propagation and multi-view consistency verification.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian inpainting, a critical technique for numerous applications in
virtual reality and multimedia, has made significant progress with pretrained
diffusion models. However, ensuring multi-view consistency, an essential
requirement for high-quality inpainting, remains a key challenge. In this work,
we present PAInpainter, a novel approach designed to advance 3D Gaussian

PAInpainter substantially enhances global consistency and texture fidelity in
restored 3D scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
PAInpainter over existing methods. Our approach achieves superior 3D inpainting

*Ruihang Xu,Dewei Zhou,Fan Ma,Yi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ContextGen is a novel Diffusion Transformer framework for multi-instance image generation that uses layout and reference images to achieve precise object positioning and identity preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models struggle with multi-instance generation due to limitations in precise layout control and maintaining identity consistency across multiple distinct subjects.

Method: Uses Contextual Layout Anchoring (CLA) to incorporate layout images for object positioning and Identity Consistency Attention (ICA) with reference images to maintain identity consistency. Introduces IMIG-100K dataset with detailed layout and identity annotations.

Result: Sets new state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods in control precision, identity fidelity, and overall visual quality.

Conclusion: ContextGen effectively addresses key challenges in multi-instance generation through its novel framework combining layout anchoring and identity consistency mechanisms.

Abstract: Multi-instance image generation (MIG) remains a significant challenge for
modern diffusion models due to key limitations in achieving precise control
over object layout and preserving the identity of multiple distinct subjects.
To address these limitations, we introduce ContextGen, a novel Diffusion
Transformer framework for multi-instance generation that is guided by both
layout and reference images. Our approach integrates two key technical
contributions: a Contextual Layout Anchoring (CLA) mechanism that incorporates
the composite layout image into the generation context to robustly anchor the
objects in their desired positions, and Identity Consistency Attention (ICA),
an innovative attention mechanism that leverages contextual reference images to
ensure the identity consistency of multiple instances. Recognizing the lack of
large-scale, hierarchically-structured datasets for this task, we introduce
IMIG-100K, the first dataset with detailed layout and identity annotations.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that ContextGen sets a new state-of-the-art,
outperforming existing methods in control precision, identity fidelity, and
overall visual quality.

*Kai Han,Siqi Ma,Chengxuan Qian,Jun Chen,Chongwen Lyu,Yuqing Song,Zhe Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes FASS framework for medical image segmentation that addresses challenges in low-contrast tumor segmentation through foreground-aware processing, frequency enhancement, and edge constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models struggle with foreground focus in complex, low-contrast medical images where malignant tumors closely resemble normal organs, making contextual differentiation difficult.

Method: Three-module framework: 1) Foreground-aware module to amplify background-volume distinction, 2) Feature-level frequency enhancement using wavelet transform for boundary recognition, 3) Edge constraint module for geometric continuity.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple medical datasets show superior performance across all metrics, with particularly strong robustness under complex conditions and fine structure recognition.

Conclusion: FASS framework significantly enhances segmentation of low-contrast medical images and enables applications in more diverse and complex medical imaging scenarios.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of tumors and adjacent normal tissues in medical images
is essential for surgical planning and tumor staging. Although foundation
models generally perform well in segmentation tasks, they often struggle to
focus on foreground areas in complex, low-contrast backgrounds, where some
malignant tumors closely resemble normal organs, complicating contextual
differentiation. To address these challenges, we propose the Foreground-Aware
Spectrum Segmentation (FASS) framework. First, we introduce a foreground-aware
module to amplify the distinction between background and the entire volume
space, allowing the model to concentrate more effectively on target areas.
Next, a feature-level frequency enhancement module, based on wavelet transform,
extracts discriminative high-frequency features to enhance boundary recognition
and detail perception. Eventually, we introduce an edge constraint module to
preserve geometric continuity in segmentation boundaries. Extensive experiments
on multiple medical datasets demonstrate superior performance across all
metrics, validating the effectiveness of our framework, particularly in
robustness under complex conditions and fine structure recognition. Our
framework significantly enhances segmentation of low-contrast images, paving
the way for applications in more diverse and complex medical imaging scenarios.

*Sanchit Sinha,Guangzhi Xiong,Aidong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COCO-Tree improves VLMs' compositional reasoning using neurosymbolic concept trees learned from LLMs, boosting performance by 5-10% on benchmarks while providing interpretable reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle with compositional reasoning involving multiple objects, attributes, and relations. Existing solutions are either resource-intensive or lack interpretability.

Method: Augments VLM outputs with neurosymbolic concept trees learned from LLMs, using a beam search-inspired reasoning process to enhance linguistic reasoning.

Result: Significant improvement of 5-10% on four compositionality benchmarks (Winoground, EqBench, ColorSwap, SugarCrepe) across seven different VLMs.

Conclusion: COCO-Tree effectively enhances VLMs' compositional generalization while providing interpretable reasoning processes.

Abstract: Compositional reasoning remains a persistent weakness of modern vision
language models (VLMs): they often falter when a task hinges on understanding
how multiple objects, attributes, and relations interact within an image.
Multiple research works have attempted to improve compositionality performance
by creative tricks such as improving prompt structure, chain of thought
reasoning, etc. A more recent line of work attempts to impart additional
reasoning in VLMs using well-trained Large Language Models (LLMs), which are
far superior in linguistic understanding than VLMs to compensate for the
limited linguistic prowess of VLMs. However, these approaches are either
resource-intensive or do not provide an interpretable reasoning process. In
this paper, we present 'COCO-Tree' - a novel approach that augments VLM outputs
with carefully designed neurosymbolic concept trees learned from LLMs to
improve VLM's linguistic reasoning. COCO-Tree's beam search-inspired reasoning
process boosts compositionality performance and provides a rationale behind VLM
predictions. Empirical results on four compositionality benchmarks, Winoground,
EqBench, ColorSwap, and SugarCrepe, in seven different open-source VLMs with
varying sizes, demonstrate that COCO-Tree significantly improves compositional
generalization by 5-10% over baselines.

### [143] [High-Resolution Spatiotemporal Modeling with Global-Local State Space Models for Video-Based Human Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11017)
*Runyang Feng,Hyung Jin Chang,Tze Ho Elden Tse,Boeun Kim,Yi Chang,Yixing Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel framework that extends Mamba (state space models) to separately learn global and local high-resolution spatiotemporal representations for video-based human pose estimation, achieving better performance and computational efficiency than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VHPE methods struggle to balance global dynamic contexts and local motion details within single modeling structures, and suffer from quadratic complexity when capturing global dependencies. Mamba shows potential for long-range modeling with linear complexity but is limited to 1D sequential data.

Method: Proposes two extensions of Mamba: 1) Global Spatiotemporal Mamba with 6D selective space-time scan and spatial-temporal modulated scan merging for global representations, and 2) Local Refinement Mamba with windowed space-time scan for enhancing high-frequency details of localized keypoint motions.

Result: Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art VHPE approaches while achieving better computational trade-offs.

Conclusion: The framework successfully extends Mamba for VHPE by separately modeling global and local spatiotemporal representations, overcoming limitations of existing methods in balancing global-local dynamics and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Modeling high-resolution spatiotemporal representations, including both
global dynamic contexts (e.g., holistic human motion tendencies) and local
motion details (e.g., high-frequency changes of keypoints), is essential for
video-based human pose estimation (VHPE). Current state-of-the-art methods
typically unify spatiotemporal learning within a single type of modeling
structure (convolution or attention-based blocks), which inherently have
difficulties in balancing global and local dynamic modeling and may bias the
network to one of them, leading to suboptimal performance. Moreover, existing
VHPE models suffer from quadratic complexity when capturing global
dependencies, limiting their applicability especially for high-resolution
sequences. Recently, the state space models (known as Mamba) have demonstrated
significant potential in modeling long-range contexts with linear complexity;
however, they are restricted to 1D sequential data. In this paper, we present a
novel framework that extends Mamba from two aspects to separately learn global
and local high-resolution spatiotemporal representations for VHPE.
Specifically, we first propose a Global Spatiotemporal Mamba, which performs 6D
selective space-time scan and spatial- and temporal-modulated scan merging to
efficiently extract global representations from high-resolution sequences. We
further introduce a windowed space-time scan-based Local Refinement Mamba to
enhance the high-frequency details of localized keypoint motions. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed model
outperforms state-of-the-art VHPE approaches while achieving better
computational trade-offs.

*Shasha Guo,Liang Pang,Xi Wang,Yanling Wang,Huawei Shen,Jing Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes GeoVLMath, an LVLM that uses reinforcement learning with cross-modal rewards to generate textual descriptions of auxiliary lines for solving geometry problems, achieving competitive performance on auxiliary-line reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Auxiliary lines are crucial for solving complex geometry problems but current LVLMs struggle with them. Image editing approaches fail due to geometric precision issues, so textual descriptions better align with LVLM strengths.

Method: A reinforcement learning framework with cross-modal rewards that evaluates how well generated auxiliary-line descriptions match ground-truth diagrams. Uses GRPO-based RL for precise diagram-text alignment. Built GeoVLMath LVLM and created AuxSolidMath dataset with 3,018 geometry problems.

Result: GeoVLMath at 3B and 7B scales achieves competitive and often superior performance compared to strong open-source and proprietary LVLMs on auxiliary-line reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: Textual descriptions of auxiliary-line constructions combined with reinforcement learning for diagram-text alignment provide an effective approach for enhancing LVLMs' geometric reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Auxiliary lines are essential for solving complex geometric problems but
remain challenging for large vision-language models (LVLMs). Rather than
editing diagrams to draw auxiliary lines, which current image editing models
struggle to render with geometric precision, we generate textual descriptions
of auxiliary-line constructions to better align with the representational
strengths of LVLMs. To bridge the gap between textual descriptions and spatial
structure, we propose a reinforcement learning framework that enhances
diagram-text alignment. At the core of our approach is a cross-modal reward
that evaluates how well the generated auxiliary-line description for an
original diagram matches a ground-truth auxiliary-line diagram. Built on this
reward, we present GeoVLMath, an open-source LVLM tailored to auxiliary-line
reasoning in solid geometry. This fine-grained signal drives a GRPO-based RL
stage, yielding precise diagram-text alignment. To support training, we develop
a scalable data creation pipeline and construct AuxSolidMath, a dataset of
3,018 real-exam geometry problems with paired diagrams and aligned textual
fields. At the 3B and 7B scales, GeoVLMath achieves competitive and often
superior performance compared with strong open-source and proprietary LVLMs on
auxiliary-line reasoning benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GIR-Bench is a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates unified multimodal models across three perspectives: understanding-generation consistency, reasoning-centric text-to-image generation, and multi-step reasoning in editing, revealing persistent gaps between understanding and generation capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The community lacks a rigorous reasoning-centric benchmark to systematically evaluate the alignment between understanding and generation in unified multimodal models, and their generalization potential in complex visual tasks.

Method: GIR-Bench evaluates models across three complementary perspectives with carefully designed task-specific evaluation pipelines: (1) understanding-generation consistency, (2) reasoning-centric text-to-image generation requiring logical constraints and implicit knowledge, and (3) multi-step reasoning in editing tasks.

Result: Extensive evaluations show that while unified models are more capable of reasoning-driven visual tasks, they still exhibit a persistent gap between understanding and generation capabilities.

Conclusion: GIR-Bench provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating unified multimodal models, highlighting the need for better alignment between understanding and generation in reasoning-centric visual tasks.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models integrate the reasoning capacity of large language
models with both image understanding and generation, showing great promise for
advanced multimodal intelligence. However, the community still lacks a rigorous
reasoning-centric benchmark to systematically evaluate the alignment between
understanding and generation, and their generalization potential in complex
visual tasks. To this end, we introduce \textbf{GIR-Bench}, a comprehensive
benchmark that evaluates unified models across three complementary
perspectives. Firstly, we investigate understanding-generation consistency
(GIR-Bench-UGC), asking whether models can consistently leverage the same
knowledge in both understanding and generation tasks. Secondly, we investigate
whether models can perform reasoning-centric text-to-image generation that
requires applying logical constraints and implicit knowledge to generate
faithful visual content (GIR-Bench-T2I). Thirdly, we evaluate whether models
can handle multi-step reasoning in editing (GIR-Bench-Edit). For each subset,
we carefully design different task-specific evaluation pipelines tailored for
each task. This enables fine-grained and interpretable evaluation while
mitigating biases from the prevalent MLLM-as-a-Judge paradigm. Extensive
ablations over various unified models and generation-only systems have shown
that: Although unified models are more capable of reasoning-driven visual
tasks, they still exhibit a persistent gap between understanding and
generation. The data and code for GIR-Bench are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between upstream VLM-based reasoning and downstream VLA policy learning for embodied agents, integrating high-level reasoning with low-level control.

Method: Built upon the Vlaser-6M dataset, Vlaser integrates reasoning with control and systematically examines how different VLM initializations affect supervised VLA fine-tuning to mitigate domain shift.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on embodied reasoning benchmarks (spatial reasoning, embodied grounding, QA, task planning) and SOTA results on WidowX benchmark with competitive performance on Google Robot benchmark.

Conclusion: Vlaser successfully bridges embodied reasoning with VLA policy learning and provides insights for mitigating domain shift between pre-training data and embodied policy learning.

Abstract: While significant research has focused on developing embodied reasoning
capabilities using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) or integrating advanced VLMs
into Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for end-to-end robot control, few
studies directly address the critical gap between upstream VLM-based reasoning
and downstream VLA policy learning. In this work, we take an initial step
toward bridging embodied reasoning with VLA policy learning by introducing
Vlaser - a Vision-Language-Action Model with synergistic embodied reasoning
capability, which is a foundational vision-language model designed to integrate
high-level reasoning with low-level control for embodied agents. Built upon the
high-quality Vlaser-6M dataset, Vlaser achieves state-of-the-art performance
across a range of embodied reasoning benchmarks - including spatial reasoning,
embodied grounding, embodied QA, and task planning. Furthermore, we
systematically examine how different VLM initializations affect supervised VLA
fine-tuning, offering novel insights into mitigating the domain shift between
internet-scale pre-training data and embodied-specific policy learning data.
Based on these insights, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the
WidowX benchmark and competitive performance on the Google Robot benchmark.

TL;DR: A novel two-stage framework for zero-shot anomaly segmentation that leverages CLIP's anomaly localization and SAM's boundary perception, achieving state-of-the-art results with significant improvements on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of properly guiding foundation models for zero-shot anomaly segmentation tasks in industrial anomaly detection, particularly overcoming SAM's tendency for object segmentation rather than anomaly-focused segmentation.

Method: Two-stage framework with: (1) Co-Feature Point Prompt Generation (PPG) module that collaboratively uses CLIP and SAM to generate positive/negative point prompts to guide SAM toward anomalous regions; (2) Cascaded Prompts for SAM (CPS) module that uses hybrid prompts with SAM's lightweight decoder to optimize segmentation and address rough boundaries and noise.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot anomaly segmentation results across multiple datasets, with particularly strong performance on Visa dataset - outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 10.3% in F1-max and 7.7% in AP metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively leverages foundation models' capabilities for precise zero-shot anomaly segmentation, demonstrating superior performance through collaborative use of CLIP and SAM with innovative prompt generation and optimization modules.

Abstract: Recently, the powerful generalization ability exhibited by foundation models
has brought forth new solutions for zero-shot anomaly segmentation tasks.
However, guiding these foundation models correctly to address downstream tasks
remains a challenge. This paper proposes a novel two-stage framework, for
zero-shot anomaly segmentation tasks in industrial anomaly detection. This
framework excellently leverages the powerful anomaly localization capability of
CLIP and the boundary perception ability of SAM.(1) To mitigate SAM's
inclination towards object segmentation, we propose the Co-Feature Point Prompt
Generation (PPG) module. This module collaboratively utilizes CLIP and SAM to
generate positive and negative point prompts, guiding SAM to focus on
segmenting anomalous regions rather than the entire object. (2) To further
optimize SAM's segmentation results and mitigate rough boundaries and isolated
noise, we introduce the Cascaded Prompts for SAM (CPS) module. This module
employs hybrid prompts cascaded with a lightweight decoder of SAM, achieving
precise segmentation of anomalous regions. Across multiple datasets, consistent
experimental validation demonstrates that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art zero-shot anomaly segmentation results. Particularly
noteworthy is our performance on the Visa dataset, where we outperform the
state-of-the-art methods by 10.3\% and 7.7\% in terms of {$F_1$-max} and AP
metrics, respectively.

Motivation: Laryngeal cancer imaging research lacks standardized datasets for reproducible deep learning model development, creating a need for curated benchmarks to support AI-driven clinical decision making.

Method: Created LaryngealCT benchmark with 1,029 CT scans from TCIA, extracted uniform 1mm isotropic volumes using weakly supervised parameter search, and benchmarked 3D DL architectures (3D CNN, ResNet18,50,101, DenseNet121) on early vs. advanced and T4 vs. non-T4 classification tasks.

Result: 3D CNN achieved AUC-0.881 and F1-macro-0.821 for early vs. advanced classification, while ResNet18 achieved AUC-0.892 and F1-macro-0.646 for T4 vs. non-T4 classification. 3D GradCAM analysis showed peri-cartilage attention in non-T4 cases and focal activations in T4 predictions.

Conclusion: LaryngealCT provides a reproducible foundation for AI-driven laryngeal cancer research through open-source data, pretrained models, and integrated explainability tools to support clinical decisions.

Abstract: Laryngeal cancer imaging research lacks standardised datasets to enable
reproducible deep learning (DL) model development. We present LaryngealCT, a
curated benchmark of 1,029 computed tomography (CT) scans aggregated from six
collections from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). Uniform 1 mm isotropic
volumes of interest encompassing the larynx were extracted using a weakly
supervised parameter search framework validated by clinical experts. 3D DL
architectures (3D CNN, ResNet18,50,101, DenseNet121) were benchmarked on (i)
early (Tis,T1,T2) vs. advanced (T3,T4) and (ii) T4 vs. non-T4 classification
tasks. 3D CNN (AUC-0.881, F1-macro-0.821) and ResNet18 (AUC-0.892,
F1-macro-0.646) respectively outperformed the other models in the two tasks.
Model explainability assessed using 3D GradCAMs with thyroid cartilage overlays
revealed greater peri-cartilage attention in non-T4 cases and focal activations
in T4 predictions. Through open-source data, pretrained models, and integrated
explainability tools, LaryngealCT offers a reproducible foundation for

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-guided diffusion models struggle to maintain ID and structural consistency in real face editing tasks, limiting their effectiveness for facial attribute manipulation.

Method: Decompose face representation into ID and attribute features, using them as joint conditions to guide both inversion and reverse diffusion processes for independent control over ID and attributes.

Result: Method achieves strong ID preservation and structural consistency while enabling precise facial attribute manipulation, supporting complex multi-attribute editing with only text prompts at DDIM inversion speed.

Conclusion: The proposed zero-shot face editing method demonstrates practicality and effectiveness for maintaining identity consistency while enabling flexible facial attribute manipulation through text prompts.

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-guided diffusion models have shown promise for
general image editing via inversion techniques, but often struggle to maintain
ID and structural consistency in real face editing tasks. To address this
limitation, we propose a zero-shot face editing method based on ID-Attribute
Decoupled Inversion. Specifically, we decompose the face representation into ID
and attribute features, using them as joint conditions to guide both the
inversion and the reverse diffusion processes. This allows independent control
over ID and attributes, ensuring strong ID preservation and structural
consistency while enabling precise facial attribute manipulation. Our method
supports a wide range of complex multi-attribute face editing tasks using only
text prompts, without requiring region-specific input, and operates at a speed
comparable to DDIM inversion. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate its
practicality and effectiveness.

TL;DR: The 7th LSVOS Challenge at ICCV 2025 introduces a new Complex VOS track (MOSEv2) with more realistic and challenging scenarios, while maintaining traditional VOS and RVOS tracks to advance video object segmentation robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To push video object segmentation beyond curated benchmarks by introducing more realistic challenges including dense small objects, disappear/reappear events, severe occlusions, and adverse conditions, aiming for better long-term consistency and generalization.

Method: The challenge features three tracks: Classic VOS, Referring VOS, and the new Complex VOS (MOSEv2) with increased difficulty. Standard J, F, and J&F metrics are used for VOS/RVOS, while MOSEv2 adopts J&Ḟ to better evaluate objects across scales and disappearance cases.

Result: The challenge successfully evaluated top-performing solutions and identified emerging trends including the growing role of LLM/MLLM components and memory-aware propagation techniques.

Conclusion: The 2025 LSVOS Challenge advances the field by introducing more realistic evaluation scenarios and highlighting future directions for resilient, language-aware video segmentation in real-world conditions.

Abstract: This report presents an overview of the 7th Large-scale Video Object
Segmentation (LSVOS) Challenge held in conjunction with ICCV 2025. Besides the
two traditional tracks of LSVOS that jointly target robustness in realistic
video scenarios: Classic VOS (VOS), and Referring VOS (RVOS), the 2025 edition
features a newly introduced track, Complex VOS (MOSEv2). Building upon prior
insights, MOSEv2 substantially increases difficulty, introducing more
challenging but realistic scenarios including denser small objects, frequent
disappear/reappear events, severe occlusions, adverse weather and lighting,
etc., pushing long-term consistency and generalization beyond curated
benchmarks. The challenge retains standard ${J}$, $F$, and ${J\&F}$ metrics for
VOS and RVOS, while MOSEv2 adopts ${J\&\dot{F}}$ as the primary ranking metric
to better evaluate objects across scales and disappearance cases. We summarize
datasets and protocols, highlight top-performing solutions, and distill
emerging trends, such as the growing role of LLM/MLLM components and
memory-aware propagation, aiming to chart future directions for resilient,
language-aware video segmentation in the wild.

*Huizai Yao,Sicheng Zhao,Shuo Lu,Hui Chen,Yangyang Li,Guoping Liu,Tengfei Xing,Chenggang Yan,Jianhua Tao,Guiguang Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FRANCK is a novel Source-Free Object Detection framework specifically designed for DETR models, featuring objectness score-based sample reweighting, contrastive learning with memory banks, uncertainty-weighted feature distillation, and improved self-training with dynamic teacher updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SFOD approaches are either limited to conventional object detection models like Faster R-CNN or lack tailored adaptations for novel Detection Transformer (DETR) architectures, creating a need for specialized SFOD solutions for DETR models.

Method: FRANCK uses four key components: 1) Objectness Score-based Sample Reweighting for attention-based loss reweighting, 2) Contrastive Learning with Matching-based Memory Bank for class-wise feature enhancement, 3) Uncertainty-weighted Query-fused Feature Distillation for improved feature transfer, and 4) Dynamic Teacher Updating Interval for better pseudo-label quality in self-training.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that FRANCK achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating enhanced robustness and generalization for DETR-based SFOD models.

Conclusion: FRANCK effectively adapts source-pre-trained DETR models to target domains and represents an effective and compatible solution for DETR-based Source-Free Object Detection.

Abstract: Source-Free Object Detection (SFOD) enables knowledge transfer from a source
domain to an unsupervised target domain for object detection without access to
source data. Most existing SFOD approaches are either confined to conventional
object detection (OD) models like Faster R-CNN or designed as general solutions
without tailored adaptations for novel OD architectures, especially Detection
Transformer (DETR). In this paper, we introduce Feature Reweighting ANd
Contrastive Learning NetworK (FRANCK), a novel SFOD framework specifically
designed to perform query-centric feature enhancement for DETRs. FRANCK
comprises four key components: (1) an Objectness Score-based Sample Reweighting
(OSSR) module that computes attention-based objectness scores on multi-scale
encoder feature maps, reweighting the detection loss to emphasize
less-recognized regions; (2) a Contrastive Learning with Matching-based Memory
Bank (CMMB) module that integrates multi-level features into memory banks,
enhancing class-wise contrastive learning; (3) an Uncertainty-weighted
Query-fused Feature Distillation (UQFD) module that improves feature
distillation through prediction quality reweighting and query feature fusion;
and (4) an improved self-training pipeline with a Dynamic Teacher Updating
Interval (DTUI) that optimizes pseudo-label quality. By leveraging these
components, FRANCK effectively adapts a source-pre-trained DETR model to a
target domain with enhanced robustness and generalization. Extensive
experiments on several widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its effectiveness and
compatibility with DETR-based SFOD models.

*Xianlin Liu,Yan Gong,Bohao Li,Jiajing Huang,Bowen Du,Junchen Ye,Liyan Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A panoptic symbol spotting framework for CAD drawings that incorporates textual annotations and models relationships between geometric and textual primitives using a Transformer-based backbone with type-aware attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for CAD drawing analysis overlook textual annotations and lack explicit modeling of relationships among primitives, leading to incomprehensive understanding of holistic drawings.

Method: Proposes a framework that constructs unified representations by jointly modeling geometric and textual primitives, uses pretrained CNN for initial feature extraction, and employs a Transformer-based backbone with type-aware attention to model spatial dependencies.

Result: Outperforms existing approaches on symbol spotting tasks involving textual annotations and exhibits superior robustness on complex CAD drawings.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses limitations of existing approaches by incorporating textual information and explicit relationship modeling, achieving better performance in CAD drawing analysis.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Computer-Aided Design(CAD) drawings in
engineering, architecture, and industrial design, the ability to accurately
interpret and analyze these drawings has become increasingly critical. Among
various subtasks, panoptic symbol spotting plays a vital role in enabling
downstream applications such as CAD automation and design retrieval. Existing
methods primarily focus on geometric primitives within the CAD drawings to
address this task, but they face following major problems: they usually
overlook the rich textual annotations present in CAD drawings and they lack
explicit modeling of relationships among primitives, resulting in
incomprehensive understanding of the holistic drawings. To fill this gap, we
propose a panoptic symbol spotting framework that incorporates textual
annotations. The framework constructs unified representations by jointly
modeling geometric and textual primitives. Then, using visual features extract
by pretrained CNN as the initial representations, a Transformer-based backbone
is employed, enhanced with a type-aware attention mechanism to explicitly model
the different types of spatial dependencies between various primitives.
Extensive experiments on the real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed
method outperforms existing approaches on symbol spotting tasks involving
textual annotations, and exhibits superior robustness when applied to complex
CAD drawings.

### [154] [Future-Aware End-to-End Driving: Bidirectional Modeling of Trajectory Planning and Scene Evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11092)
*Bozhou Zhang,Nan Song,Jingyu Li,Xiatian Zhu,Jiankang Deng,Li Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeerDrive is an end-to-end autonomous driving framework that jointly models future scene evolution and trajectory planning in a closed-loop manner, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional end-to-end autonomous driving methods operate under a one-shot paradigm that underestimates scene dynamics and temporal evolution, limiting adaptive decision-making in complex scenarios.

Method: Proposes SeerDrive with two key components: (1) future-aware planning that injects predicted BEV features into trajectory planner, and (2) iterative scene modeling and vehicle planning that refines both future scene prediction and trajectory generation through collaborative optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments on NAVSIM and nuScenes benchmarks show SeerDrive significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The bidirectional relationship between vehicle trajectory and scene dynamics enables more informed and adaptive autonomous driving decisions through joint modeling of future scene evolution and trajectory planning.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving methods aim to directly map raw sensor inputs
to future driving actions such as planned trajectories, bypassing traditional
modular pipelines. While these approaches have shown promise, they often
operate under a one-shot paradigm that relies heavily on the current scene
context, potentially underestimating the importance of scene dynamics and their
temporal evolution. This limitation restricts the model's ability to make
informed and adaptive decisions in complex driving scenarios. We propose a new
perspective: the future trajectory of an autonomous vehicle is closely
intertwined with the evolving dynamics of its environment, and conversely, the
vehicle's own future states can influence how the surrounding scene unfolds.
Motivated by this bidirectional relationship, we introduce SeerDrive, a novel
end-to-end framework that jointly models future scene evolution and trajectory
planning in a closed-loop manner. Our method first predicts future bird's-eye
view (BEV) representations to anticipate the dynamics of the surrounding scene,
then leverages this foresight to generate future-context-aware trajectories.
Two key components enable this: (1) future-aware planning, which injects
predicted BEV features into the trajectory planner, and (2) iterative scene
modeling and vehicle planning, which refines both future scene prediction and
trajectory generation through collaborative optimization. Extensive experiments
on the NAVSIM and nuScenes benchmarks show that SeerDrive significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

*Fengling Zhu,Boshi Liu,Jingyu Hua,Sheng Zhong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a supervised diffusion-based denoising framework to defend multimodal LLMs against visual adversarial attacks, achieving higher quality reconstructions and improved robustness compared to unsupervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal LLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks on visual inputs, and existing defenses like adversarial training and input purification have limitations in computational cost, image quality degradation, and generalization to complex multimodal tasks.

Method: Supervised diffusion-based denoising framework that fine-tunes diffusion models using paired adversarial-clean image datasets with directional, task-specific guidance, complemented by prompt optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments on image captioning and VQA show substantial robustness improvements and strong transferability to unknown adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: The supervised diffusion-based denoising approach effectively defends multimodal systems against visual adversarial attacks, enabling more reliable deployment of MLLMs in real-world applications.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
tasks such as image captioning, visual question answering, and cross-modal
reasoning by integrating visual and textual modalities. However, their
multimodal nature also exposes them to adversarial threats, where attackers can
perturb either modality or both jointly to induce harmful, misleading, or
policy violating outputs. Existing defense strategies, such as adversarial
training and input purification, face notable limitations: adversarial training
typically improves robustness only against known attacks while incurring high
computational costs, whereas conventional purification approaches often suffer
from degraded image quality and insufficient generalization to complex
multimodal tasks.
  In this work, we focus on defending the visual modality, which frequently
serves as the primary entry point for adversarial manipulation. We propose a
supervised diffusion based denoising framework that leverages paired
adversarial clean image datasets to fine-tune diffusion models with
directional, task specific guidance. Unlike prior unsupervised purification
methods such as DiffPure, our approach achieves higher quality reconstructions
while significantly improving defense robustness in multimodal tasks.
Furthermore, we incorporate prompt optimization as a complementary defense
mechanism, enhancing resistance against diverse and unseen attack strategies.
  Extensive experiments on image captioning and visual question answering
demonstrate that our method not only substantially improves robustness but also
exhibits strong transferability to unknown adversarial attacks. These results
highlight the effectiveness of supervised diffusion based denoising for
multimodal defense, paving the way for more reliable and secure deployment of
MLLMs in real world applications.

TL;DR: This paper presents the first comprehensive survey on Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL), systematically reviewing state-of-the-art methods through a taxonomy based on disentanglement approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CZSL addresses the combinatorial challenge of recognizing unseen attribute-object combinations by modeling contextual visual appearances and compositionality, which is crucial for robust zero-shot recognition.

Method: The survey introduces a taxonomy grounded in disentanglement with four families: no explicit disentanglement, textual disentanglement, visual disentanglement, and cross-modal disentanglement, providing comparative analysis across different problem settings.

Result: The paper systematically reviews CZSL methods, highlighting their advantages and limitations in closed-world and open-world settings, and identifies significant open challenges.

Conclusion: This survey serves as a foundational resource to guide and inspire further advancements in CZSL, with available code and papers on GitHub for continued research.

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) is a critical task in computer vision
that enables models to recognize unseen combinations of known attributes and
objects during inference, addressing the combinatorial challenge of requiring
training data for every possible composition. This is particularly challenging
because the visual appearance of primitives is highly contextual; for example,
``small'' cats appear visually distinct from ``older'' ones, and ``wet'' cars
differ significantly from ``wet'' cats. Effectively modeling this contextuality
and the inherent compositionality is crucial for robust compositional zero-shot
recognition. This paper presents, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive
survey specifically focused on Compositional Zero-Shot Learning. We
systematically review the state-of-the-art CZSL methods, introducing a taxonomy
grounded in disentanglement, with four families of approaches: no explicit
disentanglement, textual disentanglement, visual disentanglement, and
cross-modal disentanglement. We provide a detailed comparative analysis of
these methods, highlighting their core advantages and limitations in different
problem settings, such as closed-world and open-world CZSL. Finally, we
identify the most significant open challenges and outline promising future
research directions. This survey aims to serve as a foundational resource to
guide and inspire further advancements in this fascinating and important field.

*Jiahui Lei,Kyle Genova,George Kopanas,Noah Snavely,Leonidas Guibas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a pixel-aligned Motion Map (MoMap) representation for 3D scene motion that enables future motion prediction from a single image using diffusion models trained on large-scale video data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of learning semantically meaningful 3D motion priors from real-world videos for predicting future 3D scene motion from single images.

Method: Developed a novel MoMap representation for 3D motion, created a large-scale database from 50,000+ videos, trained a diffusion model on MoMaps, and proposed a pipeline for 2D video synthesis via MoMap generation and image warping.

Result: The approach generates plausible and semantically consistent 3D scene motion, demonstrating effective motion prediction capabilities.

Conclusion: The MoMap representation combined with diffusion modeling provides an effective framework for learning 3D motion priors and enables both 3D motion prediction and 2D video synthesis pipelines.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of learning semantically and functionally
meaningful 3D motion priors from real-world videos, in order to enable
prediction of future 3D scene motion from a single input image. We propose a
novel pixel-aligned Motion Map (MoMap) representation for 3D scene motion,
which can be generated from existing generative image models to facilitate
efficient and effective motion prediction. To learn meaningful distributions
over motion, we create a large-scale database of MoMaps from over 50,000 real
videos and train a diffusion model on these representations. Our motion
generation not only synthesizes trajectories in 3D but also suggests a new
pipeline for 2D video synthesis: first generate a MoMap, then warp an image
accordingly and complete the warped point-based renderings. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach generates plausible and semantically
consistent 3D scene motion.

*Chen Liu,Wenfang Yao,Kejing Yin,William K. Cheung,Jing Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiPro is a framework that disentangles static and dynamic features in sequential chest X-rays and aligns them with EHR data to model disease progression, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Longitudinal multimodal data (EHR and CXRs) is underutilized due to redundancy in CXR sequences and temporal misalignment between sparse imaging and continuous EHR data.

Method: Region-aware disentanglement of static (anatomy) and dynamic (pathology) features in CXRs, followed by hierarchical alignment with EHR data via local and global synchronization.

Result: Extensive experiments on MIMIC dataset show DiPro effectively extracts temporal clinical dynamics and achieves state-of-the-art performance on disease progression identification and ICU prediction tasks.

Conclusion: DiPro addresses key challenges in multimodal longitudinal data analysis and demonstrates superior performance in modeling disease progression.

Abstract: Longitudinal multimodal data, including electronic health records (EHR) and
sequential chest X-rays (CXRs), is critical for modeling disease progression,
yet remains underutilized due to two key challenges: (1) redundancy in
consecutive CXR sequences, where static anatomical regions dominate over
clinically-meaningful dynamics, and (2) temporal misalignment between sparse,
irregular imaging and continuous EHR data. We introduce $\texttt{DiPro}$, a
novel framework that addresses these challenges through region-aware
disentanglement and multi-timescale alignment. First, we disentangle static
(anatomy) and dynamic (pathology progression) features in sequential CXRs,
prioritizing disease-relevant changes. Second, we hierarchically align these
static and dynamic CXR features with asynchronous EHR data via local (pairwise
interval-level) and global (full-sequence) synchronization to model coherent
progression pathways. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC dataset demonstrate
that $\texttt{DiPro}$ could effectively extract temporal clinical dynamics and
achieve state-of-the-art performance on both disease progression identification
and general ICU prediction tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SynTrans is a novel few-shot learning framework that transfers diverse knowledge from large multimodal models to empower few-shot learners through synergistic knowledge mining and bi-directional visual-semantic knowledge transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing few-shot learning methods that leverage semantic knowledge from smaller-scale models often introduce noise and bias due to data simplicity, limiting their effectiveness in handling data scarcity.

Method: SynTrans uses CLIP as a teacher and few-shot vision encoder as student, distilling knowledge via unsupervised proxy task. It includes synergistic knowledge mining, visual-semantic bridging module, and adaptive multimodal classifier construction with visual weight generator and semantic weight reconstructor.

Result: Experimental results on four FSL datasets show that SynTrans significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, even when paired with a simple few-shot vision encoder.

Conclusion: SynTrans effectively addresses few-shot learning challenges by synergistically transferring diverse knowledge from large multimodal models, demonstrating superior performance over existing approaches.

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) addresses the challenge of classifying novel classes
with limited training samples. While some methods leverage semantic knowledge
from smaller-scale models to mitigate data scarcity, these approaches often
introduce noise and bias due to the data's inherent simplicity. In this paper,
we propose a novel framework, Synergistic Knowledge Transfer (SynTrans), which
effectively transfers diverse and complementary knowledge from large multimodal
models to empower the off-the-shelf few-shot learner. Specifically, SynTrans
employs CLIP as a robust teacher and uses a few-shot vision encoder as a weak
student, distilling semantic-aligned visual knowledge via an unsupervised proxy
task. Subsequently, a training-free synergistic knowledge mining module
facilitates collaboration among large multimodal models to extract high-quality
semantic knowledge. Building upon this, a visual-semantic bridging module
enables bi-directional knowledge transfer between visual and semantic spaces,
transforming explicit visual and implicit semantic knowledge into
category-specific classifier weights. Finally, SynTrans introduces a visual
weight generator and a semantic weight reconstructor to adaptively construct
optimal multimodal FSL classifiers. Experimental results on four FSL datasets
demonstrate that SynTrans, even when paired with a simple few-shot vision
encoder, significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

*Yaqi Zhao,Xiaochen Wang,Li Dong,Wentao Zhang,Yuhui Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Scaling up datasets and model size alone does not improve diffusion models' ability to accurately count objects in text-to-image generation. The study reveals noise initialization biases and proposes a count-aware layout injection method that significantly improves numerosity accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art text-to-image models like FLUX and GPT-4o struggle with accurately following counting instructions in prompts, raising the question of whether scaling alone can solve numerosity challenges.

Method: Created two synthetic numerosity benchmarks (GrayCount250 and NaturalCount6) for evaluation. Analyzed scaling effects and identified noise initialization biases. Proposed injecting count-aware layout information into the noise prior to control numerosity.

Result: Scaling hypothesis disproved - larger models/datasets alone don't improve counting accuracy. Proposed method achieved significant gains: GrayCount250 accuracy improved from 20.0% to 85.3%, NaturalCount6 from 74.8% to 86.3%.

Conclusion: Diffusion models' numerosity limitations stem from noise initialization biases rather than scaling constraints. Count-aware layout injection effectively addresses this fundamental counting problem in text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Numerosity remains a challenge for state-of-the-art text-to-image generation
models like FLUX and GPT-4o, which often fail to accurately follow counting
instructions in text prompts. In this paper, we aim to study a fundamental yet
often overlooked question: Can diffusion models inherently generate the correct
number of objects specified by a textual prompt simply by scaling up the
dataset and model size? To enable rigorous and reproducible evaluation, we
construct a clean synthetic numerosity benchmark comprising two complementary
datasets: GrayCount250 for controlled scaling studies, and NaturalCount6
featuring complex naturalistic scenes. Second, we empirically show that the
scaling hypothesis does not hold: larger models and datasets alone fail to
improve counting accuracy on our benchmark. Our analysis identifies a key
reason: diffusion models tend to rely heavily on the noise initialization
rather than the explicit numerosity specified in the prompt. We observe that
noise priors exhibit biases toward specific object counts. In addition, we
propose an effective strategy for controlling numerosity by injecting
count-aware layout information into the noise prior. Our method achieves
significant gains, improving accuracy on GrayCount250 from 20.0\% to 85.3\% and
on NaturalCount6 from 74.8\% to 86.3\%, demonstrating effective generalization
across settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: video-SALMONN S is a streaming audio-visual LLM that processes 3-hour videos at 1 FPS and 360p resolution under fixed memory budget, achieving state-of-the-art performance on long-video benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video-understanding LLMs struggle to scale for continuous, high-frame-rate processing of long video streams. Offline methods require adapting frame rates, while streaming methods lose information by merging or discarding tokens.

Method: Introduces (i) a test-time-training (TTT) memory module that continually updates token representations to capture long-range dependencies, replacing token merging, and (ii) a prompt-dependent memory reader that selectively retrieves context-relevant content from fixed-size memory. Uses Hessian-free conjugate-gradient procedure (TTT_HF) for efficient adaptation.

Result: Processes 3-hour videos with 10k frames and 1M tokens. The 8B-parameter model achieves 74.2% overall and 67.8% on Video-MME long split, outperforming both offline and streaming baselines on benchmarks (Video-MME, LVBench, VideoEvalPro).

Conclusion: video-SALMONN S successfully enables continuous, high-frame-rate processing of long video streams under fixed memory constraints, demonstrating superior performance on multi-hour video understanding tasks.

Abstract: Continuous, high-frame-rate, high-resolution processing of long video streams
is critical for future AI agents, yet current video-understanding LLMs struggle
to scale. Offline, fixed-frame-number methods require the stream length to
adapt frame rates; streaming methods constrain memory by merging or discarding
tokens, losing information. We propose video-SALMONN S, a streaming
audio-visual LLM that, to our knowledge, is the first to process 3-hour videos
at 1 FPS and 360p resolution under a fixed memory budget. Our model introduces
(i) a test-time-training (TTT) memory module that continually updates token
representations to capture long-range dependencies by replacing token merging,
and (ii) a prompt-dependent memory reader that selectively retrieves
context-relevant content from fixed-size memory. The TTT module is optimised
with a Hessian-free conjugate-gradient procedure (TTT_HF) for efficient
adaptation. On long-video benchmarks (Video-MME, LVBench, VideoEvalPro),
video-SALMONN S sustains high-quality understanding on multi-hour videos with
10k frames and 1M tokens. Our 8B-parameter model achieves 74.2% overall and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional semen analysis fails to evaluate sperm DNA fragmentation (SDF), which is critical for male fertility assessment. Current methods require destructive testing.

Method: Morphology-assisted ensemble AI model combining image processing with transformer-based machine learning (GC-ViT) to predict DNA fragmentation from phase contrast images, benchmarked against pure transformer and morphology-only models.

Result: The proposed framework achieved 60% sensitivity and 75% specificity in detecting sperm DNA fragmentation using TUNEL assay as gold standard.

Conclusion: This non-destructive AI methodology enables real-time sperm selection based on DNA integrity, representing a significant advancement in reproductive medicine for clinical diagnostics and therapeutic applications.

Abstract: Sperm DNA fragmentation (SDF) is a critical parameter in male fertility
assessment that conventional semen analysis fails to evaluate. This study
presents the validation of a novel artificial intelligence (AI) tool designed
to detect SDF through digital analysis of phase contrast microscopy images,
using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)
assay as the gold standard reference. Utilising the established link between
sperm morphology and DNA integrity, the present work proposes a morphology
assisted ensemble AI model that combines image processing techniques with
state-of-the-art transformer based machine learning models (GC-ViT) for the
prediction of DNA fragmentation in sperm from phase contrast images. The
ensemble model is benchmarked against a pure transformer `vision' model as well
as a `morphology-only` model. Promising results show the proposed framework is
able to achieve sensitivity of 60\% and specificity of 75\%. This
non-destructive methodology represents a significant advancement in

### [163] [Multiview Manifold Evidential Fusion for PolSAR Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11171)
*Junfei Shi,Haojia Zhang,Haiyan Jin,Junhuai Li,Xiaogang Song,Yuanfan Guo,Haonan Su,Weisi Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes MMEFnet, a multiview manifold evidential fusion method that effectively fuses PolSAR covariance matrices and multi-features from different manifolds with uncertainty quantification for more reliable classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional fusion methods overlook the different geometric structures of covariance matrices and multi-features on distinct manifolds, ignore varying view importance, and lack uncertainty quantification, leading to unreliable predictions.

Method: Represents covariance matrices on HPD manifold and multi-features on Grassmann manifold, uses kernel metric learning networks for manifold representations, implements trusted multiview evidence fusion with belief mass estimation, and applies Dempster-Shafer theory for evidence combination.

Result: Extensive experiments on three real-world PolSAR datasets show consistent outperformance over existing approaches in accuracy, robustness, and interpretability.

Conclusion: The proposed MMEFnet successfully integrates PolSAR manifold learning and evidence fusion into a unified architecture, enabling more reliable and interpretable classification through uncertainty-aware multiview fusion.

Abstract: Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) covariance matrices and their
extracted multi-features - such as scattering angle, entropy, texture, and
boundary descriptors - provide complementary and physically interpretable
information for image classification. Traditional fusion strategies typically
concatenate these features or employ deep learning networks to combine them.
However, the covariance matrices and multi-features, as two complementary
views, lie on different manifolds with distinct geometric structures. Existing
fusion methods also overlook the varying importance of different views and
ignore uncertainty, often leading to unreliable predictions. To address these
issues, we propose a Multiview Manifold Evidential Fusion (MMEFnet) method to
effectively fuse these two views. It gives a new framework to integrate PolSAR
manifold learning and evidence fusion into a unified architecture.
Specifically, covariance matrices are represented on the Hermitian Positive
Definite (HPD) manifold, while multi-features are modeled on the Grassmann
manifold. Two different kernel metric learning networks are constructed to
learn their manifold representations. Subsequently, a trusted multiview
evidence fusion, replacing the conventional softmax classifier, estimates
belief mass and quantifies the uncertainty of each view from the learned deep
features. Finally, a Dempster-Shafer theory-based fusion strategy combines
evidence, enabling a more reliable and interpretable classification. Extensive
experiments on three real-world PolSAR datasets demonstrate that the proposed
method consistently outperforms existing approaches in accuracy, robustness,
and interpretability.

*Zhenyu Lu,Liupeng Li,Jinpeng Wang,Yan Feng,Bin Chen,Ke Chen,Yaowei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoPRS introduces a Multi-modal Chain-of-Thought based positional perception model that bridges language reasoning to segmentation through a differentiable heatmap, improving interpretability and achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods connect language model features directly to mask decoders or use text position representations, which limits interpretability and semantic detail.

Method: Uses a learnable concentration token to aggregate image and reasoning text features, generating a differentiable positional prior heatmap that is decoded to masks through a lightweight decoder.

Result: Matches or surpasses best reported metrics on RefCOCO series and ReasonSeg datasets under comparable protocols, achieving state-of-the-art performance across validation and test partitions.

Conclusion: The heatmap quality strongly influences mask quality, supporting consistent association between reasoning output and mask generation, demonstrating advantages in concentration and precise mask prediction.

Abstract: Existing works on reasoning segmentation either connect hidden features from
a language model directly to a mask decoder or represent positions in text,
which limits interpretability and semantic detail. To solve this, we present
CoPRS, a Multi-modal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT)-based positional perception model
that bridges language reasoning to segmentation through a differentiable and
interpretable positional prior instantiated as a heatmap. By making the
reasoning process clear via MCoT and expressing it as a dense, differentiable
heatmap, this interface enhances interpretability and diagnostic analysis and
yields more concentrated evidence on the target. A learnable concentration
token aggregates features of the image and reasoning text to generate this
positional prior, which is decoded to precise masks through a lightweight
decoder, providing a direct connection between reasoning and segmentation.
Across the RefCOCO series and ReasonSeg, CoPRS matches or surpasses the best
reported metrics on each standard split under comparable protocols, with
performance at or above prior state of the art across both validation and test
partitions. Extensive experiments reveal that the quality of the heatmap
strongly influences the resulting mask quality, supporting a consistent
association between the reasoning output and downstream mask generation.
Collectively, these findings support the utility of this paradigm in bridging
reasoning and segmentation and show advantages in concentration driven by
reasoning and predicting masks more precisely. Code, checkpoints and logs are
released at https://github.com/ZhenyuLU-Heliodore/CoPRS.git.

### [165] [Reliable Cross-modal Alignment via Prototype Iterative Construction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11175)
*Xiang Ma,Litian Xu,Lexin Fang,Caiming Zhang,Lizhen Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PICO is a framework that suppresses style interference in cross-modal alignment by quantifying semantic probability of feature columns and using it as weights during embedding interaction, outperforming SOTA methods by 5.2%-14.1%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional cross-modal alignment methods assume embeddings contain only semantic information, ignoring non-semantic style variations that cause information bias and loss during alignment.

Method: Proposes PICO framework that quantifies semantic probability of each feature column and uses it as weights during embedding interaction. Uses prototype iterative construction with performance feedback-based weighting function.

Result: Extensive experiments show PICO outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 5.2%-14.1% across various benchmarks and model backbones.

Conclusion: PICO effectively suppresses style interference in cross-modal alignment by separating semantic from style information through semantic probability quantification and weighted embedding interaction.

Abstract: Cross-modal alignment is an important multi-modal task, aiming to bridge the
semantic gap between different modalities. The most reliable fundamention for
achieving this objective lies in the semantic consistency between matched
pairs. Conventional methods implicitly assume embeddings contain solely
semantic information, ignoring the impact of non-semantic information during
alignment, which inevitably leads to information bias or even loss. These
non-semantic information primarily manifest as stylistic variations in the
data, which we formally define as style information. An intuitive approach is
to separate style from semantics, aligning only the semantic information.
However, most existing methods distinguish them based on feature columns, which
cannot represent the complex coupling relationship between semantic and style
information. In this paper, we propose PICO, a novel framework for suppressing
style interference during embedding interaction. Specifically, we quantify the
probability of each feature column representing semantic information, and
regard it as the weight during the embedding interaction. To ensure the
reliability of the semantic probability, we propose a prototype iterative
construction method. The key operation of this method is a performance
feedback-based weighting function, and we have theoretically proven that the
function can assign higher weight to prototypes that bring higher performance
improvements. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and model backbones
demonstrate the superiority of PICO, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by
5.2\%-14.1\%.

*Yesung Cho,Sungmin Lee,Geongyu Lee,Minkyung Lee,Jongbae Park,Dongmyung Shin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The G2L framework uses knowledge distillation to boost large-scale pathology models to giga-scale performance levels using only 1K slides per cancer type, achieving better results than same-size models and even surpassing giga-scale teachers in some benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Giga-scale pathology foundation models have high computational costs that limit practical deployment. There's a need for more efficient models that can achieve similar performance without prohibitive resource requirements.

Method: Knowledge distillation framework that transfers capabilities from giga-scale models to large-scale models using only 1,000 pathology slides per target cancer type.

Result: Distilled models outperformed state-of-the-art same-size models across benchmarks, surpassed giga-scale teacher models in some cases, and showed higher robustness to multi-institutional image variations.

Conclusion: The distillation approach provides a data- and parameter-efficient way to achieve giga-scale performance for cancer-specific applications without the computational burden of large models.

Abstract: Recent studies in pathology foundation models have shown that scaling
training data, diversifying cancer types, and increasing model size
consistently improve their performance. However, giga-scale foundation models,
which are trained on hundreds of thousands of slides covering tens of cancer
types and contain billions of parameters, pose significant challenges for
practical use due to their tremendous computational costs in both development
and deployment. In this work, we present a novel strategy, named the G2L
framework, to increase the performance of large-scale foundation models, which
consist of only $15\%$ of the parameters of giga-scale models, to a comparable
performance level of giga-scale models in cancer-specific tasks. Our approach
applies knowledge distillation, transferring the capabilities of a giga-scale
model to a large-scale model, using just 1K pathology slides of a target cancer
(e.g., breast, prostate, etc.). The resulting distilled model not only
outperformed state-of-the-art models of the same size (i.e., large-scale)
across several benchmarks but also, interestingly, surpassed the giga-scale
teacher and huge-scale models in some benchmarks. In addition, the distilled
model exhibited a higher robustness index, indicating improved resilience to
image variations originating from multiple institutions. These findings suggest
that the proposed distillation approach for a large-scale model is a data- and
parameter-efficient way to achieve giga-scale-level performance for
cancer-specific applications without prohibitive computational burden.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BLEnD-Vis is a multimodal, multicultural benchmark that evaluates cultural knowledge robustness in vision-language models across linguistic rephrasings and visual modalities, revealing significant fragility in current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As VLMs are deployed globally, their ability to understand culturally situated knowledge becomes essential, but existing evaluations focus on static recall or isolated visual grounding, leaving gaps in assessing robust and transferable cultural understanding.

Method: Built on the BLEnD dataset, BLEnD-Vis constructs 313 culturally grounded question templates spanning 16 regions, generating three aligned multiple-choice formats: text-only baseline (Region → Entity), inverted text-only (Entity → Region), and VQA-style version with generated images, totaling 4,916 images and over 21,000 MCQ instances validated through human annotation.

Result: BLEnD-Vis reveals significant fragility in current VLM cultural knowledge; models show performance drops under linguistic rephrasing, and while visual cues often aid performance, low cross-modal consistency highlights challenges in robustly integrating textual and visual understanding, especially for lower-resource regions.

Conclusion: BLEnD-Vis provides a crucial testbed for systematically analyzing cultural robustness and multimodal grounding, exposing limitations and guiding the development of more culturally competent VLMs.

Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) are deployed globally, their ability to
understand culturally situated knowledge becomes essential. Yet, existing
evaluations largely assess static recall or isolated visual grounding, leaving
unanswered whether VLMs possess robust and transferable cultural understanding.
We introduce BLEnD-Vis, a multimodal, multicultural benchmark designed to
evaluate the robustness of everyday cultural knowledge in VLMs across
linguistic rephrasings and visual modalities. Building on the BLEnD dataset,
BLEnD-Vis constructs 313 culturally grounded question templates spanning 16
regions and generates three aligned multiple-choice formats: (i) a text-only
baseline querying from Region $\to$ Entity, (ii) an inverted text-only variant
(Entity $\to$ Region), and (iii) a VQA-style version of (ii) with generated
images. The resulting benchmark comprises 4,916 images and over 21,000
multiple-choice question (MCQ) instances, validated through human annotation.
BLEnD-Vis reveals significant fragility in current VLM cultural knowledge;
models exhibit performance drops under linguistic rephrasing and, whilst visual
cues often aid performance, low cross-modal consistency highlights challenges
in robustly integrating textual and visual understanding, particularly for
lower-resource regions. BLEnD-Vis thus provides a crucial testbed for
systematically analysing cultural robustness and multimodal grounding, exposing
limitations and guiding the development of more culturally competent VLMs.

*Shengming Yuan,Xinyu Lyu,Shuailong Wang,Beitao Chen,Jingkuan Song,Lianli Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlexAC enables flexible control over associative reasoning in MLLMs by modulating middle layer representations using hallucination-guided steering vectors, achieving improved creativity and reduced hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs face a trade-off between faithfulness and creativity, but existing methods lack flexibility to modulate associative reasoning strength for different tasks.

Method: FlexAC uses hallucination-guided intermediate representations to create associative steering vectors, adaptively calibrates their strength, and incorporates task-specific vectors from target-domain samples.

Result: Achieved 5.8x improvement in creativity on Creation-MMBench and 29% reduction in hallucination rate on CHAIR, surpassing existing baselines.

Conclusion: FlexAC effectively enables flexible control over associative reasoning in MLLMs, balancing creative guidance with output stability across different tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) face an inherent trade-off between
faithfulness and creativity, as different tasks require varying degrees of
associative reasoning. However, existing methods lack the flexibility to
modulate this reasoning strength, limiting MLLMs' adaptability across factual
and creative scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose equipping MLLMs with
mechanisms that enable flexible control over associative reasoning. We begin by
investigating the internal mechanisms underlying associative behavior in MLLMs
and find that: (1) middle layers play a pivotal role in shaping model's
associative tendencies, (2) modifying representations in these layers
effectively regulates associative reasoning strength, and (3) hallucinations
can be exploited to derive steering vectors that guide this modulation.
Building on these findings, we introduce Flexible Association Control (FlexAC),
a lightweight and training-free framework for modulating associative behavior
in MLLMs. FlexAC first induces hallucination-guided intermediate
representations to encode associative directions. Then, it selects
high-association instances to construct effective associative steering vectors,
whose strengths are adaptively calibrated to balance creative guidance with
output stability. Finally, recognizing the multi-dimensional nature of
associative reasoning, FlexAC incorporates task-specific associative vectors
derived from a forward pass on a few target-domain samples, enabling models to
follow diverse associative directions and better adapt to creative tasks.
Notably, our method achieves up to a 5.8x improvement in creativity on
Creation-MMBench and a 29% reduction in hallucination rate on CHAIR, surpassing
existing baselines and demonstrating its effectiveness in enabling flexible
control over associative reasoning in MLLMs. Our code is available at

TL;DR: This paper presents a multimodal contrastive learning approach for detecting fine-grained educational content in online videos, focusing on literacy and math classes based on Common Core Standards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing consumption of online media by children necessitates tools for educators to filter appropriate educational content, particularly for literacy and math learning in early childhood.

Method: Proposes a class prototypes-based supervised contrastive learning approach with multimodal transformer networks to capture visual-audio interactions, treating it as fine-grained multilabel classification.

Result: The approach outperforms strong baselines on the APPROVE dataset (193 hours of expert-annotated videos with 19 classes) and other benchmarks like YouTube-8M and COIN.

Conclusion: The proposed multimodal contrastive learning method effectively detects fine-grained educational content in videos, providing a valuable tool for filtering educational media for young learners.

Abstract: The recent growth in the consumption of online media by children during early
childhood necessitates data-driven tools enabling educators to filter out
appropriate educational content for young learners. This paper presents an
approach for detecting educational content in online videos. We focus on two
widely used educational content classes: literacy and math. For each class, we
choose prominent codes (sub-classes) based on the Common Core Standards. For
example, literacy codes include `letter names', `letter sounds', and math codes
include `counting', `sorting'. We pose this as a fine-grained multilabel
classification problem as videos can contain multiple types of educational
content and the content classes can get visually similar (e.g., `letter names'
vs `letter sounds'). We propose a novel class prototypes based supervised
contrastive learning approach that can handle fine-grained samples associated
with multiple labels. We learn a class prototype for each class and a loss
function is employed to minimize the distances between a class prototype and
the samples from the class. Similarly, distances between a class prototype and
the samples from other classes are maximized. As the alignment between visual
and audio cues are crucial for effective comprehension, we consider a
multimodal transformer network to capture the interaction between visual and
audio cues in videos while learning the embedding for videos. For evaluation,
we present a dataset, APPROVE, employing educational videos from YouTube
labeled with fine-grained education classes by education researchers. APPROVE
consists of 193 hours of expert-annotated videos with 19 classes. The proposed
approach outperforms strong baselines on APPROVE and other benchmarks such as
Youtube-8M, and COIN. The dataset is available at

Motivation: To investigate whether people can be identified purely through facial expression dynamics, independent of static facial appearance.

Method: Used FLAME 3D morphable model to disentangle facial shape and expression dynamics, extracting expression and jaw coefficients from conversational videos. Applied Conformer model with supervised contrastive learning on CANDOR dataset.

Result: Achieved 61.14% accuracy on 1,429-way classification (458 times above chance). Introduced drift-to-noise ratio (DNR) showing strong negative correlation with recognition performance.

Conclusion: Facial dynamics carry strong identity signatures, revealing person-specific signatures in conversational facial dynamics with implications for social perception and clinical assessment.

Abstract: This work investigates whether individuals can be identified solely through
the pure dynamical components of their facial expressions, independent of
static facial appearance. We leverage the FLAME 3D morphable model to achieve
explicit disentanglement between facial shape and expression dynamics,
extracting frame-by-frame parameters from conversational videos while retaining
only expression and jaw coefficients. On the CANDOR dataset of 1,429 speakers
in naturalistic conversations, our Conformer model with supervised contrastive
learning achieves 61.14\%accuracy on 1,429-way classification -- 458 times
above chance -- demonstrating that facial dynamics carry strong identity
signatures. We introduce a drift-to-noise ratio (DNR) that quantifies the
reliability of shape expression separation by measuring across-session shape
changes relative to within-session variability. DNR strongly negatively
correlates with recognition performance, confirming that unstable shape
estimation compromises dynamic identification. Our findings reveal
person-specific signatures in conversational facial dynamics, with implications
for social perception and clinical assessment.

Conclusion: The DTEA framework with its novel skip connection modules effectively addresses structural representation and contextual modeling challenges in medical image segmentation, achieving improved performance and generalization.

Abstract: In medical image segmentation, skip connections are used to merge global
context and reduce the semantic gap between encoder and decoder. Current
methods often struggle with limited structural representation and insufficient
contextual modeling, affecting generalization in complex clinical scenarios. We
propose the DTEA model, featuring a new skip connection framework with the

hypergraph to better model cross-resolution anatomical dependencies, enhancing
structural and semantic representation. EPG assesses channel stability after
perturbation and filters high-entropy channels to emphasize clinically
important regions and improve spatial attention. Extensive experiments on three

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual scale bar detection in SEM images is time-consuming and error-prone, requiring an automated solution for accurate microscopic analysis.

Method: Four-phase framework: 1) Auto-DG for dataset generation, 2) scale bar object detection, 3) hybrid OCR with DenseNet and CRNN, 4) LLM agent for verification and analysis.

Result: Object detection achieved 100% precision, 95.8% recall, 99.2% mAP@0.5; OCR achieved 89% precision, 65% recall, 75% F1 score, outperforming standalone engines.

Conclusion: The automated LLM-powered method significantly enhances efficiency and accuracy of SEM scale bar detection, advancing scientific imaging analysis.

Abstract: Microscopic characterizations, such as Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM),
are widely used in scientific research for visualizing and analyzing
microstructures. Determining the scale bars is an important first step of
accurate SEM analysis; however, currently, it mainly relies on manual
operations, which is both time-consuming and prone to errors. To address this
issue, we propose a multi-modal and automated scale bar detection and
extraction framework that provides concurrent object detection, text detection
and text recognition with a Large Language Model (LLM) agent. The proposed
framework operates in four phases; i) Automatic Dataset Generation (Auto-DG)
model to synthesize a diverse dataset of SEM images ensuring robust training
and high generalizability of the model, ii) scale bar object detection, iii)
information extraction using a hybrid Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
system with DenseNet and Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) based
algorithms, iv) an LLM agent to analyze and verify accuracy of the results. The
proposed model demonstrates a strong performance in object detection and
accurate localization with a precision of 100%, recall of 95.8%, and a mean
Average Precision (mAP) of 99.2% at IoU=0.5 and 69.1% at IoU=0.5:0.95. The
hybrid OCR system achieved 89% precision, 65% recall, and a 75% F1 score on the
Auto-DG dataset, significantly outperforming several mainstream standalone
engines, highlighting its reliability for scientific image analysis. The LLM is
introduced as a reasoning engine as well as an intelligent assistant that
suggests follow-up steps and verifies the results. This automated method
powered by an LLM agent significantly enhances the efficiency and accuracy of
scale bar detection and extraction in SEM images, providing a valuable tool for
microscopic analysis and advancing the field of scientific imaging.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing classifier editing methods are limited to error correction or require extensive retraining, creating a bottleneck for flexible editing in image classification applications like medical imaging and manufacturing anomaly detection.

Method: Introduces Class Vectors that capture class-specific representation adjustments during fine-tuning, disentangling each class's adaptation in latent space. These vectors can steer latent features or be mapped to weight space to update decision boundaries.

Result: Class Vectors demonstrate linearity and orthogonality properties that support efficient concept editing through simple class arithmetic. They effectively capture semantic shifts and enable flexible classifier editing.

Conclusion: Class Vectors provide a practical solution for post-hoc model editing, validated in applications including unlearning, environmental adaptation, adversarial defense, and trigger optimization.

Abstract: Image classifiers play a critical role in detecting diseases in medical
imaging and identifying anomalies in manufacturing processes. However, their
predefined behaviors after extensive training make post hoc model editing
difficult, especially when it comes to forgetting specific classes or adapting
to distribution shifts. Existing classifier editing methods either focus
narrowly on correcting errors or incur extensive retraining costs, creating a
bottleneck for flexible editing. Moreover, such editing has seen limited
investigation in image classification. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce Class Vectors, which capture class-specific representation
adjustments during fine-tuning. Whereas task vectors encode task-level changes
in weight space, Class Vectors disentangle each class's adaptation in the
latent space. We show that Class Vectors capture each class's semantic shift
and that classifier editing can be achieved either by steering latent features
along these vectors or by mapping them into weight space to update the decision
boundaries. We also demonstrate that the inherent linearity and orthogonality
of Class Vectors support efficient, flexible, and high-level concept editing
via simple class arithmetic. Finally, we validate their utility in applications
such as unlearning, environmental adaptation, adversarial defense, and
adversarial trigger optimization.

Conclusion: EEMS provides an effective solution for medical image segmentation with enhanced edge perception and precise target localization.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is vital for diagnosis, treatment planning, and
disease monitoring but is challenged by complex factors like ambiguous edges
and background noise. We introduce EEMS, a new model for segmentation,
combining an Edge-Aware Enhancement Unit (EAEU) and a Multi-scale Prompt
Generation Unit (MSPGU). EAEU enhances edge perception via multi-frequency
feature extraction, accurately defining boundaries. MSPGU integrates high-level
semantic and low-level spatial features using a prompt-guided approach,
ensuring precise target localization. The Dual-Source Adaptive Gated Fusion
Unit (DAGFU) merges edge features from EAEU with semantic features from MSPGU,
enhancing segmentation accuracy and robustness. Tests on datasets like ISIC2018

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HaDola is a human uncertainty-aware framework that improves VLM training by selectively using high-uncertainty samples and automatic labeling, achieving better performance with less data than standard supervised fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard supervised fine-tuning ignores human uncertainty in annotations, leading to under-calibrated models and inefficient use of training data. The paper aims to understand how human uncertainty affects training and leverage it effectively.

Method: HaDola framework with four stages: discriminate (identify harmful samples), self-annotate (automatic labeling), error trigger (prioritize informative samples), and training. It bootstraps from a small seed set (5% of data) to reduce reliance on costly human annotations.

Result: HaDola consistently matches or outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on VQAv2 and VizWiz datasets with less training data. It produces more accurate and better calibrated models than standard supervised fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling human uncertainty in supervised fine-tuning is more effective than simply scaling up dataset size. Better utilization of human uncertainty distributions leads to improved model performance and calibration.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) achieve strong performance in Visual
Question Answering but still rely heavily on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with
massive labeled datasets, which is costly due to human annotations. Crucially,
real-world datasets often exhibit human uncertainty (HU) -- variation in human
confidence across annotations -- but standard SFT simply optimizes toward the
most frequent label, disregarding HU distributions. This leaves two open
questions: How does HU affect SFT, and how can HU be effectively leveraged in
training? In this work, we first conduct a systematic evaluation of VLMs across
varying HU levels. We have two key findings: (i) surprisingly, high-HU samples
contribute little or even degrade model performance, and (ii) naively training
on the full dataset yields under-calibrated models that fail to capture HU
distributions. Motivated by these findings, we introduce HaDola, a human
uncertainty-aware data selection and automatic labeling framework. HaDola
operates in four stages -- discriminate, self-annotate, error trigger, and
training -- to iteratively identify harmful samples, prioritize informative
ones, and bootstrap from a small seed set (5\% of data). Our approach
substantially reduces reliance on costly HU annotations and makes VLMs more
accurate and better calibrated. Extensive experiments on VQAv2 and VizWiz
datasets demonstrate that HaDola consistently matches or outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines with less training data. Our work highlights the
importance of explicitly modeling HU in SFT, suggesting that better utilization
of HU is more effective than merely scaling up dataset size.

*Lin Zhu,Yifeng Yang,Xinbing Wang,Qinying Gu,Nanyang Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ΔEnergy, a novel OOD score for vision-language models that improves both OOD detection and generalization by leveraging energy changes during modality realignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs encounter both ID and OOD data in real-world applications, including covariate shifts (style changes) and semantic shifts (unseen classes). Current methods need better generalization to covariate-shifted OOD data and more reliable detection of semantic-shifted OOD classes.

Method: Proposed ΔEnergy score based on energy changes during vision-language modality realignment, with EBM (lower-bound maximization) to simultaneously improve OOD detection and generalization. Developed unified fine-tuning framework leveraging domain-consistent Hessian.

Result: Extensive experiments show superiority over recent approaches, outperforming them by 10% to 25% in AUROC on challenging OOD detection and generalization benchmarks.

Conclusion: ΔEnergy provides a unified solution that significantly enhances VLMs' robustness in both OOD generalization and detection, with theoretical guarantees and strong empirical performance.

Abstract: Recent approaches for vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable
success in achieving fast downstream adaptation. When applied to real-world
downstream tasks, VLMs inevitably encounter both the in-distribution (ID) data
and out-of-distribution (OOD) data. The OOD datasets often include both
covariate shifts (e.g., known classes with changes in image styles) and
semantic shifts (e.g., test-time unseen classes). This highlights the
importance of improving VLMs' generalization ability to covariate-shifted OOD
data, while effectively detecting open-set semantic-shifted OOD classes. In
this paper, inspired by the substantial energy change observed in closed-set
data when re-aligning vision-language modalities (specifically by directly
reducing the maximum cosine similarity to a low value), we introduce a novel
OOD score, named {\Delta}Energy. {\Delta}Energy significantly outperforms the
vanilla energy-based OOD score and provides a more reliable approach for OOD
detection. Furthermore, {\Delta}Energy can simultaneously improve OOD
generalization under covariate shifts, which is achieved by lower-bound
maximization for {\Delta}Energy (termed EBM). EBM is theoretically proven to
not only enhance OOD detection but also yields a domain-consistent Hessian,
which serves as a strong indicator for OOD generalization. Based on this
finding, we developed a unified fine-tuning framework that allows for improving
VLMs' robustness in both OOD generalization and OOD detection. Extensive
experiments on challenging OOD detection and generalization benchmarks
demonstrate the superiority of our method, outperforming recent approaches by
10% to 25% in AUROC.

*Samer Al-Hamadani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Comprehensive cost-effectiveness analysis comparing supervised YOLO detection (91.2% accuracy) vs zero-shot Gemini VLM (68.5% accuracy), establishing break-even thresholds and decision frameworks for architecture selection based on deployment volume, budget, and accuracy requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional supervised detection requires expensive manual annotations, while zero-shot VLMs eliminate annotation costs but have lower accuracy. Need systematic comparison to guide architecture selection decisions.

Method: Systematic evaluation on 1,000 COCO images and 200 diverse product images, combined with detailed Total Cost of Ownership modeling to establish quantitative break-even thresholds.

Result: Supervised YOLO achieves 91.2% accuracy vs 68.5% for Gemini, but requires $10,800 annotation cost. Break-even at 55M inferences (151k images daily for 1 year). Gemini shows 52.3% accuracy on diverse products where YOLO gets 0%. Cost per detection: Gemini $0.00050 vs YOLO $0.143 at 100k inferences.

Conclusion: Optimal architecture selection depends on deployment volume, category stability, budget constraints, and accuracy requirements rather than purely technical performance metrics.

Abstract: Object detection systems have traditionally relied on supervised learning
with manually annotated bounding boxes, achieving high accuracy at the cost of
substantial annotation investment. The emergence of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) offers an alternative paradigm enabling zero-shot detection through
natural language queries, eliminating annotation requirements but operating
with reduced accuracy. This paper presents the first comprehensive
cost-effectiveness analysis comparing supervised detection (YOLO) with
zero-shot VLM inference (Gemini Flash 2.5). Through systematic evaluation on
1,000 stratified COCO images and 200 diverse product images spanning consumer
electronics and rare categories, combined with detailed Total Cost of Ownership
modeling, we establish quantitative break-even thresholds governing
architecture selection. Our findings reveal that supervised YOLO achieves 91.2%
accuracy versus 68.5% for zero-shot Gemini on standard categories, representing
a 22.7 percentage point advantage that costs $10,800 in annotation for
100-category systems. However, this advantage justifies investment only beyond
55 million inferences, equivalent to 151,000 images daily for one year.
Zero-shot Gemini demonstrates 52.3% accuracy on diverse product categories
(ranging from highly web-prevalent consumer electronics at 75-85% to rare
specialized equipment at 25-40%) where supervised YOLO achieves 0% due to
architectural constraints preventing detection of untrained classes. Cost per
Correct Detection analysis reveals substantially lower per-detection costs for
Gemini ($0.00050 vs $0.143) at 100,000 inferences despite accuracy deficits. We
develop decision frameworks demonstrating that optimal architecture selection
depends critically on deployment volume, category stability, budget
constraints, and accuracy requirements rather than purely technical performance
metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sketch-based 3D reconstruction is challenging due to the abstract and sparse nature of sketch inputs that lack sufficient semantic and geometric information.

Method: Two-stage generation method: 1) semantic bridging via sketch-to-image translation to enrich sparse sketch representations, 2) incorporates symmetry constraints as geometric priors to leverage structural regularity.

Result: Superior performance compared to existing methods on mainstream sketch datasets in terms of Chamfer Distance, Earth Mover's Distance, and F-Score.

Conclusion: The proposed semantic bridging and symmetry-aware design effectively address the challenges of sketch-based 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: Sketch-based 3D reconstruction remains a challenging task due to the abstract
and sparse nature of sketch inputs, which often lack sufficient semantic and
geometric information. To address this, we propose Sketch2Symm, a two-stage
generation method that produces geometrically consistent 3D shapes from
sketches. Our approach introduces semantic bridging via sketch-to-image
translation to enrich sparse sketch representations, and incorporates symmetry
constraints as geometric priors to leverage the structural regularity commonly
found in everyday objects. Experiments on mainstream sketch datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to existing
sketch-based reconstruction methods in terms of Chamfer Distance, Earth Mover's
Distance, and F-Score, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed semantic
bridging and symmetry-aware design.

### [182] [Evaluating the effects of preprocessing, method selection, and hyperparameter tuning on SAR-based flood mapping and water depth estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11305)
*Jean-Paul Travert,Cédric Goeury,Sébastien Boyaval,Vito Bacchi,Fabrice Zaoui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAR imagery analysis for flood mapping and water depth estimation, evaluating preprocessing, flood mapping methods, and their impact on results using ensemble approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve flood mapping and water depth estimation from SAR imagery by understanding how different preprocessing and analysis methods affect results, and to highlight the importance of methodological uncertainty.

Method: Used SAR imagery with various preprocessing techniques (speckle noise reduction), flood mapping methods (supervised and unsupervised), and water depth estimation approaches. Evaluated impact of method choices and hyperparameters through ensemble analysis on two Garonne River flood events.

Result: Speckle filter choice caused flood extent variations of several square kilometers. Supervised methods outperformed unsupervised ones, but tuned unsupervised approaches achieved comparable results. Compounded uncertainty from preprocessing and flood mapping introduced high variability in water depth estimates.

Conclusion: The entire processing pipeline (preprocessing, flood mapping, water depth estimation) and their hyperparameters must be considered. Ensemble approaches and accounting for methodological uncertainty are preferred over single configurations. Flood mapping method choice has the most influence, while for water depth estimation, flood map input and method hyperparameters are most influential.

Abstract: Flood mapping and water depth estimation from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
imagery are crucial for calibrating and validating hydraulic models. This study
uses SAR imagery to evaluate various preprocessing (especially speckle noise
reduction), flood mapping, and water depth estimation methods. The impact of
the choice of method at different steps and its hyperparameters is studied by
considering an ensemble of preprocessed images, flood maps, and water depth
fields. The evaluation is conducted for two flood events on the Garonne River
(France) in 2019 and 2021, using hydrodynamic simulations and in-situ
observations as reference data. Results show that the choice of speckle filter
alters flood extent estimations with variations of several square kilometers.
Furthermore, the selection and tuning of flood mapping methods also affect
performance. While supervised methods outperformed unsupervised ones, tuned
unsupervised approaches (such as local thresholding or change detection) can
achieve comparable results. The compounded uncertainty from preprocessing and
flood mapping steps also introduces high variability in the water depth field
estimates. This study highlights the importance of considering the entire
processing pipeline, encompassing preprocessing, flood mapping, and water depth
estimation methods and their associated hyperparameters. Rather than relying on
a single configuration, adopting an ensemble approach and accounting for
methodological uncertainty should be privileged. For flood mapping, the method
choice has the most influence. For water depth estimation, the most influential
processing step was the flood map input resulting from the flood mapping step
and the hyperparameters of the methods.

Result: Experiments show InternSVG achieves substantial gains and consistently outperforms leading open and proprietary counterparts on SArena and prior benchmarks.

Conclusion: The unified formulation induces positive transfer and improves overall performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of leveraging MLLMs for comprehensive SVG tasks.

Abstract: General SVG modeling remains challenging due to fragmented datasets, limited
transferability of methods across tasks, and the difficulty of handling
structural complexity. In response, we leverage the strong transfer and
generalization capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to
achieve unified modeling for SVG understanding, editing, and generation. We
present the InternSVG family, an integrated data-benchmark-model suite. At its
core is SAgoge, the largest and most comprehensive multimodal dataset for SVG
tasks, encompassing both static graphics and dynamic animations. It covers
icons, long-sequence illustrations, scientific diagrams, and dynamic
animations, supporting tasks of varied difficulty levels and providing deeper
hierarchies with richer attributes compared to previous datasets. Based on this
resource, we introduce SArena, a companion benchmark with comprehensive task
definitions and standardized evaluation that aligns with the domains and
difficulty spectrum covered by SAgoge. Building on these foundations, we
propose InternSVG, a unified MLLM for SVG understanding, editing, and
generation with SVG-specific special tokens, subword-based embedding
initialization, and a two-stage training strategy that progresses from short
static SVGs to long-sequence illustrations and complex animations. This unified
formulation induces positive transfer and improves overall performance.
Experiments on SArena and prior benchmark confirm that InternSVG achieves

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMAP framework improves spatial gene expression prediction from H&E-stained images using multi-magnification patches for local detail and prototype embeddings for global context, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting spatial gene expression from histological images is challenging due to modality gap between visual features and molecular signals, with existing methods having insufficient local granularity and inadequate global context coverage.

Method: Proposes MMAP framework with multi-magnification patch representations for fine-grained local details and latent prototype embeddings for slide-level global context understanding.

Result: Extensive experiments show MMAP consistently outperforms all state-of-the-art methods across multiple metrics including MAE, MSE, and Pearson Correlation Coefficient.

Conclusion: MMAP successfully addresses both local granularity and global context limitations in spatial gene expression prediction from histological images.

Abstract: Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) enables the measurement of gene expression while
preserving spatial information, offering critical insights into tissue
architecture and disease pathology. Recent developments have explored the use
of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained whole-slide images (WSIs) to predict
transcriptome-wide gene expression profiles through deep neural networks. This
task is commonly framed as a regression problem, where each input corresponds
to a localized image patch extracted from the WSI. However, predicting spatial
gene expression from histological images remains a challenging problem due to
the significant modality gap between visual features and molecular signals.
Recent studies have attempted to incorporate both local and global information
into predictive models. Nevertheless, existing methods still suffer from two
key limitations: (1) insufficient granularity in local feature extraction, and
(2) inadequate coverage of global spatial context. In this work, we propose a
novel framework, MMAP (Multi-MAgnification and Prototype-enhanced
architecture), that addresses both challenges simultaneously. To enhance local
feature granularity, MMAP leverages multi-magnification patch representations
that capture fine-grained histological details. To improve global contextual
understanding, it learns a set of latent prototype embeddings that serve as
compact representations of slide-level information. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that MMAP consistently outperforms all existing
state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics, including Mean
Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Pearson Correlation
Coefficient (PCC).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces an uncertainty-guided ControlNet method that uses unlabeled domain data to create synthetic annotated datasets, improving segmentation performance on target domains without additional supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ControlNets reproduce original training distributions, limiting their effectiveness for data augmentation. The need arises to utilize unlabeled domain data to create synthetic datasets that can improve segmentation models on target domains with distribution shifts.

Method: Introduces uncertainty into ControlNet's control mechanism, combining uncertainty control from unlabeled datasets with semantic control from labeled datasets to generate annotated data from target domains.

Result: The method successfully creates synthetic annotated data from unlabeled domains, leading to significantly improved segmentation results on Home-OCT retinal images and traffic scenes without additional supervision.

Conclusion: Uncertainty-guidance enables effective domain adaptation without strict style learning, outperforming traditional style transfer methods and providing a flexible approach for arbitrary domain shifts.

Abstract: Generative Models are a valuable tool for the controlled creation of
high-quality image data. Controlled diffusion models like the ControlNet have
allowed the creation of labeled distributions. Such synthetic datasets can
augment the original training distribution when discriminative models, like
semantic segmentation, are trained. However, this augmentation effect is
limited since ControlNets tend to reproduce the original training distribution.
  This work introduces a method to utilize data from unlabeled domains to train
ControlNets by introducing the concept of uncertainty into the control
mechanism. The uncertainty indicates that a given image was not part of the
training distribution of a downstream task, e.g., segmentation. Thus, two types
of control are engaged in the final network: an uncertainty control from an
unlabeled dataset and a semantic control from the labeled dataset. The
resulting ControlNet allows us to create annotated data with high uncertainty
from the target domain, i.e., synthetic data from the unlabeled distribution
with labels. In our scenario, we consider retinal OCTs, where typically
high-quality Spectralis images are available with given ground truth
segmentations, enabling the training of segmentation networks. The recent
development in Home-OCT devices, however, yields retinal OCTs with lower
quality and a large domain shift, such that out-of-the-pocket segmentation
networks cannot be applied for this type of data. Synthesizing annotated images
from the Home-OCT domain using the proposed approach closes this gap and leads
to significantly improved segmentation results without adding any further
supervision. The advantage of uncertainty-guidance becomes obvious when
compared to style transfer: it enables arbitrary domain shifts without any
strict learning of an image style. This is also demonstrated in a traffic scene
experiment.

TL;DR: RALI uses contrastive learning to align images with generalizable text representations from RL-trained IQA models, achieving comparable generalization with 95% fewer parameters and inference time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reasoning-based IQA models show great generalization but have high inference costs and unclear mechanisms. The paper aims to understand the generalization source and develop efficient alternatives.

Method: Proposes RALI algorithm that uses contrastive learning to directly align images with compact text representations learned by RL-trained models, eliminating reasoning processes and LLM loading.

Result: RALI achieves generalization performance comparable to reasoning-based models while requiring less than 5% of their model parameters and inference time.

Conclusion: The key to generalization in reasoning-based IQA is converting visual representations to compact text representations, which can be directly learned through contrastive alignment without expensive reasoning processes.

Abstract: Reasoning-based image quality assessment (IQA) models trained through
reinforcement learning (RL) exhibit exceptional generalization, yet the
underlying mechanisms and critical factors driving this capability remain
underexplored in current research. Moreover, despite their superior
performance, these models incur inference energy usage and latency orders of
magnitude higher than their earlier counterparts, restricting their deployment
in specific scenarios. Through extensive experiments, this paper verifies and
elaborates that through RL training, MLLMs leverage their reasoning capability
to convert redundant visual representations into compact, cross-domain aligned
text representations. This conversion is precisely the source of the
generalization exhibited by these reasoning-based IQA models. Building on this
fundamental insight, we propose a novel algorithm, RALI, which employs
contrastive learning to directly align images with these generalizable text
representations learned by RL. This approach eliminates the reliance on
reasoning processes and even obviates the need to load an LLM. For the quality
scoring task, this framework achieves generalization performance comparable to
reasoning-based models while requiring less than 5% of their model parameters
and inference time.

*Wenyuan Zhang,Jimin Tang,Weiqi Zhang,Yi Fang,Yu-Shen Liu,Zhizhong Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to improve reflection modeling in Gaussian Splatting by enforcing multi-view consistent material inference and introducing physically-based environment modeling with ray tracing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches for modeling reflections in Gaussian Splatting lack sufficient constraints, especially under limited environment modeling, leading to illumination aliasing and reduced generalization.

Method: Enforces 2D Gaussians to produce multi-view consistent material maps during deferred shading, tracks photometric variations across views to identify reflective regions as priors, and introduces environment modeling through ray tracing with 2DGS to handle indirect illumination.

Result: The method faithfully recovers both illumination and geometry, achieving state-of-the-art rendering quality in novel view synthesis on widely used benchmarks.

Conclusion: Multi-view consistent material inference with physically-based environment modeling is key to learning accurate reflections with Gaussian Splatting.

Abstract: Modeling reflections from 2D images is essential for photorealistic rendering
and novel view synthesis. Recent approaches enhance Gaussian primitives with
reflection-related material attributes to enable physically based rendering
(PBR) with Gaussian Splatting. However, the material inference often lacks
sufficient constraints, especially under limited environment modeling,
resulting in illumination aliasing and reduced generalization. In this work, we
revisit the problem from a multi-view perspective and show that multi-view
consistent material inference with more physically-based environment modeling
is key to learning accurate reflections with Gaussian Splatting. To this end,
we enforce 2D Gaussians to produce multi-view consistent material maps during
deferred shading. We also track photometric variations across views to identify
highly reflective regions, which serve as strong priors for reflection strength
terms. To handle indirect illumination caused by inter-object occlusions, we
further introduce an environment modeling strategy through ray tracing with
2DGS, enabling photorealistic rendering of indirect radiance. Experiments on
widely used benchmarks show that our method faithfully recovers both
illumination and geometry, achieving state-of-the-art rendering quality in
novel views synthesis.

TL;DR: DocReward is a document reward model that evaluates documents based on structure and style rather than just textual quality, trained on a large multi-domain dataset to guide agentic workflows toward producing more professional-looking documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agentic workflows for document generation focus primarily on textual quality but neglect visual structure and style, which are crucial for readability and engagement. There's a gap in suitable reward models to guide workflows toward better structural and stylistic quality.

Method: Created DocPair dataset with 117K paired documents across 32 domains and 267 document types, each containing high- and low-professionalism versions with identical content but different structure/style. Trained DocReward using Bradley-Terry loss to score documents and penalize predictions that contradict human rankings.

Result: DocReward outperforms GPT-4o and GPT-5 in accuracy by 30.6 and 19.4 percentage points respectively. In document generation evaluation, DocReward achieves 60.8% win rate compared to GPT-5's 37.7%, demonstrating superior ability to guide generation toward human-preferred documents.

Conclusion: DocReward effectively addresses the gap in evaluating document structure and style, providing a valuable tool for guiding agentic workflows to produce more professional and human-preferred documents beyond just textual quality.

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic workflows have enabled the automation of tasks
such as professional document generation. However, they primarily focus on
textual quality, neglecting visual structure and style, which are crucial for
readability and engagement. This gap arises mainly from the absence of suitable
reward models to guide agentic workflows toward producing documents with
stronger structural and stylistic quality. To address this, we propose
DocReward, a document reward model that evaluates documents based on their
structure and style. We construct a multi-domain dataset DocPair of 117K paired
documents, covering 32 domains and 267 document types, each including a high-
and low-professionalism document with identical content but different structure
and style. This enables the model to evaluate professionalism comprehensively,
and in a textual-quality-agnostic way. DocReward is trained using the
Bradley-Terry loss to score documents, penalizing predictions that contradict
the annotated ranking. To assess the performance of reward models, we create a
test dataset containing document bundles ranked by well-educated human
evaluators. Notably, DocReward outperforms GPT-4o and GPT-5 in accuracy by 30.6
and 19.4 percentage points, respectively, demonstrating its superiority over
baselines. In an extrinsic evaluation of document generation, DocReward
achieves a significantly higher win rate of 60.8%, compared to GPT-5's 37.7%
win rate, demonstrating its utility in guiding generation agents toward
producing human-preferred documents.

*Yijun Hu,Bing Fan,Xin Gu,Haiqing Ren,Dongfang Liu,Heng Fan,Libo Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LM-EEC is a novel ego-exo correspondence framework that enhances SAM 2 with long-term memory and adaptive feature routing, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the EgoExo4D benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Establishing object-level correspondence between egocentric and exocentric views is essential for intelligent assistants, but faces challenges like extreme viewpoint variations, occlusions, and small objects. Existing solutions from video object segmentation models struggle with these issues.

Method: Proposes a dual-memory architecture with adaptive feature routing inspired by Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). Includes Memory-View MoE module for adaptive feature weighting and dual-memory bank system with compression strategy for long-term information retention.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art results on the challenging EgoExo4D benchmark, significantly outperforming existing methods and SAM 2 baseline, with strong generalization across diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed LM-EEC framework effectively addresses SAM 2's limitations in ego-exo correspondence by incorporating long-term memory and adaptive feature fusion, demonstrating superior performance for cross-view object correspondence tasks.

Abstract: Establishing object-level correspondence between egocentric and exocentric
views is essential for intelligent assistants to deliver precise and intuitive
visual guidance. However, this task faces numerous challenges, including
extreme viewpoint variations, occlusions, and the presence of small objects.
Existing approaches usually borrow solutions from video object segmentation
models, but still suffer from the aforementioned challenges. Recently, the
Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) has shown strong generalization capabilities
and excellent performance in video object segmentation. Yet, when simply
applied to the ego-exo correspondence (EEC) task, SAM 2 encounters severe
difficulties due to ineffective ego-exo feature fusion and limited long-term
memory capacity, especially for long videos. Addressing these problems, we
propose a novel EEC framework based on SAM 2 with long-term memories by
presenting a dual-memory architecture and an adaptive feature routing module
inspired by Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). Compared to SAM 2, our approach features
(i) a Memory-View MoE module which consists of a dual-branch routing mechanism
to adaptively assign contribution weights to each expert feature along both
channel and spatial dimensions, and (ii) a dual-memory bank system with a
simple yet effective compression strategy to retain critical long-term
information while eliminating redundancy. In the extensive experiments on the
challenging EgoExo4D benchmark, our method, dubbed LM-EEC, achieves new
state-of-the-art results and significantly outperforms existing methods and the
SAM 2 baseline, showcasing its strong generalization across diverse scenarios.

*Geoffery Agorku,Sarah Hernandez,Hayley Hames,Cade Wagner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework fusing satellite imagery with AIS data to enhance maritime domain awareness in inland waterways, using YOLO v11 for vessel detection and classification with high accuracy across multiple attributes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of AIS-based monitoring by leveraging non-cooperative satellite imagery to identify dark vessels, validate cooperative traffic, and support advanced maritime domain awareness in inland waterways.

Method: Fusion of high-resolution satellite imagery with AIS trajectory data using YOLO v11 object detection model for vessel detection and characterization (vessel type, barge cover, operational status, barge count, direction of travel). Developed annotated dataset from 5,973 mi² of Lower Mississippi River imagery.

Result: High performance across all metrics: vessel classification F1=95.8%, barge cover detection F1=91.6%, operational status classification F1=99.4%, directionality accuracy=93.8%, barge count MAE=2.4 barges. Spatial transferability maintained 98% accuracy across disjoint river segments.

Conclusion: Integration of non-cooperative satellite sensing with AIS fusion is viable and enables near-real-time fleet inventories, anomaly detection, and high-quality inland waterway surveillance. Future work will expand datasets, incorporate temporal tracking, and explore multi-modal deep learning.

Abstract: Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) for inland waterways remains challenged by
cooperative system vulnerabilities. This paper presents a novel framework that
fuses high-resolution satellite imagery with vessel trajectory data from the
Automatic Identification System (AIS). This work addresses the limitations of
AIS-based monitoring by leveraging non-cooperative satellite imagery and
implementing a fusion approach that links visual detections with AIS data to
identify dark vessels, validate cooperative traffic, and support advanced MDA.
The You Only Look Once (YOLO) v11 object detection model is used to detect and
characterize vessels and barges by vessel type, barge cover, operational
status, barge count, and direction of travel. An annotated data set of 4,550
instances was developed from $5{,}973~\mathrm{mi}^2$ of Lower Mississippi River
imagery. Evaluation on a held-out test set demonstrated vessel classification
(tugboat, crane barge, bulk carrier, cargo ship, and hopper barge) with an F1
score of 95.8\%; barge cover (covered or uncovered) detection yielded an F1
score of 91.6\%; operational status (staged or in motion) classification
reached an F1 score of 99.4\%. Directionality (upstream, downstream) yielded
93.8\% accuracy. The barge count estimation resulted in a mean absolute error
(MAE) of 2.4 barges. Spatial transferability analysis across geographically
disjoint river segments showed accuracy was maintained as high as 98\%. These
results underscore the viability of integrating non-cooperative satellite
sensing with AIS fusion. This approach enables near-real-time fleet
inventories, supports anomaly detection, and generates high-quality data for
inland waterway surveillance. Future work will expand annotated datasets,
incorporate temporal tracking, and explore multi-modal deep learning to further
enhance operational scalability.

*Tianpei Zhang,Jufeng Zhao,Yiming Zhu,Guangmang Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VGDCFusion is a novel infrared and visible image fusion method that tightly couples degradation handling with fusion, using vision-language models for degradation-aware perception and guided suppression, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on degraded images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IVIF methods assume high-quality inputs and rely on manual pre-processing for degraded images, leading to performance issues due to decoupled degradation handling and fusion processes.

Method: Proposes VGDCFusion with two key components: SPDCE for modality-specific degradation awareness and joint modeling of degradation suppression with feature extraction, and JPDCF for cross-modal degradation perception and residual degradation filtering with feature fusion.

Result: Extensive experiments show VGDCFusion significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art fusion approaches under various degraded image scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully couples degradation modeling with fusion process and leverages VLMs for effective degradation-aware image fusion, providing superior performance on degraded images.

Abstract: Existing Infrared and Visible Image Fusion (IVIF) methods typically assume
high-quality inputs. However, when handing degraded images, these methods
heavily rely on manually switching between different pre-processing techniques.
This decoupling of degradation handling and image fusion leads to significant
performance degradation. In this paper, we propose a novel VLM-Guided
Degradation-Coupled Fusion network (VGDCFusion), which tightly couples
degradation modeling with the fusion process and leverages vision-language
models (VLMs) for degradation-aware perception and guided suppression.
Specifically, the proposed Specific-Prompt Degradation-Coupled Extractor
(SPDCE) enables modality-specific degradation awareness and establishes a joint
modeling of degradation suppression and intra-modal feature extraction. In
parallel, the Joint-Prompt Degradation-Coupled Fusion (JPDCF) facilitates
cross-modal degradation perception and couples residual degradation filtering
with complementary cross-modal feature fusion. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our VGDCFusion significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art fusion approaches under various degraded image scenarios. Our

*Qing Li,Huifang Feng,Xun Gong,Yu-Shen Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel method to enhance 3D Gaussian Splatting's geometric representation through view alignment, improving surface reconstruction while maintaining real-time novel view synthesis capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting shows promise for real-time novel view synthesis but suffers from inaccurate geometry and inconsistent multi-view alignment due to its discrete and unstructured nature.

Method: The method incorporates edge-aware image cues, visibility-aware photometric alignment loss to handle occlusions, normal-based constraints for lighting variations, and deep image feature embeddings for cross-view consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance in both surface reconstruction and novel view synthesis on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed view alignment approach significantly improves 3D Gaussian Splatting's geometric accuracy while maintaining its efficiency for real-time rendering applications.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has recently emerged as an efficient solution for
high-quality and real-time novel view synthesis. However, its capability for
accurate surface reconstruction remains underexplored. Due to the discrete and
unstructured nature of Gaussians, supervision based solely on image rendering
loss often leads to inaccurate geometry and inconsistent multi-view alignment.
In this work, we propose a novel method that enhances the geometric
representation of 3D Gaussians through view alignment (VA). Specifically, we
incorporate edge-aware image cues into the rendering loss to improve surface
boundary delineation. To enforce geometric consistency across views, we
introduce a visibility-aware photometric alignment loss that models occlusions
and encourages accurate spatial relationships among Gaussians. To further
mitigate ambiguities caused by lighting variations, we incorporate normal-based
constraints to refine the spatial orientation of Gaussians and improve local
surface estimation. Additionally, we leverage deep image feature embeddings to
enforce cross-view consistency, enhancing the robustness of the learned
geometry under varying viewpoints and illumination. Extensive experiments on
standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both surface reconstruction and novel view synthesis. The source

Conclusion: AndesVL provides state-of-the-art mobile-side MLLMs that match or exceed similar-scale models while being optimized for edge device constraints.

Abstract: In recent years, while cloud-based MLLMs such as QwenVL, InternVL, GPT-4o,

*Francesco Milano,Jen Jen Chung,Lionel Ott,Roland Siegwart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel normal integration method that treats the problem as estimating relative scales of continuous components, achieving state-of-the-art results with significant speed improvements over pixel-level approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing normal integration methods require iterative global optimization at the pixel level, which scales poorly to larger normal maps and becomes computationally expensive.

Method: Recast normal integration as estimating relative scales of continuous components, constrain pixels in same component to vary scale jointly, use heuristic for accurate component estimation, rebalance optimization terms, and iteratively merge components to reduce problem size.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on standard benchmark in seconds, achieves one-order-of-magnitude speedup over pixel-level approaches on large-resolution normal maps.

Conclusion: The component-based approach provides an efficient and scalable solution to normal integration, dramatically reducing computational complexity while maintaining high accuracy.

Abstract: Surface normal integration is a fundamental problem in computer vision,
dealing with the objective of reconstructing a surface from its corresponding
normal map. Existing approaches require an iterative global optimization to
jointly estimate the depth of each pixel, which scales poorly to larger normal
maps. In this paper, we address this problem by recasting normal integration as
the estimation of relative scales of continuous components. By constraining
pixels belonging to the same component to jointly vary their scale, we
drastically reduce the number of optimization variables. Our framework includes
a heuristic to accurately estimate continuous components from the start, a
strategy to rebalance optimization terms, and a technique to iteratively merge
components to further reduce the size of the problem. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art results on the standard normal integration benchmark in as
little as a few seconds and achieves one-order-of-magnitude speedup over
pixel-level approaches on large-resolution normal maps.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D datasets focus on either dynamic scenarios or situations in isolation, leading to incomplete understanding of environmental changes. There's a need for comprehensive datasets that support human-AI collaboration through shared mental models.

Method: Leveraged 11K human observations with egocentric/allocentric perspectives and spatial relations, integrated using LLM. Proposed SCReasoner - an efficient 3D MLLM for point cloud comparison with minimal parameter overhead and no additional tokens for language decoder.

Result: Comprehensive evaluation shows progress and limitations of MLLMs in dynamic scene understanding. Data scaling and cross-domain transfer experiments demonstrate Situat3DChange's task-agnostic effectiveness as training data for MLLMs.

Conclusion: Situat3DChange addresses the gap in dynamic 3D understanding datasets and enables better human-AI collaboration through shared situational awareness, with SCReasoner providing efficient point cloud comparison capabilities.

Abstract: Physical environments and circumstances are fundamentally dynamic, yet
current 3D datasets and evaluation benchmarks tend to concentrate on either
dynamic scenarios or dynamic situations in isolation, resulting in incomplete
comprehension. To overcome these constraints, we introduce Situat3DChange, an
extensive dataset supporting three situation-aware change understanding tasks
following the perception-action model: 121K question-answer pairs, 36K change
descriptions for perception tasks, and 17K rearrangement instructions for the
action task. To construct this large-scale dataset, Situat3DChange leverages
11K human observations of environmental changes to establish shared mental
models and shared situational awareness for human-AI collaboration. These
observations, enriched with egocentric and allocentric perspectives as well as
categorical and coordinate spatial relations, are integrated using an LLM to
support understanding of situated changes. To address the challenge of
comparing pairs of point clouds from the same scene with minor changes, we
propose SCReasoner, an efficient 3D MLLM approach that enables effective point
cloud comparison with minimal parameter overhead and no additional tokens
required for the language decoder. Comprehensive evaluation on Situat3DChange
tasks highlights both the progress and limitations of MLLMs in dynamic scene
and situation understanding. Additional experiments on data scaling and
cross-domain transfer demonstrate the task-agnostic effectiveness of using
Situat3DChange as a training dataset for MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately evaluating intuitive physics understanding in video diffusion models is challenging due to difficulty in disentangling physics correctness from visual appearance in generated videos.

Method: Uses denoising objective as ELBO-based likelihood surrogate on curated dataset of valid-invalid video pairs, with Plausibility Preference Error (PPE) metric tested on 12 scenarios across 4 physics domains.

Result: PPE demonstrates strong alignment with human preference, outperforming state-of-the-art evaluator baselines. Current models struggle with complex dynamics but show improvement trend with model capacity and inference scaling.

Conclusion: LikePhys provides effective evaluation of intuitive physics in video diffusion models, revealing domain-specific capacity variations and scaling trends in physics understanding.

Abstract: Intuitive physics understanding in video diffusion models plays an essential
role in building general-purpose physically plausible world simulators, yet
accurately evaluating such capacity remains a challenging task due to the
difficulty in disentangling physics correctness from visual appearance in
generation. To the end, we introduce LikePhys, a training-free method that
evaluates intuitive physics in video diffusion models by distinguishing
physically valid and impossible videos using the denoising objective as an
ELBO-based likelihood surrogate on a curated dataset of valid-invalid pairs. By
testing on our constructed benchmark of twelve scenarios spanning over four
physics domains, we show that our evaluation metric, Plausibility Preference
Error (PPE), demonstrates strong alignment with human preference, outperforming
state-of-the-art evaluator baselines. We then systematically benchmark
intuitive physics understanding in current video diffusion models. Our study
further analyses how model design and inference settings affect intuitive
physics understanding and highlights domain-specific capacity variations across
physical laws. Empirical results show that, despite current models struggling
with complex and chaotic dynamics, there is a clear trend of improvement in
physics understanding as model capacity and inference settings scale.

Conclusion: The mmWalk dataset advances multi-modal walking assistance research by providing comprehensive outdoor navigation data and benchmarks tailored for BLV users' real-world needs.

Abstract: Walking assistance in extreme or complex environments remains a significant
challenge for people with blindness or low vision (BLV), largely due to the
lack of a holistic scene understanding. Motivated by the real-world needs of
the BLV community, we build mmWalk, a simulated multi-modal dataset that
integrates multi-view sensor and accessibility-oriented features for outdoor
safe navigation. Our dataset comprises 120 manually controlled,
scenario-categorized walking trajectories with 62k synchronized frames. It
contains over 559k panoramic images across RGB, depth, and semantic modalities.
Furthermore, to emphasize real-world relevance, each trajectory involves
outdoor corner cases and accessibility-specific landmarks for BLV users.
Additionally, we generate mmWalkVQA, a VQA benchmark with over 69k visual
question-answer triplets across 9 categories tailored for safe and informed
walking assistance. We evaluate state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
using zero- and few-shot settings and found they struggle with our risk
assessment and navigational tasks. We validate our mmWalk-finetuned model on
real-world datasets and show the effectiveness of our dataset for advancing

TL;DR: The paper investigates Massive Activations (MAs) in Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) and proposes Detail Guidance (DG), a training-free method to enhance local detail synthesis by leveraging these activations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the role of Massive Activations in DiTs' internal feature maps and improve local detail fidelity in visual generation.

Method: Proposed Detail Guidance (DG), which constructs a degraded model by disrupting MAs and uses it to guide the original network toward better detail synthesis. DG can integrate with Classifier-Free Guidance.

Result: DG consistently improves fine-grained detail quality across various pre-trained DiTs (SD3, SD3.5, Flux) without additional training.

Conclusion: Massive Activations play a key role in local detail synthesis, and the proposed DG method effectively enhances detail fidelity in DiT-based visual generation.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently emerged as a powerful backbone
for visual generation. Recent observations reveal \emph{Massive Activations}
(MAs) in their internal feature maps, yet their function remains poorly
understood. In this work, we systematically investigate these activations to
elucidate their role in visual generation. We found that these massive
activations occur across all spatial tokens, and their distribution is
modulated by the input timestep embeddings. Importantly, our investigations
further demonstrate that these massive activations play a key role in local
detail synthesis, while having minimal impact on the overall semantic content
of output. Building on these insights, we propose \textbf{D}etail
\textbf{G}uidance (\textbf{DG}), a MAs-driven, training-free self-guidance
strategy to explicitly enhance local detail fidelity for DiTs. Specifically, DG
constructs a degraded ``detail-deficient'' model by disrupting MAs and
leverages it to guide the original network toward higher-quality detail
synthesis. Our DG can seamlessly integrate with Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG),
enabling further refinements of fine-grained details. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our DG consistently improves fine-grained detail quality
across various pre-trained DiTs (\eg, SD3, SD3.5, and Flux).

TL;DR: ODI-Bench is a comprehensive benchmark for omnidirectional image understanding with 2,000 images and 4,000 QA pairs across 10 tasks, revealing current MLLMs struggle with ODIs. Omni-CoT is proposed as a training-free enhancement method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs perform well on 2D images but their ability to understand immersive omnidirectional images (ODIs) remains unexplored, creating a gap in comprehensive ODI understanding.

Method: Created ODI-Bench with 2,000 ODIs and 4,000 QA pairs across 10 tasks. Evaluated 20 MLLMs and proposed Omni-CoT - a training-free chain-of-thought method that enhances ODI comprehension through textual and visual reasoning.

Result: Experiments show current MLLMs struggle to capture immersive context in ODIs. Omni-CoT significantly improves MLLMs' comprehension ability in omnidirectional environments.

Conclusion: There's a significant gap in MLLMs' ability to understand ODIs. ODI-Bench provides a comprehensive evaluation framework, and Omni-CoT offers an effective training-free solution to enhance ODI comprehension.

Abstract: Omnidirectional images (ODIs) provide full 360x180 view which are widely
adopted in VR, AR and embodied intelligence applications. While multi-modal
large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on
conventional 2D image and video understanding benchmarks, their ability to
comprehend the immersive environments captured by ODIs remains largely
unexplored. To address this gap, we first present ODI-Bench, a novel
comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for omnidirectional image
understanding. ODI-Bench contains 2,000 high-quality omnidirectional images and
over 4,000 manually annotated question-answering (QA) pairs across 10
fine-grained tasks, covering both general-level and spatial-level ODI
understanding. Extensive experiments are conducted to benchmark 20
representative MLLMs, including proprietary and open-source models, under both
close-ended and open-ended settings. Experimental results reveal that current
MLLMs still struggle to capture the immersive context provided by ODIs. To this
end, we further introduce Omni-CoT, a training-free method which significantly
enhances MLLMs' comprehension ability in the omnidirectional environment
through chain-of-thought reasoning across both textual information and visual
cues. Both the benchmark and the code will be released upon the publication.

TL;DR: SNAP is a unified 3D point cloud segmentation model that supports both point-based and text-based prompts across diverse domains (indoor, outdoor, aerial), achieving state-of-the-art performance through domain-adaptive normalization and automatic mask proposal generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D segmentation approaches are limited to single domains and single interaction types, with training on multiple datasets causing negative transfer and lack of generalizability.

Method: Train on 7 datasets across different environments using domain-adaptive normalization to prevent negative transfer. For text prompts, automatically generate mask proposals and match them against CLIP embeddings of textual queries.

Result: Achieves SOTA on 8 out of 9 zero-shot benchmarks for spatial-prompted segmentation and competitive results on all 5 text-prompted benchmarks.

Conclusion: A unified model can match or exceed specialized domain-specific approaches, providing a practical tool for scalable 3D annotation.

Abstract: Interactive 3D point cloud segmentation enables efficient annotation of
complex 3D scenes through user-guided prompts. However, current approaches are
typically restricted in scope to a single domain (indoor or outdoor), and to a
single form of user interaction (either spatial clicks or textual prompts).
Moreover, training on multiple datasets often leads to negative transfer,
resulting in domain-specific tools that lack generalizability. To address these
limitations, we present \textbf{SNAP} (\textbf{S}egment a\textbf{N}ything in
\textbf{A}ny \textbf{P}oint cloud), a unified model for interactive 3D
segmentation that supports both point-based and text-based prompts across
diverse domains. Our approach achieves cross-domain generalizability by
training on 7 datasets spanning indoor, outdoor, and aerial environments, while
employing domain-adaptive normalization to prevent negative transfer. For
text-prompted segmentation, we automatically generate mask proposals without
human intervention and match them against CLIP embeddings of textual queries,
enabling both panoptic and open-vocabulary segmentation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SNAP consistently delivers high-quality segmentation results.
We achieve state-of-the-art performance on 8 out of 9 zero-shot benchmarks for
spatial-prompted segmentation and demonstrate competitive results on all 5
text-prompted benchmarks. These results show that a unified model can match or
exceed specialized domain-specific approaches, providing a practical tool for
scalable 3D annotation. Project page is at, https://neu-vi.github.io/SNAP/

*Denis Zavadski,Damjan Kalšan,Tim Küchler,Haebom Lee,Stefan Roth,Carsten Rother*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework that adapts diffusion models to generate high-fidelity, target-aligned images from synthetic semantic maps using imperfect pseudo-labels, making low-effort synthetic datasets as effective as manually designed ones for urban scene recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Synthetic datasets have a noticeable gap to real imagery, especially when adapting to specific target domains like Cityscapes, limiting downstream performance. Detailed 3D modeling to close this gap is expensive and defeats the purpose of low-cost labeled data.

Method: Adapts an off-the-shelf diffusion model to a target domain using imperfect pseudo-labels. The method filters suboptimal generations, rectifies image-label misalignments, and standardizes semantics across datasets to transform weak synthetic data into competitive real-domain training sets.

Result: Experiments on five synthetic datasets and two real target datasets show segmentation gains of up to +8.0%pt. mIoU over state-of-the-art translation methods. Rapidly constructed synthetic datasets become as effective as high-effort, time-intensive synthetic datasets requiring extensive manual design.

Conclusion: The work presents a valuable collaborative paradigm where fast semantic prototyping combined with generative models enables scalable, high-quality training data creation for urban scene understanding.

Abstract: Synthetic datasets are widely used for training urban scene recognition
models, but even highly realistic renderings show a noticeable gap to real
imagery. This gap is particularly pronounced when adapting to a specific target
domain, such as Cityscapes, where differences in architecture, vegetation,
object appearance, and camera characteristics limit downstream performance.
Closing this gap with more detailed 3D modelling would require expensive asset
and scene design, defeating the purpose of low-cost labelled data. To address
this, we present a new framework that adapts an off-the-shelf diffusion model
to a target domain using only imperfect pseudo-labels. Once trained, it
generates high-fidelity, target-aligned images from semantic maps of any
synthetic dataset, including low-effort sources created in hours rather than
months. The method filters suboptimal generations, rectifies image-label
misalignments, and standardises semantics across datasets, transforming weak
synthetic data into competitive real-domain training sets. Experiments on five
synthetic datasets and two real target datasets show segmentation gains of up
to +8.0%pt. mIoU over state-of-the-art translation methods, making rapidly
constructed synthetic datasets as effective as high-effort, time-intensive
synthetic datasets requiring extensive manual design. This work highlights a
valuable collaborative paradigm where fast semantic prototyping, combined with
generative models, enables scalable, high-quality training data creation for
urban scene understanding.

*Hongyu Zhu,Lin Chen,Mounim A. El-Yacoubi,Mingsheng Shang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MS-Mix is an emotion-sensitive multimodal augmentation framework that addresses label ambiguity in sentiment analysis by using sentiment-aware sample selection, dynamic mixing ratios, and alignment loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Mixup-based augmentation methods for multimodal sentiment analysis suffer from label ambiguity and semantic inconsistency due to random mixing of samples with contradictory emotions.

Method: Proposes MS-Mix with three key components: Sentiment-Aware Sample Selection to prevent semantic confusion, Sentiment Intensity Guided module for dynamic mixing ratios, and Sentiment Alignment Loss for modality consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets with six state-of-the-art backbones show MS-Mix consistently outperforms existing methods.

Conclusion: MS-Mix establishes a new standard for robust multimodal sentiment augmentation by effectively addressing emotion-aware mixing challenges.

Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) aims to identify and interpret human
emotions by integrating information from heterogeneous data sources such as
text, video, and audio. While deep learning models have advanced in network
architecture design, they remain heavily limited by scarce multimodal annotated
data. Although Mixup-based augmentation improves generalization in unimodal
tasks, its direct application to MSA introduces critical challenges: random
mixing often amplifies label ambiguity and semantic inconsistency due to the
lack of emotion-aware mixing mechanisms. To overcome these issues, we propose
MS-Mix, an adaptive, emotion-sensitive augmentation framework that
automatically optimizes sample mixing in multimodal settings. The key
components of MS-Mix include: (1) a Sentiment-Aware Sample Selection (SASS)
strategy that effectively prevents semantic confusion caused by mixing samples
with contradictory emotions. (2) a Sentiment Intensity Guided (SIG) module
using multi-head self-attention to compute modality-specific mixing ratios
dynamically based on their respective emotional intensities. (3) a Sentiment
Alignment Loss (SAL) that aligns the prediction distributions across
modalities, and incorporates the Kullback-Leibler-based loss as an additional
regularization term to train the emotion intensity predictor and the backbone
network jointly. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets with six
state-of-the-art backbones confirm that MS-Mix consistently outperforms
existing methods, establishing a new standard for robust multimodal sentiment
augmentation. The source code is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ACE-G separates coordinate regression into a generic transformer and scene-specific map code, enabling pre-training on thousands of scenes and improved generalization to unseen query images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional scene coordinate regression (SCR) methods overfit to training views by design, limiting their generalization to query images with different lighting or viewpoints compared to classical feature-matching approaches.

Method: Proposes ACE-G framework that separates coordinate regressor and map representation into a generic transformer and scene-specific map code, allowing pre-training on thousands of scenes and training for generalization from mapping to query images.

Result: Demonstrates significantly increased robustness on multiple challenging relocalization datasets while maintaining attractive computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The separation of coordinate regressor and map representation enables effective pre-training and generalization, overcoming the inherent limitation of previous SCR frameworks that overfit to training views.

Abstract: Scene coordinate regression (SCR) has established itself as a promising
learning-based approach to visual relocalization. After mere minutes of
scene-specific training, SCR models estimate camera poses of query images with
high accuracy. Still, SCR methods fall short of the generalization capabilities
of more classical feature-matching approaches. When imaging conditions of query
images, such as lighting or viewpoint, are too different from the training
views, SCR models fail. Failing to generalize is an inherent limitation of
previous SCR frameworks, since their training objective is to encode the
training views in the weights of the coordinate regressor itself. The regressor
essentially overfits to the training views, by design. We propose to separate
the coordinate regressor and the map representation into a generic transformer
and a scene-specific map code. This separation allows us to pre-train the
transformer on tens of thousands of scenes. More importantly, it allows us to
train the transformer to generalize from mapping images to unseen query images
during pre-training. We demonstrate on multiple challenging relocalization
datasets that our method, ACE-G, leads to significantly increased robustness
while keeping the computational footprint attractive.

TL;DR: ExpVid is the first benchmark for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on scientific experiment videos, featuring a three-level task hierarchy that reveals MLLMs struggle with fine-grained perception, procedural understanding, and scientific reasoning despite excelling at coarse recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks neglect the fine-grained and long-horizon nature of authentic laboratory work, especially in wet-lab settings, leaving MLLMs' true capabilities poorly understood for scientific discovery acceleration.

Method: Created ExpVid benchmark curated from peer-reviewed video publications with three-level task hierarchy: Fine-grained Perception, Procedural Understanding, and Scientific Reasoning. Used vision-centric annotation pipeline combining automated generation with multi-disciplinary expert validation.

Result: Evaluation of 19 leading MLLMs showed they excel at coarse-grained recognition but struggle with disambiguating fine details, tracking state changes over time, and linking experimental procedures to scientific outcomes. Notable performance gap between proprietary and open-source models, particularly in high-order reasoning.

Conclusion: ExpVid provides a diagnostic tool and charts a roadmap for developing MLLMs capable of becoming trustworthy partners in scientific experimentation by addressing current limitations in fine-grained perception and scientific reasoning.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold promise for accelerating
scientific discovery by interpreting complex experimental procedures. However,
their true capabilities are poorly understood, as existing benchmarks neglect
the fine-grained and long-horizon nature of authentic laboratory work,
especially in wet-lab settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce ExpVid, the
first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate MLLMs on scientific
experiment videos. Curated from peer-reviewed video publications, ExpVid
features a new three-level task hierarchy that mirrors the scientific process:
(1) Fine-grained Perception of tools, materials, and actions; (2) Procedural
Understanding of step order and completeness; and (3) Scientific Reasoning that
connects the full experiment to its published conclusions. Our vision-centric
annotation pipeline, combining automated generation with multi-disciplinary
expert validation, ensures that tasks require visual grounding. We evaluate 19
leading MLLMs on ExpVid and find that while they excel at coarse-grained
recognition, they struggle with disambiguating fine details, tracking state
changes over time, and linking experimental procedures to scientific outcomes.
Our results reveal a notable performance gap between proprietary and
open-source models, particularly in high-order reasoning. ExpVid not only
provides a diagnostic tool but also charts a roadmap for developing MLLMs
capable of becoming trustworthy partners in scientific experimentation.

TL;DR: LLF-LUT++ is a pyramid network for photo enhancement that combines global and local operators using Laplacian pyramid decomposition, achieving both high performance and computational efficiency for edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing photo enhancement methods either focus on performance but are too heavy for edge devices, or prioritize efficiency but deliver inadequate performance for real-world applications.

Method: Uses image-adaptive 3D LUT for global tonal enhancement on downsampled images, spatial-frequency transformer weight predictor for weight fusion, and local Laplacian filters for edge detail refinement in high-frequency components.

Result: Achieves 2.64 dB PSNR improvement on HDR+ dataset, processes 4K resolution images in 13 ms on a single GPU, and performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: LLF-LUT++ successfully balances enhancement performance with computational efficiency, making it suitable for real-world applications on edge devices while maintaining high-quality results.

Abstract: Photo enhancement plays a crucial role in augmenting the visual aesthetics of
a photograph. In recent years, photo enhancement methods have either focused on
enhancement performance, producing powerful models that cannot be deployed on
edge devices, or prioritized computational efficiency, resulting in inadequate
performance for real-world applications. To this end, this paper introduces a
pyramid network called LLF-LUT++, which integrates global and local operators
through closed-form Laplacian pyramid decomposition and reconstruction. This
approach enables fast processing of high-resolution images while also achieving
excellent performance. Specifically, we utilize an image-adaptive 3D LUT that
capitalizes on the global tonal characteristics of downsampled images, while
incorporating two distinct weight fusion strategies to achieve coarse global
image enhancement. To implement this strategy, we designed a spatial-frequency
transformer weight predictor that effectively extracts the desired distinct
weights by leveraging frequency features. Additionally, we apply local
Laplacian filters to adaptively refine edge details in high-frequency
components. After meticulously redesigning the network structure and
transformer model, LLF-LUT++ not only achieves a 2.64 dB improvement in PSNR on
the HDR+ dataset, but also further reduces runtime, with 4K resolution images
processed in just 13 ms on a single GPU. Extensive experimental results on two
benchmark datasets further show that the proposed approach performs favorably
compared to state-of-the-art methods. The source code will be made publicly
available at https://github.com/fengzhang427/LLF-LUT.

TL;DR: EvoCAD combines vision language models with evolutionary optimization to generate CAD objects through symbolic representations, outperforming previous methods on multiple metrics including novel topological similarity measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage the generative capabilities of large language models with evolutionary algorithms for creating computer-aided design objects, addressing the need for topologically correct 3D object generation.

Method: Samples multiple CAD objects using vision language models, then optimizes them through evolutionary approach with vision and reasoning language models. Uses GPT-4V and GPT-4o for evaluation on CADPrompt benchmark.

Result: EvoCAD outperforms previous approaches on multiple metrics, particularly in generating topologically correct objects. Two novel Euler characteristic-based metrics effectively capture semantic similarity between 3D objects.

Conclusion: The combination of LLMs with evolutionary computation shows promise for CAD generation, with EvoCAD demonstrating superior performance and introducing valuable topological evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Combining large language models with evolutionary computation algorithms
represents a promising research direction leveraging the remarkable generative
and in-context learning capabilities of LLMs with the strengths of evolutionary
algorithms. In this work, we present EvoCAD, a method for generating
computer-aided design (CAD) objects through their symbolic representations
using vision language models and evolutionary optimization. Our method samples
multiple CAD objects, which are then optimized using an evolutionary approach
with vision language and reasoning language models. We assess our method using
GPT-4V and GPT-4o, evaluating it on the CADPrompt benchmark dataset and
comparing it to prior methods. Additionally, we introduce two new metrics based
on topological properties defined by the Euler characteristic, which capture a
form of semantic similarity between 3D objects. Our results demonstrate that
EvoCAD outperforms previous approaches on multiple metrics, particularly in
generating topologically correct objects, which can be efficiently evaluated
using our two novel metrics that complement existing spatial metrics.

*Krittin Chaowakarn,Paramin Sangwongngam,Nang Htet Htet Aung,Chalie Charoenlarpnopparut*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NV3D is a 3D object detection method that uses normal vectors from LiDAR point clouds to improve feature representation, with sampling strategies that reduce data by 55% while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-modal methods face feature alignment challenges, and local feature extraction can be oversimplified for complex 3D object detection tasks. The paper aims to address these limitations by using normal vectors to better capture surface relationships.

Method: NV3D computes normal vectors per voxel using KNN and PCA, uses two sampling strategies (density-based and FOV-aware bin-based), and applies element-wise attention fusion that treats voxel features as query/value and normal vector features as key.

Result: NV3D achieves 86.60% and 80.18% mAP for car and cyclist detection respectively, outperforming baseline Voxel R-CNN by 2.61% and 4.23%. With sampling, it maintains 85.54% mAP while filtering out 55% of voxels.

Conclusion: The proposed normal vector features effectively capture surface relationships and improve 3D object detection performance, especially for objects with distinct spatial shapes like cars and cyclists, while sampling strategies enable significant data reduction without performance degradation.

Abstract: Recent studies in 3D object detection for autonomous vehicles aim to enrich
features through the utilization of multi-modal setups or the extraction of
local patterns within LiDAR point clouds. However, multi-modal methods face
significant challenges in feature alignment, and gaining features locally can
be oversimplified for complex 3D object detection tasks. In this paper, we
propose a novel model, NV3D, which utilizes local features acquired from voxel
neighbors, as normal vectors computed per voxel basis using K-nearest neighbors
(KNN) and principal component analysis (PCA). This informative feature enables
NV3D to determine the relationship between the surface and pertinent target
entities, including cars, pedestrians, or cyclists. During the normal vector
extraction process, NV3D offers two distinct sampling strategies: normal vector
density-based sampling and FOV-aware bin-based sampling, allowing elimination
of up to 55% of data while maintaining performance. In addition, we applied
element-wise attention fusion, which accepts voxel features as the query and
value and normal vector features as the key, similar to the attention
mechanism. Our method is trained on the KITTI dataset and has demonstrated
superior performance in car and cyclist detection owing to their spatial
shapes. In the validation set, NV3D without sampling achieves 86.60% and 80.18%
mean Average Precision (mAP), greater than the baseline Voxel R-CNN by 2.61%
and 4.23% mAP, respectively. With both samplings, NV3D achieves 85.54% mAP in
car detection, exceeding the baseline by 1.56% mAP, despite roughly 55% of
voxels being filtered out.

Conclusion: IVEBench successfully addresses the limitations of existing benchmarks and provides a modern, comprehensive evaluation framework for instruction-guided video editing methods.

Abstract: Instruction-guided video editing has emerged as a rapidly advancing research
direction, offering new opportunities for intuitive content transformation
while also posing significant challenges for systematic evaluation. Existing
video editing benchmarks fail to support the evaluation of instruction-guided
video editing adequately and further suffer from limited source diversity,
narrow task coverage and incomplete evaluation metrics. To address the above
limitations, we introduce IVEBench, a modern benchmark suite specifically
designed for instruction-guided video editing assessment. IVEBench comprises a

dimensions, and covering video lengths ranging from 32 to 1,024 frames. It
further includes 8 categories of editing tasks with 35 subcategories, whose
prompts are generated and refined through large language models and expert
review. Crucially, IVEBench establishes a three-dimensional evaluation protocol
encompassing video quality, instruction compliance and video fidelity,
integrating both traditional metrics and multimodal large language model-based
assessments. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of IVEBench in
benchmarking state-of-the-art instruction-guided video editing methods, showing

TL;DR: PhySIC is a framework that reconstructs metrically accurate 3D humans and scenes from single RGB images, addressing depth ambiguity and physical inconsistencies through occlusion-aware depth fusion, contact optimization, and explicit occlusion masking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with depth ambiguity, occlusions, and physically inconsistent contacts in human-scene reconstruction from single images, which is crucial for VR, robotics, and 3D scene understanding.

Method: Uses coarse monocular depth and body estimates, performs occlusion-aware inpainting, fuses visible depth with unscaled geometry, synthesizes missing surfaces, and refines parameters through confidence-weighted optimization enforcing depth alignment, contact priors, interpenetration avoidance, and 2D reprojection consistency.

Result: Outperforms single-image baselines: reduces mean per-vertex scene error from 641mm to 227mm, halves PA-MPJPE to 42mm, improves contact F1 from 0.09 to 0.51. Efficient (9s for optimization, <27s end-to-end), handles multiple humans naturally.

Conclusion: PhySIC advances scalable 3D scene understanding by converting single images into physically plausible 3D human-scene pairs with realistic interactions and plausible reconstructions of occluded furniture.

Abstract: Reconstructing metrically accurate humans and their surrounding scenes from a
single image is crucial for virtual reality, robotics, and comprehensive 3D
scene understanding. However, existing methods struggle with depth ambiguity,
occlusions, and physically inconsistent contacts. To address these challenges,
we introduce PhySIC, a framework for physically plausible Human-Scene
Interaction and Contact reconstruction. PhySIC recovers metrically consistent
SMPL-X human meshes, dense scene surfaces, and vertex-level contact maps within
a shared coordinate frame from a single RGB image. Starting from coarse
monocular depth and body estimates, PhySIC performs occlusion-aware inpainting,
fuses visible depth with unscaled geometry for a robust metric scaffold, and
synthesizes missing support surfaces like floors. A confidence-weighted
optimization refines body pose, camera parameters, and global scale by jointly
enforcing depth alignment, contact priors, interpenetration avoidance, and 2D
reprojection consistency. Explicit occlusion masking safeguards invisible
regions against implausible configurations. PhySIC is efficient, requiring only
9 seconds for joint human-scene optimization and under 27 seconds end-to-end.
It naturally handles multiple humans, enabling reconstruction of diverse
interactions. Empirically, PhySIC outperforms single-image baselines, reducing
mean per-vertex scene error from 641 mm to 227 mm, halving PA-MPJPE to 42 mm,
and improving contact F1 from 0.09 to 0.51. Qualitative results show realistic
foot-floor interactions, natural seating, and plausible reconstructions of
heavily occluded furniture. By converting a single image into a physically
plausible 3D human-scene pair, PhySIC advances scalable 3D scene understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Creating realistic 3D human avatars with broad diversity is challenging due to expensive data collection and limited scale/diversity of existing datasets.

Method: Uses InfiniHumanData pipeline with vision-language and image generation models to create large-scale multi-modal dataset, then builds InfiniHumanGen diffusion model for text/shape/clothing-conditioned avatar generation.

Result: Generated 111K diverse identities with multi-granular annotations; user study shows generated identities indistinguishable from scan renderings; significant improvements in visual quality, speed, and controllability over SOTA.

Conclusion: Enables high-quality avatar generation with fine-grained control at effectively unbounded scale through a practical and affordable solution.

Abstract: Generating realistic and controllable 3D human avatars is a long-standing
challenge, particularly when covering broad attribute ranges such as ethnicity,
age, clothing styles, and detailed body shapes. Capturing and annotating
large-scale human datasets for training generative models is prohibitively
expensive and limited in scale and diversity. The central question we address
in this paper is: Can existing foundation models be distilled to generate
theoretically unbounded, richly annotated 3D human data? We introduce
InfiniHuman, a framework that synergistically distills these models to produce
richly annotated human data at minimal cost and with theoretically unlimited
scalability. We propose InfiniHumanData, a fully automatic pipeline that
leverages vision-language and image generation models to create a large-scale
multi-modal dataset. User study shows our automatically generated identities
are undistinguishable from scan renderings. InfiniHumanData contains 111K
identities spanning unprecedented diversity. Each identity is annotated with
multi-granularity text descriptions, multi-view RGB images, detailed clothing
images, and SMPL body-shape parameters. Building on this dataset, we propose
InfiniHumanGen, a diffusion-based generative pipeline conditioned on text, body
shape, and clothing assets. InfiniHumanGen enables fast, realistic, and
precisely controllable avatar generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in visual quality,
generation speed, and controllability. Our approach enables high-quality avatar
generation with fine-grained control at effectively unbounded scale through a
practical and affordable solution. We will publicly release the automatic data
generation pipeline, the comprehensive InfiniHumanData dataset, and the

TL;DR: FACE is a novel framework that enhances concept-based explanations of deep neural networks by ensuring faithfulness through KL divergence regularization, outperforming existing methods on faithfulness and sparsity metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automatic concept discovery methods often fail to align extracted concepts with the model's true decision-making process, compromising explanation faithfulness.

Method: Augments Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) with Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence regularization to ensure alignment between original and concept-based predictions, incorporating classifier supervision during concept learning.

Result: Outperforms existing methods across faithfulness and sparsity metrics on ImageNet, COCO, and CelebA datasets.

Conclusion: FACE provides faithful concept-based explanations by enforcing predictive consistency and theoretical guarantees on predictive distribution deviation.

Abstract: Interpreting deep neural networks through concept-based explanations offers a
bridge between low-level features and high-level human-understandable
semantics. However, existing automatic concept discovery methods often fail to
align these extracted concepts with the model's true decision-making process,
thereby compromising explanation faithfulness. In this work, we propose FACE
(Faithful Automatic Concept Extraction), a novel framework that augments
Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) with a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
regularization term to ensure alignment between the model's original and
concept-based predictions. Unlike prior methods that operate solely on encoder
activations, FACE incorporates classifier supervision during concept learning,
enforcing predictive consistency and enabling faithful explanations. We provide
theoretical guarantees showing that minimizing the KL divergence bounds the
deviation in predictive distributions, thereby promoting faithful local
linearity in the learned concept space. Systematic evaluations on ImageNet,
COCO, and CelebA datasets demonstrate that FACE outperforms existing methods
across faithfulness and sparsity metrics.

Conclusion: Establishes a new standard for open-set 6D understanding in robotics and embodied AI, demonstrating category-agnostic performance without templates or CAD models.

Abstract: Estimating an object's 6D pose, size, and shape from visual input is a
fundamental problem in computer vision, with critical applications in robotic
grasping and manipulation. Existing methods either rely on object-specific
priors such as CAD models or templates, or suffer from limited generalization
across categories due to pose-shape entanglement and multi-stage pipelines. In
this work, we propose a unified, category-agnostic framework that
simultaneously predicts 6D pose, size, and dense shape from a single RGB-D
image, without requiring templates, CAD models, or category labels at test
time. Our model fuses dense 2D features from vision foundation models with
partial 3D point clouds using a Transformer encoder enhanced by a
Mixture-of-Experts, and employs parallel decoders for pose-size estimation and
shape reconstruction, achieving real-time inference at 28 FPS. Trained solely
on synthetic data from 149 categories in the SOPE dataset, our framework is
evaluated on four diverse benchmarks SOPE, ROPE, ObjaversePose, and HANDAL,
spanning over 300 categories. It achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on seen
categories while demonstrating remarkably strong zero-shot generalization to
unseen real-world objects, establishing a new standard for open-set 6D
understanding in robotics and embodied AI.

### [216] [Diffusion Transformers with Representation Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11690)
*Boyang Zheng,Nanye Ma,Shengbang Tong,Saining Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes replacing traditional VAEs with Representation Autoencoders (RAEs) using pretrained encoders like DINO, SigLIP, and MAE for diffusion transformers, achieving better image generation quality and faster convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DiTs rely on outdated VAE encoders that have limitations: outdated backbones, low-dimensional latent spaces, weak representations from purely reconstruction-based training, and compromised generative quality.

Method: Replace VAE with pretrained representation encoders (DINO, SigLIP, MAE) paired with trained decoders to form RAEs. Use a DiT variant with lightweight, wide DDT head to handle high-dimensional latent spaces effectively.

Result: Achieved strong image generation results: 1.51 FID at 256x256 (no guidance) and 1.13 at both 256x256 and 512x512 (with guidance). Faster convergence without auxiliary representation alignment losses.

Conclusion: RAE offers clear advantages over traditional VAEs and should be the new default for diffusion transformer training.

Abstract: Latent generative modeling, where a pretrained autoencoder maps pixels into a
latent space for the diffusion process, has become the standard strategy for
Diffusion Transformers (DiT); however, the autoencoder component has barely
evolved. Most DiTs continue to rely on the original VAE encoder, which
introduces several limitations: outdated backbones that compromise
architectural simplicity, low-dimensional latent spaces that restrict
information capacity, and weak representations that result from purely
reconstruction-based training and ultimately limit generative quality. In this
work, we explore replacing the VAE with pretrained representation encoders
(e.g., DINO, SigLIP, MAE) paired with trained decoders, forming what we term
Representation Autoencoders (RAEs). These models provide both high-quality
reconstructions and semantically rich latent spaces, while allowing for a
scalable transformer-based architecture. Since these latent spaces are
typically high-dimensional, a key challenge is enabling diffusion transformers
to operate effectively within them. We analyze the sources of this difficulty,
propose theoretically motivated solutions, and validate them empirically. Our
approach achieves faster convergence without auxiliary representation alignment
losses. Using a DiT variant equipped with a lightweight, wide DDT head, we
achieve strong image generation results on ImageNet: 1.51 FID at 256x256 (no
guidance) and 1.13 at both 256x256 and 512x512 (with guidance). RAE offers
clear advantages and should be the new default for diffusion transformer
training.

*Sarah Harkins Dayton,Hayden Everett,Ioannis Schizas,David L. Boothe Jr.,Vasileios Maroulas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Bayesian topological CNN that combines topology-aware learning with Bayesian sampling to improve training efficiency, reduce calibration error, and enhance uncertainty quantification in image classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard CNNs require large training datasets, produce overconfident predictions, and lack proper uncertainty quantification. The paper aims to address these limitations by integrating topological information with Bayesian methods.

Method: Proposes a Bayesian topological CNN that uses manifold information to accelerate training, places prior distributions on network parameters, learns appropriate posteriors, and includes a consistency condition in the learning cost to modify prior distributions.

Result: The model outperforms conventional CNNs, Bayesian neural networks, and topological CNNs on benchmark datasets, especially with limited or corrupted training data. It provides better uncertainty quantification and more readily identifies out-of-distribution examples.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach combining topological learning with Bayesian methods shows potential for more efficient and robust image classification, particularly in data-scarce or uncertain scenarios.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been established as the main
workhorse in image data processing; nonetheless, they require large amounts of
data to train, often produce overconfident predictions, and frequently lack the
ability to quantify the uncertainty of their predictions. To address these
concerns, we propose a new Bayesian topological CNN that promotes a novel
interplay between topology-aware learning and Bayesian sampling. Specifically,
it utilizes information from important manifolds to accelerate training while
reducing calibration error by placing prior distributions on network parameters
and properly learning appropriate posteriors. One important contribution of our
work is the inclusion of a consistency condition in the learning cost, which
can effectively modify the prior distributions to improve the performance of
our novel network architecture. We evaluate the model on benchmark image
classification datasets and demonstrate its superiority over conventional CNNs,
Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), and topological CNNs. In particular, we supply
evidence that our method provides an advantage in situations where training
data is limited or corrupted. Furthermore, we show that the new model allows
for better uncertainty quantification than standard BNNs since it can more
readily identify examples of out-of-distribution data on which it has not been
trained. Our results highlight the potential of our novel hybrid approach for
more efficient and robust image classification.

### [218] [DiT360: High-Fidelity Panoramic Image Generation via Hybrid Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11712)
*Haoran Feng,Dizhe Zhang,Xiangtai Li,Bo Du,Lu Qi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiT360 is a DiT-based framework for panoramic image generation using hybrid training on perspective and panoramic data, addressing data scarcity issues through inter-domain transformation and intra-domain augmentation at both image and token levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The main challenge in panoramic image generation is maintaining geometric fidelity and photorealism, which is attributed to the lack of large-scale, high-quality real-world panoramic data. This data-centric approach differs from prior methods that focus on model design.

Method: DiT360 employs key modules for inter-domain transformation and intra-domain augmentation at both pre-VAE image level (cross-domain knowledge through perspective guidance and panoramic refinement) and post-VAE token level (hybrid supervision with circular padding, yaw loss, and cube loss).

Result: Extensive experiments on text-to-panorama, inpainting, and outpainting tasks demonstrate better boundary consistency and image fidelity across eleven quantitative metrics compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed DiT360 framework effectively addresses panoramic image generation challenges through a data-centric approach with hybrid training and multi-level supervision, achieving superior performance in maintaining geometric fidelity and photorealism.

Abstract: In this work, we propose DiT360, a DiT-based framework that performs hybrid
training on perspective and panoramic data for panoramic image generation. For
the issues of maintaining geometric fidelity and photorealism in generation
quality, we attribute the main reason to the lack of large-scale, high-quality,
real-world panoramic data, where such a data-centric view differs from prior
methods that focus on model design. Basically, DiT360 has several key modules
for inter-domain transformation and intra-domain augmentation, applied at both
the pre-VAE image level and the post-VAE token level. At the image level, we
incorporate cross-domain knowledge through perspective image guidance and
panoramic refinement, which enhance perceptual quality while regularizing
diversity and photorealism. At the token level, hybrid supervision is applied
across multiple modules, which include circular padding for boundary
continuity, yaw loss for rotational robustness, and cube loss for distortion
awareness. Extensive experiments on text-to-panorama, inpainting, and
outpainting tasks demonstrate that our method achieves better boundary
consistency and image fidelity across eleven quantitative metrics. Our code is

### [219] [Point Prompting: Counterfactual Tracking with Video Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11715)
*Ayush Shrivastava,Sanyam Mehta,Daniel Geng,Andrew Owens*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pretrained video diffusion models can perform zero-shot point tracking by prompting them to visually mark points as they move over time, achieving competitive performance with specialized methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Trackers and video generators solve related problems - analyzing vs synthesizing motion. This connection enables using video diffusion models for tracking without additional training.

Method: Place a colored marker at query point, regenerate video from intermediate noise level to propagate marker across frames. Use unedited initial frame as negative prompt to keep marker visible.

Result: Emergent tracks outperform prior zero-shot methods, persist through occlusions, and achieve performance competitive with specialized self-supervised models.

Conclusion: Video diffusion models can effectively perform zero-shot point tracking by leveraging their motion synthesis capabilities, demonstrating the connection between tracking and video generation.

Abstract: Trackers and video generators solve closely related problems: the former
analyze motion, while the latter synthesize it. We show that this connection
enables pretrained video diffusion models to perform zero-shot point tracking
by simply prompting them to visually mark points as they move over time. We
place a distinctively colored marker at the query point, then regenerate the
rest of the video from an intermediate noise level. This propagates the marker
across frames, tracing the point's trajectory. To ensure that the marker
remains visible in this counterfactual generation, despite such markers being
unlikely in natural videos, we use the unedited initial frame as a negative
prompt. Through experiments with multiple image-conditioned video diffusion
models, we find that these "emergent" tracks outperform those of prior
zero-shot methods and persist through occlusions, often obtaining performance
that is competitive with specialized self-supervised models.

### [220] [Ev4DGS: Novel-view Rendering of Non-Rigid Objects from Monocular Event Streams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11717)
*Takuya Nakabayashi,Navami Kairanda,Hideo Saito,Vladislav Golyanik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ev4DGS is the first method for novel view rendering of non-rigidly deforming objects from monocular event streams only, using deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting and event-based supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing event-based rendering methods for non-rigid objects require additional RGB inputs, creating practical limitations. The paper explores whether similar models can be learned from event streams alone.

Method: Regresses a deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting representation using: 1) loss relating model outputs with 2D event observation space, and 2) coarse 3D deformation model trained from binary masks generated from events.

Result: Experimental comparisons on synthetic and real datasets show Ev4DGS is valid and outperforms multiple naive baselines applicable in this setting.

Conclusion: Ev4DGS successfully demonstrates novel view rendering of non-rigid objects from event streams only, addressing a challenging open question in event-based vision.

Abstract: Event cameras offer various advantages for novel view rendering compared to
synchronously operating RGB cameras, and efficient event-based techniques
supporting rigid scenes have been recently demonstrated in the literature. In
the case of non-rigid objects, however, existing approaches additionally
require sparse RGB inputs, which can be a substantial practical limitation; it
remains unknown if similar models could be learned from event streams only.
This paper sheds light on this challenging open question and introduces Ev4DGS,
i.e., the first approach for novel view rendering of non-rigidly deforming
objects in the explicit observation space (i.e., as RGB or greyscale images)
from monocular event streams. Our method regresses a deformable 3D Gaussian
Splatting representation through 1) a loss relating the outputs of the
estimated model with the 2D event observation space, and 2) a coarse 3D
deformation model trained from binary masks generated from events. We perform
experimental comparisons on existing synthetic and newly recorded real datasets
with non-rigid objects. The results demonstrate the validity of Ev4DGS and its
superior performance compared to multiple naive baselines that can be applied
in our setting. We will release our models and the datasets used in the
evaluation for research purposes; see the project webpage:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CodePlot-CoT is a code-driven Chain-of-Thought paradigm that enables VLMs to generate executable plotting code as "visual thoughts" to solve mathematical problems requiring visual assistance, achieving 21% improvement over base models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs and VLMs struggle with mathematical problems that require visual assistance like drawing auxiliary lines or plotting functions, as they are limited to text-only reasoning and lack precision in multimodal generation.

Method: 1) Created Math-VR, a large-scale bilingual dataset for mathematical visual reasoning; 2) Developed an image-to-code converter for parsing mathematical figures; 3) Trained CodePlot-CoT model to generate both text reasoning and executable plotting code that renders into visual thoughts.

Result: The model achieved up to 21% increase over base model on the new Math-VR benchmark, validating the efficacy of the code-driven reasoning paradigm for multimodal mathematical problem-solving.

Conclusion: CodePlot-CoT opens a new direction for multimodal mathematical reasoning by enabling "thinking with images" through code generation, and provides the community with the first large-scale dataset, benchmark, and strong approach for such problems.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models
(VLMs) have shown significant progress in mathematical reasoning, yet they
still face a critical bottleneck with problems requiring visual assistance,
such as drawing auxiliary lines or plotting functions to solve the problems.
Most LLMs and VLMs are constrained to text-only reasoning chains, while
multimodal unified models that can generate interleaved text and images lack
the necessary precision and controllability for such tasks. To address this, we
propose CodePlot-CoT, a code-driven Chain-of-Thought paradigm for "thinking
with images" in mathematics. Our approach leverages the VLM to generate text
reasoning as well as executable plotting code, which is then rendered into
images as "visual thought", to solve mathematical problems. To achieve this, we
first construct Math-VR, the first large-scale, bilingual dataset and benchmark
for Mathematics problems with Visual Reasoning, comprising 178K samples.
Second, to create high-quality training data, we develop a state-of-the-art
image-to-code converter specialized for parsing complex mathematical figures
into codes. Finally, using these training data, we train the CodePlot-CoT model
for solving mathematical problems. Experimental results show that our model
achieves up to 21% increase over base model on our new benchmark, fully
validating the efficacy of our proposed code-driven reasoning paradigm. Our
work opens a new direction for multimodal mathematical reasoning and provides
the community with the first large-scale dataset, comprehensive benchmark, and
strong approach for such problems. To facilitate future research, we make our
datasets, code, and pretrained models publicly available at
https://github.com/HKU-MMLab/Math-VR-CodePlot-CoT.
