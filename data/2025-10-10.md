*Nader Nemati*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A real-time maritime object detection system using RT-DETR enhanced with synthetic data augmentation, multi-scale feature fusion, and domain adaptation strategies to address small target detection challenges in maritime environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Maritime object detection faces challenges due to small target sizes and limited labeled real RGB data, requiring solutions that can handle these constraints while maintaining real-time performance.

Method: Uses RT-DETR with multi-scale feature fusion for small vessel detection, uncertainty-minimizing query selection for reliable proposals, and smart weighting between synthetic and real training samples to bridge domain gaps. Includes data augmentation for class balancing.

Result: Developed a full Python robust maritime detection pipeline that maintains real-time performance under practical limits, with verified contributions from each module and handling of extreme conditions like poor lighting or sea states.

Conclusion: The system preserves DETR's end-to-end set prediction advantages while allowing speed-accuracy trade-offs, and includes component analysis to quantify each architectural module's contribution and their interactions.

Abstract: Maritime object detection faces essential challenges due to the small target
size and limitations of labeled real RGB data. This paper will present a
real-time object detection system based on RT-DETR, enhanced by employing
augmented synthetic images while strictly evaluating on real data. This study
employs RT-DETR for the maritime environment by combining multi-scale feature
fusion, uncertainty-minimizing query selection, and smart weight between
synthetic and real training samples. The fusion module in DETR enhances the
detection of small, low-contrast vessels, query selection focuses on the most
reliable proposals, and the weighting strategy helps reduce the visual gap
between synthetic and real domains. This design preserves DETR's refined
end-to-end set prediction while allowing users to adjust between speed and
accuracy at inference time. Data augmentation techniques were also used to
balance the different classes of the dataset to improve the robustness and
accuracy of the model. Regarding this study, a full Python robust maritime
detection pipeline is delivered that maintains real-time performance even under
practical limits. It also verifies how each module contributes, and how the
system handles failures in extreme lighting or sea conditions. This study also
includes a component analysis to quantify the contribution of each
architectural module and explore its interactions.

### [2] [DynamicEval: Rethinking Evaluation for Dynamic Text-to-Video Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07441)
*Nithin C. Babu,Aniruddha Mahapatra,Harsh Rangwani,Rajiv Soundararajan,Kuldeep Kulkarni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DynamicEval is a new benchmark for text-to-video evaluation that addresses limitations in existing benchmarks by focusing on dynamic camera motion and providing video-level evaluation with human annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing T2V evaluation benchmarks like VBench and EvalCrafter have two main limitations: they focus on static camera scenes rather than dynamic motion essential for cinematic shots, and they aggregate scores at model level rather than evaluating individual videos.

Method: DynamicEval introduces 45k human annotations on 3k videos from 10 T2V models, evaluating background scene consistency and foreground object consistency. It improves motion smoothness metrics by addressing occlusion/disocclusion issues and introduces a new foreground consistency metric that tracks points within object instances.

Result: The proposed metrics achieve stronger correlations with human preferences at both video and model levels, with improvements of more than 2 percentage points compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: DynamicEval establishes a more comprehensive benchmark for evaluating T2V models under dynamic camera motion, addressing key limitations in current evaluation frameworks.

Abstract: Existing text-to-video (T2V) evaluation benchmarks, such as VBench and
EvalCrafter, suffer from two limitations. (i) While the emphasis is on
subject-centric prompts or static camera scenes, camera motion essential for
producing cinematic shots and existing metrics under dynamic motion are largely
unexplored. (ii) These benchmarks typically aggregate video-level scores into a
single model-level score for ranking generative models. Such aggregation,
however, overlook video-level evaluation, which is vital to selecting the
better video among the candidate videos generated for a given prompt. To
address these gaps, we introduce DynamicEval, a benchmark consisting of
systematically curated prompts emphasizing dynamic camera motion, paired with
45k human annotations on video pairs from 3k videos generated by ten T2V
models. DynamicEval evaluates two key dimensions of video quality: background
scene consistency and foreground object consistency. For background scene
consistency, we obtain the interpretable error maps based on the Vbench motion
smoothness metric. We observe that while the Vbench motion smoothness metric
shows promising alignment with human judgments, it fails in two cases:
occlusions/disocclusions arising from camera and foreground object movements.
Building on this, we propose a new background consistency metric that leverages
object error maps to correct two failure cases in a principled manner. Our
second innovation is the introduction of a foreground consistency metric that
tracks points and their neighbors within each object instance to assess object
fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed metrics achieve
stronger correlations with human preferences at both the video level and the
model level (an improvement of more than 2% points), establishing DynamicEval
as a more comprehensive benchmark for evaluating T2V models under dynamic
camera motion.

### [3] [Provably Accelerated Imaging with Restarted Inertia and Score-based Image Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07470)
*Marien Renaud,Julien Hermant,Deliang Wei,Yu Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RISP is a principled extension of RED that combines restarting inertia for fast convergence with score-based priors for high-quality image reconstruction in ill-posed inverse problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like RED focus on sophisticated image priors for quality but lack principled convergence acceleration, creating a gap between convergence speed and reconstruction quality.

Method: Proposes Restarted Inertia with Score-based Priors (RISP) that incorporates restarting inertia mechanism for acceleration while maintaining score-based image priors for reconstruction quality.

Result: RISP achieves faster stationary-point convergence rate than RED without requiring convexity of image prior, and experimental results show fast convergence with high-quality reconstructions across various imaging problems.

Conclusion: RISP successfully bridges the gap between convergence speed and reconstruction quality by combining principled acceleration with score-based priors, offering both theoretical guarantees and practical performance improvements.

Abstract: Fast convergence and high-quality image recovery are two essential features
of algorithms for solving ill-posed imaging inverse problems. Existing methods,
such as regularization by denoising (RED), often focus on designing
sophisticated image priors to improve reconstruction quality, while leaving
convergence acceleration to heuristics. To bridge the gap, we propose Restarted
Inertia with Score-based Priors (RISP) as a principled extension of RED. RISP
incorporates a restarting inertia for fast convergence, while still allowing
score-based image priors for high-quality reconstruction. We prove that RISP
attains a faster stationary-point convergence rate than RED, without requiring
the convexity of the image prior. We further derive and analyze the associated
continuous-time dynamical system, offering insight into the connection between
RISP and the heavy-ball ordinary differential equation (ODE). Experiments
across a range of imaging inverse problems demonstrate that RISP enables fast
convergence while achieving high-quality reconstructions.

### [4] [A Denoising Framework for Real-World Ultra-Low Dose Lung CT Images Based on an Image Purification Strategy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07492)
*Guoliang Gong,Man Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an Image Purification strategy and Frequency-domain Flow Matching model to address spatial misalignment in ultra-low dose CT denoising, achieving state-of-the-art structure preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ultra-low dose CT reduces radiation but introduces severe noise, artifacts, and spatial misalignment with normal dose CT, making existing denoising methods ineffective on real clinical data.

Method: Developed Image Purification strategy to generate structurally aligned uLDCT-NDCT pairs, and Frequency-domain Flow Matching model that works synergistically with IP to preserve anatomical structure integrity.

Result: IP strategy significantly enhanced multiple denoising models on real clinical uLDCT dataset. FFM model with IP achieved state-of-the-art results in anatomical structure preservation.

Conclusion: Provides effective solution to data mismatch problem in real-world uLDCT denoising, with code and dataset publicly available.

Abstract: Ultra-low dose CT (uLDCT) significantly reduces radiation exposure but
introduces severe noise and artifacts. It also leads to substantial spatial
misalignment between uLDCT and normal dose CT (NDCT) image pairs. This poses
challenges for directly applying existing denoising networks trained on
synthetic noise or aligned data. To address this core challenge in uLDCT
denoising, this paper proposes an innovative denoising framework based on an
Image Purification (IP) strategy. First, we construct a real clinical uLDCT
lung dataset. Then, we propose an Image Purification strategy that generates
structurally aligned uLDCT-NDCT image pairs, providing a high-quality data
foundation for network training. Building upon this, we propose a
Frequency-domain Flow Matching (FFM) model, which works synergistically with
the IP strategy to excellently preserve the anatomical structure integrity of
denoised images. Experiments on the real clinical dataset demonstrate that our
IP strategy significantly enhances the performance of multiple mainstream
denoising models on the uLDCT task. Notably, our proposed FFM model combined
with the IP strategy achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in anatomical
structure preservation. This study provides an effective solution to the data
mismatch problem in real-world uLDCT denoising. Code and dataset are available

### [5] [D2RA: Dual Domain Regeneration Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07538)
*Pragati Shuddhodhan Meshram,Varun Chandrasekaran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: D2RA is a training-free, single-image attack that removes or weakens watermarks from generative model outputs without needing access to the underlying model, revealing vulnerabilities in current semantic watermarking schemes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current semantic watermarking methods for generative models are vulnerable to attacks even under resource-constrained settings, highlighting the need to identify and address weaknesses in existing watermarking designs.

Method: D2RA projects watermarked images onto natural priors across complementary representations to suppress watermark signals while preserving visual fidelity, without requiring model access or training.

Result: Experiments show D2RA consistently reduces watermark detectability across diverse watermarking schemes, demonstrating fundamental weaknesses in current watermarking designs.

Conclusion: The attack reveals that current semantic watermarking methods remain vulnerable to practical attacks, indicating the need for more robust watermarking schemes that can withstand such removal attempts.

Abstract: The growing use of generative models has intensified the need for
watermarking methods that ensure content attribution and provenance. While
recent semantic watermarking schemes improve robustness by embedding signals in
latent or frequency representations, we show they remain vulnerable even under
resource-constrained adversarial settings. We present D2RA, a training-free,
single-image attack that removes or weakens watermarks without access to the
underlying model. By projecting watermarked images onto natural priors across
complementary representations, D2RA suppresses watermark signals while
preserving visual fidelity. Experiments across diverse watermarking schemes
demonstrate that our approach consistently reduces watermark detectability,
revealing fundamental weaknesses in current designs. Our code is available at
https://github.com/Pragati-Meshram/DAWN.

### [6] [PickStyle: Video-to-Video Style Transfer with Context-Style Adapters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07546)
*Soroush Mehraban,Vida Adeli,Jacob Rommann,Babak Taati,Kyryl Truskovskyi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PickStyle enables video style transfer using diffusion models by adding style adapters and leveraging paired image data, achieving coherent and content-preserving results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge is video style transfer without paired video data for supervision, requiring preservation of video context while applying target styles from text prompts.

Method: Uses low-rank adapters in self-attention layers, synthetic training clips from paired images with shared augmentations, and Context-Style Classifier-Free Guidance (CS-CFG) to separate style and context control.

Result: Achieves temporally coherent, style-faithful, and content-preserving video translations that outperform existing baselines both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Conclusion: PickStyle effectively bridges the gap between static image supervision and dynamic video style transfer through adapter-based specialization and novel guidance techniques.

Abstract: We address the task of video style transfer with diffusion models, where the
goal is to preserve the context of an input video while rendering it in a
target style specified by a text prompt. A major challenge is the lack of
paired video data for supervision. We propose PickStyle, a video-to-video style
transfer framework that augments pretrained video diffusion backbones with
style adapters and benefits from paired still image data with source-style
correspondences for training. PickStyle inserts low-rank adapters into the
self-attention layers of conditioning modules, enabling efficient
specialization for motion-style transfer while maintaining strong alignment
between video content and style. To bridge the gap between static image
supervision and dynamic video, we construct synthetic training clips from
paired images by applying shared augmentations that simulate camera motion,
ensuring temporal priors are preserved. In addition, we introduce Context-Style
Classifier-Free Guidance (CS-CFG), a novel factorization of classifier-free
guidance into independent text (style) and video (context) directions. CS-CFG
ensures that context is preserved in generated video while the style is
effectively transferred. Experiments across benchmarks show that our approach
achieves temporally coherent, style-faithful, and content-preserving video
translations, outperforming existing baselines both qualitatively and
quantitatively.

### [7] [TRAVL: A Recipe for Making Video-Language Models Better Judges of Physics Implausibility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07550)
*Saman Motamed,Minghao Chen,Luc Van Gool,Iro Laina*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces TRAVL, a fine-tuning method for Video-Language Models to improve their ability to detect physical plausibility violations in videos, and proposes ImplausiBench, a benchmark for evaluating physical reasoning in video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern video generative models often produce sequences that violate physical laws, but there's no robust method to quantitatively assess physical realism. The authors explore whether VLMs can be trained to serve as reliable judges of physical plausibility.

Method: The authors introduce TRAVL, a fine-tuning recipe combining balanced training data with a trajectory-aware attention module to improve motion encoding. They also create ImplausiBench, a benchmark of 300 videos (150 real, 150 generated) to evaluate physical reasoning without linguistic biases.

Result: Existing VLMs struggle to identify physics violations, revealing limitations in their temporal and causal reasoning. TRAVL improves motion encoding and discrimination in VLMs for better physical plausibility assessment.

Conclusion: TRAVL and ImplausiBench provide a unified framework for probing and improving physical plausibility in multimodal models, addressing a challenging aspect of visual-temporal understanding in video generation.

Abstract: Despite impressive visual fidelity, modern video generative models frequently
produce sequences that violate intuitive physical laws, such as objects
floating, teleporting, or morphing in ways that defy causality. While humans
can easily detect such implausibilities, there remains no robust method for
quantitatively assessing physical realism in video. In this work, we explore
whether Video-Language Models (VLMs) can be trained to serve as reliable judges
of physical plausibility. We find that existing VLMs struggle to identify
physics violations, exposing fundamental limitations in their temporal and
causal reasoning. To address this, we introduce TRAVL, a fine-tuning recipe
that combines a balanced training dataset with a trajectory-aware attention
module to improve motion encoding and discrimination in VLMs. To evaluate
physical reasoning more rigorously, we propose ImplausiBench, a benchmark of
300 videos (150 real, 150 generated) that removes linguistic biases and
isolates visual-temporal understanding. Performance is reported both with
gold-standard human judgments and stricter LLM-as-judge metrics. Together,
TRAVL and ImplausiBench offer a unified framework for probing and improving
physical plausibility in multimodal models, shedding light on a challenging and
underexplored aspect of visual-temporal understanding.

### [8] [Label Semantics for Robust Hyperspectral Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07556)
*Rafin Hassan,Zarin Tasnim Roshni,Rafiqul Bari,Alimul Islam,Nabeel Mohammed,Moshiur Farazi,Shafin Rahman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: S3FN is a semantic spectral-spatial fusion network that uses LLM-generated textual descriptions to enhance HSI classification by improving feature-label alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HSI classification faces challenges with limited training samples, high dimensionality causing overfitting, and most models being monomodal relying only on spectral-spatial data.

Method: Uses LLMs to generate comprehensive textual descriptions for each class label, embeds them using pre-trained text encoders (BERT/RoBERTa), and fuses textual semantics with spectral-spatial data for better feature-label alignment.

Result: Significant performance boost demonstrated on three HSI benchmark datasets (Hyperspectral Wood, HyperspectralBlueberries, DeepHS-Fruit).

Conclusion: The approach highlights the synergy between textual semantics and spectral-spatial data, paving the way for semantically augmented HSI classification models.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) classification is a critical tool with widespread
applications across diverse fields such as agriculture, environmental
monitoring, medicine, and materials science. Due to the limited availability of
high-quality training samples and the high dimensionality of spectral data, HSI
classification models are prone to overfitting and often face challenges in
balancing accuracy and computational complexity. Furthermore, most of HSI
classification models are monomodal, where it solely relies on spectral-spatial
data to learn decision boundaries in the high dimensional embedding space. To
address this, we propose a general-purpose Semantic Spectral-Spatial Fusion
Network (S3FN) that uses contextual, class specific textual descriptions to
complement the training of an HSI classification model. Specifically, S3FN
leverages LLMs to generate comprehensive textual descriptions for each class
label that captures their unique characteristics and spectral behaviors. These
descriptions are then embedded into a vector space using a pre-trained text
encoder such as BERT or RoBERTa to extract meaningful label semantics which in
turn leads to a better feature-label alignment for improved classification
performance. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we evaluate our
model on three diverse HSI benchmark datasets - Hyperspectral Wood,
HyperspectralBlueberries, and DeepHS-Fruit and report significant performance
boost. Our results highlight the synergy between textual semantics and
spectral-spatial data, paving the way for further advancements in semantically
augmented HSI classification models. Codes are be available in:

### [9] [Cross-Modal Attention Guided Unlearning in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07567)
*Karuna Bhaila,Aneesh Komanduri,Minh-Hao Van,Xintao Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAGUL is a lightweight unlearning framework for vision-language models that prevents leakage of sensitive information by transforming low-importance visual tokens using cross-modal attention, without altering pre-trained model parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models may memorize and regurgitate private/sensitive information during training, and visual context adds complexity to unlearning compared to text-only models.

Method: Cross-Modal Attention Guided Unlearning (CAGUL) uses external modules to encode unlearning information in visual tokens of low importance for relevant queries, leveraging cross-modal attention patterns.

Result: CAGUL performs better or on par with finetuning-based baselines while preventing information leakage and retaining reference model behavior, without changing pre-trained parameters or requiring retraining.

Conclusion: CAGUL provides a practical and effective unlearning solution for VLMs that is computationally efficient and maintains model performance while addressing privacy concerns.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated immense capabilities in
multi-modal understanding and inference tasks such as Visual Question Answering
(VQA), which requires models to infer outputs based on visual and textual
context simultaneously. Such inference abilities of large-scale pretrained
models are often attributed to the massive scale of pre-training data collected
across several domains. However, the models may memorize private and/or
sensitive information during training and regurgitate it in inference.
Recently, machine unlearning has been leveraged to address the leakage of
private data in LLMs. VLMs add a layer of complexity to this process, as the
visual context in the query may also contain sensitive information in addition
to the text. To address this issue, we explore unlearning for vision-language
models, specifically for the VQA task. We explore the role of visual tokens for
output generation in VLMs using cross-modal attention and utilize it to
formulate Cross-Modal Attention Guided Unlearning (CAGUL), a lightweight and
efficient VLM unlearning framework. In contrast to computationally expensive
model finetuning methods, CAGUL utilizes external modules to encode unlearning
information in visual tokens of low importance for relevant queries. We find
that the transformed visual tokens not only prevent leakage but also retain
reference model behavior. Experimental results show that our method performs
better or on par with finetuning-based baselines without altering the
pre-trained model parameters or incurring retraining costs, making it a
practical and effective unlearning solution for VLMs.

### [10] [MaizeStandCounting (MaSC): Automated and Accurate Maize Stand Counting from UAV Imagery Using Image Processing and Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07580)
*Dewi Endah Kharismawati,Toni Kazic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MaSC is an automated maize seedling counting system using UAV imagery and lightweight YOLOv9 model that achieves high accuracy (R^2 up to 0.906) and real-time processing capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual maize stand counting is labor-intensive, slow, and error-prone, especially for large fields, creating need for automated solutions for crop management and research.

Method: Uses RGB imagery from low-cost UAVs with two processing modes: mosaic image patches and raw video frames aligned via homography. Employs lightweight YOLOv9 model trained for V2-V10 growth stages, with row and range segmentation based on spatial distribution.

Result: Strong agreement with manual counts (R^2=0.616 for mosaics, R^2=0.906 for raw frames). Processes 83 frames in 60.63s including inference and post-processing, demonstrating real-time capability.

Conclusion: MaSC is an effective, scalable, low-cost, and accurate tool for automated maize stand counting suitable for both research and production environments.

Abstract: Accurate maize stand counts are essential for crop management and research,
informing yield prediction, planting density optimization, and early detection
of germination issues. Manual counting is labor-intensive, slow, and
error-prone, especially across large or variable fields. We present
MaizeStandCounting (MaSC), a robust algorithm for automated maize seedling
stand counting from RGB imagery captured by low-cost UAVs and processed on
affordable hardware. MaSC operates in two modes: (1) mosaic images divided into
patches, and (2) raw video frames aligned using homography matrices. Both modes
use a lightweight YOLOv9 model trained to detect maize seedlings from V2-V10
growth stages. MaSC distinguishes maize from weeds and other vegetation, then
performs row and range segmentation based on the spatial distribution of
detections to produce precise row-wise stand counts. Evaluation against
in-field manual counts from our 2024 summer nursery showed strong agreement
with ground truth (R^2= 0.616 for mosaics, R^2 = 0.906 for raw frames). MaSC
processed 83 full-resolution frames in 60.63 s, including inference and
post-processing, highlighting its potential for real-time operation. These
results demonstrate MaSC's effectiveness as a scalable, low-cost, and accurate
tool for automated maize stand counting in both research and production
environments.

### [11] [Quick-CapsNet (QCN): A fast alternative to Capsule Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07600)
*Pouya Shiri,Ramin Sharifi,Amirali Baniasadi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Quick-CapsNet (QCN) is proposed as a faster alternative to Capsule Networks, achieving 5x faster inference with only marginal accuracy loss by reducing the number of capsules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CapsNet has slow training and testing speeds, which limits its use in real-time applications requiring fast inference.

Method: QCN reduces the number of capsules in the network to speed up computation, and also enhances the decoder for better performance.

Result: QCN achieves 5x faster inference on MNIST, F-MNIST, SVHN and Cifar-10 datasets with only marginal accuracy loss compared to original CapsNet.

Conclusion: QCN provides a fast alternative to CapsNet suitable for real-time applications, with the trade-off of slightly reduced accuracy for significantly improved speed.

Abstract: The basic computational unit in Capsule Network (CapsNet) is a capsule (vs.
neurons in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)). A capsule is a set of
neurons, which form a vector. CapsNet is used for supervised classification of
data and has achieved state-of-the-art accuracy on MNIST digit recognition
dataset, outperforming conventional CNNs in detecting overlapping digits.
Moreover, CapsNet shows higher robustness towards affine transformation when
compared to CNNs for MNIST datasets. One of the drawbacks of CapsNet, however,
is slow training and testing. This can be a bottleneck for applications that
require a fast network, especially during inference. In this work, we introduce
Quick-CapsNet (QCN) as a fast alternative to CapsNet, which can be a starting
point to develop CapsNet for fast real-time applications. QCN builds on
producing a fewer number of capsules, which results in a faster network. QCN
achieves this at the cost of marginal loss in accuracy. Inference is 5x faster
on MNIST, F-MNIST, SVHN and Cifar-10 datasets. We also further enhanced QCN by
employing a more powerful decoder instead of the default decoder to further
improve QCN.

### [12] [Rectified-CFG++ for Flow Based Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07631)
*Shreshth Saini,Shashank Gupta,Alan C. Bovik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Rectified-CFG++ is an adaptive predictor-corrector guidance method that addresses off-manifold drift issues in classifier-free guidance for rectified flow models, ensuring stable text-to-image generation across various guidance strengths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard classifier-free guidance (CFG) causes severe off-manifold drift when applied to rectified flow models, leading to visual artifacts, text misalignment, and brittle behavior.

Method: Uses adaptive predictor-corrector guidance with conditional RF updates to anchor samples near learned transport paths, followed by weighted conditional correction that interpolates between conditional and unconditional velocity fields.

Result: Proven marginally consistent with trajectories remaining within bounded tubular neighborhood of data manifold. Outperforms standard CFG on large-scale text-to-image models (Flux, Stable Diffusion 3/3.5, Lumina) across MS-COCO, LAION-Aesthetic, and T2I-CompBench datasets.

Conclusion: Rectified-CFG++ successfully couples deterministic efficiency of rectified flows with geometry-aware conditioning, providing stable and improved performance over standard CFG for text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is the workhorse for steering large diffusion
models toward text-conditioned targets, yet its native application to rectified
flow (RF) based models provokes severe off-manifold drift, yielding visual
artifacts, text misalignment, and brittle behaviour. We present
Rectified-CFG++, an adaptive predictor-corrector guidance that couples the
deterministic efficiency of rectified flows with a geometry-aware conditioning
rule. Each inference step first executes a conditional RF update that anchors
the sample near the learned transport path, then applies a weighted conditional
correction that interpolates between conditional and unconditional velocity
fields. We prove that the resulting velocity field is marginally consistent and
that its trajectories remain within a bounded tubular neighbourhood of the data
manifold, ensuring stability across a wide range of guidance strengths.
Extensive experiments on large-scale text-to-image models (Flux, Stable
Diffusion 3/3.5, Lumina) show that Rectified-CFG++ consistently outperforms
standard CFG on benchmark datasets such as MS-COCO, LAION-Aesthetic, and
T2I-CompBench. Project page: https://rectified-cfgpp.github.io/

### [13] [PIT-QMM: A Large Multimodal Model For No-Reference Point Cloud Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07636)
*Shashank Gupta,Gregoire Phillips,Alan C. Bovik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PIT-QMM is a novel Large Multimodal Model for No-Reference Point Cloud Quality Assessment that uses text, images, and point clouds end-to-end to predict quality scores, outperforming state-of-the-art methods with fewer training iterations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While Large Multimodal Models have advanced image and video quality assessment, their potential for 3D asset quality assessment remains unexplored. The authors aim to leverage these models for No-Reference Point Cloud Quality Assessment (NR-PCQA) to automatically evaluate perceptual quality without reference data.

Method: The method leverages complementary information from different modalities - text descriptions, 2D projections, and 3D point cloud views. It constructs PIT-QMM, a novel LMM capable of consuming text, images, and point clouds end-to-end to predict quality scores.

Result: Extensive experiments show that PIT-QMM outperforms state-of-the-art methods by significant margins on popular benchmarks with fewer training iterations. The framework also enables distortion localization and identification.

Conclusion: The proposed PIT-QMM framework paves a new way forward for model explainability and interactivity in point cloud quality assessment, demonstrating superior performance with multimodal input processing.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have recently enabled considerable advances in
the realm of image and video quality assessment, but this progress has yet to
be fully explored in the domain of 3D assets. We are interested in using these
models to conduct No-Reference Point Cloud Quality Assessment (NR-PCQA), where
the aim is to automatically evaluate the perceptual quality of a point cloud in
absence of a reference. We begin with the observation that different modalities
of data - text descriptions, 2D projections, and 3D point cloud views - provide
complementary information about point cloud quality. We then construct PIT-QMM,
a novel LMM for NR-PCQA that is capable of consuming text, images and point
clouds end-to-end to predict quality scores. Extensive experimentation shows
that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art by significant
margins on popular benchmarks with fewer training iterations. We also
demonstrate that our framework enables distortion localization and
identification, which paves a new way forward for model explainability and
interactivity. Code and datasets are available at

### [14] [Dual-Stream Alignment for Action Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07652)
*Harshala Gammulle,Clinton Fookes,Sridha Sridharan,Simon Denman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes DSA Net, a dual-stream alignment network with quantum-classical framework for action segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art performance through feature alignment and temporal context fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing single-stream approaches for action segmentation are limited, while recent two-stream methods show promise but need better feature alignment and communication between streams.

Method: Dual-stream network with Temporal Context block using cross-attention and Quantum-based Action-Guided Modulation, plus Dual-Stream Alignment Loss with relational consistency, cross-level contrastive, and cycle-consistency reconstruction components.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on GTEA, Breakfast, 50Salads, and EgoProcel datasets, with extensive ablation studies validating each component's effectiveness.

Conclusion: DSA Net successfully demonstrates the benefits of dual-stream feature alignment with quantum-classical fusion for action segmentation, significantly outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Action segmentation is a challenging yet active research area that involves
identifying when and where specific actions occur in continuous video streams.
Most existing work has focused on single-stream approaches that model the
spatio-temporal aspects of frame sequences. However, recent research has
shifted toward two-stream methods that learn action-wise features to enhance
action segmentation performance. In this work, we propose the Dual-Stream
Alignment Network (DSA Net) and investigate the impact of incorporating a
second stream of learned action features to guide segmentation by capturing
both action and action-transition cues. Communication between the two streams
is facilitated by a Temporal Context (TC) block, which fuses complementary
information using cross-attention and Quantum-based Action-Guided Modulation
(Q-ActGM), enhancing the expressive power of the fused features. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first study to introduce a hybrid quantum-classical
machine learning framework for action segmentation. Our primary objective is
for the two streams (frame-wise and action-wise) to learn a shared feature
space through feature alignment. This is encouraged by the proposed Dual-Stream
Alignment Loss, which comprises three components: relational consistency,
cross-level contrastive, and cycle-consistency reconstruction losses. Following
prior work, we evaluate DSA Net on several diverse benchmark datasets: GTEA,
Breakfast, 50Salads, and EgoProcel. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of
each component through extensive ablation studies. Notably, DSA Net achieves
state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing

*Yanjie Pan,Qingdong He,Lidong Wang,Bo Peng,Mingmin Chi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OIE is a video virtual try-on method that performs clothing replacement only on the first frame, then uses pose/mask guidance to generate remaining frames sequentially, achieving high efficiency while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current dual-branch architectures for video virtual try-on require complex modifications to Diffusion Transformer backbones and lack temporal characteristics in garment features, leading to high computational costs.

Method: Uses image-based clothing transfer on the first frame, then leverages pose and mask information to guide video generation model for synthesizing remaining frames sequentially under content control of the edited first frame.

Result: Achieves superior parameter efficiency and computational efficiency while maintaining leading performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed OIE method provides an efficient alternative to complex dual-branch architectures by performing clothing replacement only once on the first frame and leveraging temporal guidance for subsequent frame generation.

Abstract: Video virtual try-on aims to replace the clothing of a person in a video with
a target garment. Current dual-branch architectures have achieved significant
success in diffusion models based on the U-Net; however, adapting them to
diffusion models built upon the Diffusion Transformer remains challenging.
Initially, introducing latent space features from the garment reference branch
requires adding or modifying the backbone network, leading to a large number of
trainable parameters. Subsequently, the latent space features of garments lack
inherent temporal characteristics and thus require additional learning. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel approach, OIE (Once is Enough), a
virtual try-on strategy based on first-frame clothing replacement:
specifically, we employ an image-based clothing transfer model to replace the
clothing in the initial frame, and then, under the content control of the
edited first frame, utilize pose and mask information to guide the temporal
prior of the video generation model in synthesizing the remaining frames
sequentially. Experiments show that our method achieves superior parameter
efficiency and computational efficiency while still maintaining leading
performance under these constraints.

*James Baker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method that improves personalization in diffusion models by using automatically generated masks to restrict image tokens to the subject, allowing text prompts to better control the background.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing personalization methods often recreate the subject image and ignore text prompts, limiting user control over generated content.

Method: Uses IP-Adapter's automatically generated masks in a second pass to mask image tokens, restricting them to the subject area while allowing text prompts to attend to the background.

Result: Produces images that accurately depict the subject while definitively matching text prompts, especially for location/place descriptions, with high prompt and source image alignment.

Conclusion: The proposed masking approach effectively improves personalization in diffusion models by better balancing subject preservation and text prompt adherence.

Abstract: Personalizing diffusion models allows users to generate new images that
incorporate a given subject, allowing more control than a text prompt. These
models often suffer somewhat when they end up just recreating the subject
image, and ignoring the text prompt. We observe that one popular method for
personalization, the IP-Adapter automatically generates masks that we
definitively segment the subject from the background during inference. We
propose to use this automatically generated mask on a second pass to mask the
image tokens, thus restricting them to the subject, not the background,
allowing the text prompt to attend to the rest of the image. For text prompts
describing locations and places, this produces images that accurately depict
the subject while definitively matching the prompt. We compare our method to a
few other test time personalization methods, and find our method displays high
prompt and source image alignment.

*Heming Wu,Di Wang,Tai Ma,Peng Zhao,Yubin Xiao,Zhongke Wu,Xing-Ce Wang,Chuang Li,Xuan Wu,You Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TCIP is a deformable medical image registration model that addresses anatomical misalignment accumulation in pyramid networks and adaptive iteration control, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with comparable speed and parameter size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pyramid networks in medical image registration suffer from anatomical misalignment propagation and lack adaptive iteration control, leading to either premature termination or excessive iterations that degrade registration accuracy.

Method: Proposes Feature-Enhanced Residual Module (FERM) with three sequential blocks for anatomical feature extraction, irrelevant feature suppression, and deformation field estimation. Also introduces dual-stage Threshold-Controlled Iterative (TCI) strategy for adaptive iteration determination.

Result: TCIP outperforms state-of-the-art registration networks in accuracy on three brain MRI datasets and one abdomen CT dataset, while maintaining comparable inference speed and compact parameter size. FERM and TCI show good generalizability when integrated with existing networks.

Conclusion: The proposed TCIP model effectively addresses anatomical misalignment accumulation and adaptive iteration control in medical image registration, demonstrating superior performance and generalizability across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Although pyramid networks have demonstrated superior performance in
deformable medical image registration, their decoder architectures are
inherently prone to propagating and accumulating anatomical structure
misalignments. Moreover, most existing models do not adaptively determine the
number of iterations for optimization under varying deformation requirements
across images, resulting in either premature termination or excessive
iterations that degrades registration accuracy. To effectively mitigate the
accumulation of anatomical misalignments, we propose the Feature-Enhanced
Residual Module (FERM) as the core component of each decoding layer in the
pyramid network. FERM comprises three sequential blocks that extract anatomical
semantic features, learn to suppress irrelevant features, and estimate the
final deformation field, respectively. To adaptively determine the number of
iterations for varying images, we propose the dual-stage Threshold-Controlled
Iterative (TCI) strategy. In the first stage, TCI assesses registration
stability and with asserted stability, it continues with the second stage to
evaluate convergence. We coin the model that integrates FERM and TCI as
Threshold-Controlled Iterative Pyramid (TCIP). Extensive experiments on three
public brain MRI datasets and one abdomen CT dataset demonstrate that TCIP
outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) registration networks in terms of
accuracy, while maintaining comparable inference speed and a compact model
parameter size. Finally, we assess the generalizability of FERM and TCI by
integrating them with existing registration networks and further conduct
ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of these two proposed methods.

TL;DR: A video synthesis method that combines multiple user controls (from exact 4D trajectories to coarse text prompts) using variational inference and step-wise KL divergence minimization to achieve high controllability while maintaining diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generative models are trained for fixed input formats, but real video workflows need flexible control with varying granularity - from precise object trajectories to coarse text prompts.

Method: Uses variational inference to approximate a composed distribution, leveraging multiple video generation backbones. Employs step-wise KL divergence minimization over annealed distributions and context-conditioned factorization to reduce solution space modes and avoid local optima.

Result: Produces samples with improved controllability, diversity, and 3D consistency compared to prior works.

Conclusion: The method successfully addresses the need for flexible control in video synthesis while maintaining sample quality and diversity.

Abstract: Many video workflows benefit from a mixture of user controls with varying
granularity, from exact 4D object trajectories and camera paths to coarse text
prompts, while existing video generative models are typically trained for fixed
input formats. We develop a video synthesis method that addresses this need and
generates samples with high controllability for specified elements while
maintaining diversity for under-specified ones. We cast the task as variational
inference to approximate a composed distribution, leveraging multiple video
generation backbones to account for all task constraints collectively. To
address the optimization challenge, we break down the problem into step-wise KL
divergence minimization over an annealed sequence of distributions, and further
propose a context-conditioned factorization technique that reduces modes in the
solution space to circumvent local optima. Experiments suggest that our method
produces samples with improved controllability, diversity, and 3D consistency
compared to prior works.

Abstract: Induction motors (IMs) are indispensable in industrial and daily life, but
they are susceptible to various faults that can lead to overheating, wasted
energy consumption, and service failure. Early detection of faults is essential
to protect the motor and prolong its lifespan. This paper presents a hybrid
method that integrates BYOL with CNNs for classifying thermal images of
induction motors for fault detection. The thermal dataset used in this work
includes different operating states of the motor, such as normal operation,
overload, and faults. We employed multiple deep learning (DL) models for the
BYOL technique, ranging from popular architectures such as ResNet-50,
DenseNet-121, DenseNet-169, EfficientNetB0, VGG16, and MobileNetV2.
Additionally, we introduced a new high-performance yet lightweight CNN model
named BYOL-IMNet, which comprises four custom-designed blocks tailored for
fault classification in thermal images. Our experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed BYOL-IMNet achieves 99.89\% test accuracy and an inference
time of 5.7 ms per image, outperforming state-of-the-art models. This study
highlights the promising performance of the CNN-BYOL hybrid method in enhancing
accuracy for detecting faults in induction motors, offering a robust
methodology for online monitoring in industrial settings.

*Xiaoxu Ma,Runhao Li,Zhenyu Weng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLH is a mutual learning framework that enhances center-based hashing by transferring local similarity knowledge from a weaker pairwise-based branch, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Center-based hashing methods capture global data distributions well but underutilize local similarity information, while pairwise methods preserve local similarity relationships effectively.

Method: Proposes a weak-to-strong mutual learning framework with two branches (center-based and pairwise-based), using mixture-of-hash-experts module for cross-branch interaction and iterative knowledge transfer.

Result: Extensive experiments show MLH consistently outperforms state-of-the-art hashing methods across multiple benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The mutual learning framework effectively combines global structure modeling from center-based methods with local similarity preservation from pairwise methods, achieving superior hashing performance.

Abstract: Deep hashing has been widely adopted for large-scale image retrieval, with
numerous strategies proposed to optimize hash function learning. Pairwise-based
methods are effective in learning hash functions that preserve local similarity
relationships, whereas center-based methods typically achieve superior
performance by more effectively capturing global data distributions. However,
the strength of center-based methods in modeling global structures often comes
at the expense of underutilizing important local similarity information. To
address this limitation, we propose Mutual Learning for Hashing (MLH), a novel
weak-to-strong framework that enhances a center-based hashing branch by
transferring knowledge from a weaker pairwise-based branch. MLH consists of two
branches: a strong center-based branch and a weaker pairwise-based branch.
Through an iterative mutual learning process, the center-based branch leverages
local similarity cues learned by the pairwise-based branch. Furthermore,
inspired by the mixture-of-experts paradigm, we introduce a novel
mixture-of-hash-experts module that enables effective cross-branch interaction,
further enhancing the performance of both branches. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MLH consistently outperforms state-of-the-art hashing methods
across multiple benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Repainter provides an effective solution for e-commerce image inpainting, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods. The framework and accompanying dataset/benchmark advance the field of commercial image enhancement.

Abstract: In web data, product images are central to boosting user engagement and
advertising efficacy on e-commerce platforms, yet the intrusive elements such
as watermarks and promotional text remain major obstacles to delivering clear
and appealing product visuals. Although diffusion-based inpainting methods have
advanced, they still face challenges in commercial settings due to unreliable
object removal and limited domain-specific adaptation. To tackle these
challenges, we propose Repainter, a reinforcement learning framework that
integrates spatial-matting trajectory refinement with Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). Our approach modulates attention mechanisms to emphasize
background context, generating higher-reward samples and reducing unwanted
object insertion. We also introduce a composite reward mechanism that balances
global, local, and semantic constraints, effectively reducing visual artifacts
and reward hacking. Additionally, we contribute EcomPaint-100K, a high-quality,
large-scale e-commerce inpainting dataset, and a standardized benchmark
EcomPaint-Bench for fair evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
Repainter significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in
challenging scenes with intricate compositions. We will release our code and
weights upon acceptance.

TL;DR: SyncHuman combines 2D multiview and 3D native generative models for high-quality 3D human reconstruction from single images, achieving robust results even with challenging poses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods using SMPL estimation and SMPL-conditioned models suffer from inaccurate 3D priors and struggle with difficult poses and fine details in photorealistic 3D human reconstruction.

Method: Jointly fine-tunes multiview generative model (for fine 2D details) and 3D native generative model (for structural consistency) using pixel-aligned 2D-3D synchronization attention, plus feature injection to lift 2D details onto 3D shapes.

Result: Achieves robust and photo-realistic 3D human reconstruction with improved geometric accuracy and visual fidelity, outperforming baseline methods even on challenging pose images.

Conclusion: SyncHuman demonstrates a promising direction for 3D generation by effectively integrating complementary strengths of 2D and 3D generative approaches.

Abstract: Photorealistic 3D full-body human reconstruction from a single image is a
critical yet challenging task for applications in films and video games due to
inherent ambiguities and severe self-occlusions. While recent approaches
leverage SMPL estimation and SMPL-conditioned image generative models to
hallucinate novel views, they suffer from inaccurate 3D priors estimated from
SMPL meshes and have difficulty in handling difficult human poses and
reconstructing fine details. In this paper, we propose SyncHuman, a novel
framework that combines 2D multiview generative model and 3D native generative
model for the first time, enabling high-quality clothed human mesh
reconstruction from single-view images even under challenging human poses.
Multiview generative model excels at capturing fine 2D details but struggles
with structural consistency, whereas 3D native generative model generates
coarse yet structurally consistent 3D shapes. By integrating the complementary
strengths of these two approaches, we develop a more effective generation
framework. Specifically, we first jointly fine-tune the multiview generative
model and the 3D native generative model with proposed pixel-aligned 2D-3D
synchronization attention to produce geometrically aligned 3D shapes and 2D
multiview images. To further improve details, we introduce a feature injection
mechanism that lifts fine details from 2D multiview images onto the aligned 3D
shapes, enabling accurate and high-fidelity reconstruction. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SyncHuman achieves robust and photo-realistic 3D
human reconstruction, even for images with challenging poses. Our method
outperforms baseline methods in geometric accuracy and visual fidelity,
demonstrating a promising direction for future 3D generation models.

TL;DR: ComGS is a framework for realistic 3D object-scene composition using Gaussian Splatting, addressing appearance and shadow inconsistencies through efficient relightable object reconstruction and simplified lighting estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gaussian Splatting enables immersive rendering but struggles with realistic object-scene composition due to baked appearance and shadow information, causing inconsistencies when combining objects and scenes.

Method: Introduces Surface Octahedral Probes (SOPs) for efficient lighting/occlusion storage and querying, avoiding expensive ray tracing. Simplifies lighting estimation by focusing on environment lighting at object placement using 360° reconstructed radiance fields and diffusion model completion.

Result: Achieves 2x speedup in reconstruction, real-time shadow computation, high-quality rendering at ~28 FPS, visually harmonious results with vivid shadows, and only 36 seconds for editing.

Conclusion: ComGS provides an effective solution for realistic 3D object-scene composition by addressing key challenges in relightable reconstruction and lighting estimation, enabling real-time performance and fast editing.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS) enables immersive rendering, but realistic 3D
object-scene composition remains challenging. Baked appearance and shadow
information in GS radiance fields cause inconsistencies when combining objects
and scenes. Addressing this requires relightable object reconstruction and
scene lighting estimation. For relightable object reconstruction, existing
Gaussian-based inverse rendering methods often rely on ray tracing, leading to
low efficiency. We introduce Surface Octahedral Probes (SOPs), which store
lighting and occlusion information and allow efficient 3D querying via
interpolation, avoiding expensive ray tracing. SOPs provide at least a 2x
speedup in reconstruction and enable real-time shadow computation in Gaussian
scenes. For lighting estimation, existing Gaussian-based inverse rendering
methods struggle to model intricate light transport and often fail in complex
scenes, while learning-based methods predict lighting from a single image and
are viewpoint-sensitive. We observe that 3D object-scene composition primarily
concerns the object's appearance and nearby shadows. Thus, we simplify the
challenging task of full scene lighting estimation by focusing on the
environment lighting at the object's placement. Specifically, we capture a 360
degrees reconstructed radiance field of the scene at the location and fine-tune
a diffusion model to complete the lighting. Building on these advances, we
propose ComGS, a novel 3D object-scene composition framework. Our method
achieves high-quality, real-time rendering at around 28 FPS, produces visually
harmonious results with vivid shadows, and requires only 36 seconds for
editing. Code and dataset are available at

*Yuang Meng,Xin Jin,Lina Lei,Chun-Le Guo,Chongyi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UltraLED is a two-stage framework that reconstructs ultra-high dynamic range (UHDR) scenes from a single short-exposure RAW image, avoiding ghosting artifacts while recovering details in dark regions through exposure correction and brightness-aware denoising.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UHDR scenes with significant exposure disparities between bright and dark regions are challenging to capture, especially in dynamic scenes where RGB-based bracketing methods suffer from misalignment and ghosting artifacts. A single short-exposure RAW image can retain highlight details while offering better potential for recovering dark regions.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Exposure correction via ratio map to balance dynamic range, 2) Brightness-aware RAW denoiser to enhance detail recovery in dark regions. Uses only single short-exposure RAW frame as input. Created a 9-stop bracketing pipeline to synthesize realistic UHDR dataset.

Result: UltraLED significantly outperforms existing single-frame approaches in UHDR reconstruction. The method effectively avoids ghosting and motion blur artifacts, making it robust in dynamic scenes.

Conclusion: Single short-exposure RAW images are sufficient for UHDR reconstruction when processed through the proposed two-stage framework, eliminating the need for bracketing while maintaining robustness in dynamic scenes.

Abstract: Ultra-high dynamic range (UHDR) scenes exhibit significant exposure
disparities between bright and dark regions. Such conditions are commonly
encountered in nighttime scenes with light sources. Even with standard exposure
settings, a bimodal intensity distribution with boundary peaks often emerges,
making it difficult to preserve both highlight and shadow details
simultaneously. RGB-based bracketing methods can capture details at both ends
using short-long exposure pairs, but are susceptible to misalignment and
ghosting artifacts. We found that a short-exposure image already retains
sufficient highlight detail. The main challenge of UHDR reconstruction lies in
denoising and recovering information in dark regions. In comparison to the RGB
images, RAW images, thanks to their higher bit depth and more predictable noise
characteristics, offer greater potential for addressing this challenge. This
raises a key question: can we learn to see everything in UHDR scenes using only
a single short-exposure RAW image? In this study, we rely solely on a single
short-exposure frame, which inherently avoids ghosting and motion blur, making
it particularly robust in dynamic scenes. To achieve that, we introduce
UltraLED, a two-stage framework that performs exposure correction via a ratio
map to balance dynamic range, followed by a brightness-aware RAW denoiser to
enhance detail recovery in dark regions. To support this setting, we design a
9-stop bracketing pipeline to synthesize realistic UHDR images and contribute a
corresponding dataset based on diverse scenes, using only the shortest exposure
as input for reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that UltraLED
significantly outperforms existing single-frame approaches. Our code and
dataset are made publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework that combines low-framerate RGB videos with high-framerate event streams to reconstruct Dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting, using event motion priors to guide deformation field optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reconstructing Dynamic 3DGS from low-framerate RGB videos is challenging due to large inter-frame motions increasing uncertainty. Event cameras capture rapid visual changes robustly but lack color information. Combining both modalities can address the motion uncertainty problem.

Method: Uses event motion priors to guide deformation field optimization. First extracts motion priors from event streams using LoCM unsupervised fine-tuning. Then employs geometry-aware data association to build event-Gaussian motion correspondence, with motion decomposition and inter-frame pseudo-label strategies.

Result: Outperforms existing image and event-based approaches across synthetic and real scenes. Effectively optimizes dynamic 3DGS with event data assistance.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully combines RGB and event modalities to reconstruct Dynamic 3DGS, overcoming the challenges of large inter-frame motions and modality discrepancy through event-guided optimization.

Abstract: Reconstructing Dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) from low-framerate RGB
videos is challenging. This is because large inter-frame motions will increase
the uncertainty of the solution space. For example, one pixel in the first
frame might have more choices to reach the corresponding pixel in the second
frame. Event cameras can asynchronously capture rapid visual changes and are
robust to motion blur, but they do not provide color information. Intuitively,
the event stream can provide deterministic constraints for the inter-frame
large motion by the event trajectories. Hence, combining
low-temporal-resolution images with high-framerate event streams can address
this challenge. However, it is challenging to jointly optimize Dynamic 3DGS
using both RGB and event modalities due to the significant discrepancy between
these two data modalities. This paper introduces a novel framework that jointly
optimizes dynamic 3DGS from the two modalities. The key idea is to adopt event
motion priors to guide the optimization of the deformation fields. First, we
extract the motion priors encoded in event streams by using the proposed LoCM
unsupervised fine-tuning framework to adapt an event flow estimator to a
certain unseen scene. Then, we present the geometry-aware data association
method to build the event-Gaussian motion correspondence, which is the primary
foundation of the pipeline, accompanied by two useful strategies, namely motion
decomposition and inter-frame pseudo-label. Extensive experiments show that our
method outperforms existing image and event-based approaches across synthetic
and real scenes and prove that our method can effectively optimize dynamic 3DGS
with the help of event data.

Motivation: To improve brain tumor segmentation accuracy in MRI images and assist physicians in clinical decision-making by using XAI to enhance model interpretability and trust.

Method: Evaluated three deep learning models (UNet, ResUNet, AttUNet) on BraTS2020 dataset using Adam optimizer, with XAI techniques including Grad-CAM and attention-based visualization for model interpretability.

Result: ResUNet outperformed other models in final testing with superior Dice and Jaccard similarity scores, accuracy, recall, and F1 scores. XAI techniques provided visuospatial insights into model focus areas.

Conclusion: ResUNet is recommended as the best-performing model for automated brain tumor segmentation in future clinical assessments, with XAI successfully enhancing model interpretability and physician trust.

Abstract: The current study investigated the use of Explainable Artificial Intelligence
(XAI) to improve the accuracy of brain tumor segmentation in MRI images, with
the goal of assisting physicians in clinical decision-making. The study focused
on applying UNet models for brain tumor segmentation and using the XAI
techniques of Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and
attention-based visualization to enhance the understanding of these models.
Three deep learning models - UNet, Residual UNet (ResUNet), and Attention UNet
(AttUNet) - were evaluated to identify the best-performing model. XAI was
employed with the aims of clarifying model decisions and increasing physicians'
trust in these models. We compared the performance of two UNet variants
(ResUNet and AttUNet) with the conventional UNet in segmenting brain tumors
from the BraTS2020 public dataset and analyzed model predictions with Grad-CAM
and attention-based visualization. Using the latest computer hardware, we
trained and validated each model using the Adam optimizer and assessed their
performance with respect to: (i) training, validation, and inference times,
(ii) segmentation similarity coefficients and loss functions, and (iii)
classification performance. Notably, during the final testing phase, ResUNet

### [28] [GTR-Bench: Evaluating Geo-Temporal Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07791)
*Qinghongbing Xie,Zhaoyuan Xia,Feng Zhu,Lijun Gong,Ziyue Li,Rui Zhao,Long Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GTR-Bench is a novel benchmark for evaluating geographic temporal reasoning in VLMs, requiring multi-perspective reasoning across maps and videos in large camera networks. Current VLMs perform poorly (34.9% vs human 78.61%) due to imbalanced context utilization, weak temporal forecasting, and poor map-video alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing spatial-temporal benchmarks focus on either egocentric perspective reasoning with images/video or geographic perspective reasoning with graphics, but fail to assess VLMs' geographic spatial-temporal intelligence with both images/video and graphics context, which is important for applications like traffic management and emergency response.

Method: Introduces GTR-Bench, a benchmark for geographic temporal reasoning of moving targets in large-scale camera networks. It requires multiple perspective switches between maps and videos, joint reasoning across multiple videos with non-overlapping fields of view, and inference over unobserved spatial-temporal regions.

Result: Evaluation of 10+ popular VLMs shows even the best proprietary model (Gemini-2.5-Pro) achieves only 34.9% accuracy, significantly lagging behind human performance (78.61%). Three key deficiencies identified: imbalanced spatial-temporal context utilization, weak temporal forecasting, and poor map-video comprehension/alignment.

Conclusion: GTR-Bench reveals significant gaps in VLMs' geo-temporal reasoning capabilities and provides valuable insights for future research in spatial-temporal intelligence, opening new opportunities for applications requiring joint reasoning across visual and geographic contexts.

Abstract: Recently spatial-temporal intelligence of Visual-Language Models (VLMs) has
attracted much attention due to its importance for Autonomous Driving, Embodied
AI and General Artificial Intelligence. Existing spatial-temporal benchmarks
mainly focus on egocentric perspective reasoning with images/video context, or
geographic perspective reasoning with graphics context (eg. a map), thus fail
to assess VLMs' geographic spatial-temporal intelligence with both images/video
and graphics context, which is important for areas like traffic management and
emergency response. To address the gaps, we introduce Geo-Temporal Reasoning
benchmark (GTR-Bench), a novel challenge for geographic temporal reasoning of
moving targets in a large-scale camera network. GTR-Bench is more challenging
as it requires multiple perspective switches between maps and videos, joint
reasoning across multiple videos with non-overlapping fields of view, and
inference over spatial-temporal regions that are unobserved by any video
context. Evaluations of more than 10 popular VLMs on GTR-Bench demonstrate that
even the best proprietary model, Gemini-2.5-Pro (34.9%), significantly lags
behind human performance (78.61%) on geo-temporal reasoning. Moreover, our
comprehensive analysis on GTR-Bench reveals three primary deficiencies of
current models for geo-temporal reasoning. (1) VLMs' reasoning is impaired by
an imbalanced utilization of spatial-temporal context. (2) VLMs are weak in
temporal forecasting, which leads to worse performance on temporal-emphasized
tasks than on spatial-emphasized tasks. (3) VLMs lack the proficiency to
comprehend or align the map data with multi-view video inputs. We believe
GTR-Bench offers valuable insights and opens up new opportunities for research
and applications in spatial-temporal intelligence. Benchmark and code will be
released at https://github.com/X-Luffy/GTR-Bench.

### [29] [FMANet: A Novel Dual-Phase Optical Flow Approach with Fusion Motion Attention Network for Robust Micro-expression Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07810)
*Luu Tu Nguyen,Vu Tram Anh Khuong,Thi Bich Phuong Man,Thi Duyen Ngo,Thanh Ha Le*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes MM-COF, a comprehensive motion representation that integrates both onset-apex and apex-offset phases of micro-expressions, and FMANet, an end-to-end neural network that adaptively fuses motion cues from both phases for improved micro-expression recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current micro-expression recognition methods only use optical flow between onset and apex frames, missing important motion information in the apex-to-offset phase, which limits recognition performance.

Method: Introduces MM-COF motion representation combining both micro-expression phases, and FMANet neural network with learnable modules for dual-phase analysis, magnitude modulation, and adaptive fusion of motion cues.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on standard benchmarks (MMEW, SMIC, CASME-II, SAMM), demonstrating the effectiveness of the dual-phase framework.

Conclusion: The proposed learnable dual-phase framework with MM-COF representation and FMANet architecture significantly advances micro-expression recognition by capturing complete motion dynamics.

Abstract: Facial micro-expressions, characterized by their subtle and brief nature, are
valuable indicators of genuine emotions. Despite their significance in
psychology, security, and behavioral analysis, micro-expression recognition
remains challenging due to the difficulty of capturing subtle facial movements.
Optical flow has been widely employed as an input modality for this task due to
its effectiveness. However, most existing methods compute optical flow only
between the onset and apex frames, thereby overlooking essential motion
information in the apex-to-offset phase. To address this limitation, we first
introduce a comprehensive motion representation, termed Magnitude-Modulated
Combined Optical Flow (MM-COF), which integrates motion dynamics from both
micro-expression phases into a unified descriptor suitable for direct use in
recognition networks. Building upon this principle, we then propose FMANet, a
novel end-to-end neural network architecture that internalizes the dual-phase
analysis and magnitude modulation into learnable modules. This allows the
network to adaptively fuse motion cues and focus on salient facial regions for
classification. Experimental evaluations on the MMEW, SMIC, CASME-II, and SAMM
datasets, widely recognized as standard benchmarks, demonstrate that our
proposed MM-COF representation and FMANet outperforms existing methods,
underscoring the potential of a learnable, dual-phase framework in advancing
micro-expression recognition.

*Kanglin Ning,Ruzhao Chen,Penghong Wang,Xingtao Wang,Ruiqin Xiong,Xiaopeng Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel depth estimation framework for 360° indoor panoramas that leverages room geometry constraints through layout prediction and background segmentation to improve depth estimation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing depth estimation methods for 360° indoor panoramas focus on pixel-level accuracy but cause oversmoothed room corners and noise sensitivity, motivating the need for geometry-aware approaches.

Method: Uses a shared feature encoder with task-specific decoders for layout estimation, depth estimation, and background segmentation. Incorporates room geometry-based background depth resolving and background-segmentation-guided fusion strategies.

Result: Achieves significantly superior performance compared to current open-source methods on Stanford2D3D, Matterport3D and Structured3D datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively integrates room geometry constraints into depth estimation, overcoming limitations of pixel-level approaches and improving overall depth prediction quality.

Abstract: Predicting spherical pixel depth from monocular $360^{\circ}$ indoor
panoramas is critical for many vision applications. However, existing methods
focus on pixel-level accuracy, causing oversmoothed room corners and noise
sensitivity. In this paper, we propose a depth estimation framework based on
room geometry constraints, which extracts room geometry information through
layout prediction and integrates those information into the depth estimation
process through background segmentation mechanism. At the model level, our
framework comprises a shared feature encoder followed by task-specific decoders
for layout estimation, depth estimation, and background segmentation. The
shared encoder extracts multi-scale features, which are subsequently processed
by individual decoders to generate initial predictions: a depth map, a room
layout map, and a background segmentation map. Furthermore, our framework
incorporates two strategies: a room geometry-based background depth resolving
strategy and a background-segmentation-guided fusion mechanism. The proposed
room-geometry-based background depth resolving strategy leverages the room
layout and the depth decoder's output to generate the corresponding background
depth map. Then, a background-segmentation-guided fusion strategy derives
fusion weights for the background and coarse depth maps from the segmentation
decoder's predictions. Extensive experimental results on the Stanford2D3D,
Matterport3D and Structured3D datasets show that our proposed methods can
achieve significantly superior performance than current open-source methods.

### [31] [Enhancing Visual Prompting through Expanded Transformation Space and Overfitting Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07823)
*Shohei Enomoto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ACAVP is a new visual prompting method that combines affine, color, and additive transformations to overcome limitations of conventional VP methods, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional visual prompting methods suffer from limited expressivity due to simple additive transformations and tend to overfit when increasing parameters, resulting in lower accuracy compared to other adaptation approaches.

Method: Proposed ACAVP with three complementary transformations: affine transformation for task-specific prompt regions, color transformation for emphasizing relevant features, and additive transformation. Also introduced TrivialAugment as effective data augmentation to address overfitting.

Result: ACAVP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among VP methods, surpasses linear probing in average accuracy, and shows superior robustness to distribution shifts. TrivialAugment boosts existing VP methods by up to 12 percentage points on some datasets.

Conclusion: ACAVP effectively addresses expressivity and overfitting limitations in visual prompting through complementary transformations and proper data augmentation, achieving high performance while maintaining computational efficiency during inference.

Abstract: Visual prompting (VP) has emerged as a promising parameter-efficient
fine-tuning approach for adapting pre-trained vision models to downstream tasks
without modifying model parameters. Despite offering advantages like negligible
computational overhead and compatibility with black-box models, conventional VP
methods typically achieve lower accuracy than other adaptation approaches. Our
analysis reveals two critical limitations: the restricted expressivity of
simple additive transformation and a tendency toward overfitting when the
parameter count increases. To address these challenges, we propose ACAVP
(Affine, Color, and Additive Visual Prompting), which enhances VP's expressive
power by introducing complementary transformation operations: affine
transformation for creating task-specific prompt regions while preserving
original image information, and color transformation for emphasizing
task-relevant visual features. Additionally, we identify that overfitting is a
critical issue in VP training and introduce TrivialAugment as an effective data
augmentation, which not only benefits our approach but also significantly
improves existing VP methods, with performance gains of up to 12 percentage
points on certain datasets. This demonstrates that appropriate data
augmentation is universally beneficial for VP training. Extensive experiments
across twelve diverse image classification datasets with two different model
architectures demonstrate that ACAVP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among
VP methods, surpasses linear probing in average accuracy, and exhibits superior
robustness to distribution shifts, all while maintaining minimal computational
overhead during inference.

TL;DR: MMHOI is a large-scale dataset for multi-human multi-object interactions with complete 3D annotations, and MMHOI-Net is a transformer-based network that achieves state-of-the-art performance in modeling these complex interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D human-object interaction benchmarks only cover a fraction of complex real-world interactions where multiple humans interact with multiple objects in causal, goal-oriented, or cooperative ways.

Method: MMHOI-Net uses an end-to-end transformer-based neural network with a structured dual-patch representation for modeling objects and their interactions, combined with action recognition to enhance interaction prediction.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on MMHOI and CORE4D datasets, excelling in both accuracy and reconstruction quality for multi-human object interaction modeling.

Conclusion: MMHOI provides a comprehensive testbed for next-generation HOI research, and MMHOI-Net demonstrates effective modeling of complex multi-human multi-object interactions through its structured representation and action-aware framework.

Abstract: Real-world scenes often feature multiple humans interacting with multiple
objects in ways that are causal, goal-oriented, or cooperative. Yet existing 3D
human-object interaction (HOI) benchmarks consider only a fraction of these
complex interactions. To close this gap, we present MMHOI -- a large-scale,
Multi-human Multi-object Interaction dataset consisting of images from 12
everyday scenarios. MMHOI offers complete 3D shape and pose annotations for
every person and object, along with labels for 78 action categories and 14
interaction-specific body parts, providing a comprehensive testbed for
next-generation HOI research. Building on MMHOI, we present MMHOI-Net, an
end-to-end transformer-based neural network for jointly estimating human-object
3D geometries, their interactions, and associated actions. A key innovation in
our framework is a structured dual-patch representation for modeling objects
and their interactions, combined with action recognition to enhance the
interaction prediction. Experiments on MMHOI and the recently proposed CORE4D
datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in
multi-HOI modeling, excelling in both accuracy and reconstruction quality.

*Houqiang Zhong,Zhenglong Wu,Sihua Fu,Zihan Zheng,Xin Jin,Xiaoyun Zhang,Li Song,Qiang Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PrismGS is a regularization framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting that addresses aliasing artifacts in large urban environments through pyramidal multi-scale supervision and explicit size regularization, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 1.5 dB PSNR gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting suffers from severe aliasing artifacts and optimization instability when scaling to large urban environments, especially under high-resolution rendering, due to mismatch between Gaussian primitives and multi-scale urban geometry.

Method: Proposes two synergistic regularizers: 1) Pyramidal multi-scale supervision that enforces consistency against pre-filtered image pyramid, and 2) Explicit size regularization that imposes physically-grounded lower bounds on 3D Gaussian dimensions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with significant PSNR gains around 1.5 dB against CityGaussian, maintaining superior quality and robustness under 4K rendering on MatrixCity, Mill-19, and UrbanScene3D datasets.

Conclusion: PrismGS provides a plug-and-play framework that improves intrinsic rendering behavior of 3D Gaussians, effectively mitigating flickering textures and jagged edges while maintaining compatibility with existing pipelines.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently enabled real-time photorealistic
rendering in compact scenes, but scaling to large urban environments introduces
severe aliasing artifacts and optimization instability, especially under
high-resolution (e.g., 4K) rendering. These artifacts, manifesting as
flickering textures and jagged edges, arise from the mismatch between Gaussian
primitives and the multi-scale nature of urban geometry. While existing
``divide-and-conquer'' pipelines address scalability, they fail to resolve this
fidelity gap. In this paper, we propose PrismGS, a physically-grounded
regularization framework that improves the intrinsic rendering behavior of 3D
Gaussians. PrismGS integrates two synergistic regularizers. The first is
pyramidal multi-scale supervision, which enforces consistency by supervising
the rendering against a pre-filtered image pyramid. This compels the model to
learn an inherently anti-aliased representation that remains coherent across
different viewing scales, directly mitigating flickering textures. This is
complemented by an explicit size regularization that imposes a
physically-grounded lower bound on the dimensions of the 3D Gaussians. This
prevents the formation of degenerate, view-dependent primitives, leading to
more stable and plausible geometric surfaces and reducing jagged edges. Our
method is plug-and-play and compatible with existing pipelines. Extensive
experiments on MatrixCity, Mill-19, and UrbanScene3D demonstrate that PrismGS
achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding significant PSNR gains around
1.5 dB against CityGaussian, while maintaining its superior quality and
robustness under demanding 4K rendering.

TL;DR: IsoSignVid2Aud is an end-to-end framework that translates isolated sign language videos directly to speech without intermediate text, using I3D feature extraction and a novel NMS algorithm for temporal sign detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable direct communication between hearing/speech-challenged individuals and others by translating sign language videos to speech, avoiding the latency and errors of multi-stage systems that require text intermediate representations.

Method: Combines I3D-based feature extraction with specialized feature transformation and audio generation pipeline, utilizing a novel Non-Maximal Suppression (NMS) algorithm for temporal detection of signs in non-grammatic continuous sequences.

Result: Achieved competitive performance with Top-1 accuracies of 72.01% on ASL-Citizen-1500 and 78.67% on WLASL-100 datasets, with audio quality metrics (PESQ: 2.67, STOI: 0.73) indicating intelligible speech output.

Conclusion: The proposed end-to-end framework successfully translates isolated sign sequences directly to speech without text intermediate, providing immediate communication benefits with competitive accuracy and intelligible audio quality.

Abstract: Sign language to spoken language audio translation is important to connect
the hearing- and speech-challenged humans with others. We consider sign
language videos with isolated sign sequences rather than continuous grammatical
signing. Such videos are useful in educational applications and sign prompt
interfaces. Towards this, we propose IsoSignVid2Aud, a novel end-to-end
framework that translates sign language videos with a sequence of possibly
non-grammatic continuous signs to speech without requiring intermediate text
representation, providing immediate communication benefits while avoiding the
latency and cascading errors inherent in multi-stage translation systems. Our
approach combines an I3D-based feature extraction module with a specialized
feature transformation network and an audio generation pipeline, utilizing a
novel Non-Maximal Suppression (NMS) algorithm for the temporal detection of
signs in non-grammatic continuous sequences. Experimental results demonstrate
competitive performance on ASL-Citizen-1500 and WLASL-100 datasets with Top-1
accuracies of 72.01\% and 78.67\%, respectively, and audio quality metrics

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AlignGS is a novel framework that synergistically optimizes geometry and semantics for sparse-view 3D reconstruction, using semantic priors from 2D foundation models as geometric regularizers to achieve state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods treat semantics as passive features on potentially flawed geometry, but for robust sparse-view reconstruction, semantic understanding should actively guide the reconstruction process to overcome geometric ambiguity.

Method: AlignGS performs end-to-end optimization of geometry and semantics, distilling priors from 2D foundation models and using novel semantic-to-geometry guidance mechanisms including depth consistency and multi-faceted normal regularization.

Result: Extensive evaluations show state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis and superior geometric accuracy, producing more coherent and complete 3D models from limited input views.

Conclusion: Leveraging semantic priors as geometric regularizers effectively improves 3D reconstruction quality from sparse views, validating the approach of using semantics as an active guiding force rather than passive feature.

Abstract: The demand for semantically rich 3D models of indoor scenes is rapidly
growing, driven by applications in augmented reality, virtual reality, and
robotics. However, creating them from sparse views remains a challenge due to
geometric ambiguity. Existing methods often treat semantics as a passive
feature painted on an already-formed, and potentially flawed, geometry. We
posit that for robust sparse-view reconstruction, semantic understanding
instead be an active, guiding force. This paper introduces AlignGS, a novel
framework that actualizes this vision by pioneering a synergistic, end-to-end
optimization of geometry and semantics. Our method distills rich priors from 2D
foundation models and uses them to directly regularize the 3D representation
through a set of novel semantic-to-geometry guidance mechanisms, including
depth consistency and multi-faceted normal regularization. Extensive
evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results in novel view synthesis and produces reconstructions
with superior geometric accuracy. The results validate that leveraging semantic
priors as a geometric regularizer leads to more coherent and complete 3D models
from limited input views. Our code is avaliable at

Motivation: To address critical challenges in automated evaluation for high-throughput toxicity testing systems using machine learning models.

Method: Used self-supervised learning on the EmbryoNet dataset containing zebrafish embryo phenotypes from chemical compounds targeting different developmental processes.

Result: Learned representations effectively distinguished between modes-of-action of different compounds.

Conclusion: The approach provides a proof-of-concept for integrating machine learning models in physical toxicity testing devices, as demonstrated in the TOXBOX project.

Abstract: High-throughput toxicity testing offers a fast and cost-effective way to test
large amounts of compounds. A key component for such systems is the automated
evaluation via machine learning models. In this paper, we address critical
challenges in this domain and demonstrate how representations learned via
self-supervised learning can effectively identify toxicant-induced changes. We
provide a proof-of-concept that utilizes the publicly available EmbryoNet
dataset, which contains ten zebrafish embryo phenotypes elicited by various
chemical compounds targeting different processes in early embryonic
development. Our analysis shows that the learned representations using
self-supervised learning are suitable for effectively distinguishing between
the modes-of-action of different compounds. Finally, we discuss the integration
of machine learning models in a physical toxicity testing device in the context

TL;DR: XYZCylinder is a feedforward model that improves 3D scene reconstruction for driving scenes using a unified cylinder lifting method with camera modeling and feature lifting to address generalization and accuracy limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing feedforward reconstruction methods have limited generalization across different camera configurations and reduced accuracy due to sparse views and complex driving scenes.

Method: Proposes Unified Cylinder Camera Modeling (UCCM) for generalization and hybrid representation with Cylinder Plane Feature Group (CPFG) modules for feature lifting from 2D to 3D space.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance under different evaluation settings and demonstrates zero-shot generalization to other driving scenes.

Conclusion: XYZCylinder effectively addresses generalization and accuracy challenges in driving scene reconstruction through unified camera modeling and hybrid feature representation.

Abstract: Recently, more attention has been paid to feedforward reconstruction
paradigms, which mainly learn a fixed view transformation implicitly and
reconstruct the scene with a single representation. However, their
generalization capability and reconstruction accuracy are still limited while
reconstructing driving scenes, which results from two aspects: (1) The fixed
view transformation fails when the camera configuration changes, limiting the
generalization capability across different driving scenes equipped with
different camera configurations. (2) The small overlapping regions between
sparse views of the $360^\circ$ panorama and the complexity of driving scenes
increase the learning difficulty, reducing the reconstruction accuracy. To
handle these difficulties, we propose \textbf{XYZCylinder}, a feedforward model
based on a unified cylinder lifting method which involves camera modeling and
feature lifting. Specifically, to improve the generalization capability, we
design a Unified Cylinder Camera Modeling (UCCM) strategy, which avoids the
learning of viewpoint-dependent spatial correspondence and unifies different
camera configurations with adjustable parameters. To improve the reconstruction
accuracy, we propose a hybrid representation with several dedicated modules
based on newly designed Cylinder Plane Feature Group (CPFG) to lift 2D image
features to 3D space. Experimental results show that XYZCylinder achieves
state-of-the-art performance under different evaluation settings, and can be
generalized to other driving scenes in a zero-shot manner. Project page:

Motivation: Visual language models face heavy computational costs when processing videos due to high frame rates and long durations. Existing token compression methods cause information loss and performance degradation.

Method: Proposes MARC with retrieve-then-compress strategy: Visual Memory Retriever selects key clips, and Compression Group Relative Policy Optimization distills reasoning ability from teacher to student model.

Result: Achieves near-baseline accuracy using only one frame's tokens on six video benchmarks, reducing visual tokens by 95%, GPU memory by 72%, and latency by 23.9%.

Conclusion: MARC demonstrates potential for efficient, real-time video understanding in resource-constrained settings like video QA, surveillance, and autonomous driving.

Abstract: The rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) has laid the foundation
for multimodal models. However, visual language models (VLMs) still face heavy
computational costs when extended from images to videos due to high frame rates
and long durations. Token compression is a promising solution, yet most
existing training-free methods cause information loss and performance
degradation. To overcome this, we propose \textbf{Memory-Augmented
Reinforcement Learning-based Token Compression (MARC)}, which integrates
structured retrieval and RL-based distillation. MARC adopts a
\textit{retrieve-then-compress} strategy using a \textbf{Visual Memory
Retriever (VMR)} to select key clips and a \textbf{Compression Group Relative
Policy Optimization (C-GRPO)} framework to distil reasoning ability from a
teacher to a student model. Experiments on six video benchmarks show that MARC
achieves near-baseline accuracy using only one frame's tokens -- reducing
visual tokens by \textbf{95\%}, GPU memory by \textbf{72\%}, and latency by
\textbf{23.9\%}. This demonstrates its potential for efficient, real-time video
understanding in resource-constrained settings such as video QA, surveillance,

Result: Extensive experiments revealed limitations in current anomaly synthesis methods and provided actionable insights for future research directions.

Conclusion: ASBench serves as a comprehensive benchmarking tool that addresses critical gaps in anomaly synthesis evaluation and guides future development of more effective synthesis methods.

Abstract: Anomaly detection plays a pivotal role in manufacturing quality control, yet
its application is constrained by limited abnormal samples and high manual
annotation costs. While anomaly synthesis offers a promising solution, existing
studies predominantly treat anomaly synthesis as an auxiliary component within
anomaly detection frameworks, lacking systematic evaluation of anomaly
synthesis algorithms. Current research also overlook crucial factors specific
to anomaly synthesis, such as decoupling its impact from detection,
quantitative analysis of synthetic data and adaptability across different
scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose ASBench, the first
comprehensive benchmarking framework dedicated to evaluating anomaly synthesis
methods. Our framework introduces four critical evaluation dimensions: (i) the
generalization performance across different datasets and pipelines (ii) the
ratio of synthetic to real data (iii) the correlation between intrinsic metrics
of synthesis images and anomaly detection performance metrics , and (iv)
strategies for hybrid anomaly synthesis methods. Through extensive experiments,
ASBench not only reveals limitations in current anomaly synthesis methods but
also provides actionable insights for future research directions in anomaly

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video Foundation Models struggle with compositional scenarios like motion, numeracy, and spatial relations, needing better text-image alignment.

Method: Integrates and optimizes new parameters guided by layout-attention objective, uses streaming video generation with parametric memory mechanism for historical context management (insert, read, update, delete).

Result: TTOM disentangles compositional world knowledge with strong transferability and generalization, achieving effective cross-modal alignment for compositional video generation.

Conclusion: TTOM is an effective, practical, scalable, and efficient framework for compositional video generation that works on the fly without requiring training.

Abstract: Video Foundation Models (VFMs) exhibit remarkable visual generation
performance, but struggle in compositional scenarios (e.g., motion, numeracy,
and spatial relation). In this work, we introduce Test-Time Optimization and
Memorization (TTOM), a training-free framework that aligns VFM outputs with
spatiotemporal layouts during inference for better text-image alignment. Rather
than direct intervention to latents or attention per-sample in existing work,
we integrate and optimize new parameters guided by a general layout-attention
objective. Furthermore, we formulate video generation within a streaming
setting, and maintain historical optimization contexts with a parametric memory
mechanism that supports flexible operations, such as insert, read, update, and
delete. Notably, we found that TTOM disentangles compositional world knowledge,
showing powerful transferability and generalization. Experimental results on
the T2V-CompBench and Vbench benchmarks establish TTOM as an effective,
practical, scalable, and efficient framework to achieve cross-modal alignment
for compositional video generation on the fly.

Conclusion: The proposed model successfully generates high-quality multi-view videos with 4D reconstruction capabilities, enhancing scene understanding for autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Generative models have been widely applied to world modeling for environment
simulation and future state prediction. With advancements in autonomous
driving, there is a growing demand not only for high-fidelity video generation
under various controls, but also for producing diverse and meaningful
information such as depth estimation. To address this, we propose CVD-STORM, a
cross-view video diffusion model utilizing a spatial-temporal reconstruction
Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that generates long-term, multi-view videos with
4D reconstruction capabilities under various control inputs. Our approach first
fine-tunes the VAE with an auxiliary 4D reconstruction task, enhancing its
ability to encode 3D structures and temporal dynamics. Subsequently, we
integrate this VAE into the video diffusion process to significantly improve
generation quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves
substantial improvements in both FID and FVD metrics. Additionally, the
jointly-trained Gaussian Splatting Decoder effectively reconstructs dynamic
scenes, providing valuable geometric information for comprehensive scene
understanding.

Conclusion: AnimeText effectively addresses the gap in anime text detection and provides a robust dataset that enables better performance for text detection in anime scenes compared to existing datasets.

Abstract: Current text detection datasets primarily target natural or document scenes,
where text typically appear in regular font and shapes, monotonous colors, and

However, these characteristics differ significantly from anime scenes, where
text is often diverse in style, irregularly arranged, and easily confused with
complex visual elements such as symbols and decorative patterns. Text in anime
scene also includes a large number of handwritten and stylized fonts. Motivated
by this gap, we introduce AnimeText, a large-scale dataset containing 735K
images and 4.2M annotated text blocks. It features hierarchical annotations and
hard negative samples tailored for anime scenarios. %Cross-dataset evaluations
using state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that models trained on AnimeText
achieve superior performance in anime text detection tasks compared to existing
datasets. To evaluate the robustness of AnimeText in complex anime scenes, we
conducted cross-dataset benchmarking using state-of-the-art text detection

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SimCast is a novel precipitation nowcasting pipeline using short-to-long term knowledge distillation and weighted MSE loss, while CasCast integrates it with diffusion models for probabilistic forecasting, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precipitation nowcasting is crucial for disaster management, agriculture, transportation, and energy optimization. Existing non-autoregressive approaches have limitations, and the impact of prediction horizons on nowcasting models needs investigation.

Method: Proposed SimCast with short-to-long term knowledge distillation and weighted MSE loss to prioritize heavy rainfall regions. Then integrated SimCast into CasCast, a diffusion-based framework that combines deterministic predictions with probabilistic modeling.

Result: Achieved mean CSI scores of 0.452 on SEVIR, 0.474 on HKO-7, and 0.361 on MeteoNet, significantly outperforming existing approaches without additional inference overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses blurriness and distribution shift issues in deterministic nowcasting by combining knowledge distillation with diffusion models, delivering superior performance across multiple benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting predicts future radar sequences based on current
observations, which is a highly challenging task driven by the inherent
complexity of the Earth system. Accurate nowcasting is of utmost importance for
addressing various societal needs, including disaster management, agriculture,
transportation, and energy optimization. As a complementary to existing
non-autoregressive nowcasting approaches, we investigate the impact of
prediction horizons on nowcasting models and propose SimCast, a novel training
pipeline featuring a short-to-long term knowledge distillation technique
coupled with a weighted MSE loss to prioritize heavy rainfall regions. Improved
nowcasting predictions can be obtained without introducing additional overhead
during inference. As SimCast generates deterministic predictions, we further
integrate it into a diffusion-based framework named CasCast, leveraging the
strengths from probabilistic models to overcome limitations such as blurriness
and distribution shift in deterministic outputs. Extensive experimental results
on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed
framework, achieving mean CSI scores of 0.452 on SEVIR, 0.474 on HKO-7, and
0.361 on MeteoNet, which outperforms existing approaches by a significant
margin.

*Yidi Liu,Xueyang Fu,Jie Huang,Jie Xiao,Dong Li,Wenlong Zhang,Lei Bai,Zheng-Jun Zha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Latent Harmony is a two-stage VAE framework for UHD image restoration that balances computational efficiency with high-frequency detail retention through latent space regularization and high-frequency-aware reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UHD image restoration faces a trade-off between computational efficiency and high-frequency detail retention. Standard VAEs improve efficiency but discard degradation-specific high-frequency information due to Gaussian constraints, hurting reconstruction fidelity.

Method: Two-stage framework: Stage One introduces LH-VAE with visual semantic constraints, progressive degradation perturbations, and latent equivariance. Stage Two jointly trains the refined VAE with restoration model using High-Frequency Low-Rank Adaptation (HF-LoRA) - encoder LoRA with fidelity-oriented high-frequency alignment loss and decoder LoRA with perception-oriented loss, trained via alternating optimization.

Result: Latent Harmony achieves state-of-the-art performance across UHD and standard-resolution tasks, effectively balancing efficiency, perceptual quality, and reconstruction accuracy. A tunable parameter α enables flexible fidelity-perception trade-offs at inference.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully overcomes the limitations of standard VAEs for UHD restoration by jointly regularizing latent space and enforcing high-frequency-aware reconstruction, achieving superior performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Ultra-High Definition (UHD) image restoration faces a trade-off between
computational efficiency and high-frequency detail retention. While Variational
Autoencoders (VAEs) improve efficiency via latent-space processing, their
Gaussian constraint often discards degradation-specific high-frequency
information, hurting reconstruction fidelity. To overcome this, we propose
Latent Harmony, a two-stage framework that redefines VAEs for UHD restoration
by jointly regularizing the latent space and enforcing high-frequency-aware
reconstruction.In Stage One, we introduce LH-VAE, which enhances semantic
robustness through visual semantic constraints and progressive degradation
perturbations, while latent equivariance strengthens high-frequency
reconstruction.Stage Two jointly trains this refined VAE with a restoration
model using High-Frequency Low-Rank Adaptation (HF-LoRA): an encoder LoRA
guided by a fidelity-oriented high-frequency alignment loss to recover
authentic details, and a decoder LoRA driven by a perception-oriented loss to
synthesize realistic textures. Both LoRA modules are trained via alternating
optimization with selective gradient propagation to preserve the pretrained
latent structure.At inference, a tunable parameter {\alpha} enables flexible
fidelity-perception trade-offs.Experiments show Latent Harmony achieves
state-of-the-art performance across UHD and standard-resolution tasks,
effectively balancing efficiency, perceptual quality, and reconstruction
accuracy.

### [45] [The impact of abstract and object tags on image privacy classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07976)
*Darya Baranouskaya,Andrea Cavallaro*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Abstract tags are more effective than object tags for image privacy classification when tag budget is limited, but object tags become equally useful when more tags are available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine which type of tags (object vs abstract) is more suitable for the context-dependent and subjective task of image privacy classification.

Method: Explored the effectiveness of object tags (denoting concrete entities) versus abstract tags (capturing higher-level contextual information) for image privacy classification under different tag budget constraints.

Result: Abstract tags are more effective when tag budget is limited, while object-related information becomes as useful when a larger number of tags per image is available.

Conclusion: The findings provide guidance for developing more accurate image privacy classifiers by considering the role of tag types and quantity.

Abstract: Object tags denote concrete entities and are central to many computer vision
tasks, whereas abstract tags capture higher-level information, which is
relevant for tasks that require a contextual, potentially subjective scene
understanding. Object and abstract tags extracted from images also facilitate
interpretability. In this paper, we explore which type of tags is more suitable
for the context-dependent and inherently subjective task of image privacy.
While object tags are generally used for privacy classification, we show that
abstract tags are more effective when the tag budget is limited. Conversely,
when a larger number of tags per image is available, object-related information
is as useful. We believe that these findings will guide future research in
developing more accurate image privacy classifiers, informed by the role of tag
types and quantity.

### [46] [Is Architectural Complexity Always the Answer? A Case Study on SwinIR vs. an Efficient CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07984)
*Chandresh Sutariya,Nitin Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Lightweight CNN achieves near state-of-the-art performance (37.4 dB PSNR) for low-light image restoration, being 55x smaller and converging 13x faster than SwinIR Transformer (39.03 dB PSNR), offering better efficiency for resource-constrained applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the performance-efficiency trade-off in low-light image restoration, where large Transformers like SwinIR achieve high performance but have prohibitive computational costs for practical applications.

Method: Comparative analysis between state-of-the-art SwinIR Transformer and a standard lightweight CNN on low-light image restoration task, evaluating performance metrics and computational requirements.

Result: CNN achieved 37.4 dB PSNR vs SwinIR's 39.03 dB, but converged in only 10 epochs (vs 132 for SwinIR) and was 55x smaller in model size, making it much more efficient.

Conclusion: Standard CNNs provide near state-of-the-art performance with significantly lower computational overhead, making them compelling for real-world applications with resource constraints.

Abstract: The simultaneous restoration of high-frequency details and suppression of
severe noise in low-light imagery presents a significant and persistent
challenge in computer vision. While large-scale Transformer models like SwinIR
have set the state of the art in performance, their high computational cost can
be a barrier for practical applications. This paper investigates the critical
trade-off between performance and efficiency by comparing the state-of-the-art
SwinIR model against a standard, lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
on this challenging task. Our experimental results reveal a nuanced but
important finding. While the Transformer-based SwinIR model achieves a higher
peak performance, with a Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 39.03 dB, the
lightweight CNN delivers a surprisingly competitive PSNR of 37.4 dB. Crucially,
the CNN reached this performance after converging in only 10 epochs of
training, whereas the more complex SwinIR model required 132 epochs. This
efficiency is further underscored by the model's size; the CNN is over 55 times
smaller than SwinIR. This work demonstrates that a standard CNN can provide a
near state-of-the-art result with significantly lower computational overhead,
presenting a compelling case for its use in real-world scenarios where resource
constraints are a primary concern.

TL;DR: GraphEnet is a Graph Neural Network that uses event camera data for high-frequency 2D human pose estimation, leveraging sparse event data with line-based representation and novel offset vector learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event-based cameras offer low latency and energy efficiency advantages over RGB cameras, making them ideal for resource-constrained applications like portable electronics and mobile robots, but existing human pose estimation methods primarily use RGB data.

Method: Proposes GraphEnet - a Graph Neural Network that uses event camera output with intermediate line-based event representation, incorporating novel offset vector learning paradigm with confidence-based pooling for pose estimation.

Result: This is the first work to apply Graph Neural Networks to event data for Human Pose Estimation. The method achieves high-frequency 2D human pose estimation of a single person.

Conclusion: GraphEnet successfully demonstrates the feasibility of using Graph Neural Networks with event camera data for human pose estimation, providing an open-source solution for low-latency, energy-efficient pose estimation applications.

Abstract: Human Pose Estimation is a crucial module in human-machine interaction
applications and, especially since the rise in deep learning technology, robust
methods are available to consumers using RGB cameras and commercial GPUs. On
the other hand, event-based cameras have gained popularity in the vision
research community for their low latency and low energy advantages that make
them ideal for applications where those resources are constrained like portable
electronics and mobile robots. In this work we propose a Graph Neural Network,
GraphEnet, that leverages the sparse nature of event camera output, with an
intermediate line based event representation, to estimate 2D Human Pose of a
single person at a high frequency. The architecture incorporates a novel offset
vector learning paradigm with confidence based pooling to estimate the human
pose. This is the first work that applies Graph Neural Networks to event data

### [48] [CIR-CoT: Towards Interpretable Composed Image Retrieval via End-to-End Chain-of-Thought Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08003)
*Weihuang Lin,Yiwei Ma,Jiayi Ji,Xiaoshuai Sun,Rongrong Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CIR-CoT is a novel MLLM that integrates Chain-of-Thought reasoning for composed image retrieval, providing interpretable reasoning chains while achieving competitive performance across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CIR approaches using VLMs and MLLMs are opaque "black boxes" that prevent understanding of retrieval rationale and limit ability to follow complex instructions.

Method: Developed CIR-CoT with explicit CoT reasoning, created structured CoT annotations through three-stage process (caption, reasoning, conclusion), and fine-tuned model to generate structured output before encoding retrieval intent.

Result: Achieves highly competitive performance on in-domain datasets (FashionIQ, CIRR) and demonstrates remarkable generalization on out-of-domain CIRCO dataset.

Conclusion: Establishes a new path toward more effective and trustworthy retrieval systems by making decision processes transparent through interpretable reasoning chains.

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR), which aims to find a target image from a
reference image and a modification text, presents the core challenge of
performing unified reasoning across visual and semantic modalities. While
current approaches based on Vision-Language Models (VLMs, e.g., CLIP) and more
recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs, e.g., Qwen-VL) have shown
progress, they predominantly function as ``black boxes." This inherent opacity
not only prevents users from understanding the retrieval rationale but also
restricts the models' ability to follow complex, fine-grained instructions. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce CIR-CoT, the first end-to-end
retrieval-oriented MLLM designed to integrate explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning. By compelling the model to first generate an interpretable reasoning
chain, CIR-CoT enhances its ability to capture crucial cross-modal
interactions, leading to more accurate retrieval while making its decision
process transparent. Since existing datasets like FashionIQ and CIRR lack the
necessary reasoning data, a key contribution of our work is the creation of
structured CoT annotations using a three-stage process involving a caption,
reasoning, and conclusion. Our model is then fine-tuned to produce this
structured output before encoding its final retrieval intent into a dedicated
embedding. Comprehensive experiments show that CIR-CoT achieves highly
competitive performance on in-domain datasets (FashionIQ, CIRR) and
demonstrates remarkable generalization on the out-of-domain CIRCO dataset,
establishing a new path toward more effective and trustworthy retrieval
systems.

TL;DR: RayFusion is a ray-based fusion method that uses ray occupancy information from collaborators to improve depth estimation and reduce false positives in camera-based collaborative visual perception systems for autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Camera-based perception systems in autonomous driving struggle with accurate depth estimation due to the absence of explicit depth information, leading to ambiguity in 3D object detection.

Method: Proposes RayFusion, a ray-based fusion method that leverages ray occupancy information from collaborators to reduce redundancy and false positive predictions along camera rays.

Result: Comprehensive experiments show the method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models and substantially advances collaborative visual perception performance.

Conclusion: RayFusion effectively enhances detection performance of purely camera-based collaborative perception systems by addressing depth estimation ambiguity through ray-based fusion.

Abstract: Collaborative visual perception methods have gained widespread attention in
the autonomous driving community in recent years due to their ability to
address sensor limitation problems. However, the absence of explicit depth
information often makes it difficult for camera-based perception systems, e.g.,
3D object detection, to generate accurate predictions. To alleviate the
ambiguity in depth estimation, we propose RayFusion, a ray-based fusion method
for collaborative visual perception. Using ray occupancy information from
collaborators, RayFusion reduces redundancy and false positive predictions
along camera rays, enhancing the detection performance of purely camera-based
collaborative perception systems. Comprehensive experiments show that our
method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, substantially
advancing the performance of collaborative visual perception. The code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RASALoRE is a novel two-stage weakly supervised anomaly detection framework for brain MRI that uses discriminative dual prompt tuning and region-aware spatial attention with location-based random embeddings to achieve state-of-the-art performance with minimal parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of detecting brain anomalies in MRI scans when only weak slice-level labels are available instead of precise pixel-level annotations, which is common in clinical settings.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Discriminative Dual Prompt Tuning (DDPT) generates pseudo weak masks from slice-level labels; 2) Segmentation network with region-aware spatial attention using fixed location-based random embeddings to focus on anomalous regions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art anomaly detection performance on BraTS20, BraTS21, BraTS23, and MSD datasets, significantly outperforming existing WSAD methods while using less than 8 million parameters with reduced computational complexity.

Conclusion: RASALoRE provides an effective and efficient solution for weakly supervised anomaly detection in brain MRI, demonstrating substantial performance improvements with minimal computational requirements.

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Anomaly detection (WSAD) in brain MRI scans is an important
challenge useful to obtain quick and accurate detection of brain anomalies when
precise pixel-level anomaly annotations are unavailable and only weak labels
(e.g., slice-level) are available. In this work, we propose RASALoRE: Region
Aware Spatial Attention with Location-based Random Embeddings, a novel
two-stage WSAD framework. In the first stage, we introduce a Discriminative
Dual Prompt Tuning (DDPT) mechanism that generates high-quality pseudo weak
masks based on slice-level labels, serving as coarse localization cues. In the
second stage, we propose a segmentation network with a region-aware spatial
attention mechanism that relies on fixed location-based random embeddings. This
design enables the model to effectively focus on anomalous regions. Our
approach achieves state-of-the-art anomaly detection performance, significantly
outperforming existing WSAD methods while utilizing less than 8 million
parameters. Extensive evaluations on the BraTS20, BraTS21, BraTS23, and MSD
datasets demonstrate a substantial performance improvement coupled with a
significant reduction in computational complexity. Code is available at:

TL;DR: RetouchLLM is a training-free white-box image retouching system that performs interpretable, code-based retouching without requiring paired training data, enabling controllable adjustments through natural language interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning-based image retouching approaches require large-scale paired data, operate as black boxes, and lack adaptability for user- or image-specific adjustments.

Method: A training-free framework with two modules: a visual critic that identifies differences between input and reference images, and a code generator that produces executable codes for multi-step retouching similar to human workflow.

Result: The approach generalizes well across diverse retouching styles and enables interpretable and controllable adjustments through natural language-based user interaction.

Conclusion: RetouchLLM provides an effective white-box solution for image retouching that is interpretable, controllable, and adaptable to user preferences without requiring training data.

Abstract: Image retouching not only enhances visual quality but also serves as a means
of expressing personal preferences and emotions. However, existing
learning-based approaches require large-scale paired data and operate as black
boxes, making the retouching process opaque and limiting their adaptability to
handle diverse, user- or image-specific adjustments. In this work, we propose
RetouchLLM, a training-free white-box image retouching system, which requires
no training data and performs interpretable, code-based retouching directly on
high-resolution images. Our framework progressively enhances the image in a
manner similar to how humans perform multi-step retouching, allowing
exploration of diverse adjustment paths. It comprises of two main modules: a
visual critic that identifies differences between the input and reference
images, and a code generator that produces executable codes. Experiments
demonstrate that our approach generalizes well across diverse retouching
styles, while natural language-based user interaction enables interpretable and
controllable adjustments tailored to user intent.

*Giulio Weikmann,Gianmarco Perantoni,Lorenzo Bruzzone*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hierarchical ResNet architecture for multitemporal time series classification that uses class hierarchy and penalty maps to improve discrimination across different semantic levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve classification of time series multispectral images by leveraging class hierarchies and addressing limited training samples, while enabling better discrimination of both general and specific classes.

Method: Modified ResNet with additional branches for hierarchical classification, hierarchy-penalty maps to prevent incoherent transitions, and modular training where lower layers learn general classes and upper layers learn specific classes.

Result: Experimental results on Amazonian Forest Sentinel-2 data show effective generalization across hierarchical levels and accurate micro-class classification with better representation of minority classes.

Conclusion: The hierarchical approach successfully improves classification accuracy at detailed levels while maintaining generalization, with intrinsic adaptation capability through fine-tuning.

Abstract: This work presents a multitemporal class-driven hierarchical Residual Neural
Network (ResNet) designed for modelling the classification of Time Series (TS)
of multispectral images at different semantical class levels. The architecture
consists of a modification of the ResNet where we introduce additional branches
to perform the classification at the different hierarchy levels and leverage on
hierarchy-penalty maps to discourage incoherent hierarchical transitions within
the classification. In this way, we improve the discrimination capabilities of
classes at different levels of semantic details and train a modular
architecture that can be used as a backbone network for introducing new
specific classes and additional tasks considering limited training samples
available. We exploit the class-hierarchy labels to train efficiently the
different layers of the architecture, allowing the first layers to train faster
on the first levels of the hierarchy modeling general classes (i.e., the
macro-classes) and the intermediate classes, while using the last ones to
discriminate more specific classes (i.e., the micro-classes). In this way, the
targets are constrained in following the hierarchy defined, improving the
classification of classes at the most detailed level. The proposed modular
network has intrinsic adaptation capability that can be obtained through fine
tuning. The experimental results, obtained on two tiles of the Amazonian Forest
on 12 monthly composites of Sentinel 2 images acquired during 2019, demonstrate
the effectiveness of the hierarchical approach in both generalizing over
different hierarchical levels and learning discriminant features for an
accurate classification at the micro-class level on a new target area, with a
better representation of the minoritarian classes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deepfake detection benchmarks lack specificity, diversity, and real-world applicability, failing to address the growing threat of hyper-realistic synthetic media on social media platforms.

Method: Created RedFace dataset using 9 commercial online platforms to generate deepfakes, simulating real-world black-box scenarios with bespoke algorithms that capture diverse manipulation techniques used by actual deepfake creators.

Result: Extensive experiments (cross-domain, intra-domain, social network simulations) show limited practicality of existing deepfake detection schemes against real-world applications, with detailed analysis explaining performance gaps compared to conventional datasets.

Conclusion: RedFace bridges the gap between academic evaluations and real-world necessity by providing a realistic benchmark that better reflects current deepfake threats, highlighting the need for more robust detection methods.

Abstract: Deepfakes, leveraging advanced AIGC (Artificial Intelligence-Generated
Content) techniques, create hyper-realistic synthetic images and videos of
human faces, posing a significant threat to the authenticity of social media.
While this real-world threat is increasingly prevalent, existing academic
evaluations and benchmarks for detecting deepfake forgery often fall short to
achieve effective application for their lack of specificity, limited deepfake
diversity, restricted manipulation techniques.To address these limitations, we
introduce RedFace (Real-world-oriented Deepfake Face), a specialized facial
deepfake dataset, comprising over 60,000 forged images and 1,000 manipulated
videos derived from authentic facial features, to bridge the gap between
academic evaluations and real-world necessity. Unlike prior benchmarks, which
typically rely on academic methods to generate deepfakes, RedFace utilizes 9
commercial online platforms to integrate the latest deepfake technologies found
"in the wild", effectively simulating real-world black-box scenarios.Moreover,
RedFace's deepfakes are synthesized using bespoke algorithms, allowing it to
capture diverse and evolving methods used by real-world deepfake creators.
Extensive experimental results on RedFace (including cross-domain,
intra-domain, and real-world social network dissemination simulations) verify
the limited practicality of existing deepfake detection schemes against
real-world applications. We further perform a detailed analysis of the RedFace

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-generated videos like Sora have achieved near-perfect visual realism, creating an urgent need for reliable detection mechanisms to identify subtle anomalies that violate physical laws in high-dimensional spatiotemporal dynamics.

Method: Proposes Normalized Spatiotemporal Gradient (NSG) statistic that quantifies ratio of spatial probability gradients to temporal density changes. Uses pre-trained diffusion models for NSG estimation through spatial gradient approximation and motion-aware temporal modeling without complex motion decomposition. NSG-VD computes Maximum Mean Discrepancy between NSG features of test and real videos.

Result: Extensive experiments show NSG-VD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 16.00% in Recall and 10.75% in F1-Score. The method proves generated videos exhibit amplified discrepancies due to distributional shifts through derived upper bound of NSG feature distances.

Conclusion: NSG-VD provides an effective physics-driven approach for AI-generated video detection by capturing deviations from natural video dynamics through spatiotemporal gradient analysis, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: AI-generated videos have achieved near-perfect visual realism (e.g., Sora),
urgently necessitating reliable detection mechanisms. However, detecting such
videos faces significant challenges in modeling high-dimensional spatiotemporal
dynamics and identifying subtle anomalies that violate physical laws. In this
paper, we propose a physics-driven AI-generated video detection paradigm based
on probability flow conservation principles. Specifically, we propose a
statistic called Normalized Spatiotemporal Gradient (NSG), which quantifies the
ratio of spatial probability gradients to temporal density changes, explicitly
capturing deviations from natural video dynamics. Leveraging pre-trained
diffusion models, we develop an NSG estimator through spatial gradients
approximation and motion-aware temporal modeling without complex motion
decomposition while preserving physical constraints. Building on this, we
propose an NSG-based video detection method (NSG-VD) that computes the Maximum
Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between NSG features of the test and real videos as a
detection metric. Last, we derive an upper bound of NSG feature distances
between real and generated videos, proving that generated videos exhibit
amplified discrepancies due to distributional shifts. Extensive experiments
confirm that NSG-VD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 16.00% in Recall
and 10.75% in F1-Score, validating the superior performance of NSG-VD. The

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DarkHash is the first data-free backdoor attack against deep hashing models that doesn't require access to the training dataset, achieving high attack effectiveness while maintaining original retrieval accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing backdoor attacks on deep hashing models require access to training data, which is often prohibited in real-world scenarios due to privacy and intellectual property concerns. There's a need for data-free backdoor attacks that can work without training data access.

Method: Proposes DarkHash with a shadow backdoor attack framework using dual-semantic guidance. Fine-tunes only specific layers of victim models using surrogate datasets. Uses topological alignment loss to optimize both individual and neighboring poisoned samples toward target samples, enhancing attack capability.

Result: Experimental results on four image datasets, five model architectures, and two hashing methods show DarkHash outperforms state-of-the-art backdoor attack methods. It maintains original retrieval accuracy while achieving high attack effectiveness and can withstand existing mainstream backdoor defense methods.

Conclusion: DarkHash successfully demonstrates the feasibility of data-free backdoor attacks against deep hashing models, presenting a significant security threat that can bypass current defense mechanisms while preserving model utility.

Abstract: Benefiting from its superior feature learning capabilities and efficiency,
deep hashing has achieved remarkable success in large-scale image retrieval.
Recent studies have demonstrated the vulnerability of deep hashing models to
backdoor attacks. Although these studies have shown promising attack results,
they rely on access to the training dataset to implant the backdoor. In the
real world, obtaining such data (e.g., identity information) is often
prohibited due to privacy protection and intellectual property concerns.
Embedding backdoors into deep hashing models without access to the training
data, while maintaining retrieval accuracy for the original task, presents a
novel and challenging problem. In this paper, we propose DarkHash, the first
data-free backdoor attack against deep hashing. Specifically, we design a novel
shadow backdoor attack framework with dual-semantic guidance. It embeds
backdoor functionality and maintains original retrieval accuracy by fine-tuning
only specific layers of the victim model using a surrogate dataset. We consider
leveraging the relationship between individual samples and their neighbors to
enhance backdoor attacks during training. By designing a topological alignment
loss, we optimize both individual and neighboring poisoned samples toward the
target sample, further enhancing the attack capability. Experimental results on
four image datasets, five model architectures, and two hashing methods
demonstrate the high effectiveness of DarkHash, outperforming existing
state-of-the-art backdoor attack methods. Defense experiments show that
DarkHash can withstand existing mainstream backdoor defense methods.

TL;DR: A novel label refinement pipeline using 3D Gaussian Splatting to generate accurate face segmentation masks from noisy multiview predictions, enabling pose-diverse training data without ground-truth 3D annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face parsing under extreme viewing angles is challenging due to limited labeled data, and manual annotation is costly and impractical at scale.

Method: Jointly fit two 3DGS models - one for RGB images and one for initial segmentation maps - to enforce multiview consistency through shared geometry, synthesizing pose-diverse training data with minimal post-processing.

Result: Fine-tuning on the refined dataset significantly improves accuracy on challenging head poses while maintaining strong performance on standard views, achieving superior results compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The method provides a scalable and effective solution for improving face parsing robustness in real-world settings without requiring ground-truth 3D annotations and using only a small set of initial images.

Abstract: Accurate face parsing under extreme viewing angles remains a significant
challenge due to limited labeled data in such poses. Manual annotation is
costly and often impractical at scale. We propose a novel label refinement
pipeline that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to generate accurate
segmentation masks from noisy multiview predictions. By jointly fitting two
3DGS models, one to RGB images and one to their initial segmentation maps, our
method enforces multiview consistency through shared geometry, enabling the
synthesis of pose-diverse training data with only minimal post-processing.
Fine-tuning a face parsing model on this refined dataset significantly improves
accuracy on challenging head poses, while maintaining strong performance on
standard views. Extensive experiments, including human evaluations, demonstrate
that our approach achieves superior results compared to state-of-the-art
methods, despite requiring no ground-truth 3D annotations and using only a
small set of initial images. Our method offers a scalable and effective
solution for improving face parsing robustness in real-world settings.

*Eirik A. Østmo,Kristoffer K. Wickstrøm,Keyur Radiya,Michael C. Kampffmeyer,Karl Øyvind Mikalsen,Robert Jenssen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Random windowing, a CT-specific augmentation method that leverages Hounsfield Unit distributions to improve liver tumor segmentation, outperforming standard intensity augmentations that cause artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard image augmentations developed for natural images are unsuitable for CT scans as they disregard the physical meaning of Hounsfield Units, leading to artifacts and poor generalization in medical image segmentation.

Method: Developed Random windowing augmentation that exploits HU intensity distributions in CT images to encourage robustness to contrast-enhancement variations and poor imaging conditions.

Result: The proposed method significantly increases model performance on challenging images with poor contrast or timing, outperforming state-of-the-art alternatives in liver tumor segmentation across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: CT-specific augmentation methods like Random windowing are essential for achieving robust generalization in medical image analysis, as they respect the physical properties of CT imaging data.

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) is important for diagnosis and
treatment planning for various medical conditions. Deep learning (DL) based
segmentation models may enable automated medical image analysis for detecting
and delineating tumors in CT images, thereby reducing clinicians' workload.
Achieving generalization capabilities in limited data domains, such as
radiology, requires modern DL models to be trained with image augmentation.
However, naively applying augmentation methods developed for natural images to
CT scans often disregards the nature of the CT modality, where the intensities
measure Hounsfield Units (HU) and have important physical meaning. This paper
challenges the use of such intensity augmentations for CT imaging and shows
that they may lead to artifacts and poor generalization. To mitigate this, we
propose a CT-specific augmentation technique, called Random windowing, that
exploits the available HU distribution of intensities in CT images. Random
windowing encourages robustness to contrast-enhancement and significantly
increases model performance on challenging images with poor contrast or timing.
We perform ablations and analysis of our method on multiple datasets, and
compare to, and outperform, state-of-the-art alternatives, while focusing on
the challenge of liver tumor segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AR-Drag is a reinforcement learning-enhanced autoregressive video diffusion model for real-time image-to-video generation with motion control, achieving high visual quality and reduced latency using only 1.3B parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in real-time motion-controllable video generation, including latency issues with bidirectional diffusion models and limitations of existing AR approaches that suffer from quality degradation and motion artifacts.

Method: Fine-tune base image-to-video model for basic motion control, then enhance via RL with trajectory-based reward model. Uses Self-Rollout mechanism to preserve Markov property and selective stochasticity in denoising steps for training acceleration.

Result: Achieves high visual fidelity and precise motion alignment, significantly reduces latency compared to state-of-the-art motion-controllable video diffusion models while using only 1.3B parameters.

Conclusion: AR-Drag successfully enables real-time motion-controllable video generation with improved quality and reduced computational requirements, demonstrating effectiveness of RL enhancement in autoregressive video diffusion models.

Abstract: Real-time motion-controllable video generation remains challenging due to the
inherent latency of bidirectional diffusion models and the lack of effective
autoregressive (AR) approaches. Existing AR video diffusion models are limited
to simple control signals or text-to-video generation, and often suffer from
quality degradation and motion artifacts in few-step generation. To address
these challenges, we propose AR-Drag, the first RL-enhanced few-step AR video
diffusion model for real-time image-to-video generation with diverse motion
control. We first fine-tune a base I2V model to support basic motion control,
then further improve it via reinforcement learning with a trajectory-based
reward model. Our design preserves the Markov property through a Self-Rollout
mechanism and accelerates training by selectively introducing stochasticity in
denoising steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AR-Drag achieves high
visual fidelity and precise motion alignment, significantly reducing latency
compared with state-of-the-art motion-controllable VDMs, while using only 1.3B
parameters. Additional visualizations can be found on our project page:

*Chengzhi Li,Heyan Huang,Ping Jian,Zhen Yang,Yaning Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper analyzes self-contradiction in Video-LLMs and proposes TCAS method to enhance temporal logic consistency by improving cross-modal attention's temporal discriminability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models often generate self-contradictory outputs, which severely impacts reliability and hinders practical adoption. In Video-LLMs, this phenomenon is particularly problematic as models fail to provide logically consistent responses to rephrased questions based on their grounding outputs.

Method: Proposes Temporally Conditioned Attention Sharpening (TCAS) - an attention enhancement method that constructs an enhancement objective based on attention distinctions to enhance the model's temporal resolution capability and improve temporal understanding logic consistency.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that TCAS significantly enhances the temporal logic consistency of Video-LLMs. Interpretability analyses show improved temporal discriminability of attention heads. The method also achieves performance improvements in general video temporal grounding tasks.

Conclusion: Temporal logic consistency is a bottleneck in temporal understanding. By enhancing consistency through TCAS, the method drives significant progress in video temporal understanding, validating that improved temporal discriminability of attention heads addresses the self-contradiction problem.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate self-contradictory outputs, which
severely impacts their reliability and hinders their adoption in practical
applications. In video-language models (Video-LLMs), this phenomenon recently
draws the attention of researchers. Specifically, these models fail to provide
logically consistent responses to rephrased questions based on their grounding
outputs. However, the underlying causes of this phenomenon remain
underexplored. In this work, we adopt an interpretability-driven approach to
analyze, statistically summarize, and intervention the potential factors of the
phenomenon. We find that one of the primary reasons for the inconsistency in
responses lies in the inability of cross-modal attention heads to effectively
distinguish video tokens across different timestamps. To address this, we
propose an attention enhancement method called Temporally Conditioned Attention
Sharpening (TCAS), which constructs an enhancement objective based on attention
distinctions to enhance the model's temporal resolution capability, thereby
improving its temporal understanding logic consistency. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the temporal logic
consistency of Video-LLMs. Further interpretability analyses reveal that our
method indeed improves the temporal discriminability of attention heads,
validating our conclusions. Additionally, our method achieves performance
improvements in general video temporal grounding tasks, highlighting that
temporal logic consistency is a bottleneck in temporal understanding. By
enhancing consistency, our method drives significant progress in video temporal
understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniMMVSR is a unified generative video super-resolution framework that incorporates hybrid-modal conditions (text, images, videos) to enhance video fidelity, outperforming existing methods and enabling 4K video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cascaded video super-resolution methods are limited to text-to-video tasks and fail to leverage additional generative conditions beyond text, which are crucial for ensuring fidelity in multi-modal video generation.

Method: The framework explores condition injection strategies, training schemes, and data mixture techniques within a latent video diffusion model, with distinct data construction and condition utilization methods for different condition types.

Result: UniMMVSR significantly outperforms existing methods, producing videos with superior detail and higher conformity to multi-modal conditions, and enables multi-modal guided generation of 4K video when combined with a base model.

Conclusion: The proposed UniMMVSR framework successfully addresses the limitations of existing methods by incorporating hybrid-modal conditions, demonstrating superior performance and enabling previously unattainable 4K video generation capabilities.

Abstract: Cascaded video super-resolution has emerged as a promising technique for
decoupling the computational burden associated with generating high-resolution
videos using large foundation models. Existing studies, however, are largely
confined to text-to-video tasks and fail to leverage additional generative
conditions beyond text, which are crucial for ensuring fidelity in multi-modal
video generation. We address this limitation by presenting UniMMVSR, the first
unified generative video super-resolution framework to incorporate hybrid-modal
conditions, including text, images, and videos. We conduct a comprehensive
exploration of condition injection strategies, training schemes, and data
mixture techniques within a latent video diffusion model. A key challenge was
designing distinct data construction and condition utilization methods to
enable the model to precisely utilize all condition types, given their varied
correlations with the target video. Our experiments demonstrate that UniMMVSR
significantly outperforms existing methods, producing videos with superior
detail and a higher degree of conformity to multi-modal conditions. We also
validate the feasibility of combining UniMMVSR with a base model to achieve
multi-modal guided generation of 4K video, a feat previously unattainable with
existing techniques.

TL;DR: MURE is a multimodal reasoning framework for image editing that uses interleaved text-image chain-of-thought to improve spatial reasoning and fine-grained editing, achieving state-of-the-art results on editing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-based image editing methods struggle with complex object intersections and spatial relationships due to lack of explicit visual reasoning and fine-grained visual cues.

Method: Proposes MURE framework with multimodal interleaved text-image CoT reasoning, where textual descriptions are followed by visual cues like positional masks. Introduces Multimodal Deep Confidence (MMDC) to prune low-quality reasoning paths using reward model scores.

Result: Significant improvements across three image editing benchmarks. Created CoT-Edit-14K dataset with 14K high-quality editing examples.

Conclusion: Multimodal reasoning with interleaved text-image chains effectively addresses complex editing tasks by decomposing them into precise sub-tasks, yielding high-fidelity results.

Abstract: Image editing with natural language has gained significant popularity, yet
existing methods struggle with intricate object intersections and fine-grained
spatial relationships due to the lack of an explicit reasoning process. While
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has been explored to enhance reasoning, purely textual
CoT or CoT augmented with coordinate information is fundamentally limited in
its ability to represent intricate visual layouts and lacks the necessary
visual cues to guide the generation of fine-grained, pixel-level details. To
address these challenges, we propose Multimodal Reasoning Edit (MURE), a novel
framework that shifts the visual editing process from purely text-based
reasoning to a series of interleaved textual and visual rationales. Our
framework performs image editing using a natively multimodal, interleaved
text-image CoT. This approach generates a step-by-step chain of reasoning where
a textual description is followed by a corresponding visual cue, such as a
positional mask that defined intended edited regions or a representation of new
content. Furthermore, to mitigate the hallucination phenomenon of large
language models, we introduce Multimodal Deep Confidence (MMDC) reasoning
paradigm. This paradigm explores a tree of visual reasoning paths at each step.
By pruning low-quality branches using a deep confidence score from a reward
model, it ensures the model consistently follows a high-quality trajectory
towards the final edited result. The proposed method decomposes complex editing
tasks into interdependent sub-tasks, achieving greater precision at each stage
and yielding high-fidelity edited results. We define the formulation for
interleaved text-image chains and release the first CoT-Edit-14K dataset,
comprising 14K high-quality editing examples. Extensive experiments show that
our method yields significant improvements across three image editing
benchmarks.

*Johann Schmidt,Sebastian Stober*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a bootstrapping algorithm for fine-grained visual classification that iteratively re-aligns training samples to handle geometric biases without requiring aligned training data, outperforming equivariant and canonicalization methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-grained visual classification requires sensitivity to subtle visual cues while being robust to spatial transformations. Existing methods rely on heavy data augmentation or equivariant architectures, which have limitations in expressivity and cost. Canonicalization methods assume aligned training data, which real-world datasets don't fulfill.

Method: A bootstrapping algorithm that iteratively re-aligns training samples by progressively reducing variance and recovering the alignment assumption. The method works for arbitrary compact groups and has convergence guarantees under mild conditions.

Result: The method consistently outperforms equivariant and canonicalization baselines on four FGVC benchmarks, while performing on par with augmentation-based approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed bootstrapping approach effectively handles geometric biases in fine-grained visual classification without requiring aligned training data, offering a practical alternative to existing methods.

Abstract: Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) tasks, such as insect and bird
identification, demand sensitivity to subtle visual cues while remaining robust
to spatial transformations. A key challenge is handling geometric biases and
noise, such as different orientations and scales of objects. Existing remedies
rely on heavy data augmentation, which demands powerful models, or on
equivariant architectures, which constrain expressivity and add cost.
Canonicalization offers an alternative by shielding such biases from the
downstream model. In practice, such functions are often obtained using
canonicalization priors, which assume aligned training data. Unfortunately,
real-world datasets never fulfill this assumption, causing the obtained
canonicalizer to be brittle. We propose a bootstrapping algorithm that
iteratively re-aligns training samples by progressively reducing variance and
recovering the alignment assumption. We establish convergence guarantees under
mild conditions for arbitrary compact groups, and show on four FGVC benchmarks
that our method consistently outperforms equivariant, and canonicalization
baselines while performing on par with augmentation.

*Haoran Yu,Yi Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstructUDrag is a diffusion-based framework that combines text instructions with object dragging for simultaneous object relocation and text-based image editing, addressing limitations of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-based methods struggle with precise object positioning, while object dragging methods are limited to static relocation. The authors aim to combine both approaches for more flexible and precise image editing.

Method: The framework treats object dragging as image reconstruction with two synergistic branches: moving-reconstruction branch using energy-based gradient guidance for accurate object movement, and text-driven editing branch sharing gradient signals for consistent transformations. Uses DDPM inversion and prior information injection to preserve object structure.

Result: Extensive experiments show that InstructUDrag enables flexible, high-fidelity image editing with precision in object relocation and semantic control over image content.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully combines text instructions with object dragging, overcoming limitations of individual methods and providing both precise object positioning and semantic editing capabilities.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have shown great potential for image editing,
with techniques such as text-based and object-dragging methods emerging as key
approaches. However, each of these methods has inherent limitations: text-based
methods struggle with precise object positioning, while object dragging methods
are confined to static relocation. To address these issues, we propose
InstructUDrag, a diffusion-based framework that combines text instructions with
object dragging, enabling simultaneous object dragging and text-based image
editing. Our framework treats object dragging as an image reconstruction
process, divided into two synergistic branches. The moving-reconstruction
branch utilizes energy-based gradient guidance to move objects accurately,
refining cross-attention maps to enhance relocation precision. The text-driven
editing branch shares gradient signals with the reconstruction branch, ensuring
consistent transformations and allowing fine-grained control over object
attributes. We also employ DDPM inversion and inject prior information into
noise maps to preserve the structure of moved objects. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that InstructUDrag facilitates flexible, high-fidelity image
editing, offering both precision in object relocation and semantic control over
image content.

*Mu Li,Yin Wang,Zhiying Leng,Jiapeng Liu,Frederick W. B. Li,Xiaohui Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FineDual is a tri-stage method for dual-human motion generation that models dynamic hierarchical interactions from individual to inter-individual levels, outperforming existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods model human interaction temporally invariantly, ignoring the dynamic nature of motion changes with distance and the hierarchical structure from individual to inter-individual to overall motion.

Method: Three-stage approach: 1) Self-Learning Stage uses LLM to divide dual-human text into individual texts for text-motion alignment; 2) Adaptive Adjustment Stage predicts interaction distance and models interactions dynamically; 3) Teacher-Guided Refinement Stage uses overall text features to refine motion features.

Result: Extensive evaluations show FineDual outperforms existing approaches on dual-human motion datasets, generating fine-grained and high-quality motion.

Conclusion: FineDual effectively models dynamic hierarchical human interaction by addressing both distance dynamics and hierarchical structure in dual-human motion generation.

Abstract: Human interaction is inherently dynamic and hierarchical, where the dynamic
refers to the motion changes with distance, and the hierarchy is from
individual to inter-individual and ultimately to overall motion. Exploiting
these properties is vital for dual-human motion generation, while existing
methods almost model human interaction temporally invariantly, ignoring
distance and hierarchy. To address it, we propose a fine-grained dual-human
motion generation method, namely FineDual, a tri-stage method to model the
dynamic hierarchical interaction from individual to inter-individual. The first
stage, Self-Learning Stage, divides the dual-human overall text into individual
texts through a Large Language Model, aligning text features and motion
features at the individual level. The second stage, Adaptive Adjustment Stage,
predicts interaction distance by an interaction distance predictor, modeling
human interactions dynamically at the inter-individual level by an
interaction-aware graph network. The last stage, Teacher-Guided Refinement
Stage, utilizes overall text features as guidance to refine motion features at
the overall level, generating fine-grained and high-quality dual-human motion.
Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on dual-human motion
datasets demonstrate that our proposed FineDual outperforms existing
approaches, effectively modeling dynamic hierarchical human interaction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes AdaGC, a novel framework for single-positive multi-label learning in remote sensing imagery that uses adaptive gradient calibration to handle supervision ambiguity and label noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-label classification provides better semantic understanding of RS imagery but complete annotations are expensive. Single-positive multi-label learning is more scalable but introduces supervision ambiguity, with limited research in RS context.

Method: AdaGC uses gradient calibration mechanism combined with Mixup and dual EMA module for robust pseudo-label generation. Includes adaptive triggering of GC based on training dynamics after warm-up stage.

Result: Extensive experiments on two RS datasets under different label noise types show AdaGC achieves state-of-the-art performance with strong robustness across diverse settings.

Conclusion: AdaGC effectively bridges the gap in SPML research for RS imagery, providing a generalizable framework that handles supervision ambiguity and label noise while achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Multi-label classification (MLC) offers a more comprehensive semantic
understanding of Remote Sensing (RS) imagery compared to traditional
single-label classification (SLC). However, obtaining complete annotations for
MLC is particularly challenging due to the complexity and high cost of the
labeling process. As a practical alternative, single-positive multi-label
learning (SPML) has emerged, where each image is annotated with only one
relevant label, and the model is expected to recover the full set of labels.
While scalable, SPML introduces significant supervision ambiguity, demanding
specialized solutions for model training. Although various SPML methods have
been proposed in the computer vision domain, research in the RS context remains
limited. To bridge this gap, we propose Adaptive Gradient Calibration (AdaGC),
a novel and generalizable SPML framework tailored to RS imagery. AdaGC adopts a
gradient calibration (GC) mechanism combined with Mixup and a dual exponential
moving average (EMA) module for robust pseudo-label generation. To maximize
AdaGC's effectiveness, we introduce a simple yet theoretically grounded
indicator to adaptively trigger GC after an initial warm-up stage based on
training dynamics, thereby guaranteeing the effectiveness of GC in mitigating
overfitting to label noise. Extensive experiments on two benchmark RS datasets
under two distinct label noise types demonstrate that AdaGC achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance while maintaining strong robustness across
diverse settings.

*Haipeng Liu,Yang Wang,Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NTN-Diff is a frequency-aware diffusion model for text-guided image inpainting that decomposes semantics consistency across frequency bands and uses null-text denoising to preserve unmasked regions while achieving semantic alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods failed to simultaneously preserve unmasked regions and achieve semantic consistency between masked and unmasked areas due to entanglement of different frequency bands during denoising.

Method: Proposes null-text-null frequency-aware diffusion that divides denoising into early and late stages, disentangling mid-and-low frequency bands. Uses stable mid-frequency as guidance for null-text denoising of low-frequency in masked regions.

Result: Extensive experiments show NTN-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion models for text-guided image inpainting.

Conclusion: NTN-Diff successfully addresses both preservation of unmasked regions and semantic consistency across frequency bands through frequency-aware decomposition and staged denoising process.

Abstract: Text-guided image inpainting aims at reconstructing the masked regions as per
text prompts, where the longstanding challenges lie in the preservation for
unmasked regions, while achieving the semantics consistency between unmasked
and inpainted masked regions. Previous arts failed to address both of them,
always with either of them to be remedied. Such facts, as we observed, stem
from the entanglement of the hybrid (e.g., mid-and-low) frequency bands that
encode varied image properties, which exhibit different robustness to text
prompts during the denoising process. In this paper, we propose a
null-text-null frequency-aware diffusion models, dubbed \textbf{NTN-Diff}, for
text-guided image inpainting, by decomposing the semantics consistency across
masked and unmasked regions into the consistencies as per each frequency band,
while preserving the unmasked regions, to circumvent two challenges in a row.
Based on the diffusion process, we further divide the denoising process into
early (high-level noise) and late (low-level noise) stages, where the
mid-and-low frequency bands are disentangled during the denoising process. As
observed, the stable mid-frequency band is progressively denoised to be
semantically aligned during text-guided denoising process, which, meanwhile,
serves as the guidance to the null-text denoising process to denoise
low-frequency band for the masked regions, followed by a subsequent text-guided
denoising process at late stage, to achieve the semantics consistency for
mid-and-low frequency bands across masked and unmasked regions, while preserve
the unmasked regions. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of
NTN-Diff over the state-of-the-art diffusion models to text-guided diffusion
models. Our code can be accessed from https://github.com/htyjers/NTN-Diff.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior open-vocabulary object detection methods often fail in ambiguous scenarios with multiple candidate objects, requiring better integration of linguistic and embodied cues for robust referent identification.

Method: Proposes ERU framework with three key components: LLM-based data augmentation for training data, depth-map modality for spatial understanding, and depth-aware decision module for integrating linguistic and embodied cues.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing baselines on two datasets, achieving more accurate and reliable referent detection in complex or cluttered environments.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the challenges of embodied reference understanding by jointly leveraging multiple modalities and decision mechanisms for improved disambiguation performance.

Abstract: Embodied Reference Understanding requires identifying a target object in a
visual scene based on both language instructions and pointing cues. While prior
works have shown progress in open-vocabulary object detection, they often fail
in ambiguous scenarios where multiple candidate objects exist in the scene. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel ERU framework that jointly
leverages LLM-based data augmentation, depth-map modality, and a depth-aware
decision module. This design enables robust integration of linguistic and
embodied cues, improving disambiguation in complex or cluttered environments.
Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving more accurate and

Method: Proposes learning a neural field that predicts optimal exposure per 3D point, with joint optimization of scene representation and exposure field via neural conditioning, generalizing camera exposure selection to 3D space.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with over 55% improvement over best-performing baselines, trains faster than prior works, and enables accurate view synthesis in high dynamic range scenarios without post-processing.

Conclusion: NExF successfully addresses exposure variations in neural scene representations, providing robust 3D reconstruction and high-quality view synthesis for challenging real-world captures with significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Recent advances in neural scene representations have led to unprecedented
quality in 3D reconstruction and view synthesis. Despite achieving high-quality
results for common benchmarks with curated data, outputs often degrade for data
that contain per image variations such as strong exposure changes, present,
e.g., in most scenes with indoor and outdoor areas or rooms with windows. In
this paper, we introduce Neural Exposure Fields (NExF), a novel technique for
robustly reconstructing 3D scenes with high quality and 3D-consistent
appearance from challenging real-world captures. In the core, we propose to
learn a neural field predicting an optimal exposure value per 3D point,
enabling us to optimize exposure along with the neural scene representation.
While capture devices such as cameras select optimal exposure per image/pixel,
we generalize this concept and perform optimization in 3D instead. This enables
accurate view synthesis in high dynamic range scenarios, bypassing the need of
post-processing steps or multi-exposure captures. Our contributions include a
novel neural representation for exposure prediction, a system for joint
optimization of the scene representation and the exposure field via a novel
neural conditioning mechanism, and demonstrated superior performance on
challenging real-world data. We find that our approach trains faster than prior
works and produces state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks improving by
over 55% over best-performing baselines.

*Cilin Yan,Jingyun Wang,Guoliang Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes LTCA mechanism for Referring Video Segmentation that balances local and global temporal context through sparse local attention and global query interactions, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous RVOS methods fail to balance locality and globality in temporal context extraction, with computation complexity increasing significantly with video length.

Method: LTCA mechanism with: 1) Stacked sparse local attentions using dilated window attention across frames, 2) Random global key selection for enhanced globality, 3) Global query to interact with all other queries for direct global context encoding.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art on four referring video segmentation benchmarks, with 11.3% and 8.3% improvements on MeViS valu and val datasets respectively.

Conclusion: LTCA effectively balances local and global temporal context extraction while maintaining computational efficiency, significantly advancing RVOS performance.

Abstract: Referring Video Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment objects in videos given
linguistic expressions. The key to solving RVOS is to extract long-range
temporal context information from the interactions of expressions and videos to
depict the dynamic attributes of each object. Previous works either adopt
attention across all the frames or stack dense local attention to achieve a
global view of temporal context. However, they fail to strike a good balance
between locality and globality, and the computation complexity significantly
increases with the increase of video length. In this paper, we propose an
effective long-range temporal context attention (LTCA) mechanism to aggregate
global context information into object features. Specifically, we aggregate the
global context information from two aspects. Firstly, we stack sparse local
attentions to balance the locality and globality. We design a dilated window
attention across frames to aggregate local context information and perform such
attention in a stack of layers to enable a global view. Further, we enable each
query to attend to a small group of keys randomly selected from a global pool
to enhance the globality. Secondly, we design a global query to interact with
all the other queries to directly encode the global context information.
Experiments show our method achieves new state-of-the-art on four referring
video segmentation benchmarks. Notably, our method shows an improvement of
11.3% and 8.3% on the MeViS valu and val datasets respectively.

*Yu Huang,Zelin Peng,Changsong Wen,Xiaokang Yang,Wei Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework for 3D affordance segmentation that transfers semantic knowledge from 2D Vision Foundation Models to address challenges in 3D data like sparsity and ambiguity, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches rely on generic point cloud encoders that overlook 3D data challenges (sparsity, noise, geometric ambiguity), leading to features lacking clear functional boundaries for affordance segmentation.

Method: Proposes Cross-Modal Affinity Transfer (CMAT) pre-training to align 3D encoder with 2D semantics, optimizing reconstruction, affinity, and diversity. Then uses Cross-modal Affordance Segmentation Transformer (CAST) with multi-modal prompts and CMAT-pretrained features.

Result: Extensive experiments show the framework establishes new state-of-the-art results for 3D affordance segmentation on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: The semantic-grounded learning paradigm effectively bridges 2D semantic knowledge with 3D affordance segmentation, overcoming limitations of isolated 3D feature learning.

Abstract: Affordance segmentation aims to parse 3D objects into functionally distinct
parts, bridging recognition and interaction for applications in robotic
manipulation, embodied AI, and AR. While recent studies leverage visual or
textual prompts to guide this process, they often rely on point cloud encoders
as generic feature extractors, overlooking the intrinsic challenges of 3D data
such as sparsity, noise, and geometric ambiguity. As a result, 3D features
learned in isolation frequently lack clear and semantically consistent
functional boundaries. To address this bottleneck, we propose a
semantic-grounded learning paradigm that transfers rich semantic knowledge from
large-scale 2D Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) into the 3D domain.
Specifically, We introduce Cross-Modal Affinity Transfer (CMAT), a pre-training
strategy that aligns a 3D encoder with lifted 2D semantics and jointly
optimizes reconstruction, affinity, and diversity to yield semantically
organized representations. Building on this backbone, we further design the
Cross-modal Affordance Segmentation Transformer (CAST), which integrates
multi-modal prompts with CMAT-pretrained features to generate precise,
prompt-aware segmentation maps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks
demonstrate that our framework establishes new state-of-the-art results for 3D
affordance segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LinVideo is an efficient data-free post-training framework that replaces self-attention modules with linear attention in video diffusion models, achieving 1.25-2.00x speedup while preserving quality, with further acceleration through distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video diffusion models have high computation costs due to quadratic complexity of self-attention, and existing linear attention approaches require expensive pretraining and have limited expressiveness.

Method: Proposes selective transfer for automatic layer selection as binary classification, and anytime distribution matching (ADM) objective to align sample distributions across timesteps efficiently.

Result: Achieves 1.25-2.00x speedup while preserving generation quality, with 4-step distilled model delivering 15.92x latency reduction with minimal visual quality drop.

Conclusion: LinVideo provides an effective framework for efficient video generation by replacing quadratic attention with linear attention through automated layer selection and distribution matching.

Abstract: Video diffusion models (DMs) have enabled high-quality video synthesis.
However, their computation costs scale quadratically with sequence length
because self-attention has quadratic complexity. While linear attention lowers
the cost, fully replacing quadratic attention requires expensive pretraining
due to the limited expressiveness of linear attention and the complexity of
spatiotemporal modeling in video generation. In this paper, we present
LinVideo, an efficient data-free post-training framework that replaces a target
number of self-attention modules with linear attention while preserving the
original model's performance. First, we observe a significant disparity in the
replaceability of different layers. Instead of manual or heuristic choices, we
frame layer selection as a binary classification problem and propose selective
transfer, which automatically and progressively converts layers to linear
attention with minimal performance impact. Additionally, to overcome the
ineffectiveness and inefficiency of existing objectives for this transfer
process, we introduce an anytime distribution matching (ADM) objective that
aligns the distributions of samples across any timestep along the sampling
trajectory. This objective is efficient and recovers model performance.
Extensive experiments show that our method achieves a 1.25-2.00x speedup while
preserving generation quality, and our 4-step distilled model further delivers
a 15.92x latency reduction with minimal visual quality drop.

*Nikos Theodoridis,Tim Brophy,Reenu Mohandas,Ganesh Sistu,Fiachra Collins,Anthony Scanlan,Ciaran Eising*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DTPQA, a Visual Question Answering benchmark for traffic scene perception with distance annotations, and shows that small VLMs significantly underperform humans on perception tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop reliable perception systems for automated driving that handle both close and long-range objects, requiring benchmarks that isolate perception capabilities from reasoning.

Method: Created DTPQA benchmark with perception-only questions and distance annotations, then evaluated several state-of-the-art small VLMs on this dataset.

Result: Best-performing small VLM achieved ~60% accuracy vs ~85% human performance, with particular challenges in tasks like left-right distinction.

Conclusion: Current small VLMs have significant perception limitations for automated driving applications, especially in distance perception and spatial tasks.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are becoming increasingly powerful,
demonstrating strong performance on a variety of tasks that require both visual
and textual understanding. Their strong generalisation abilities make them a
promising component for automated driving systems, which must handle unexpected
corner cases. However, to be trusted in such safety-critical applications, a
model must first possess a reliable perception system. Moreover, since critical
objects and agents in traffic scenes are often at a distance, we require
systems that are not "shortsighted", i.e., systems with strong perception
capabilities at both close (up to 20 meters) and long (30+ meters) range. With
this in mind, we introduce Distance-Annotated Traffic Perception Question
Answering (DTPQA), the first Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark focused
solely on perception-based questions in traffic scenes, enriched with distance
annotations. By excluding questions that require reasoning, we ensure that
model performance reflects perception capabilities alone. Since automated
driving hardware has limited processing power and cannot support large VLMs,
our study centers on smaller VLMs. More specifically, we evaluate several
state-of-the-art (SOTA) small VLMs on DTPQA and show that, despite the
simplicity of the questions, these models significantly underperform compared
to humans (~60% average accuracy for the best-performing small VLM versus ~85%
human performance). However, it is important to note that the human sample size
was relatively small, which imposes statistical limitations. We also identify
specific perception tasks, such as distinguishing left from right, that remain
particularly challenging for these models.

Abstract: We introduce a simple and efficient method to enhance and clarify images.

TL;DR: A guided diffusion model with lightweight transformer and optimized training techniques for hyperspectral image data augmentation, achieving superior forest classification accuracy with limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address overfitting in deep learning methods when training with small labeled hyperspectral datasets, particularly for detailed land-cover classification tasks.

Method: Proposed data augmentation using guided diffusion model, lightweight transformer network, modified weighted loss function, and optimized cosine variance scheduler for efficient training on small datasets.

Result: Outperformed other data augmentation techniques in average and weighted average accuracy for forest classification with 10 different forest types using PRISMA satellite hyperspectral images.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses overfitting in small datasets and provides stable training behavior, overcoming practical limitations of deep generative models for data augmentation.

Abstract: The introduction of new generation hyperspectral satellite sensors, combined
with advancements in deep learning methodologies, has significantly enhanced
the ability to discriminate detailed land-cover classes at medium-large scales.
However, a significant challenge in deep learning methods is the risk of
overfitting when training networks with small labeled datasets. In this work,
we propose a data augmentation technique that leverages a guided diffusion
model. To effectively train the model with a limited number of labeled samples
and to capture complex patterns in the data, we implement a lightweight
transformer network. Additionally, we introduce a modified weighted loss
function and an optimized cosine variance scheduler, which facilitate fast and
effective training on small datasets. We evaluate the effectiveness of the
proposed method on a forest classification task with 10 different forest types
using hyperspectral images acquired by the PRISMA satellite. The results
demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other data augmentation
techniques in both average and weighted average accuracy. The effectiveness of
the method is further highlighted by the stable training behavior of the model,
which addresses a common limitation in the practical application of deep
generative models for data augmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unified multimodal models are largely limited to the image domain, creating a need to extend unified modeling capabilities to video generation and editing tasks.

Method: Dual-stream architecture with MLLM for instruction interpretation and MMDiT for video generation, trained jointly across multiple video tasks under a unified multimodal instruction paradigm.

Result: Matches or surpasses state-of-the-art task-specific baselines in text/image-to-video generation, in-context video generation and editing, and demonstrates task composition and generalization to unseen editing instructions.

Conclusion: UniVideo successfully extends unified multimodal modeling to video domain, enabling versatile video generation and editing with strong generalization capabilities and task composition.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models have shown promising results in multimodal content
generation and editing but remain largely limited to the image domain. In this
work, we present UniVideo, a versatile framework that extends unified modeling
to the video domain. UniVideo adopts a dual-stream design, combining a
Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) for instruction understanding with a
Multimodal DiT (MMDiT) for video generation. This design enables accurate
interpretation of complex multimodal instructions while preserving visual
consistency. Built on this architecture, UniVideo unifies diverse video
generation and editing tasks under a single multimodal instruction paradigm and
is jointly trained across them. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniVideo
matches or surpasses state-of-the-art task-specific baselines in
text/image-to-video generation, in-context video generation and in-context
video editing. Notably, the unified design of UniVideo enables two forms of
generalization. First, UniVideo supports task composition, such as combining
editing with style transfer, by integrating multiple capabilities within a
single instruction. Second, even without explicit training on free-form video
editing, UniVideo transfers its editing capability from large-scale image
editing data to this setting, handling unseen instructions such as
green-screening characters or changing materials within a video. Beyond these
core capabilities, UniVideo also supports visual-prompt-based video generation,
where the MLLM interprets visual prompts and guides the MMDiT during synthesis.
To foster future research, we will release our model and code.

Motivation: Historical map legends are crucial for interpretation but have inconsistent layouts and unstructured formats, making automatic extraction difficult. Existing methods focus mainly on segmentation or OCR without effectively matching symbols to descriptions.

Method: Combines LayoutLMv3 for layout detection with GPT-4o using in-context learning to detect and link legend items and descriptions via bounding box predictions. Uses structured JSON prompts for improved performance.

Conclusion: The approach enables scalable, layout-aware legend parsing and improves indexing and searchability of historical maps across various visual styles.

Abstract: Historical map legends are critical for interpreting cartographic symbols.
However, their inconsistent layouts and unstructured formats make automatic
extraction challenging. Prior work focuses primarily on segmentation or general
optical character recognition (OCR), with few methods effectively matching
legend symbols to their corresponding descriptions in a structured manner. We
present a method that combines LayoutLMv3 for layout detection with GPT-4o
using in-context learning to detect and link legend items and their
descriptions via bounding box predictions. Our experiments show that GPT-4 with
structured JSON prompts outperforms the baseline, achieving 88% F-1 and 85%

performance. This approach supports scalable, layout-aware legend parsing and

TL;DR: A curriculum-based framework called LFC for source-free domain adaptation that uses easy-to-hard and source-to-target curricula to progressively adapt models without accessing source data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address data privacy and security concerns in medical imaging by enabling domain adaptation without source data access, while improving learning procedure through progressive knowledge transfer.

Method: Proposes LFC framework with two curricula: easy-to-hard (starts with easy samples, gradually increases difficulty) and source-to-target (ensures smooth transition from source to target domain).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on public cross-domain datasets for fundus segmentation and polyp segmentation, surpassing existing approaches.

Conclusion: The curriculum-based approach effectively enables source-free domain adaptation for medical imaging tasks while maintaining data privacy and achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Recent studies have uncovered a new research line, namely source-free domain
adaptation, which adapts a model to target domains without using the source
data. Such a setting can address the concerns on data privacy and security
issues of medical images. However, current source-free domain adaptation
frameworks mainly focus on the pseudo label refinement for target data without
the consideration of learning procedure. Indeed, a progressive learning process
from source to target domain will benefit the knowledge transfer during model
adaptation. To this end, we propose a curriculum-based framework, namely
learning from curriculum (LFC), for source-free domain adaptation, which
consists of easy-to-hard and source-to-target curricula. Concretely, the former
curriculum enables the framework to start learning with `easy' samples and
gradually tune the optimization direction of model adaption by increasing the
sample difficulty. While, the latter can stablize the adaptation process, which
ensures smooth transfer of the model from the source domain to the target. We
evaluate the proposed source-free domain adaptation approach on the public
cross-domain datasets for fundus segmentation and polyp segmentation. The
extensive experimental results show that our framework surpasses the existing
approaches and achieves a new state-of-the-art.

TL;DR: VideoVerse is a new benchmark for evaluating Text-to-Video models' ability to understand temporal causality and world knowledge, addressing limitations of existing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing T2V benchmarks are insufficient because they can't differentiate state-of-the-art models, lack evaluation of event-level temporal causality, and don't systematically assess world knowledge needed for building world models.

Method: Collected diverse videos across multiple domains, extracted event-level descriptions with temporal causality, rewrote them into T2V prompts, designed binary evaluation questions across 10 dimensions, and developed a human-preference-aligned QA evaluation pipeline using vision-language models.

Result: Created VideoVerse with 300 curated prompts, 815 events, and 793 binary evaluation questions, enabling systematic evaluation of both open-source and closed-source T2V models.

Conclusion: VideoVerse provides comprehensive assessment of how far current T2V generators are from achieving world model capabilities, particularly in understanding complex temporal causality and world knowledge.

Abstract: The recent rapid advancement of Text-to-Video (T2V) generation technologies,
which are critical to build ``world models'', makes the existing benchmarks
increasingly insufficient to evaluate state-of-the-art T2V models. First,
current evaluation dimensions, such as per-frame aesthetic quality and temporal
consistency, are no longer able to differentiate state-of-the-art T2V models.
Second, event-level temporal causality, which not only distinguishes video from
other modalities but also constitutes a crucial component of world models, is
severely underexplored in existing benchmarks. Third, existing benchmarks lack
a systematic assessment of world knowledge, which are essential capabilities
for building world models. To address these issues, we introduce VideoVerse, a
comprehensive benchmark that focuses on evaluating whether a T2V model could
understand complex temporal causality and world knowledge in the real world. We
collect representative videos across diverse domains (e.g., natural landscapes,
sports, indoor scenes, science fiction, chemical and physical experiments) and
extract their event-level descriptions with inherent temporal causality, which
are then rewritten into text-to-video prompts by independent annotators. For
each prompt, we design a suite of binary evaluation questions from the
perspective of dynamic and static properties, with a total of ten carefully
defined evaluation dimensions. In total, our VideoVerse comprises 300 carefully
curated prompts, involving 815 events and 793 binary evaluation questions.
Consequently, a human preference aligned QA-based evaluation pipeline is
developed by using modern vision-language models. Finally, we perform a
systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source T2V
models on VideoVerse, providing in-depth analysis on how far the current T2V
generators are from world models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper scales continuous-time consistency distillation to large-scale image and video diffusion models, addressing infrastructure challenges and quality limitations through a novel score-regularized approach (rCM) that improves visual quality while maintaining diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend continuous-time consistency models (sCM) from academic-scale to large-scale text-to-image and video diffusion models, overcoming infrastructure challenges in Jacobian-vector product computation and addressing fundamental quality limitations in fine-detail generation.

Method: Developed a parallelism-compatible FlashAttention-2 JVP kernel for training on large models, and proposed score-regularized continuous-time consistency model (rCM) that incorporates score distillation as a long-skip regularizer to complement sCM with reverse divergence.

Result: rCM matches or surpasses state-of-the-art DMD2 on quality metrics while offering better diversity, enabling high-fidelity generation in 1-4 steps (15-50× speedup) on models up to 14B parameters and 5-second videos, without GAN tuning or extensive hyperparameter searches.

Conclusion: rCM provides a practical and theoretically grounded framework for advancing large-scale diffusion distillation, achieving significant acceleration while maintaining quality and diversity.

Abstract: This work represents the first effort to scale up continuous-time consistency
distillation to general application-level image and video diffusion models.
Although continuous-time consistency model (sCM) is theoretically principled
and empirically powerful for accelerating academic-scale diffusion, its
applicability to large-scale text-to-image and video tasks remains unclear due
to infrastructure challenges in Jacobian-vector product (JVP) computation and
the limitations of standard evaluation benchmarks. We first develop a
parallelism-compatible FlashAttention-2 JVP kernel, enabling sCM training on
models with over 10 billion parameters and high-dimensional video tasks. Our
investigation reveals fundamental quality limitations of sCM in fine-detail
generation, which we attribute to error accumulation and the "mode-covering"
nature of its forward-divergence objective. To remedy this, we propose the
score-regularized continuous-time consistency model (rCM), which incorporates
score distillation as a long-skip regularizer. This integration complements sCM
with the "mode-seeking" reverse divergence, effectively improving visual
quality while maintaining high generation diversity. Validated on large-scale
models (Cosmos-Predict2, Wan2.1) up to 14B parameters and 5-second videos, rCM
matches or surpasses the state-of-the-art distillation method DMD2 on quality
metrics while offering notable advantages in diversity, all without GAN tuning
or extensive hyperparameter searches. The distilled models generate
high-fidelity samples in only $1\sim4$ steps, accelerating diffusion sampling
by $15\times\sim50\times$. These results position rCM as a practical and
theoretically grounded framework for advancing large-scale diffusion
distillation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Gaze on the Prize introduces a learnable foveal attention mechanism for visual RL that uses return differences to guide attention toward task-relevant features, improving sample efficiency by up to 2.4x.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual RL agents waste resources on irrelevant pixels in high-dimensional image data, leading to sample-inefficient and unstable learning. Human visual foveation inspires a solution to focus only on task-relevant features.

Method: Uses return-guided contrastive learning with a learnable foveal attention mechanism. Groups similar visual representations into positives/negatives based on return differences, creating contrastive triplets that train attention to distinguish success/failure states.

Result: Achieves up to 2.4x improvement in sample efficiency and solves tasks that baseline methods fail to learn, demonstrated across manipulation tasks in ManiSkill3 benchmark without modifying underlying algorithm.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses visual RL inefficiency by using return differences to guide attention to task-relevant features, enabling more stable and sample-efficient learning.

Abstract: Visual Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents must learn to act based on
high-dimensional image data where only a small fraction of the pixels is
task-relevant. This forces agents to waste exploration and computational
resources on irrelevant features, leading to sample-inefficient and unstable
learning. To address this, inspired by human visual foveation, we introduce
Gaze on the Prize. This framework augments visual RL with a learnable foveal
attention mechanism (Gaze), guided by a self-supervised signal derived from the
agent's experience pursuing higher returns (the Prize). Our key insight is that
return differences reveal what matters most: If two similar representations
produce different outcomes, their distinguishing features are likely
task-relevant, and the gaze should focus on them accordingly. This is realized
through return-guided contrastive learning that trains the attention to
distinguish between the features relevant to success and failure. We group
similar visual representations into positives and negatives based on their
return differences and use the resulting labels to construct contrastive
triplets. These triplets provide the training signal that teaches the attention
mechanism to produce distinguishable representations for states associated with
different outcomes. Our method achieves up to 2.4x improvement in sample
efficiency and can solve tasks that the baseline fails to learn, demonstrated
across a suite of manipulation tasks from the ManiSkill3 benchmark, all without
modifying the underlying algorithm or hyperparameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a comprehensive spatial image processing framework that integrates multiple enhancement techniques and geometric feature extraction for improved computer vision applications.

Method: Uses grayscale quantization, color enhancement in RGB/YCrCb spaces, HSV brightness adjustment, convolution-based sharpening, bidirectional transformation pipelines, and geometric feature extraction with Canny edge detection, Hough transform, Harris corner detection, and morphological operations.

Result: Achieved 76.10% and 74.80% accuracy for forward/reverse transformation pipelines, 51.50° billiard cue alignment accuracy, and 81.87% similarity for cue isolation against ground truth images.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates robust and deterministic performance across diverse datasets, showing strong potential for real-time image analysis and computer vision applications.

Abstract: This study introduces a modular framework for spatial image processing,
integrating grayscale quantization, color and brightness enhancement, image
sharpening, bidirectional transformation pipelines, and geometric feature
extraction. A stepwise intensity transformation quantizes grayscale images into
eight discrete levels, producing a posterization effect that simplifies
representation while preserving structural detail. Color enhancement is
achieved via histogram equalization in both RGB and YCrCb color spaces, with
the latter improving contrast while maintaining chrominance fidelity.
Brightness adjustment is implemented through HSV value-channel manipulation,
and image sharpening is performed using a 3 * 3 convolution kernel to enhance
high-frequency details. A bidirectional transformation pipeline that integrates
unsharp masking, gamma correction, and noise amplification achieved accuracy
levels of 76.10% and 74.80% for the forward and reverse processes,
respectively. Geometric feature extraction employed Canny edge detection,
Hough-based line estimation (e.g., 51.50{\deg} for billiard cue alignment),
Harris corner detection, and morphological window localization. Cue isolation
further yielded 81.87\% similarity against ground truth images. Experimental
evaluation across diverse datasets demonstrates robust and deterministic
performance, highlighting its potential for real-time image analysis and

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video-STAR is a framework for open-vocabulary action recognition that decomposes actions into sub-motions and uses tool-augmented reinforcement learning to reduce cross-modal hallucination and improve fine-grained action distinction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs rely too heavily on text-centric priors, limiting their ability to distinguish semantically similar actions in open-vocabulary scenarios, leading to cross-modal hallucination issues.

Method: The approach decomposes actions into discriminative sub-motions for fine-grained matching, dynamically invokes domain-specific tools for cross-modal interleaving, and uses hierarchical reinforcement learning rewards that balance tool-usage efficiency, sub-motion relevance, and structural coherence.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on HMDB-51, UCF-101, SSv2, Kinetics-400, and Kinetics-600 datasets, with superior ability to distinguish fine-grained actions and handle cross-modal hallucination compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Video-STAR successfully enables category-specific reasoning capacity and reduces cross-modal hallucination by transitioning from text-centric reasoning to visually grounded inference through sub-motion decomposition and tool-augmented reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
potential in bridging visual and textual reasoning, yet their reliance on
text-centric priors often limits their ability to disentangle semantically
similar actions in open-vocabulary scenarios. To address this, we propose
Video-STAR, a framework that harmonizes contextual sub-motion decomposition
with tool-augmented reinforcement learning for open-vocabulary action
recognition (OVAR). Unlike prior methods that treat actions as monolithic
entities, our approach innovatively decomposes actions into discriminative
sub-motions for fine-grained matching while dynamically invoking
domain-specific tools for cross-modal interleaving, thereby enabling
category-specific reasoning capacity and reducing cross-modal hallucination.
Moreover, by designing a hierarchical reward that balances tool-usage
efficiency, sub-motion relevance, and structural coherence in reasoning, our
method autonomously leverages external tools to prioritize sub-motion patterns
without explicit supervision, transmitting from text-centric reasoning to
visually grounded inference. Extensive evaluations on HMDB-51, UCF-101, SSv2,
Kinetics-400, and Kinetics-600 datasets demonstrate our state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming existing methods in distinguishing fine-grained
actions and handling cross-modal hallucination, validating our excellent
robustness and generalization.

*Onur Keleş,Aslı Özyürek,Gerardo Ortega,Kadir Gökgö,Esam Ghaleb*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Visual Iconicity Challenge benchmark to evaluate vision-language models on sign language iconicity tasks, finding models perform below human baselines but show some sensitivity to visually grounded structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test vision-language models' ability to recover iconicity mappings from dynamic human motion in signed languages, using psycholinguistic measures as a natural testbed for visual grounding.

Method: Created a video-based benchmark with three tasks: phonological sign-form prediction, transparency inference, and graded iconicity ratings. Evaluated 13 state-of-the-art VLMs in zero- and few-shot settings on Sign Language of the Netherlands and compared to human baselines.

Result: VLMs recovered some handshape and location detail but remained below human performance on phonological form prediction; performed far from human baselines on transparency; only top models correlated moderately with human iconicity ratings. Models with better phonological prediction correlated better with human iconicity judgment.

Conclusion: The findings validate the diagnostic tasks and motivate human-centric signals and embodied learning methods for modeling iconicity and improving visual grounding in multimodal models.

Abstract: Iconicity, the resemblance between linguistic form and meaning, is pervasive
in signed languages, offering a natural testbed for visual grounding. For
vision-language models (VLMs), the challenge is to recover such essential
mappings from dynamic human motion rather than static context. We introduce the
\textit{Visual Iconicity Challenge}, a novel video-based benchmark that adapts
psycholinguistic measures to evaluate VLMs on three tasks: (i) phonological
sign-form prediction (e.g., handshape, location), (ii) transparency (inferring
meaning from visual form), and (iii) graded iconicity ratings. We assess $13$
state-of-the-art VLMs in zero- and few-shot settings on Sign Language of the
Netherlands and compare them to human baselines. On \textit{phonological form
prediction}, VLMs recover some handshape and location detail but remain below
human performance; on \textit{transparency}, they are far from human baselines;
and only top models correlate moderately with human \textit{iconicity ratings}.
Interestingly, \textit{models with stronger phonological form prediction
correlate better with human iconicity judgment}, indicating shared sensitivity
to visually grounded structure. Our findings validate these diagnostic tasks
and motivate human-centric signals and embodied learning methods for modelling
iconicity and improving visual grounding in multimodal models.

TL;DR: InstructX is a unified framework for image and video editing that integrates Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with diffusion models, enabling instruction-driven editing across diverse tasks with state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of in-depth analysis of MLLM design choices and the challenge of integrating MLLMs with diffusion models for difficult tasks like video editing, while leveraging the strong visual understanding capabilities of recent MLLMs.

Method: Comprehensive study on MLLM-diffusion model integration, showing that training on image data enables emergent video editing capabilities without explicit supervision, and incorporating modality-specific MLLM features to unify image and video editing in a single model.

Result: The method handles a broad range of image and video editing tasks and achieves state-of-the-art performance, with training on images leading to emergent video editing capabilities that alleviate video data scarcity constraints.

Conclusion: The proposed InstructX framework successfully unifies image and video editing through MLLM-diffusion model integration, demonstrating that image training enables video editing capabilities and that modality-specific features effectively bridge the gap between image and video tasks.

Abstract: With recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) showing
strong visual understanding and reasoning, interest is growing in using them to
improve the editing performance of diffusion models. Despite rapid progress,
most studies lack an in-depth analysis of MLLM design choices. Moreover, the
integration of MLLMs and diffusion models remains an open challenge in some
difficult tasks, such as video editing. In this paper, we present InstructX, a
unified framework for image and video editing. Specifically, we conduct a
comprehensive study on integrating MLLMs and diffusion models for
instruction-driven editing across diverse tasks. Building on this study, we
analyze the cooperation and distinction between images and videos in unified
modeling. (1) We show that training on image data can lead to emergent video
editing capabilities without explicit supervision, thereby alleviating the
constraints imposed by scarce video training data. (2) By incorporating
modality-specific MLLM features, our approach effectively unifies image and
video editing tasks within a single model. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method can handle a broad range of image and video editing tasks and
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: MoA-VR is a Mixture-of-Agents Video Restoration system that uses three coordinated agents (Degradation Identification, Routing/Restoration, Quality Assessment) to handle complex video degradations, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world videos suffer from complex degradations like noise, compression artifacts, and low-light distortions, but existing methods require manual model selection or use monolithic architectures that don't generalize well across different degradation types.

Method: Proposes a three-agent system: (1) VLM-driven degradation identifier using a new video degradation benchmark, (2) LLM-powered self-adaptive router that learns restoration strategies from tool patterns, (3) VLM-based video quality assessment model trained on a new Res-VQ dataset.

Result: Extensive experiments show MoA-VR effectively handles diverse and compound degradations, consistently outperforming existing baselines in both objective metrics and perceptual quality.

Conclusion: The system demonstrates the potential of integrating multimodal intelligence and modular reasoning for general-purpose video restoration, mimicking human professional reasoning processes.

Abstract: Real-world videos often suffer from complex degradations, such as noise,
compression artifacts, and low-light distortions, due to diverse acquisition
and transmission conditions. Existing restoration methods typically require
professional manual selection of specialized models or rely on monolithic
architectures that fail to generalize across varying degradations. Inspired by
expert experience, we propose MoA-VR, the first
\underline{M}ixture-\underline{o}f-\underline{A}gents \underline{V}ideo
\underline{R}estoration system that mimics the reasoning and processing
procedures of human professionals through three coordinated agents: Degradation
Identification, Routing and Restoration, and Restoration Quality Assessment.
Specifically, we construct a large-scale and high-resolution video degradation
recognition benchmark and build a vision-language model (VLM) driven
degradation identifier. We further introduce a self-adaptive router powered by
large language models (LLMs), which autonomously learns effective restoration
strategies by observing tool usage patterns. To assess intermediate and final
processed video quality, we construct the \underline{Res}tored
\underline{V}ideo \underline{Q}uality (Res-VQ) dataset and design a dedicated
VLM-based video quality assessment (VQA) model tailored for restoration tasks.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoA-VR effectively handles diverse and
compound degradations, consistently outperforming existing baselines in terms
of both objective metrics and perceptual quality. These results highlight the
potential of integrating multimodal intelligence and modular reasoning in
general-purpose video restoration systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies ViT attention sinks - high-norm visual tokens from Vision Transformers that contain important semantic information but are often overlooked in Large Vision Language Models. The authors propose methods to better leverage these tokens and show substantial improvements in visual reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While most research focuses on attention sinks within LLMs, this paper addresses the understudied problem of ViT attention sinks - high-norm visual tokens that contain crucial semantic information but are often ignored in LVLM architectures, limiting their reasoning capabilities.

Method: The authors conduct qualitative and quantitative analyses of ViT attention sinks, then propose both training-free and training-based approaches to better utilize these high-semantic tokens in LVLMs. They explicitly leverage these tokens to enhance visual reasoning.

Result: By explicitly utilizing ViT attention sink tokens, the paper demonstrates substantial improvements across various LVLMs and visual reasoning tasks, showing the untapped potential of these previously overlooked visual tokens.

Conclusion: ViT attention sinks contain valuable high-level semantic information that significantly enhances visual reasoning when properly utilized. Leveraging these tokens represents an important direction for improving LVLM performance and should be incorporated into future architectures.

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have recently emerged as powerful
architectures capable of understanding and reasoning over both visual and
textual information. These models typically rely on two key components: a
Vision Transformer (ViT) and a Large Language Model (LLM). ViT encodes visual
content into a sequence of image tokens and serves as the perceptual front-end
-- the eyes of the model. In contrast, the LLM interprets these tokens to
perform high-level reasoning, generates responses, and functions as the
cognitive core -- the brain of the model. However, it remains unclear which
visual tokens contribute most significantly to understanding and reasoning, and
how effectively these signals are propagated from ViT to the LLM. While most
existing works have focused on identifying attention sinks, low-semantic tokens
receiving disproportionately high attention, within the LLM, we shift the focus
to the vision encoder by identifying a class of high-norm visual tokens from
ViT, referred to as ViT attention sinks -- a problem that has been rarely
studied but is indeed very important for LVLMs. Our findings show that these
ViT sinks encapsulate high-level semantic concepts from images, allowing the
LLM to perform more effective understanding and reasoning. Despite their
importance, these sink tokens are often overlooked in existing LVLM
architectures. To explore their contribution, we present both qualitative and
quantitative analyses of the information embedded in these sink tokens. We also
propose both training-free and training-based approaches to better leverage how
this information is interpreted by the LLM, and to what extent. By explicitly
utilizing these tokens, we demonstrate substantial improvements across a range
of LVLMs and visual reasoning tasks, highlighting the untapped potential of ViT
attention sinks in enhancing visual reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep compression framework using semantic scene graphs achieves 98% data reduction for 3D point clouds while maintaining structural and semantic fidelity, supporting robotic applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient transmission of 3D point cloud data is critical for multi-agent robotic systems under bandwidth constraints, as large point clouds degrade performance.

Method: Decomposes point clouds into semantic patches, encodes them with FiLM-conditioned encoders, and reconstructs using a folding-based decoder guided by latent features and graph attributes.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art compression rates (up to 98% reduction) on SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets while preserving structural and semantic fidelity.

Conclusion: The framework enables efficient point cloud transmission and supports downstream robotic applications with performance comparable to raw LiDAR data.

Abstract: Efficient transmission of 3D point cloud data is critical for advanced
perception in centralized and decentralized multi-agent robotic systems,
especially nowadays with the growing reliance on edge and cloud-based
processing. However, the large and complex nature of point clouds creates
challenges under bandwidth constraints and intermittent connectivity, often
degrading system performance. We propose a deep compression framework based on
semantic scene graphs. The method decomposes point clouds into semantically
coherent patches and encodes them into compact latent representations with
semantic-aware encoders conditioned by Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM). A
folding-based decoder, guided by latent features and graph node attributes,
enables structurally accurate reconstruction. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI
and nuScenes datasets show that the framework achieves state-of-the-art
compression rates, reducing data size by up to 98% while preserving both
structural and semantic fidelity. In addition, it supports downstream
applications such as multi-robot pose graph optimization and map merging,
achieving trajectory accuracy and map alignment comparable to those obtained
with raw LiDAR scans.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fine-tuning small random subnetworks (slices) in pre-trained models is sufficient for downstream adaptation due to spectral balance and high task energy, leading to the Universal Winning Slice Hypothesis and the SliceFine PEFT method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a theoretical foundation for why parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) works by explaining the inherent redundancy in pre-trained models that allows effective adaptation with minimal parameter updates.

Method: Proposed SliceFine, a PEFT method that updates only selected slices of original weights without introducing new parameters, leveraging the universal winning slice property arising from spectral balance and high task energy in pre-trained networks.

Result: SliceFine matches state-of-the-art PEFT performance across language and vision tasks while significantly improving training speed, memory efficiency, and model compactness compared to adapter-based approaches.

Conclusion: The work bridges theory and practice by providing a theoretically grounded alternative to existing PEFT techniques, demonstrating that exploiting inherent model redundancy through slice-based fine-tuning is both effective and efficient.

Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical framework explaining why fine tuning small,
randomly selected subnetworks (slices) within pre trained models can be
sufficient for downstream adaptation. We prove that pretrained networks exhibit
a universal winning slice property arising from two phenomena: (1) spectral
balance the eigenspectra of different weight matrix slices are remarkably
similar; and (2) high task energy their backbone representations retain rich,
task relevant features. This leads to the Universal Winning Slice Hypothesis,
which provides a theoretical foundation for parameter efficient fine tuning
(PEFT) in large scale models. Inspired by this, we propose SliceFine, a PEFT
method that exploits this inherent redundancy by updating only selected slices
of the original weights introducing zero new parameters, unlike adapter-based
approaches. Empirically, SliceFine matches the performance of state of the art
PEFT methods across language and vision tasks, while significantly improving
training speed, memory efficiency, and model compactness. Our work bridges
theory and practice, offering a theoretically grounded alternative to existing
PEFT techniques.

Motivation: To enable precise and flexible trajectory control in video generation, supporting various applications like motion cloning, drag-based editing, and camera redirection with robust performance under unaligned conditions.

Method: Uses unified point-based motion representation with segmentation IDs, trajectory IDs, and optional color channels; employs efficient sequence-concatenation instead of token concatenation or ControlNet; implements annealing training strategy to reduce reliance on complete supervision.

Result: Achieves faster convergence, stronger controllability, and more efficient inference while maintaining robustness under unaligned conditions; enables multi-granularity, alignment-agnostic trajectory control.

Conclusion: FlexTraj successfully enables flexible point trajectory control for video generation with applications in motion cloning, drag-based editing, motion interpolation, camera redirection, action control, and mesh animations.

Abstract: We present FlexTraj, a framework for image-to-video generation with flexible
point trajectory control. FlexTraj introduces a unified point-based motion
representation that encodes each point with a segmentation ID, a temporally
consistent trajectory ID, and an optional color channel for appearance cues,
enabling both dense and sparse trajectory control. Instead of injecting
trajectory conditions into the video generator through token concatenation or
ControlNet, FlexTraj employs an efficient sequence-concatenation scheme that
achieves faster convergence, stronger controllability, and more efficient
inference, while maintaining robustness under unaligned conditions. To train
such a unified point trajectory-controlled video generator, FlexTraj adopts an
annealing training strategy that gradually reduces reliance on complete
supervision and aligned condition. Experimental results demonstrate that
FlexTraj enables multi-granularity, alignment-agnostic trajectory control for
video generation, supporting various applications such as motion cloning,
drag-based image-to-video, motion interpolation, camera redirection, flexible
action control and mesh animations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle with spatial reasoning due to learning it directly without establishing hierarchical foundations of perception and understanding.

Method: Three-stage progressive training: (1) spatial perception via object localization, (2) spatial understanding through multi-dimensional tasks, (3) complex reasoning via RL with verifiable rewards, using SpatialLadder-26k dataset.

Result: 23.4% average improvement over base model, surpassing GPT-4o by 20.8% and Gemini-2.0-Flash by 10.1%, with 7.2% improvement on out-of-domain benchmarks.

Conclusion: Progressive training from perception to reasoning is essential for robust spatial intelligence in VLMs.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning remains a fundamental challenge for Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), with current approaches struggling to achieve robust performance
despite recent advances. We identify that this limitation stems from a critical
gap: existing methods attempt to learn spatial reasoning directly without
establishing the hierarchical foundations of perception and understanding. To
address this challenge, we present a comprehensive methodology for building
spatial intelligence progressively. We introduce SpatialLadder-26k, a
multimodal dataset containing 26,610 samples spanning object localization,
single image, multi-view, and video spatial reasoning tasks, constructed
through a standardized pipeline that ensures systematic coverage across
modalities. Building on this dataset, we design a three-stage progressive
training framework that (1) establishes spatial perception through object
localization, (2) develops spatial understanding through multi-dimensional
spatial tasks, and (3) strengthens complex reasoning via reinforcement learning
with verifiable rewards. This approach yields SpatialLadder, a 3B-parameter
model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatial reasoning
benchmarks, with 23.4% average improvement over the base model, surpassing
GPT-4o by 20.8% and Gemini-2.0-Flash by 10.1%. Notably, SpatialLadder maintains
strong generalization with 7.2% improvement on out-of-domain benchmarks,
demonstrating that progressive training from perception to reasoning is
essential for robust spatial intelligence.

TL;DR: Kontinuous Kontext is an instruction-driven image editing model that adds fine-grained control over edit strength through a scalar input, enabling smooth transitions from no change to full edit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current instruction-based image editing lacks fine-grained control over edit extent, limiting users' ability to adjust how strongly edits are applied.

Method: Extends existing image editing model with a lightweight projector network that maps scalar edit strength and instruction to modulation coefficients, trained on synthesized quadruplet dataset.

Result: Enables unified fine-grained control over edit strength for diverse operations (stylization, attributes, materials, etc.) without attribute-specific training.

Conclusion: Kontinuous Kontext provides continuous control over edit strength in instruction-driven image editing, bridging the gap between no change and full edit realization.

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing offers a powerful and intuitive way to
manipulate images through natural language. Yet, relying solely on text
instructions limits fine-grained control over the extent of edits. We introduce
Kontinuous Kontext, an instruction-driven editing model that provides a new
dimension of control over edit strength, enabling users to adjust edits
gradually from no change to a fully realized result in a smooth and continuous
manner. Kontinuous Kontext extends a state-of-the-art image editing model to
accept an additional input, a scalar edit strength which is then paired with
the edit instruction, enabling explicit control over the extent of the edit. To
inject this scalar information, we train a lightweight projector network that
maps the input scalar and the edit instruction to coefficients in the model's
modulation space. For training our model, we synthesize a diverse dataset of
image-edit-instruction-strength quadruplets using existing generative models,
followed by a filtering stage to ensure quality and consistency. Kontinuous
Kontext provides a unified approach for fine-grained control over edit strength
for instruction driven editing from subtle to strong across diverse operations
such as stylization, attribute, material, background, and shape changes,
without requiring attribute-specific training.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the limitation of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in long-chain reflective reasoning by creating a benchmark (MM-HELIX), generating training data (MM-HELIX-100K), and proposing a novel training strategy (AHPO) that improves reasoning performance significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs show proficiency in reasoning tasks like mathematics and logic but lack capability in long-chain reflective reasoning, which is essential for solving complex real-world problems. This gap is underexplored and needs addressing.

Method: The authors create MM-HELIX benchmark with 1,260 samples of challenging tasks requiring iterative thinking. They generate MM-HELIX-100K dataset using Step-Elicited Response Generation and propose Adaptive Hybrid Policy Optimization (AHPO) that combines offline supervision and online optimization dynamically.

Result: The proposed method achieves +18.6% accuracy improvement on MM-HELIX benchmark and +5.7% average performance gain on general mathematical and logic tasks when applied to Qwen2.5-VL-7B baseline.

Conclusion: Reflective reasoning in MLLMs can be effectively learned and generalized, paving the way for developing more capable MLLMs capable of handling complex real-world problems.

Abstract: While current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
proficiency in reasoning tasks such as mathematics and logic, their capacity
for long-chain reflective reasoning, a prerequisite for solving complex
real-world problems, remains largely underexplored. In this work, we first
conduct an extensive empirical investigation to evaluate this capability.
Leveraging a carefully designed data synthesis engine, we construct MM-HELIX, a
multimodal benchmark consisting 1,260 samples of 42 challenging synthetic tasks
that require iterative thinking and backtracking. Empirical results on this
benchmark reveal that existing MLLMs exhibit significant performance deficits
in long-chain reflective reasoning. To address this limitation, we generate
post-training data and further explore learning paradigms for exploiting such
data. We first develop the Step-Elicited Response Generation pipeline to create
MM-HELIX-100K, a large-scale dataset of 100k high-quality, reflective reasoning
traces for instruction-tuning stage. Given that standard Reinforcement Learning
fails on complex tasks due to sparse reward signals and catastrophic forgetting
after Supervised Fine-Tuning, we propose Adaptive Hybrid Policy Optimization
(AHPO), a novel training strategy that dynamically unifies offline supervision
and online optimization into a single stage. This strategy enables the model to
learn from expert data when rewards are sparse and conduct independent
exploration once proficient. When applied to the Qwen2.5-VL-7B baseline, our
method achieves a +18.6\% accuracy improvement on MM-HELIX benchmark and
demonstrates strong generalization with a +5.7\% average performance gain on
general mathematic and logic tasks. Our work demonstrate that reflective
reasoning in MLLMs can be effectively learned and generalized, paving the way
for developing more capable MLLMs.

TL;DR: VideoNorms is a benchmark dataset for evaluating cultural awareness in Video Large Language Models, containing over 1000 video-norm pairs from US and Chinese cultures with socio-cultural norm annotations based on speech act theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As VideoLLMs are deployed globally, they need cultural understanding and grounding. Current benchmarks are inadequate for assessing cultural awareness in these models.

Method: Used human-AI collaboration framework: teacher model provides candidate annotations using theoretically-grounded prompting, and trained human experts validate and correct annotations. Built VideoNorms dataset with norm adherence/violation labels and verbal/non-verbal evidence.

Result: Benchmarking revealed: 1) models perform worse on norm violations than adherence; 2) worse performance on Chinese culture vs US; 3) difficulty providing non-verbal evidence vs verbal; 4) struggle with formal, non-humorous contexts unlike humans.

Conclusion: There is a critical need for culturally-grounded video language model training, which this benchmark and framework begin to address.

Abstract: As Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) are deployed globally, they
require understanding of and grounding in the relevant cultural background. To
properly assess these models' cultural awareness, adequate benchmarks are
needed. We introduce VideoNorms, a benchmark of over 1000 (video clip, norm)
pairs from US and Chinese cultures annotated with socio-cultural norms grounded
in speech act theory, norm adherence and violations labels, and verbal and
non-verbal evidence. To build VideoNorms, we use a human-AI collaboration
framework, where a teacher model using theoretically-grounded prompting
provides candidate annotations and a set of trained human experts validate and
correct the annotations. We benchmark a variety of open-weight VideoLLMs on the
new dataset which highlight several common trends: 1) models performs worse on
norm violation than adherence; 2) models perform worse w.r.t Chinese culture
compared to the US culture; 3) models have more difficulty in providing
non-verbal evidence compared to verbal for the norm adhere/violation label and
struggle to identify the exact norm corresponding to a speech-act; and 4)
unlike humans, models perform worse in formal, non-humorous contexts. Our
findings emphasize the need for culturally-grounded video language model
training - a gap our benchmark and framework begin to address.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods face a tradeoff between per-scene optimization (high fidelity but computationally expensive) and feed-forward foundation models (real-time but less accurate). ARTDECO aims to bridge this gap for practical on-the-fly 3D reconstruction.

Method: Uses 3D foundation models for pose estimation and point prediction, coupled with a Gaussian decoder that transforms multi-scale features into structured 3D Gaussians. Implements hierarchical Gaussian representation with LoD-aware rendering strategy.

Result: Experiments on eight diverse benchmarks show interactive performance comparable to SLAM, robustness similar to feed-forward systems, and reconstruction quality close to per-scene optimization.

Conclusion: ARTDECO provides a practical path toward on-the-fly digitization of real-world environments with both accurate geometry and high visual fidelity.

Abstract: On-the-fly 3D reconstruction from monocular image sequences is a
long-standing challenge in computer vision, critical for applications such as
real-to-sim, AR/VR, and robotics. Existing methods face a major tradeoff:
per-scene optimization yields high fidelity but is computationally expensive,
whereas feed-forward foundation models enable real-time inference but struggle
with accuracy and robustness. In this work, we propose ARTDECO, a unified
framework that combines the efficiency of feed-forward models with the
reliability of SLAM-based pipelines. ARTDECO uses 3D foundation models for pose
estimation and point prediction, coupled with a Gaussian decoder that
transforms multi-scale features into structured 3D Gaussians. To sustain both
fidelity and efficiency at scale, we design a hierarchical Gaussian
representation with a LoD-aware rendering strategy, which improves rendering
fidelity while reducing redundancy. Experiments on eight diverse indoor and
outdoor benchmarks show that ARTDECO delivers interactive performance
comparable to SLAM, robustness similar to feed-forward systems, and
reconstruction quality close to per-scene optimization, providing a practical
path toward on-the-fly digitization of real-world environments with both
accurate geometry and high visual fidelity. Explore more demos on our project

*Yunzhe Xu,Yiyuan Pan,Zhe Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Memoir introduces an imagination-guided memory retrieval system for vision-and-language navigation that uses a world model to imagine future states as queries, enabling selective retrieval of relevant environmental observations and behavioral patterns from hybrid viewpoint-level memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing memory-persistent VLN approaches lack effective memory access mechanisms, relying on entire memory incorporation or fixed-horizon lookup, and store only environmental observations while neglecting valuable navigation behavioral patterns that encode decision-making strategies.

Method: 1) Language-conditioned world model that imagines future states for encoding experiences and generating retrieval queries; 2) Hybrid Viewpoint-Level Memory storing both observations and behavioral patterns; 3) Experience-augmented navigation model with specialized encoders for retrieved knowledge integration.

Result: Significant improvements across 10 testing scenarios: 5.4% SPL gains on IR2R over best baseline, 8.3x training speedup, 74% inference memory reduction. Results show substantial headroom (73.3% vs 93.4% upper bound) for imagination-guided paradigm.

Conclusion: Predictive retrieval of both environmental and behavioral memories enables more effective navigation. The imagination-guided approach with hybrid memory representation proves highly effective for memory-persistent VLN tasks.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires agents to follow natural
language instructions through environments, with memory-persistent variants
demanding progressive improvement through accumulated experience. Existing
approaches for memory-persistent VLN face critical limitations: they lack
effective memory access mechanisms, instead relying on entire memory
incorporation or fixed-horizon lookup, and predominantly store only
environmental observations while neglecting navigation behavioral patterns that
encode valuable decision-making strategies. We present Memoir, which employs
imagination as a retrieval mechanism grounded by explicit memory: a world model
imagines future navigation states as queries to selectively retrieve relevant
environmental observations and behavioral histories. The approach comprises: 1)
a language-conditioned world model that imagines future states serving dual
purposes: encoding experiences for storage and generating retrieval queries; 2)
Hybrid Viewpoint-Level Memory that anchors both observations and behavioral
patterns to viewpoints, enabling hybrid retrieval; and 3) an
experience-augmented navigation model that integrates retrieved knowledge
through specialized encoders. Extensive evaluation across diverse
memory-persistent VLN benchmarks with 10 distinctive testing scenarios
demonstrates Memoir's effectiveness: significant improvements across all
scenarios, with 5.4% SPL gains on IR2R over the best memory-persistent
baseline, accompanied by 8.3x training speedup and 74% inference memory
reduction. The results validate that predictive retrieval of both environmental
and behavioral memories enables more effective navigation, with analysis
indicating substantial headroom (73.3% vs 93.4% upper bound) for this
imagination-guided paradigm. Code at https://github.com/xyz9911/Memoir.

### [96] [VideoCanvas: Unified Video Completion from Arbitrary Spatiotemporal Patches via In-Context Conditioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08555)
*Minghong Cai,Qiulin Wang,Zongli Ye,Wenze Liu,Quande Liu,Weicai Ye,Xintao Wang,Pengfei Wan,Kun Gai,Xiangyu Yue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoCanvas enables arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion by allowing users to place patches anywhere in space and time, unifying various video generation tasks under a single framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified framework for controllable video generation that can handle arbitrary spatio-temporal conditioning, overcoming the temporal ambiguity caused by causal VAEs in modern latent video diffusion models.

Method: Uses a hybrid conditioning strategy with zero-padding for spatial control and Temporal RoPE Interpolation for temporal alignment, adapting In-Context Conditioning (ICC) with zero new parameters to resolve VAE temporal ambiguity.

Result: VideoCanvas significantly outperforms existing conditioning paradigms and establishes state-of-the-art performance in flexible video generation, as demonstrated on the new VideoCanvasBench benchmark.

Conclusion: VideoCanvas successfully enables pixel-frame-aware control on frozen backbones, providing a unified solution for arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion tasks.

Abstract: We introduce the task of arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion, where a
video is generated from arbitrary, user-specified patches placed at any spatial
location and timestamp, akin to painting on a video canvas. This flexible
formulation naturally unifies many existing controllable video generation
tasks--including first-frame image-to-video, inpainting, extension, and
interpolation--under a single, cohesive paradigm. Realizing this vision,
however, faces a fundamental obstacle in modern latent video diffusion models:
the temporal ambiguity introduced by causal VAEs, where multiple pixel frames
are compressed into a single latent representation, making precise frame-level
conditioning structurally difficult. We address this challenge with
VideoCanvas, a novel framework that adapts the In-Context Conditioning (ICC)
paradigm to this fine-grained control task with zero new parameters. We propose
a hybrid conditioning strategy that decouples spatial and temporal control:
spatial placement is handled via zero-padding, while temporal alignment is
achieved through Temporal RoPE Interpolation, which assigns each condition a
continuous fractional position within the latent sequence. This resolves the
VAE's temporal ambiguity and enables pixel-frame-aware control on a frozen
backbone. To evaluate this new capability, we develop VideoCanvasBench, the
first benchmark for arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion, covering both
intra-scene fidelity and inter-scene creativity. Experiments demonstrate that
VideoCanvas significantly outperforms existing conditioning paradigms,
establishing a new state of the art in flexible and unified video generation.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress across
various capabilities; however, complex video reasoning in the scientific domain
remains a significant and challenging frontier. Current video benchmarks

### [98] [MultiCOIN: Multi-Modal COntrollable Video INbetweening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08561)
*Maham Tanveer,Yang Zhou,Simon Niklaus,Ali Mahdavi Amiri,Hao Zhang,Krishna Kumar Singh,Nanxuan Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A video inbetweening framework that enables multi-modal controls (depth, motion trajectories, text prompts, region targeting) for precise video interpolation using Diffusion Transformers with separate motion and content generators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video inbetweening methods cannot handle large/complex motions, lack user intent versatility, and provide insufficient fine control over intermediate frames, limiting creative alignment.

Method: Uses Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture with motion controls mapped to sparse point-based representation. Separates content and motion controls into two branches with stage-wise training for multi-modal control learning.

Result: Enables dynamic, customizable, and contextually accurate visual narratives through multi-modal controls, achieving better flexibility and precision in video interpolation.

Conclusion: Multi-modal controls in video inbetweening provide superior creative control and alignment with user intent compared to existing methods, making the framework more versatile and precise.

Abstract: Video inbetweening creates smooth and natural transitions between two image
frames, making it an indispensable tool for video editing and long-form video
synthesis. Existing works in this domain are unable to generate large, complex,
or intricate motions. In particular, they cannot accommodate the versatility of
user intents and generally lack fine control over the details of intermediate
frames, leading to misalignment with the creative mind. To fill these gaps, we
introduce \modelname{}, a video inbetweening framework that allows multi-modal
controls, including depth transition and layering, motion trajectories, text
prompts, and target regions for movement localization, while achieving a
balance between flexibility, ease of use, and precision for fine-grained video
interpolation. To achieve this, we adopt the Diffusion Transformer (DiT)
architecture as our video generative model, due to its proven capability to
generate high-quality long videos. To ensure compatibility between DiT and our
multi-modal controls, we map all motion controls into a common sparse and
user-friendly point-based representation as the video/noise input. Further, to
respect the variety of controls which operate at varying levels of granularity
and influence, we separate content controls and motion controls into two
branches to encode the required features before guiding the denoising process,
resulting in two generators, one for motion and the other for content. Finally,
we propose a stage-wise training strategy to ensure that our model learns the
multi-modal controls smoothly. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments demonstrate that multi-modal controls enable a more dynamic,
customizable, and contextually accurate visual narrative.

*Zhiyu Zheng,Shaoyu Chen,Haoran Yin,Xinbang Zhang,Jialv Zou,Xinggang Wang,Qian Zhang,Lefei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ResAD addresses spatio-temporal imbalance in E2E autonomous driving by predicting residual deviations from inertial references rather than direct trajectories, using point-wise normalization to balance optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: E2EAD systems suffer from spatio-temporal data imbalance that causes models to learn spurious correlations and prioritize uncertain distant predictions over immediate safety.

Method: Normalized Residual Trajectory Modeling framework that predicts residual deviations from deterministic inertial references, with point-wise normalization to re-weight optimization objectives.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art PDMS of 88.6 on NAVSIM benchmark using vanilla diffusion policy with only two denoising steps, demonstrating improved performance and simplified learning.

Conclusion: ResAD effectively addresses optimization imbalance in trajectory prediction by reframing the learning task and normalizing residuals, leading to better causal inference and safety.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving (E2EAD) systems, which learn to predict future
trajectories directly from sensor data, are fundamentally challenged by the
inherent spatio-temporal imbalance of trajectory data. This imbalance creates a
significant optimization burden, causing models to learn spurious correlations
instead of causal inference, while also prioritizing uncertain, distant
predictions, thereby compromising immediate safety. To address these issues, we
propose ResAD, a novel Normalized Residual Trajectory Modeling framework.
Instead of predicting the future trajectory directly, our approach reframes the
learning task to predict the residual deviation from a deterministic inertial
reference. The inertial reference serves as a counterfactual, forcing the model
to move beyond simple pattern recognition and instead identify the underlying
causal factors (e.g., traffic rules, obstacles) that necessitate deviations
from a default, inertially-guided path. To deal with the optimization imbalance
caused by uncertain, long-term horizons, ResAD further incorporates Point-wise
Normalization of the predicted residual. It re-weights the optimization
objective, preventing large-magnitude errors associated with distant, uncertain
waypoints from dominating the learning signal. Extensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of our framework. On the NAVSIM benchmark, ResAD achieves a
state-of-the-art PDMS of 88.6 using a vanilla diffusion policy with only two
denoising steps, demonstrating that our approach significantly simplifies the
learning task and improves model performance. The code will be released to
facilitate further research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes NaViL, a native MLLM trained end-to-end, exploring optimal architecture and scaling properties between vision encoders and LLMs under data constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs use compositional training with pre-trained components, making it difficult to study multimodal scaling properties due to separated training.

Method: Systematic study of MLLM design space and scaling properties through end-to-end native training, identifying optimal meta-architecture and positive correlation between visual encoders and LLMs.

Result: NaViL achieves competitive performance on 14 multimodal benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed native training approach.

Conclusion: The findings provide insights for future native MLLM research, showing that end-to-end training with balanced vision-LLM scaling yields strong performance.

Abstract: Compositional training has been the de-facto paradigm in existing Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs), where pre-trained vision encoders are connected
with pre-trained LLMs through continuous multimodal pre-training. However, the
multimodal scaling property of this paradigm remains difficult to explore due
to the separated training. In this paper, we focus on the native training of
MLLMs in an end-to-end manner and systematically study its design space and
scaling property under a practical setting, i.e., data constraint. Through
careful study of various choices in MLLM, we obtain the optimal
meta-architecture that best balances performance and training cost. After that,
we further explore the scaling properties of the native MLLM and indicate the
positively correlated scaling relationship between visual encoders and LLMs.
Based on these findings, we propose a native MLLM called NaViL, combined with a
simple and cost-effective recipe. Experimental results on 14 multimodal
benchmarks confirm the competitive performance of NaViL against existing MLLMs.
Besides that, our findings and results provide in-depth insights for the future
study of native MLLMs.

TL;DR: D²GS improves 3D Gaussian Splatting under sparse-view conditions by addressing overfitting and underfitting through depth-and-density guided dropout and distance-aware fidelity enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting suffers from performance degradation and instability in sparse-view conditions due to overfitting in near regions and underfitting in distant areas.

Method: Proposes D²GS framework with: 1) Depth-and-Density Guided Dropout to mask redundant Gaussians based on density and depth, 2) Distance-Aware Fidelity Enhancement for targeted supervision in far-field areas.

Result: Extensive experiments show significant improvements in both visual quality and robustness under sparse view conditions across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: D²GS effectively addresses sparse-view challenges in 3DGS and introduces a new metric for evaluating Gaussian distribution stability.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enable real-time,
high-fidelity novel view synthesis (NVS) with explicit 3D representations.
However, performance degradation and instability remain significant under
sparse-view conditions. In this work, we identify two key failure modes under
sparse-view conditions: overfitting in regions with excessive Gaussian density
near the camera, and underfitting in distant areas with insufficient Gaussian
coverage. To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework D$^2$GS,
comprising two key components: a Depth-and-Density Guided Dropout strategy that
suppresses overfitting by adaptively masking redundant Gaussians based on
density and depth, and a Distance-Aware Fidelity Enhancement module that
improves reconstruction quality in under-fitted far-field areas through
targeted supervision. Moreover, we introduce a new evaluation metric to
quantify the stability of learned Gaussian distributions, providing insights
into the robustness of the sparse-view 3DGS. Extensive experiments on multiple
datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves both visual quality
and robustness under sparse view conditions. The project page can be found at:

TL;DR: A vision-centric agent tuning framework that automatically synthesizes multimodal trajectories and preference pairs to train VLM controllers for robust tool-use reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of VLMs in complex reasoning and decision-making due to scarcity of high-quality multimodal trajectories and expensive manual annotation costs.

Method: Developed a pipeline that constructs M-TRACE dataset (28.5K multimodal tasks with 177K verified trajectories) for imitation-based tuning, then created MATRIX Agent controller and Pref-X (11K preference pairs) for step-wise preference learning.

Result: MATRIX consistently surpasses both open- and closed-source VLMs across three benchmarks (Agent-X, GTA, and GAIA), demonstrating scalable and effective multimodal tool use.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables scalable and effective multimodal tool use through automated trajectory synthesis and preference learning, with publicly available data and code.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed as controllers with
access to external tools for complex reasoning and decision-making, yet their
effectiveness remains limited by the scarcity of high-quality multimodal
trajectories and the cost of manual annotation. We address this challenge with
a vision-centric agent tuning framework that automatically synthesizes
multimodal trajectories, generates step-wise preference pairs, and trains a VLM
controller for robust tool-use reasoning. Our pipeline first constructs
M-TRACE, a large-scale dataset of 28.5K multimodal tasks with 177K verified
trajectories, enabling imitation-based trajectory tuning. Building on this, we
develop MATRIX Agent, a controller finetuned on M-TRACE for step-wise tool
reasoning. To achieve finer alignment, we further introduce Pref-X, a set of
11K automatically generated preference pairs, and optimize MATRIX on it via
step-wise preference learning. Across three benchmarks, Agent-X, GTA, and GAIA,
MATRIX consistently surpasses both open- and closed-source VLMs, demonstrating
scalable and effective multimodal tool use. Our data and code is avaliable at

*Haofei Xu,Daniel Barath,Andreas Geiger,Marc Pollefeys*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReSplat is a recurrent Gaussian splatting model that iteratively refines 3D Gaussians using rendering error as feedback, achieving state-of-the-art performance with fewer Gaussians and faster rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Feed-forward Gaussian splatting models are limited by single-pass inference and cannot refine their outputs. The authors aim to enable iterative refinement without explicit gradient computation.

Method: Uses recurrent network with rendering error as feedback signal to iteratively update Gaussians. Introduces compact reconstruction model in 16x subsampled space to reduce Gaussian count and computational overhead.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across varying input views (2-16), resolutions (256×256 to 540×960), and datasets (DL3DV, RealEstate10K) while reducing Gaussians and improving rendering speed.

Conclusion: ReSplat demonstrates that rendering error can effectively guide Gaussian refinement in a recurrent framework, enabling robust generalization and computational efficiency.

Abstract: While feed-forward Gaussian splatting models provide computational efficiency
and effectively handle sparse input settings, their performance is
fundamentally limited by the reliance on a single forward pass during
inference. We propose ReSplat, a feed-forward recurrent Gaussian splatting
model that iteratively refines 3D Gaussians without explicitly computing
gradients. Our key insight is that the Gaussian splatting rendering error
serves as a rich feedback signal, guiding the recurrent network to learn
effective Gaussian updates. This feedback signal naturally adapts to unseen
data distributions at test time, enabling robust generalization. To initialize
the recurrent process, we introduce a compact reconstruction model that
operates in a $16 \times$ subsampled space, producing $16 \times$ fewer
Gaussians than previous per-pixel Gaussian models. This substantially reduces
computational overhead and allows for efficient Gaussian updates. Extensive
experiments across varying of input views (2, 8, 16), resolutions ($256 \times
256$ to $540 \times 960$), and datasets (DL3DV and RealEstate10K) demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly
reducing the number of Gaussians and improving the rendering speed. Our project
