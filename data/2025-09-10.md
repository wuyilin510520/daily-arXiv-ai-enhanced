### [1] [CellPainTR: Generalizable Representation Learning for Cross-Dataset Cell Painting Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06986)
*Cedric Caruzzo,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CellPainTR is a Transformer-based model that learns batch-effect-robust cellular morphology representations, enabling out-of-distribution generalization to unseen datasets without fine-tuning, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale biological discovery requires integrating massive heterogeneous datasets, but technical batch effects and lack of generalizable models remain critical roadblocks.

Method: Transformer-based architecture with source-specific context tokens designed to learn foundational representations of cellular morphology that are robust to batch effects.

Result: Outperforms established methods like ComBat and Harmony in batch integration and biological signal preservation on JUMP dataset. Maintains high performance on unseen Bray et al. dataset despite significant domain and feature shifts.

Conclusion: Represents a significant step towards creating truly foundational models for image-based profiling, enabling more reliable and scalable cross-study biological analysis.

Abstract: Large-scale biological discovery requires integrating massive, heterogeneous
datasets like those from the JUMP Cell Painting consortium, but technical batch
effects and a lack of generalizable models remain critical roadblocks. To
address this, we introduce CellPainTR, a Transformer-based architecture
designed to learn foundational representations of cellular morphology that are
robust to batch effects. Unlike traditional methods that require retraining on
new data, CellPainTR's design, featuring source-specific context tokens, allows
for effective out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization to entirely unseen
datasets without fine-tuning. We validate CellPainTR on the large-scale JUMP
dataset, where it outperforms established methods like ComBat and Harmony in
both batch integration and biological signal preservation. Critically, we
demonstrate its robustness through a challenging OOD task on the unseen Bray et
al. dataset, where it maintains high performance despite significant domain and
feature shifts. Our work represents a significant step towards creating truly
foundational models for image-based profiling, enabling more reliable and
scalable cross-study biological analysis.

### [2] [FusWay: Multimodal hybrid fusion approach. Application to Railway Defect Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06987)
*Alexey Zhukov,Jenny Benois-Pineau,Amira Youssef,Akka Zemmari,Mohamed Mosbah,Virginie Taillandier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Multimodal fusion architecture combining YOLOv8n and Vision Transformer with audio signals improves railway defect detection accuracy by 0.2 points over vision-only approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single modality vision approaches for railway defect detection suffer from overdetection when structural elements appear similar to defects. Audio signals recorded by microphones can provide complementary information to improve detection accuracy.

Method: Proposes a multimodal fusion architecture using YOLOv8n for rapid object detection and Vision Transformer to combine feature maps from multiple layers (7, 16, 19) with synthesized audio representations. Fusion is performed between audio and image modalities for detecting rail rupture and surface defects.

Result: Experimental evaluation on real-world railway dataset shows 0.2 point improvement in precision and overall accuracy compared to vision-only approach. Student's unpaired t-test confirms statistical significance of accuracy differences.

Conclusion: Multimodal fusion combining visual and audio information effectively enhances railway defect detection performance, reducing false positives and improving detection reliability.

Abstract: Multimodal fusion is a multimedia technique that has become popular in the
wide range of tasks where image information is accompanied by a signal/audio.
The latter may not convey highly semantic information, such as speech or music,
but some measures such as audio signal recorded by mics in the goal to detect
rail structure elements or defects. While classical detection approaches such
as You Only Look Once (YOLO) family detectors can be efficiently deployed for
defect detection on the image modality, the single modality approaches remain
limited. They yield an overdetection in case of the appearance similar to
normal structural elements. The paper proposes a new multimodal fusion
architecture built on the basis of domain rules with YOLO and Vision
transformer backbones. It integrates YOLOv8n for rapid object detection with a
Vision Transformer (ViT) to combine feature maps extracted from multiple layers
(7, 16, and 19) and synthesised audio representations for two defect classes:
rail Rupture and Surface defect. Fusion is performed between audio and image.
Experimental evaluation on a real-world railway dataset demonstrates that our
multimodal fusion improves precision and overall accuracy by 0.2 points
compared to the vision-only approach. Student's unpaired t-test also confirms
statistical significance of differences in the mean accuracy.

### [3] [Frustratingly Easy Feature Reconstruction for Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06988)
*Yingsheng Wang,Shuo Lu,Jian Liang,Aihua Zheng,Ran He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes ClaFR, a post-hoc OOD detection method that uses classifier weight decomposition to create class-known subspace projections, achieving state-of-the-art performance without requiring training data access.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the limitation of existing feature-based OOD detection methods that require access to training data, which poses privacy concerns in security applications.

Method: Performs orthogonal decomposition of classifier weights to extract class-known subspace, maps original data features into this subspace, and calculates OOD scores based on feature reconstruction error within the subspace.

Result: Achieves leading performance on multiple OOD benchmarks without needing training data access.

Conclusion: ClaFR provides an effective privacy-preserving solution for OOD detection that outperforms existing methods while eliminating the need for training data access.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection helps models identify data outside the
training categories, crucial for security applications. While feature-based
post-hoc methods address this by evaluating data differences in the feature
space without changing network parameters, they often require access to
training data, which may not be suitable for some data privacy scenarios. This
may not be suitable in scenarios where data privacy protection is a concern. In
this paper, we propose a simple yet effective post-hoc method, termed
Classifier-based Feature Reconstruction (ClaFR), from the perspective of
subspace projection. It first performs an orthogonal decomposition of the
classifier's weights to extract the class-known subspace, then maps the
original data features into this subspace to obtain new data representations.
Subsequently, the OOD score is determined by calculating the feature
reconstruction error of the data within the subspace. Compared to existing OOD
detection algorithms, our method does not require access to training data while
achieving leading performance on multiple OOD benchmarks. Our code is released
at https://github.com/Aie0923/ClaFR.

### [4] [DIET-CP: Lightweight and Data Efficient Self Supervised Continued Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06990)
*Bryan Rodas,Natalie Montesino,Jakob Ambsdorf,David Klindt,Randall Balestriero*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DIET-CP is a simple continued pretraining method that adapts foundation models to new domains using minimal data (1000 images) without complex hyperparameter tuning or labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Specialized domains often have small datasets that limit SSL methods and make hyperparameter search infeasible. Existing pretrained models lack information needed for continued pretraining.

Method: Uses a simple objective requiring no labels, introduces no additional hyperparameters beyond supervised finetuning, and works across data modalities and backbone architectures.

Result: Provides significant performance boost for state-of-the-art models like DINOv3 using only 1000 images, with stable performance across different data types and backbones.

Conclusion: DIET-CP effectively bridges the gap for continued pretraining in specialized domains with limited data, offering a simple and stable solution that outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: Continued pretraining offers a promising solution for adapting foundation
models to a new target domain. However, in specialized domains, available
datasets are often very small, limiting the applicability of SSL methods
developed for large-scale pretraining and making hyperparameter search
infeasible. In addition, pretrained models are usually released as
backbone-weights only, lacking important information to continue pretraining.
We propose to bridge this gap with DIET-CP, a simple continued pretraining
strategy, where any strong foundation model can be steered towards the new data
distribution of interest. DIET-CP relies on a very simple objective, requires
no labels, and introduces no more hyperparameters than supervised finetuning.
It is stable across data modalities and backbone choices, while providing a
significant performance boost for state-of-the-art models such as DINOv3 using
only 1000 images.

### [5] [FedAPT: Federated Adversarial Prompt Tuning for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06992)
*Kun Zhai,Siheng Chen,Xingjun Ma,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedAPT enhances adversarial robustness in Federated Prompt Tuning by addressing class information gaps through a class-aware prompt generator and cross-layer sharing strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Prompt Tuning models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, especially under non-IID settings where clients have limited local label information while the global model faces attacks from global labels.

Method: Proposes a class-aware prompt generator that creates visual prompts from text prompts guided by Global Label Embedding, and a cross-layer generator sharing strategy to enhance prompt coupling across model layers.

Result: Extensive experiments show FedAPT significantly outperforms existing methods in adversarial robustness and demonstrates exceptional generalization in cross-domain and cross-dataset scenarios.

Conclusion: FedAPT effectively addresses the class information gap in federated learning settings and provides superior adversarial robustness with strong real-world applicability.

Abstract: Federated Prompt Tuning (FPT) is an efficient method for cross-client
collaborative fine-tuning of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However,
models tuned using FPT are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, leading to
misclassification in downstream tasks. In this work, we introduce Federated
Adversarial Prompt Tuning (\textbf{FedAPT}), a novel method designed to enhance
the adversarial robustness of FPT. We identify a key issue in FedAPT under
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) settings: a \textit{class
information gap} between clients and the global model. Clients rely solely on
limited local label information to generate adversarial samples for training,
while the global model must defend against adversarial attacks from global
labels. To address this issue, we propose a \textbf{class-aware prompt
generator} that generates visual prompts from text prompts. This generator is
guided by a \emph{Global Label Embedding} (serving as a ``beacon") which
encodes cross-client label information to create more globally-aligned visual
prompts. Additionally, we propose a \textbf{cross-layer generator sharing}
strategy to enhance prompt coupling across different layers of the model,
further boosting adversarial robustness. Extensive experiments on multiple
image classification datasets demonstrate the superiority of FedAPT in
improving adversarial robustness, outperforming existing methods by a large
margin. FedAPT also exhibits exceptional generalization in cross-domain and
cross-dataset scenarios, indicating its effectiveness in real-world
applications.

### [7] [VLMs-in-the-Wild: Bridging the Gap Between Academic Benchmarks and Enterprise Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06994)
*Srihari Bandraupalli,Anupam Purwar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViLD framework bridges academic evaluation and enterprise needs by testing VLMs on 10 real-world business tasks using a novel OCR comparison algorithm and comprehensive metrics on 7,500 real-world samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLM benchmarks use synthetic data and multiple-choice questions that don't reflect real enterprise deployment requirements like social media content analysis.

Method: Developed ViLD framework with 10 business-critical tasks, BlockWeaver Algorithm for OCR output comparison, and used 7,500 real-world samples with semantic matching, traditional metrics, and novel completeness/faithfulness measures.

Result: Benchmarked leading open-source VLMs (Qwen, MIMO, InternVL) against proprietary baseline, providing industry-grounded assessment of VLM capabilities for enterprise deployment.

Conclusion: ViLD offers actionable insights for enterprise VLM deployment by addressing the gap between academic evaluation and real-world business requirements through comprehensive task-driven assessment.

Abstract: Open-source Vision-Language Models show immense promise for enterprise
applications, yet a critical disconnect exists between academic evaluation and
enterprise deployment requirements. Current benchmarks rely heavily on
multiple-choice questions and synthetic data, failing to capture the complexity
of real-world business applications like social media content analysis. This
paper introduces VLM-in-the-Wild (ViLD), a comprehensive framework to bridge
this gap by evaluating VLMs on operational enterprise requirements. We define
ten business-critical tasks: logo detection, OCR, object detection, human
presence and demographic analysis, human activity and appearance analysis,
scene detection, camera perspective and media quality assessment, dominant
colors, comprehensive description, and NSFW detection. To this framework, we
bring an innovative BlockWeaver Algorithm that solves the challenging problem
of comparing unordered, variably-grouped OCR outputs from VLMs without relying
on embeddings or LLMs, achieving remarkable speed and reliability. To
demonstrate efficacy of ViLD, we constructed a new benchmark dataset of 7,500
diverse samples, carefully stratified from a corpus of one million real-world
images and videos. ViLD provides actionable insights by combining semantic
matching (both embedding-based and LLM-as-a-judge approaches), traditional
metrics, and novel methods to measure the completeness and faithfulness of
descriptive outputs. By benchmarking leading open-source VLMs (Qwen, MIMO, and
InternVL) against a powerful proprietary baseline as per ViLD framework, we
provide one of the first industry-grounded, task-driven assessment of VLMs
capabilities, offering actionable insights for their deployment in enterprise
environments.

### [8] [The Protocol Genome A Self Supervised Learning Framework from DICOM Headers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06995)
*Jimmy Joseph*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Protocol Genome is a self-supervised learning system that uses DICOM headers to improve medical image analysis performance, achieving AUROC 0.901 and better calibration across multiple imaging modalities and vendors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical imaging through PACS/DICOM involves various procedure choices that create latent confounders, impeding generalization of image-only networks across different sites and scanners.

Method: Uses structured DICOM headers as labels with three approaches: protocol-image contrastive learning, masked protocol prediction, and protocol-protocol translation. Trained on 1.26M studies from 7 health systems with 31 scanners and 3 vendors.

Result: Achieves AUROC 0.901 (vs 0.847 baseline) and ECE 0.036 (vs 0.058) on external validation. Shows significant improvements in chest CT PE triage (+0.046 AUROC), brain MRI glioma grading (+0.058), and chest radiograph cardiomegaly detection (+0.041).

Conclusion: Protocol Genome improves model robustness and calibration across different protocols and vendors, reduces false positives at protocol borders, and works with limited labeled data (10-20%). The method is clinically applicable through standard DICOM interfaces.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Protocol Genome, a self-supervised learning
system that learns correlations from DICOM headers and achieves AUROC 0.901 (vs
0.847 baseline) and ECE 0.036 (vs 0.058) on fully held-out external validation.
Our method also improves calibration and robustness across modalities (CT, MRI,
CXR) and vendors. Clinical imaging is funneled through PACS/DICOM, where
procedure choices (scanner make/model, sequence, kernel, kVp, TR/TE, and slice
thickness) have consequences for contrast, noise, and artifact. These latent
confounders impede the generalization of image-only networks across sites. We
consider structured DICOM headers as a label and learn protocol-aware but
clinically robust image representations. Protocol Genome obtains tokenized
embeddings of de-identified header fields and models them along with image
features using: (1) protocol-image contrastive learning, (2) masked protocol
prediction, and (3) protocol-protocol translation. With 1.26M studies (7 health
systems, 31 scanners, 3 vendors; CT, MR, CR/DR), we experiment on: (A) chest CT
triage for PE, (B) brain MRI glioma grading, and (C) chest radiograph
cardiomegaly detection. Relative to strong SSL baselines (SimCLR, MAE) as well
as ImageNet transfer, Protocol Genome (+0.046: PE, +0.058: glioma, +0.041:
cardiomegaly) is associated with higher external AUROC; 25-37% calibration
improvements are obtained (p < 0.01, DeLong tests). While the gains may be
task-dependent, they are preserved with 10-20% of labeled data. From a clinical
point of view, the technique reduces false positives at protocol borders and is
applicable in a PACS (DICOM C-FIND/C-MOVE, DICOMweb QIDO/WADO). We publish a
model card and deployment guide, complete with both de-identification and bias
audits.

### [9] [Visible Yet Unreadable: A Systematic Blind Spot of Vision Language Models Across Writing Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06996)
*Jie Zhang,Ting Xu,Gelei Deng,Runyi Hu,Han Qiu,Tianwei Zhang,Qing Guo,Ivor Tsang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision language models struggle with fragmented/occluded text that humans can easily read, showing they lack compositional robustness needed for true literacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test whether advanced vision language models share humans' remarkable resilience in recognizing words from fragmented, fused, or partially occluded characters across different writing systems.

Method: Constructed two psychophysics-inspired benchmarks for Chinese logographs and English alphabetic words by splicing, recombining, and overlaying glyphs to create 'visible but unreadable' stimuli for models while remaining legible to humans.

Result: Contemporary VLMs show severe performance drop under these perturbations, frequently producing unrelated or incoherent outputs despite strong performance on clean text, indicating structural limitations in leveraging compositional priors.

Conclusion: Models rely too heavily on generic visual invariances and underutilize compositional priors needed for robust literacy, motivating new architectures and training strategies for symbol segmentation, composition, and binding across scripts.

Abstract: Writing is a universal cultural technology that reuses vision for symbolic
communication. Humans display striking resilience: we readily recognize words
even when characters are fragmented, fused, or partially occluded. This paper
investigates whether advanced vision language models (VLMs) share this
resilience. We construct two psychophysics inspired benchmarks across distinct
writing systems, Chinese logographs and English alphabetic words, by splicing,
recombining, and overlaying glyphs to yield ''visible but unreadable'' stimuli
for models while remaining legible to humans. Despite strong performance on
clean text, contemporary VLMs show a severe drop under these perturbations,
frequently producing unrelated or incoherent outputs. The pattern suggests a
structural limitation: models heavily leverage generic visual invariances but
under rely on compositional priors needed for robust literacy. We release
stimuli generation code, prompts, and evaluation protocols to facilitate
transparent replication and follow up work. Our findings motivate architectures
and training strategies that encode symbol segmentation, composition, and
binding across scripts, and they delineate concrete challenges for deploying
multimodal systems in education, accessibility, cultural heritage, and
security.

### [10] [K-Syn: K-space Data Synthesis in Ultra Low-data Regimes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06997)
*Guan Yu,Zhang Jianhua,Liang Dong,Liu Qiegen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method for dynamic cardiac MRI reconstruction that performs feature-level learning directly in the frequency domain using temporal-fusion strategies to synthesize k-space data, enabling robust reconstruction even with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic cardiac MRI faces challenges due to the scarcity of high-quality and diverse k-space data in practice, which hampers robust reconstruction of cardiac images.

Method: The approach performs feature-level learning in the frequency domain (natural global feature space) rather than traditional pixel-level convolution in image domain. It employs temporal-fusion strategies to integrate k-space data across time frames to guide and optimize generative trajectory.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate strong generative ability in low-data regimes, showing the method can effectively synthesize k-space data even with ultra limited data availability.

Conclusion: The proposed frequency-domain feature learning with temporal fusion strategies shows practical potential to alleviate data scarcity issues in dynamic MRI reconstruction, offering stable and rich generation capabilities.

Abstract: Owing to the inherently dynamic and complex characteristics of cardiac
magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, high-quality and diverse k-space data are
rarely available in practice, which in turn hampers robust reconstruction of
dynamic cardiac MRI. To address this challenge, we perform feature-level
learning directly in the frequency domain and employ a temporal-fusion strategy
as the generative guidance to synthesize k-space data. Specifically, leveraging
the global representation capacity of the Fourier transform, the frequency
domain can be considered a natural global feature space. Therefore, unlike
traditional methods that use pixel-level convolution for feature learning and
modeling in the image domain, this letter focuses on feature-level modeling in
the frequency domain, enabling stable and rich generation even with ultra
low-data regimes. Moreover, leveraging the advantages of feature-level modeling
in the frequency domain, we integrate k-space data across time frames with
multiple fusion strategies to steer and further optimize the generative
trajectory. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method possesses
strong generative ability in low-data regimes, indicating practical potential
to alleviate data scarcity in dynamic MRI reconstruction.

### [11] [Not All Splits Are Equal: Rethinking Attribute Generalization Across Unrelated Categories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06998)
*Liviu Nicolae Fircă,Antonio Bărbălau,Dan Oneata,Elena Burceanu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates whether models can generalize attribute knowledge across semantically and perceptually dissimilar categories, finding performance drops significantly as training-test correlation decreases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test if current models can abstract and apply attribute knowledge to conceptually distant categories (e.g., identifying 'has four legs' applies to both dogs and chairs), beyond narrow taxonomic or visually similar domains.

Method: Introduces train-test split strategies that progressively reduce correlation: LLM-driven semantic grouping, embedding similarity thresholding, embedding-based clustering, and supercategory-based partitioning using ground-truth labels.

Result: Results show sharp performance drop as correlation between training and test categories decreases, indicating strong sensitivity to split design. Clustering yields the most effective trade-off between reducing hidden correlations and preserving learnability.

Conclusion: Findings reveal limitations in current representations for attribute reasoning across dissimilar categories and provide insights for future benchmark construction.

Abstract: Can models generalize attribute knowledge across semantically and
perceptually dissimilar categories? While prior work has addressed attribute
prediction within narrow taxonomic or visually similar domains, it remains
unclear whether current models can abstract attributes and apply them to
conceptually distant categories. This work presents the first explicit
evaluation for the robustness of the attribute prediction task under such
conditions, testing whether models can correctly infer shared attributes
between unrelated object types: e.g., identifying that the attribute "has four
legs" is common to both "dogs" and "chairs". To enable this evaluation, we
introduce train-test split strategies that progressively reduce correlation
between training and test sets, based on: LLM-driven semantic grouping,
embedding similarity thresholding, embedding-based clustering, and
supercategory-based partitioning using ground-truth labels. Results show a
sharp drop in performance as the correlation between training and test
categories decreases, indicating strong sensitivity to split design. Among the
evaluated methods, clustering yields the most effective trade-off, reducing
hidden correlations while preserving learnability. These findings offer new
insights into the limitations of current representations and inform future
benchmark construction for attribute reasoning.

*Ahmed R. Sadik,Mariusz Bujny*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A human-in-the-loop framework for quantitative evaluation of LLM-generated 3D models with comprehensive metrics, showing code-level prompts achieve perfect reconstruction and faster convergence than qualitative methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models can interpret multimodal inputs to generate 3D shapes, but robust evaluation methods for geometric and structural fidelity remain underdeveloped, limiting applications like CAD democratization and rapid prototyping.

Method: Proposed a comprehensive suite of similarity and complexity metrics (volumetric accuracy, surface alignment, dimensional fidelity, topological intricacy) to benchmark LLM-generated models against ground truth CAD references. Used an L-bracket case study to compare performance across four input modalities: 2D orthographic views, isometric sketches, geometric structure trees, and code-based correction prompts.

Result: Findings demonstrate improved generation fidelity with increased semantic richness, with code-level prompts achieving perfect reconstruction across all metrics. The quantitative evaluation approach enables significantly faster convergence toward ground truth compared to traditional qualitative methods based on visual inspection.

Conclusion: This work advances understanding of AI-assisted shape synthesis and provides a scalable methodology to validate and refine generative models for diverse CAD applications, enabling more reliable 3D model generation through quantitative benchmarking.

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly capable of interpreting multimodal
inputs to generate complex 3D shapes, yet robust methods to evaluate geometric
and structural fidelity remain underdeveloped. This paper introduces a human in
the loop framework for the quantitative evaluation of LLM generated 3D models,
supporting applications such as democratization of CAD design, reverse
engineering of legacy designs, and rapid prototyping. We propose a
comprehensive suite of similarity and complexity metrics, including volumetric
accuracy, surface alignment, dimensional fidelity, and topological intricacy,
to benchmark generated models against ground truth CAD references. Using an L
bracket component as a case study, we systematically compare LLM performance
across four input modalities: 2D orthographic views, isometric sketches,
geometric structure trees, and code based correction prompts. Our findings
demonstrate improved generation fidelity with increased semantic richness, with
code level prompts achieving perfect reconstruction across all metrics. A key
contribution of this work is demonstrating that our proposed quantitative
evaluation approach enables significantly faster convergence toward the ground
truth, especially compared to traditional qualitative methods based solely on
visual inspection and human intuition. This work not only advances the
understanding of AI assisted shape synthesis but also provides a scalable
methodology to validate and refine generative models for diverse CAD
applications.

### [13] [MEGS$^{2}$: Memory-Efficient Gaussian Splatting via Spherical Gaussians and Unified Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07021)
*Jiarui Chen,Yikeng Chen,Yingshuang Zou,Ye Huang,Peng Wang,Yuan Liu,Yujing Sun,Wenping Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MEGS² is a memory-efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting framework that reduces VRAM usage by 50% for static and 40% for rendering while maintaining quality, through lightweight spherical Gaussian lobes and unified soft pruning optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has high memory consumption that limits its use on edge devices, and existing compression methods focus only on storage without addressing rendering memory bottlenecks.

Method: Replaces memory-intensive spherical harmonics with lightweight arbitrarily-oriented spherical Gaussian lobes for color representation, and proposes a unified soft pruning framework that jointly optimizes primitive number and lobe number as a constrained optimization problem.

Result: Achieves 50% reduction in static VRAM and 40% reduction in rendering VRAM compared to existing methods while maintaining comparable rendering quality.

Conclusion: MEGS² successfully addresses the critical memory bottleneck in 3DGS rendering through joint optimization of primitive count and parameter efficiency, enabling more practical deployment on memory-constrained devices.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a dominant novel-view synthesis
technique, but its high memory consumption severely limits its applicability on
edge devices. A growing number of 3DGS compression methods have been proposed
to make 3DGS more efficient, yet most only focus on storage compression and
fail to address the critical bottleneck of rendering memory. To address this
problem, we introduce MEGS$^{2}$, a novel memory-efficient framework that
tackles this challenge by jointly optimizing two key factors: the total
primitive number and the parameters per primitive, achieving unprecedented
memory compression. Specifically, we replace the memory-intensive spherical
harmonics with lightweight arbitrarily-oriented spherical Gaussian lobes as our
color representations. More importantly, we propose a unified soft pruning
framework that models primitive-number and lobe-number pruning as a single
constrained optimization problem. Experiments show that MEGS$^{2}$ achieves a
50% static VRAM reduction and a 40% rendering VRAM reduction compared to
existing methods, while maintaining comparable rendering quality.

*Jisung Hwang,Jaihoon Kim,Minhyuk Sung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel regularization loss that enforces standard Gaussian distribution in latent space to improve downstream optimization tasks for text-to-image models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To facilitate optimization in latent space of text-to-image models by ensuring samples follow standard Gaussian distribution, enabling better performance in downstream tasks like reward alignment.

Method: Composite loss combining moment-based regularization in spatial domain with power spectrum-based regularization in spectral domain, applied to randomly permuted inputs for permutation invariance.

Result: Outperforms previous Gaussianity regularization methods, effectively prevents reward hacking, and accelerates convergence in test-time reward alignment for aesthetics and text alignment.

Conclusion: The proposed unified framework provides an effective Gaussianity regularization that improves generative modeling performance while being computationally efficient compared to previous approaches.

Abstract: We propose a novel regularization loss that enforces standard Gaussianity,
encouraging samples to align with a standard Gaussian distribution. This
facilitates a range of downstream tasks involving optimization in the latent
space of text-to-image models. We treat elements of a high-dimensional sample
as one-dimensional standard Gaussian variables and define a composite loss that
combines moment-based regularization in the spatial domain with power
spectrum-based regularization in the spectral domain. Since the expected values
of moments and power spectrum distributions are analytically known, the loss
promotes conformity to these properties. To ensure permutation invariance, the
losses are applied to randomly permuted inputs. Notably, existing
Gaussianity-based regularizations fall within our unified framework: some
correspond to moment losses of specific orders, while the previous
covariance-matching loss is equivalent to our spectral loss but incurs higher
time complexity due to its spatial-domain computation. We showcase the
application of our regularization in generative modeling for test-time reward
alignment with a text-to-image model, specifically to enhance aesthetics and
text alignment. Our regularization outperforms previous Gaussianity
regularization, effectively prevents reward hacking and accelerates
convergence.

*Kamyar Barakati,Utkarsh Pratiush,Sheryl L. Sanchez,Aditya Raghavan,Delia J. Milliron,Mahshid Ahmadi,Philip D. Rack,Sergei V. Kalinin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Reward function-based optimization for fine-tuning foundational segmentation models like SAM, enabling real-time streaming data analysis in microscopy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundational models for image segmentation have many non-transparent tuning parameters requiring manual optimization, limiting usability for real-time streaming data analysis.

Method: Introduce reward function-based optimization to fine-tune foundational models (specifically SAM), where reward functions represent physics of imaged system (particle size distributions, geometries, etc.).

Result: Developed SAM* - an optimized variant that enhances adaptability and performance for diverse segmentation tasks, particularly enabling real-time streaming data segmentation.

Conclusion: The reward-driven optimization framework effectively improves foundational models for microscopy imaging, providing precise segmentation crucial for analyzing cellular structures, material interfaces, and nanoscale features.

Abstract: Image segmentation is a critical task in microscopy, essential for accurately
analyzing and interpreting complex visual data. This task can be performed
using custom models trained on domain-specific datasets, transfer learning from
pre-trained models, or foundational models that offer broad applicability.
However, foundational models often present a considerable number of
non-transparent tuning parameters that require extensive manual optimization,
limiting their usability for real-time streaming data analysis. Here, we
introduce a reward function-based optimization to fine-tune foundational models
and illustrate this approach for SAM (Segment Anything Model) framework by
Meta. The reward functions can be constructed to represent the physics of the
imaged system, including particle size distributions, geometries, and other
criteria. By integrating a reward-driven optimization framework, we enhance
SAM's adaptability and performance, leading to an optimized variant, SAM$^{*}$,
that better aligns with the requirements of diverse segmentation tasks and
particularly allows for real-time streaming data segmentation. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of this approach in microscopy imaging, where precise
segmentation is crucial for analyzing cellular structures, material interfaces,
and nanoscale features.

### [17] [Automated Evaluation of Gender Bias Across 13 Large Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07050)
*Juan Manuel Contreras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Aymara benchmark reveals LMMs systematically amplify gender stereotypes in image generation, showing 93% male representation in male-stereotyped jobs vs 22.5% in female-stereotyped, with significant model variation proving bias is not inevitable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address methodological limitations in prior gender bias research and provide large-scale, comparable cross-model analysis of social bias in large multimodal models (LMMs) for text-to-image generation.

Method: Created Aymara Image Fairness Evaluation benchmark with 75 gender-neutral prompts across stereotypical/non-stereotypical professions. Tested 13 commercial LMMs, generated 965 images, and used validated LLM-as-a-judge system to score gender representation.

Result: LMMs significantly amplify occupational gender stereotypes (p<.001): 93.0% male representation in male-stereotyped professions vs 22.5% in female-stereotyped. Strong default-male bias (68.3% male in non-stereotyped jobs). Model variation was dramatic (46.7%-73.3% male representation).

Conclusion: Gender bias in LMMs is not inevitable but a consequence of design choices. Top-performing model achieved near gender parity, demonstrating improvement is possible. Standardized automated evaluation tools are necessary for accountability and fairness in AI development.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have revolutionized text-to-image generation,
but they risk perpetuating the harmful social biases in their training data.
Prior work has identified gender bias in these models, but methodological
limitations prevented large-scale, comparable, cross-model analysis. To address
this gap, we introduce the Aymara Image Fairness Evaluation, a benchmark for
assessing social bias in AI-generated images. We test 13 commercially available
LMMs using 75 procedurally-generated, gender-neutral prompts to generate people
in stereotypically-male, stereotypically-female, and non-stereotypical
professions. We then use a validated LLM-as-a-judge system to score the 965
resulting images for gender representation. Our results reveal (p < .001 for
all): 1) LMMs systematically not only reproduce but actually amplify
occupational gender stereotypes relative to real-world labor data, generating
men in 93.0% of images for male-stereotyped professions but only 22.5% for
female-stereotyped professions; 2) Models exhibit a strong default-male bias,
generating men in 68.3% of the time for non-stereotyped professions; and 3) The
extent of bias varies dramatically across models, with overall male
representation ranging from 46.7% to 73.3%. Notably, the top-performing model
de-amplified gender stereotypes and approached gender parity, achieving the
highest fairness scores. This variation suggests high bias is not an inevitable
outcome but a consequence of design choices. Our work provides the most
comprehensive cross-model benchmark of gender bias to date and underscores the
necessity of standardized, automated evaluation tools for promoting
accountability and fairness in AI development.

*Chung-Shien Brian Wang,Christian Schmidt,Jens Piekenbrinck,Bastian Leibe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes block-sparse attention kernels to replace dense global attention in transformer-based multi-view reconstruction models, achieving 4x faster inference without retraining while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based models like VGGT and π³ face runtime bottlenecks due to quadratic complexity of global attention layers, limiting scalability to large image sets.

Method: Empirical analysis of attention matrices revealed concentration on cross-view geometric matches. Proposed replacement using highly optimized block-sparse kernels that maintain performance while reducing computation.

Result: Achieves up to 4× faster inference with comparable task performance on multi-view benchmarks. Retrofit requires no retraining and supports large image collections.

Conclusion: Block-sparse attention kernels effectively address the scalability limitations of transformer-based multi-view reconstruction models while preserving accuracy.

Abstract: Efficient and accurate feed-forward multi-view reconstruction has long been
an important task in computer vision. Recent transformer-based models like VGGT
and $\pi^3$ have achieved impressive results with simple architectures, yet
they face an inherent runtime bottleneck, due to the quadratic complexity of
the global attention layers, that limits the scalability to large image sets.
In this paper, we empirically analyze the global attention matrix of these
models and observe that probability mass concentrates on a small subset of
patch-patch interactions that correspond to cross-view geometric matches.
Motivated by the structured attention and inspired by recent advancement in
large language models, we propose a replacement for the dense global attention
operation based on highly optimized block-sparse kernels, yielding up to
$4\times$ faster inference with comparable task performance. Our retrofit
requires no retraining of the backbone, extends to both VGGT and $\pi^3$, and
supports large image collections. Evaluations on a comprehensive suite of
multi-view benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

*Soruya Saha,Md Nurul Absur,Saptarshi Debroy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unsupervised detection and recovery mechanism for Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) security threats in offloaded VR systems, protecting against pose spoofing attacks that cause drift while evading heuristic checks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current trend of offloading VIO to edge servers creates security vulnerabilities where subtle pose spoofing attacks can accumulate into substantial drift while bypassing existing heuristic detection methods, compromising VR system integrity.

Method: Proposed an unsupervised, label-free detection and recovery model trained on attack-free sessions to learn temporal motion regularities. The model detects runtime deviations from learned patterns and initiates recovery processes to restore pose consistency.

Result: Evaluated in realistic offloaded-VIO environment using ILLIXR testbed across multiple spoofing intensities. Results showed substantial reductions in trajectory and pose error compared to no-defense baseline across well-known performance metrics.

Conclusion: The unsupervised approach effectively detects and recovers from pose spoofing attacks in offloaded VIO systems, providing significant security improvements without requiring labeled attack data or heuristic rules.

Abstract: Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) supports immersive Virtual Reality (VR) by
fusing camera and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data for real-time pose.
However, current trend of offloading VIO to edge servers can lead server-side
threat surface where subtle pose spoofing can accumulate into substantial
drift, while evading heuristic checks. In this paper, we study this threat and
present an unsupervised, label-free detection and recovery mechanism. The
proposed model is trained on attack-free sessions to learn temporal
regularities of motion to detect runtime deviations and initiate recovery to
restore pose consistency. We evaluate the approach in a realistic offloaded-VIO
environment using ILLIXR testbed across multiple spoofing intensities.
Experimental results in terms of well-known performance metrics show
substantial reductions in trajectory and pose error compared to a no-defense
baseline.

*Muhammad Saad Saeed,Ijaz Ul Haq,Khalid Malik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Face enhancement techniques, both traditional and GAN-based, can significantly reduce deepfake detection accuracy by distorting biometric features, achieving attack success rates up to 75.12%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether face enhancement methods, while improving perceptual quality, can inadvertently serve as anti-forensic tools by degrading deepfake detector performance.

Method: Systematic evaluation of traditional image processing and GAN-based enhancement methods on deepfake detectors, testing Naïve, Spatial, and Frequency-based detection approaches. Conducted adversarial training experiments to assess model robustness.

Result: Basic enhancement filters reduced detection accuracy with ASR up to 64.63%, while GAN-based techniques achieved even higher ASR up to 75.12% on FaceForensics++, DeepFakeDetection, and CelebDF-v2 datasets.

Conclusion: Face enhancement methods can effectively function as anti-forensic tools, highlighting the need for more resilient and adaptive forensic detection methods.

Abstract: Face enhancement techniques are widely used to enhance facial appearance.
However, they can inadvertently distort biometric features, leading to
significant decrease in the accuracy of deepfake detectors. This study
hypothesizes that these techniques, while improving perceptual quality, can
degrade the performance of deepfake detectors. To investigate this, we
systematically evaluate whether commonly used face enhancement methods can
serve an anti-forensic role by reducing detection accuracy. We use both
traditional image processing methods and advanced GAN-based enhancements to
evaluate the robustness of deepfake detectors. We provide a comprehensive
analysis of the effectiveness of these enhancement techniques, focusing on
their impact on Na\"ive, Spatial, and Frequency-based detection methods.
Furthermore, we conduct adversarial training experiments to assess whether
exposure to face enhancement transformations improves model robustness.
Experiments conducted on the FaceForensics++, DeepFakeDetection, and CelebDF-v2
datasets indicate that even basic enhancement filters can significantly reduce
detection accuracy achieving ASR up to 64.63\%. In contrast, GAN-based
techniques further exploit these vulnerabilities, achieving ASR up to 75.12\%.
Our results demonstrate that face enhancement methods can effectively function
as anti-forensic tools, emphasizing the need for more resilient and adaptive
forensic methods.

*Erencem Ozbey,Dimitrios I. Diochnos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A fully unsupervised approach for novel class discovery using Vision Transformers and manifold learning, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple image datasets without requiring known cluster counts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised learning requires extensive human labeling effort, and real-world applications often encounter novel classes that weren't present during initial training. Existing approaches focus on semi-supervised methods, but a fully unsupervised solution could be more practical.

Method: Uses Vision Transformers with attention mechanisms to generate vector embeddings, then incorporates manifold learning techniques to refine embeddings by exploiting the intrinsic geometry of the data for improved clustering performance.

Result: Establishes new state-of-the-art results on single-modal clustering and Novel Class Discovery on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, and Tiny ImageNet, working effectively both when the number of clusters is known or unknown.

Conclusion: The proposed fully unsupervised approach using Vision Transformers and manifold learning successfully addresses novel class discovery without requiring labeled data, outperforming previous methods across multiple benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Working with annotated data is the cornerstone of supervised learning.
Nevertheless, providing labels to instances is a task that requires significant
human effort. Several critical real-world applications make things more
complicated because no matter how many labels may have been identified in a
task of interest, it could be the case that examples corresponding to novel
classes may appear in the future. Not unsurprisingly, prior work in this,
so-called, `open-world' context has focused a lot on semi-supervised
approaches.
  Focusing on image classification, somehow paradoxically, we propose a fully
unsupervised approach to the problem of determining the novel categories in a
particular dataset. Our approach relies on estimating the number of clusters
using Vision Transformers, which utilize attention mechanisms to generate
vector embeddings. Furthermore, we incorporate manifold learning techniques to
refine these embeddings by exploiting the intrinsic geometry of the data,
thereby enhancing the overall image clustering performance. Overall, we
establish new State-of-the-Art results on single-modal clustering and Novel
Class Discovery on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, and Tiny ImageNet. We do
so, both when the number of clusters is known or unknown ahead of time. The

### [22] [XBusNet: Text-Guided Breast Ultrasound Segmentation via Multimodal Vision-Language Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07213)
*Raja Mallina,Bryar Shareef*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XBusNet is a dual-prompt, dual-branch multimodal model for breast ultrasound segmentation that combines global image semantics with local boundary precision using automated text prompts from clinical metadata, achieving state-of-the-art performance especially for small lesions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Breast ultrasound segmentation is challenging for small or low-contrast lesions with fuzzy margins and speckle noise. Existing text-image approaches produce coarse responses that smear boundaries, requiring better mechanisms for fine edge recovery.

Method: Dual-branch architecture: global pathway using CLIP Vision Transformer for whole-image semantics conditioned on lesion size/location, and local U-Net pathway for precise boundaries modulated by text prompts describing shape, margin, and BI-RADS terms. Prompts are automatically assembled from structured metadata without manual input.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with mean Dice of 0.8765 and IoU of 0.8149 on BLU dataset, outperforming six baselines. Small lesions show largest gains with fewer missed regions and spurious activations. Ablations confirm complementary contributions of global context, local modeling, and prompt modulation.

Conclusion: The dual-prompt, dual-branch multimodal design effectively merges global semantics with local precision, yielding accurate segmentation masks and improved robustness for challenging small, low-contrast breast lesions.

Abstract: Background: Precise breast ultrasound (BUS) segmentation supports reliable
measurement, quantitative analysis, and downstream classification, yet remains
difficult for small or low-contrast lesions with fuzzy margins and speckle
noise. Text prompts can add clinical context, but directly applying weakly
localized text-image cues (e.g., CAM/CLIP-derived signals) tends to produce
coarse, blob-like responses that smear boundaries unless additional mechanisms
recover fine edges. Methods: We propose XBusNet, a novel dual-prompt,
dual-branch multimodal model that combines image features with clinically
grounded text. A global pathway based on a CLIP Vision Transformer encodes
whole-image semantics conditioned on lesion size and location, while a local
U-Net pathway emphasizes precise boundaries and is modulated by prompts that
describe shape, margin, and Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS)
terms. Prompts are assembled automatically from structured metadata, requiring
no manual clicks. We evaluate on the Breast Lesions USG (BLU) dataset using
five-fold cross-validation. Primary metrics are Dice and Intersection over
Union (IoU); we also conduct size-stratified analyses and ablations to assess
the roles of the global and local paths and the text-driven modulation.
Results: XBusNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on BLU, with mean Dice
of 0.8765 and IoU of 0.8149, outperforming six strong baselines. Small lesions
show the largest gains, with fewer missed regions and fewer spurious
activations. Ablation studies show complementary contributions of global
context, local boundary modeling, and prompt-based modulation. Conclusions: A
dual-prompt, dual-branch multimodal design that merges global semantics with
local precision yields accurate BUS segmentation masks and improves robustness
for small, low-contrast lesions.

Motivation: Data scarcity hinders deep learning for medical imaging, particularly in breast cancer classification using thermograms.

Method: Uses Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DPM) for superior data augmentation, fuses deep features from pre-trained ResNet-50 with handcrafted nonlinear features (e.g., Fractal Dimension) from U-Net segmented tumors, and employs XGBoost classifier.

Result: Achieves 98.0% accuracy and 98.1% sensitivity. DPM augmentation outperforms traditional methods and ProGAN baseline. Ablation studies confirm statistical significance of both augmentation and feature fusion.

Conclusion: Validates synergy between advanced generative models and interpretable features for creating highly accurate medical diagnostic tools.

Abstract: Data scarcity hinders deep learning for medical imaging. We propose a
framework for breast cancer classification in thermograms that addresses this
using a Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DPM) for data augmentation. Our
DPM-based augmentation is shown to be superior to both traditional methods and
a ProGAN baseline. The framework fuses deep features from a pre-trained
ResNet-50 with handcrafted nonlinear features (e.g., Fractal Dimension) derived
from U-Net segmented tumors. An XGBoost classifier trained on these fused
features achieves 98.0\% accuracy and 98.1\% sensitivity. Ablation studies and
statistical tests confirm that both the DPM augmentation and the nonlinear
feature fusion are critical, statistically significant components of this
success. This work validates the synergy between advanced generative models and
interpretable features for creating highly accurate medical diagnostic tools.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RecA is a resource-efficient post-training method that improves unified multimodal models by using visual understanding embeddings as dense text prompts for self-supervised image reconstruction, enhancing both generation and editing capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional training of unified multimodal models relies on sparse image-text pairs that miss fine-grained visual details, limiting the models' generation and editing fidelity.

Method: Reconstruction Alignment (RecA) conditions UMMs on their own visual understanding embeddings and optimizes them to reconstruct input images using self-supervised reconstruction loss, realigning understanding and generation.

Result: With only 27 GPU-hours, RecA substantially improves image generation performance on GenEval (0.73→0.90) and DPGBench (80.93→88.15), while boosting editing benchmarks (ImgEdit 3.38→3.75, GEdit 6.94→7.25), surpassing larger open-source models.

Conclusion: RecA is an efficient and general post-training alignment strategy that works across diverse UMM architectures, providing rich supervision without captions and significantly improving generation and editing fidelity.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models (UMMs) unify visual understanding and generation
within a single architecture. However, conventional training relies on
image-text pairs (or sequences) whose captions are typically sparse and miss
fine-grained visual details--even when they use hundreds of words to describe a
simple image. We introduce Reconstruction Alignment (RecA), a
resource-efficient post-training method that leverages visual understanding
encoder embeddings as dense "text prompts," providing rich supervision without
captions. Concretely, RecA conditions a UMM on its own visual understanding
embeddings and optimizes it to reconstruct the input image with a
self-supervised reconstruction loss, thereby realigning understanding and
generation. Despite its simplicity, RecA is broadly applicable: across
autoregressive, masked-autoregressive, and diffusion-based UMMs, it
consistently improves generation and editing fidelity. With only 27 GPU-hours,
post-training with RecA substantially improves image generation performance on
GenEval (0.73$\rightarrow$0.90) and DPGBench (80.93$\rightarrow$88.15), while
also boosting editing benchmarks (ImgEdit 3.38$\rightarrow$3.75, GEdit
6.94$\rightarrow$7.25). Notably, RecA surpasses much larger open-source models
and applies broadly across diverse UMM architectures, establishing it as an
efficient and general post-training alignment strategy for UMMs

### [25] [DEPF: A UAV Multispectral Object Detector with Dual-Domain Enhancement and Priority-Guided Mamba Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07327)
*Shucong Li,Zhenyu Liu,Zijie Hong,Zhiheng Zhou,Xianghai Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel UAV multispectral object detector called DEPF is proposed, featuring dual-domain enhancement and priority-guided mamba fusion to address challenges in low-light imaging, small target modeling, and computational complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome three key challenges in UAV multispectral object detection: reduced modality complementarity in low-light conditions, interference from redundant information during fusion for small targets, and the computational complexity limitations of transformer-based methods on UAV platforms.

Method: Proposes DEPF with two main components: 1) Dual-Domain Enhancement Module (DDE) using Cross-Scale Wavelet Mamba for global brightness enhancement and Fourier Details Recovery for texture recovery, and 2) Priority-Guided Mamba Fusion Module (PGMF) that uses priority scanning starting from local target features based on modality difference scores.

Result: Experiments on DroneVehicle and VEDAI datasets show that DEPF performs well on object detection tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed DEPF framework effectively addresses the three key challenges in UAV multispectral object detection by leveraging Mamba's linear complexity and novel dual-domain enhancement and priority-guided fusion techniques.

Abstract: Multispectral remote sensing object detection is one of the important
application of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). However, it faces three
challenges. Firstly, the low-light remote sensing images reduce the
complementarity during multi-modality fusion. Secondly, the local small target
modeling is interfered with redundant information in the fusion stage easily.
Thirdly, due to the quadratic computational complexity, it is hard to apply the
transformer-based methods on the UAV platform. To address these limitations,
motivated by Mamba with linear complexity, a UAV multispectral object detector
with dual-domain enhancement and priority-guided mamba fusion (DEPF) is
proposed. Firstly, to enhance low-light remote sensing images, Dual-Domain
Enhancement Module (DDE) is designed, which contains Cross-Scale Wavelet Mamba
(CSWM) and Fourier Details Recovery block (FDR). CSWM applies cross-scale mamba
scanning for the low-frequency components to enhance the global brightness of
images, while FDR constructs spectrum recovery network to enhance the frequency
spectra features for recovering the texture-details. Secondly, to enhance local
target modeling and reduce the impact of redundant information during fusion,
Priority-Guided Mamba Fusion Module (PGMF) is designed. PGMF introduces the
concept of priority scanning, which starts from local targets features
according to the priority scores obtained from modality difference. Experiments
on DroneVehicle dataset and VEDAI dataset reports that, DEPF performs well on
object detection, comparing with state-of-the-art methods. Our code is
available in the supplementary material.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard GCNs struggle to distinguish between ambiguous actions due to limitations in representing topological and spatial features

Method: Proposes G$^{3}$CN with Gaussian filter to refine skeleton topology graph and integrates GRUs into GCN framework to enhance information propagation between skeleton points

Result: Shows strong generalization across various GCN backbones and achieves improved performance on NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA benchmarks, particularly for ambiguous samples

Conclusion: G$^{3}$CN effectively addresses the challenge of distinguishing ambiguous actions in skeleton-based action recognition through topology refinement and enhanced information propagation

Abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have proven to be highly effective for
skeleton-based action recognition, primarily due to their ability to leverage
graph topology for feature aggregation, a key factor in extracting meaningful
representations. However, despite their success, GCNs often struggle to
effectively distinguish between ambiguous actions, revealing limitations in the
representation of learned topological and spatial features. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel approach, Gaussian Topology Refinement Gated
Graph Convolution (G$^{3}$CN), to address the challenge of distinguishing
ambiguous actions in skeleton-based action recognition. G$^{3}$CN incorporates
a Gaussian filter to refine the skeleton topology graph, improving the
representation of ambiguous actions. Additionally, Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)
are integrated into the GCN framework to enhance information propagation
between skeleton points. Our method shows strong generalization across various
GCN backbones. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA
benchmarks demonstrate that G$^{3}$CN effectively improves action recognition,
particularly for ambiguous samples.

*Shibang Liu,Xuemei Xie,Guangming Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PGVL introduces a parse graph-based visual-language interaction method with a Guided Module to effectively fuse multimodal information for human pose estimation, addressing occlusion challenges through hierarchical feature integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing parse graph methods for human pose estimation focus on single modality modeling and fail to effectively leverage language priors. Visual-language fusion through global feature integration weakens occluded region responses and causes alignment issues.

Method: Proposes Parse Graph-based Visual-Language interaction (PGVL) with a novel Guided Module. Uses hierarchical parse graphs where low-level nodes maintain local features for occluded areas and high-level nodes integrate global features. Implements top-down decomposition and bottom-up composition with recursive bidirectional cross-attention purified by the Guided Module.

Result: The method is validated on major pose estimation datasets and demonstrates improved performance in handling occluded scenes through effective multimodal fusion.

Conclusion: PGVL successfully addresses occlusion challenges in human pose estimation by enabling effective visual-language interaction through hierarchical parse graphs and guided feature updates, outperforming previous single-modality approaches.

Abstract: Parse graphs boost human pose estimation (HPE) by integrating context and
hierarchies, yet prior work mostly focuses on single modality modeling,
ignoring the potential of multimodal fusion. Notably, language offers rich HPE
priors like spatial relations for occluded scenes, but existing visual-language
fusion via global feature integration weakens occluded region responses and
causes alignment and location failures. To address this issue, we propose Parse
Graph-based Visual-Language interaction (PGVL) with a core novel Guided Module
(GM). In PGVL, low-level nodes focus on local features, maximizing the
maintenance of responses in occluded areas and high-level nodes integrate
global features to infer occluded or invisible parts. GM enables high semantic
nodes to guide the feature update of low semantic nodes that have undergone
cross attention. It ensuring effective fusion of diverse information. PGVL
includes top-down decomposition and bottom-up composition. In the first stage,
modality specific parse graphs are constructed. Next stage. recursive
bidirectional cross-attention is used, purified by GM. We also design network
based on PGVL. The PGVL and our network is validated on major pose estimation
datasets. We will release the code soon.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LGAA is a novel framework for end-to-end PBR-ready 3D asset generation that unifies geometry and material modeling using multi-view diffusion priors in a modular, data-efficient approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D generation methods focus mainly on geometry and lack end-to-end physically based rendering (PBR) material synthesis, requiring labor-intensive manual texturing.

Method: Modular framework with three components: LGAA Wrapper (reuses MV diffusion model layers), LGAA Switcher (aligns multiple diffusion priors), and LGAA Decoder (tamed VAE for 2D Gaussian Splatting with PBR channels). Includes post-processing for mesh extraction.

Result: Superior performance demonstrated through extensive experiments with both text- and image-conditioned MV diffusion models. Achieves efficient convergence trained on only 69k multi-view instances.

Conclusion: LGAA enables flexible, high-quality PBR-ready 3D asset generation with efficient knowledge reuse from diffusion models, providing an end-to-end solution for autonomous 3D content creation.

Abstract: The labor- and experience-intensive creation of 3D assets with physically
based rendering (PBR) materials demands an autonomous 3D asset creation
pipeline. However, most existing 3D generation methods focus on geometry
modeling, either baking textures into simple vertex colors or leaving texture
synthesis to post-processing with image diffusion models. To achieve end-to-end
PBR-ready 3D asset generation, we present Lightweight Gaussian Asset Adapter
(LGAA), a novel framework that unifies the modeling of geometry and PBR
materials by exploiting multi-view (MV) diffusion priors from a novel
perspective. The LGAA features a modular design with three components.
Specifically, the LGAA Wrapper reuses and adapts network layers from MV
diffusion models, which encapsulate knowledge acquired from billions of images,
enabling better convergence in a data-efficient manner. To incorporate multiple
diffusion priors for geometry and PBR synthesis, the LGAA Switcher aligns
multiple LGAA Wrapper layers encapsulating different knowledge. Then, a tamed
variational autoencoder (VAE), termed LGAA Decoder, is designed to predict 2D
Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) with PBR channels. Finally, we introduce a dedicated

experiments demonstrate the superior performance of LGAA with both text-and
image-conditioned MV diffusion models. Additionally, the modular design enables
flexible incorporation of multiple diffusion priors, and the
knowledge-preserving scheme leads to efficient convergence trained on merely

### [29] [In the Eye of MLLM: Benchmarking Egocentric Video Intent Understanding with Gaze-Guided Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07447)
*Taiying Peng,Jiacheng Hua,Miao Liu,Feng Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EgoGazeVQA is a new benchmark for egocentric gaze-guided video question answering that uses gaze information to improve understanding of daily-life videos and user intent interpretation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal LLM benchmarks overlook gaze as a crucial indicator of user intent in egocentric videos, which capture user focus, actions, and context in a unified coordinate system for proactive AI experiences.

Method: Created EgoGazeVQA benchmark with gaze-based QA pairs generated by MLLMs and refined by human annotators. Developed gaze-guided intent prompting methods integrating spatial, temporal, and intent-related cues, and conducted gaze-related fine-tuning experiments.

Result: Existing MLLMs struggle to interpret user intentions accurately, but gaze-guided intent prompting methods significantly enhance performance. Gaze estimation accuracy impacts prompting effectiveness.

Conclusion: Gaze information is valuable for creating more personalized and effective AI assistants in egocentric settings, as it provides crucial intent-related cues that improve multimodal understanding.

Abstract: The emergence of advanced multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has
significantly enhanced AI assistants' ability to process complex information
across modalities. Recently, egocentric videos, by directly capturing user
focus, actions, and context in an unified coordinate, offer an exciting
opportunity to enable proactive and personalized AI user experiences with
MLLMs. However, existing benchmarks overlook the crucial role of gaze as an
indicator of user intent. To address this gap, we introduce EgoGazeVQA, an
egocentric gaze-guided video question answering benchmark that leverages gaze
information to improve the understanding of longer daily-life videos.
EgoGazeVQA consists of gaze-based QA pairs generated by MLLMs and refined by
human annotators. Our experiments reveal that existing MLLMs struggle to
accurately interpret user intentions. In contrast, our gaze-guided intent
prompting methods significantly enhance performance by integrating spatial,
temporal, and intent-related cues. We further conduct experiments on
gaze-related fine-tuning and analyze how gaze estimation accuracy impacts
prompting effectiveness. These results underscore the value of gaze for more
personalized and effective AI assistants in egocentric settings.

### [30] [GLEAM: Learning to Match and Explain in Cross-View Geo-Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07450)
*Xudong Lu,Zhi Zheng,Yi Wan,Yongxiang Yao,Annan Wang,Renrui Zhang,Panwang Xia,Qiong Wu,Qingyun Li,Weifeng Lin,Xiangyu Zhao,Xue Yang,Hongsheng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLEAM introduces a unified cross-view geo-localization framework with multi-modal alignment (GLEAM-C) and explainable reasoning (GLEAM-X), addressing limitations of single-view approaches and lack of interpretability in traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CVGL methods are restricted to single views/modalities and lack interpretability - they only predict matches without explaining the reasoning behind correspondences between different geographical perspectives.

Method: Two-phase approach: GLEAM-C aligns multiple views (UAV, street maps, panoramas, ground photos) with satellite imagery using optimized implementation. GLEAM-X leverages MLLMs for explainable reasoning, with bilingual benchmark generated by GPT-4o and Doubao-1.5-Thinking-Vision-Pro and human-refined test set.

Result: Achieves accuracy comparable to prior modality-specific models while enhancing training efficiency. Provides systematic evaluation framework for explainable cross-view reasoning, advancing transparency and scalability in geo-localization.

Conclusion: GLEAM forms a comprehensive CVGL pipeline that integrates multi-modal, multi-view alignment with interpretable correspondence analysis, unifying accurate cross-view matching with explainable reasoning to advance geo-localization capabilities.

Abstract: Cross-View Geo-Localization (CVGL) focuses on identifying correspondences
between images captured from distinct perspectives of the same geographical
location. However, existing CVGL approaches are typically restricted to a
single view or modality, and their direct visual matching strategy lacks
interpretability: they merely predict whether two images correspond, without
explaining the rationale behind the match. In this paper, we present GLEAM-C, a
foundational CVGL model that unifies multiple views and modalities-including
UAV imagery, street maps, panoramic views, and ground photographs-by aligning
them exclusively with satellite imagery. Our framework enhances training
efficiency through optimized implementation while achieving accuracy comparable
to prior modality-specific CVGL models through a two-phase training strategy.
Moreover, to address the lack of interpretability in traditional CVGL methods,
we leverage the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) to propose a new task, GLEAM-X, which combines cross-view
correspondence prediction with explainable reasoning. To support this task, we
construct a bilingual benchmark using GPT-4o and Doubao-1.5-Thinking-Vision-Pro
to generate training and testing data. The test set is further refined through
detailed human revision, enabling systematic evaluation of explainable
cross-view reasoning and advancing transparency and scalability in
geo-localization. Together, GLEAM-C and GLEAM-X form a comprehensive CVGL
pipeline that integrates multi-modal, multi-view alignment with interpretable
correspondence analysis, unifying accurate cross-view matching with explainable
reasoning and advancing Geo-Localization by enabling models to better Explain
And Match. Code and datasets used in this work will be made publicly accessible

### [31] [XOCT: Enhancing OCT to OCTA Translation via Cross-Dimensional Supervised Multi-Scale Feature Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07455)
*Pooya Khosravi,Kun Han,Anthony T. Wu,Arghavan Rezvani,Zexin Feng,Xiaohui Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XOCT is a deep learning framework that uses cross-dimensional supervision and multi-scale feature fusion for layer-aware OCT-to-OCTA translation, improving vascular reconstruction quality for retinal disease diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality OCTA imaging is challenging due to motion sensitivity and high costs, while existing deep learning methods fail to capture layer-specific vascular differences and intricate vascular details needed for reliable diagnosis.

Method: Proposes XOCT framework with Cross-Dimensional Supervision (CDS) using 2D layer-wise en-face projections as supervisory signals, and Multi-Scale Feature Fusion (MSFF) with channel reweighting for enhanced vessel delineation at multiple spatial scales.

Result: Experiments on OCTA-500 dataset show significant improvements, particularly for en-face projections that are clinically important for retinal pathology evaluation.

Conclusion: XOCT enhances OCTA accessibility, reliability, and diagnostic value for ophthalmic disease detection and monitoring, with code publicly available.

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) and its derived en-face
projections provide high-resolution visualization of the retinal and choroidal
vasculature, which is critical for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of retinal
diseases. However, acquiring high-quality OCTA images is challenging due to
motion sensitivity and the high costs associated with software modifications
for conventional OCT devices. Moreover, current deep learning methods for
OCT-to-OCTA translation often overlook the vascular differences across retinal
layers and struggle to reconstruct the intricate, dense vascular details
necessary for reliable diagnosis. To overcome these limitations, we propose
XOCT, a novel deep learning framework that integrates Cross-Dimensional
Supervision (CDS) with a Multi-Scale Feature Fusion (MSFF) network for
layer-aware vascular reconstruction. Our CDS module leverages 2D layer-wise
en-face projections, generated via segmentation-weighted z-axis averaging, as
supervisory signals to compel the network to learn distinct representations for
each retinal layer through fine-grained, targeted guidance. Meanwhile, the MSFF
module enhances vessel delineation through multi-scale feature extraction
combined with a channel reweighting strategy, effectively capturing vascular
details at multiple spatial scales. Our experiments on the OCTA-500 dataset
demonstrate XOCT's improvements, especially for the en-face projections which
are significant for clinical evaluation of retinal pathologies, underscoring
its potential to enhance OCTA accessibility, reliability, and diagnostic value
for ophthalmic disease detection and monitoring. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Machine unlearning techniques can effectively mitigate bias in vision models by selectively removing biased samples/features, achieving significant fairness improvements with minimal accuracy loss across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks often rely on spurious correlations in training data, leading to biased predictions in safety-critical domains. Conventional bias mitigation requires retraining from scratch, but machine unlearning offers a post-hoc alternative for model correction.

Method: Bias-Aware Machine Unlearning using techniques like Gradient Ascent, LoRA, and Teacher-Student distillation to selectively remove biased samples or feature representations. Evaluated on CUB-200-2011 (pose bias), CIFAR-10 (patch bias), and CelebA (gender bias).

Result: Substantial reduction in subgroup disparities: 94.86% improvement in demographic parity on CUB-200, 30.28% on CIFAR-10, and 97.37% on CelebA. Achieved with minimal accuracy loss and average score of 0.62 across utility, fairness, quality, and privacy metrics.

Conclusion: Machine unlearning establishes as a practical framework for enhancing fairness in deployed vision systems without requiring full retraining, making it a viable post-hoc solution for bias mitigation.

Abstract: Deep neural networks often rely on spurious correlations in training data,
leading to biased or unfair predictions in safety-critical domains such as
medicine and autonomous driving. While conventional bias mitigation typically
requires retraining from scratch or redesigning data pipelines, recent advances
in machine unlearning provide a promising alternative for post-hoc model
correction. In this work, we investigate \textit{Bias-Aware Machine
Unlearning}, a paradigm that selectively removes biased samples or feature
representations to mitigate diverse forms of bias in vision models. Building on
privacy-preserving unlearning techniques, we evaluate various strategies
including Gradient Ascent, LoRA, and Teacher-Student distillation. Through
empirical analysis on three benchmark datasets, CUB-200-2011 (pose bias),
CIFAR-10 (synthetic patch bias), and CelebA (gender bias in smile detection),
we demonstrate that post-hoc unlearning can substantially reduce subgroup
disparities, with improvements in demographic parity of up to \textbf{94.86\%}
on CUB-200, \textbf{30.28\%} on CIFAR-10, and \textbf{97.37\%} on CelebA. These
gains are achieved with minimal accuracy loss and with methods scoring an
average of 0.62 across the 3 settings on the joint evaluation of utility,
fairness, quality, and privacy. Our findings establish machine unlearning as a
practical framework for enhancing fairness in deployed vision systems without
necessitating full retraining.

TL;DR: MedicalPatchNet is a self-explainable deep learning model for chest X-ray classification that matches EfficientNet-B0 performance while providing superior interpretability through patch-based analysis and visualization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks for radiological image classification often lack interpretability, limiting clinical acceptance. There's a need for models that provide transparent explanations of their diagnostic decisions.

Method: The model splits chest X-ray images into non-overlapping patches, independently classifies each patch, and aggregates predictions. This enables intuitive visualization of each patch's diagnostic contribution without post-hoc explanation techniques.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method that combines implicit neural representations with text-to-video diffusion models to automate vector graphic animation, preserving scalability and quality while leveraging motion priors from diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vector graphics offer scalability and user-friendliness but animating them requires substantial manual effort. Existing techniques have limitations in flexibility and animation quality.

Method: Uses layered implicit neural representations to reconstruct vector graphics, bridges domain gap with diffusion models, optimizes with video score distillation sampling, and warps vector graphics to match representations.

Result: Generates vivid and natural vector graphic animations with significant improvement over existing techniques, preserving infinite resolution and precise constraints.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively automates vector graphic animation while maintaining the inherent benefits of vector graphics and leveraging modern diffusion model capabilities.

Abstract: Vector graphics, known for their scalability and user-friendliness, provide a
unique approach to visual content compared to traditional pixel-based images.
Animation of these graphics, driven by the motion of their elements, offers
enhanced comprehensibility and controllability but often requires substantial
manual effort. To automate this process, we propose a novel method that
integrates implicit neural representations with text-to-video diffusion models
for vector graphic animation. Our approach employs layered implicit neural
representations to reconstruct vector graphics, preserving their inherent
properties such as infinite resolution and precise color and shape constraints,
which effectively bridges the large domain gap between vector graphics and
diffusion models. The neural representations are then optimized using video
score distillation sampling, which leverages motion priors from pretrained
text-to-video diffusion models. Finally, the vector graphics are warped to
match the representations resulting in smooth animation. Experimental results
validate the effectiveness of our method in generating vivid and natural vector
graphic animations, demonstrating significant improvement over existing
techniques that suffer from limitations in flexibility and animation quality.

Motivation: To assist visually impaired individuals with indoor navigation where traditional GPS-based systems fail due to lack of precise location data, using vision and language models for step-by-step guidance.

Method: Fine-tuned BLIP-2 model with Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on manually annotated indoor navigation dataset, and proposed a refined BERT F1 evaluation metric emphasizing directional and sequential variables.

Result: The model significantly improved in generating directional instructions after applying LoRA, overcoming limitations of the original BLIP-2 model.

Conclusion: The integrated vision-language approach with specialized fine-tuning and evaluation metrics provides an effective solution for indoor navigation assistance for visually impaired individuals.

Abstract: We address vision-language-driven indoor navigation to assist visually
impaired individuals in reaching a target location using images and natural
language guidance. Traditional navigation systems are ineffective indoors due
to the lack of precise location data. Our approach integrates vision and
language models to generate step-by-step navigational instructions, enhancing
accessibility and independence. We fine-tune the BLIP-2 model with Low Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) on a manually annotated indoor navigation dataset. We propose
an evaluation metric that refines the BERT F1 score by emphasizing directional

navigational performance. After applying LoRA, the model significantly improved

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiGS integrates Signed Distance Field learning into 3D Gaussian Splatting to improve surface reconstruction while maintaining high rendering quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS achieves photorealistic view synthesis but struggles with accurate and complete surface reconstruction due to its unstructured nature and lack of explicit geometric supervision.

Method: Associates each Gaussian with a learnable SDF value to align primitives with geometry, and uses a geometry-guided grid growth strategy to adaptively distribute Gaussians along geometry-consistent regions in a multi-scale hierarchy.

Result: Extensive experiments on DTU, Mip-NeRF 360, and Tanks&Temples benchmarks show consistent improvements in reconstruction accuracy and completeness while retaining high rendering fidelity.

Conclusion: DiGS successfully bridges the gap between high-quality rendering and accurate surface reconstruction by embedding SDF learning into 3DGS, providing strong geometric priors and improved cross-view consistency.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for
photorealistic view synthesis, representing scenes with spatially distributed
Gaussian primitives. While highly effective for rendering, achieving accurate
and complete surface reconstruction remains challenging due to the unstructured
nature of the representation and the absence of explicit geometric supervision.
In this work, we propose DiGS, a unified framework that embeds Signed Distance
Field (SDF) learning directly into the 3DGS pipeline, thereby enforcing strong
and interpretable surface priors. By associating each Gaussian with a learnable
SDF value, DiGS explicitly aligns primitives with underlying geometry and
improves cross-view consistency. To further ensure dense and coherent coverage,
we design a geometry-guided grid growth strategy that adaptively distributes
Gaussians along geometry-consistent regions under a multi-scale hierarchy.
Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, including DTU, Mip-NeRF 360, and
Tanks& Temples, demonstrate that DiGS consistently improves reconstruction
accuracy and completeness while retaining high rendering fidelity.

*Chun Liu,Hailong Wang,Bingqian Zhu,Panpan Ding,Zheng Zheng,Tao Xu,Zhigang Han,Jiayao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a novel adversarial attack framework using local mixing and logits optimization to enhance transferability and overcome gradient vanishing issues in non-targeted attacks on remote sensing DNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep Neural Networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing security threats in remote sensing applications. Current mixing-based strategies either destroy global semantic features or suffer from gradient diminishing during iterative updates, compromising adversarial example quality.

Method: 1) Local mixing strategy to generate diverse yet semantically consistent inputs by blending local regions only; 2) Adaptation of logit loss from targeted to non-targeted attacks to mitigate gradient vanishing; 3) Perturbation smoothing loss to suppress high-frequency noise and enhance transferability.

Result: Extensive experiments on FGSCR-42 and MTARSI datasets show superior performance over 12 state-of-the-art methods across 6 surrogate models. Achieves 17.28% average improvement in black-box attack success rate with ResNet as surrogate on MTARSI.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses limitations of existing mixing-based adversarial attacks by preserving global semantics through local mixing and overcoming gradient vanishing through logits optimization, significantly improving transferability and attack success rates.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing
significant security threats to their deployment in remote sensing
applications. Research on adversarial attacks not only reveals model
vulnerabilities but also provides critical insights for enhancing robustness.
Although current mixing-based strategies have been proposed to increase the
transferability of adversarial examples, they either perform global blending or
directly exchange a region in the images, which may destroy global semantic
features and mislead the optimization of adversarial examples. Furthermore,
their reliance on cross-entropy loss for perturbation optimization leads to
gradient diminishing during iterative updates, compromising adversarial example
quality. To address these limitations, we focus on non-targeted attacks and
propose a novel framework via local mixing and logits optimization. First, we
present a local mixing strategy to generate diverse yet semantically consistent
inputs. Different from MixUp, which globally blends two images, and MixCut,
which stitches images together, our method merely blends local regions to
preserve global semantic information. Second, we adapt the logit loss from
targeted attacks to non-targeted scenarios, mitigating the gradient vanishing
problem of cross-entropy loss. Third, a perturbation smoothing loss is applied
to suppress high-frequency noise and enhance transferability. Extensive
experiments on FGSCR-42 and MTARSI datasets demonstrate superior performance
over 12 state-of-the-art methods across 6 surrogate models. Notably, with
ResNet as the surrogate on MTARSI, our method achieves a 17.28% average
improvement in black-box attack success rate.

*Saad Lahlali,Alexandre Fournier Montgieux,Nicolas Granger,Hervé Le Borgne,Quoc Cuong Pham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MVAT is a weakly supervised 3D object detection framework that uses temporal multi-view data and teacher-student distillation to achieve state-of-the-art performance without 3D box annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D data annotation is costly, and existing weakly supervised methods using 2D boxes suffer from projection ambiguities and partial visibility issues in single viewpoints.

Method: Leverages temporal multi-view data to aggregate object-centric point clouds across time, uses teacher-student distillation where teacher learns from aggregated static objects and generates pseudo-labels for student to predict from single viewpoints, incorporates multi-view 2D projection loss for consistency.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes and Waymo Open datasets, significantly narrowing the gap with fully supervised methods without requiring 3D box annotations.

Conclusion: MVAT effectively addresses projection ambiguities and partial visibility challenges in weakly supervised 3D object detection through temporal multi-view aggregation and teacher-student distillation.

Abstract: Annotating 3D data remains a costly bottleneck for 3D object detection,
motivating the development of weakly supervised annotation methods that rely on
more accessible 2D box annotations. However, relying solely on 2D boxes
introduces projection ambiguities since a single 2D box can correspond to
multiple valid 3D poses. Furthermore, partial object visibility under a single
viewpoint setting makes accurate 3D box estimation difficult. We propose MVAT,
a novel framework that leverages temporal multi-view present in sequential data
to address these challenges. Our approach aggregates object-centric point
clouds across time to build 3D object representations as dense and complete as
possible. A Teacher-Student distillation paradigm is employed: The Teacher
network learns from single viewpoints but targets are derived from temporally
aggregated static objects. Then the Teacher generates high quality
pseudo-labels that the Student learns to predict from a single viewpoint for
both static and moving objects. The whole framework incorporates a multi-view
2D projection loss to enforce consistency between predicted 3D boxes and all
available 2D annotations. Experiments on the nuScenes and Waymo Open datasets
demonstrate that MVAT achieves state-of-the-art performance for weakly
supervised 3D object detection, significantly narrowing the gap with fully
supervised methods without requiring any 3D box annotations. % \footnote{Code

Motivation: Dynamic gesture understanding remains challenging due to complex spatiotemporal variations, and existing datasets lack multimodal diversity, precise ground-truth tracking, and action quality components needed for clinical applications like hand dexterity assessment.

Method: Collected over 1,100 recordings (6 hours) from 25 healthy subjects using two high-resolution RGB-Depth cameras and an event camera, with motion capture system providing precise hand landmark tracking. All devices spatially calibrated and synchronized for cross-modal alignment.

Result: The dataset enables gesture classification, gesture trigger detection, and action quality assessment based on execution speed classes that mirror clinical evaluations of hand dexterity.

Conclusion: EHWGesture serves as a comprehensive benchmark for advancing multimodal clinical gesture understanding, particularly for applications in human-computer interaction and automatic clinical assessment of hand dexterity.

Abstract: Hand gesture understanding is essential for several applications in
human-computer interaction, including automatic clinical assessment of hand
dexterity. While deep learning has advanced static gesture recognition, dynamic
gesture understanding remains challenging due to complex spatiotemporal
variations. Moreover, existing datasets often lack multimodal and multi-view
diversity, precise ground-truth tracking, and an action quality component
embedded within gestures. This paper introduces EHWGesture, a multimodal video
dataset for gesture understanding featuring five clinically relevant gestures.
It includes over 1,100 recordings (6 hours), captured from 25 healthy subjects
using two high-resolution RGB-Depth cameras and an event camera. A motion
capture system provides precise ground-truth hand landmark tracking, and all
devices are spatially calibrated and synchronized to ensure cross-modal
alignment. Moreover, to embed an action quality task within gesture
understanding, collected recordings are organized in classes of execution speed
that mirror clinical evaluations of hand dexterity. Baseline experiments
highlight the dataset's potential for gesture classification, gesture trigger
detection, and action quality assessment. Thus, EHWGesture can serve as a
comprehensive benchmark for advancing multimodal clinical gesture
understanding.

TL;DR: UFC is a universal few-shot control adapter that enables diffusion models to generalize to novel spatial control conditions with minimal training data (30 examples), achieving competitive performance with fully supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing spatial control adapters for text-to-image diffusion models lack adaptability to novel conditions and require high training costs when encountering substantially different spatial control tasks.

Method: UFC leverages analogy between query and support conditions to construct task-specific control features through a matching mechanism and updates on a small set of task-specific parameters, working with few image-condition pairs.

Result: Experiments on six novel spatial control tasks show UFC achieves fine-grained control with only 30 annotated examples, matching fully supervised baselines with just 0.1% of training data, and works across UNet and DiT architectures.

Conclusion: UFC provides an effective few-shot solution for adapting diffusion models to diverse spatial control tasks with minimal training data, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities across various diffusion backbones.

Abstract: Spatial conditioning in pretrained text-to-image diffusion models has
significantly improved fine-grained control over the structure of generated
images. However, existing control adapters exhibit limited adaptability and
incur high training costs when encountering novel spatial control conditions
that differ substantially from the training tasks. To address this limitation,
we propose Universal Few-Shot Control (UFC), a versatile few-shot control
adapter capable of generalizing to novel spatial conditions. Given a few
image-condition pairs of an unseen task and a query condition, UFC leverages
the analogy between query and support conditions to construct task-specific
control features, instantiated by a matching mechanism and an update on a small
set of task-specific parameters. Experiments on six novel spatial control tasks
show that UFC, fine-tuned with only 30 annotated examples of novel tasks,
achieves fine-grained control consistent with the spatial conditions. Notably,
when fine-tuned with 0.1% of the full training data, UFC achieves competitive
performance with the fully supervised baselines in various control tasks. We
also show that UFC is applicable agnostically to various diffusion backbones
and demonstrate its effectiveness on both UNet and DiT architectures. Code is

Motivation: Random masking in Masked Image Modeling overlooks anatomical object density in 3D medical images, limiting its effectiveness in medical image computing.

Method: Proposed HU-based Foreground Masking strategy that leverages Hounsfield Unit measurements to focus on intensity distribution of visceral organs while excluding non-tissue regions like air and fluid.

Result: Consistent performance improvements across five public 3D medical imaging datasets with Dice scores: BTCV:~84.64%, Flare22:~92.43%, MM-WHS:~90.67%, Amos22:~88.64%, BraTS:~78.55%.

Conclusion: Domain-centric MIM with anatomical-aware masking is crucial for effective representation learning in medical image segmentation, demonstrating significant performance gains over random masking approaches.

Abstract: While Masked Image Modeling (MIM) has revolutionized fields of computer
vision, its adoption in 3D medical image computing has been limited by the use
of random masking, which overlooks the density of anatomical objects. To
address this limitation, we enhance the pretext task with a simple yet
effective masking strategy. Leveraging Hounsfield Unit (HU) measurements, we
implement an HU-based Foreground Masking, which focuses on the intensity
distribution of visceral organs and excludes non-tissue regions, such as air
and fluid, that lack diagnostically meaningful features. Extensive experiments
on five public 3D medical imaging datasets demonstrate that our masking
consistently improves performance, both in quality of segmentation and Dice
score (BTCV:~84.64\%, Flare22:~92.43\%, MM-WHS:~90.67\%, Amos22:~88.64\%,
BraTS:~78.55\%). These results underscore the importance of domain-centric MIM
and suggest a promising direction for representation learning in medical image
segmentation. Implementation is available at github.com/AISeedHub/SubFore/.

*Peijin Xie,Shun Qian,Bingquan Liu,Dexin Wang,Lin Sun,Xiangzheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TextlessRAG is the first end-to-end framework for speech-based question answering over document images that eliminates ASR, TTS and OCR, using a fully textless pipeline with layout-aware reranking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Document images contain rich knowledge and spoken queries enable flexible applications, but no prior work has explored speech-based QA over visual documents without text conversion.

Method: End-to-end framework that directly interprets speech, retrieves relevant visual knowledge from document images, and generates answers without ASR/TTS/OCR. Includes layout-aware reranking to improve retrieval.

Result: Experiments show substantial improvements in both efficiency and accuracy compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: TextlessRAG advances speech-document QA by eliminating text conversion steps, and the authors release the first bilingual speech-document RAG dataset to support further research.

Abstract: Document images encapsulate a wealth of knowledge, while the portability of
spoken queries enables broader and flexible application scenarios. Yet, no
prior work has explored knowledge base question answering over visual document
images with queries provided directly in speech. We propose TextlessRAG, the
first end-to-end framework for speech-based question answering over large-scale
document images. Unlike prior methods, TextlessRAG eliminates ASR, TTS and OCR,
directly interpreting speech, retrieving relevant visual knowledge, and
generating answers in a fully textless pipeline. To further boost performance,
we integrate a layout-aware reranking mechanism to refine retrieval.
Experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in both efficiency and
accuracy. To advance research in this direction, we also release the first
bilingual speech--document RAG dataset, featuring Chinese and English voice
queries paired with multimodal document content. Both the dataset and our
pipeline will be made available at

### [44] [PanoLAM: Large Avatar Model for Gaussian Full-Head Synthesis from One-shot Unposed Image](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07552)
*Peng Li,Yisheng He,Yingdong Hu,Yuan Dong,Weihao Yuan,Yuan Liu,Zilong Dong,Yike Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fast feed-forward framework for Gaussian full-head synthesis from single unposed images using synthetic data and coarse-to-fine generation pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods rely on time-consuming GAN inversion and test-time optimization, which are slow for inference. There's also a lack of large-scale 3D head assets for training.

Method: Proposes a coarse-to-fine Gaussian head generation pipeline using transformer blocks for feature extraction, dual-branch framework combining spherical triplane and point-based features, and trains on synthetic data from 3D GANs.

Result: Framework enables fast reconstruction and rendering in a single forward pass, achieving effective Gaussian head reconstruction from single unposed images.

Conclusion: The approach shows effectiveness compared to existing work, providing efficient high-fidelity full-head synthesis without time-consuming optimization processes.

Abstract: We present a feed-forward framework for Gaussian full-head synthesis from a
single unposed image. Unlike previous work that relies on time-consuming GAN
inversion and test-time optimization, our framework can reconstruct the
Gaussian full-head model given a single unposed image in a single forward pass.
This enables fast reconstruction and rendering during inference. To mitigate
the lack of large-scale 3D head assets, we propose a large-scale synthetic
dataset from trained 3D GANs and train our framework using only synthetic data.
For efficient high-fidelity generation, we introduce a coarse-to-fine Gaussian
head generation pipeline, where sparse points from the FLAME model interact
with the image features by transformer blocks for feature extraction and coarse
shape reconstruction, which are then densified for high-fidelity
reconstruction. To fully leverage the prior knowledge residing in pretrained 3D
GANs for effective reconstruction, we propose a dual-branch framework that
effectively aggregates the structured spherical triplane feature and
unstructured point-based features for more effective Gaussian head
reconstruction. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our framework
towards existing work.

*Barkin Buyukcakir,Rocharles Cavalcante Fontenele,Reinhilde Jacobs,Jannick De Tobel,Patrick Thevissen,Dirk Vandermeulen,Peter Claes*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CGAT architecture for 3D shape recognition uses graph attention with explainable AI to provide transparent decision-making in high-stakes applications like dental age estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the black-box nature of deep learning models in high-stakes applications where trust and accountability are required, particularly for 3D shape recognition tasks.

Method: Class Node Graph Attention Network (CGAT) with graph attention convolutions and attention rollout visualization, using local mean curvature and distance to centroid as node features on 3D meshes from CBCT images.

Result: Models with directed edges to global CLS node produced intuitive attention maps and good classification performance (0.76 weighted F1 score). Feature combination slightly improved performance and provided more comprehensive visualizations.

Conclusion: CGAT generates human-understandable attention maps that enhance trust and facilitate expert validation, making it broadly applicable to graph-based classification tasks in high-stakes environments.

Abstract: Deep learning offers a promising avenue for automating many recognition tasks
in fields such as medicine and forensics. However, the black-box nature of
these models hinders their adoption in high-stakes applications where trust and
accountability are required. For 3D shape recognition tasks in particular, this
paper introduces the Class Node Graph Attention Network (CGAT) architecture to
address this need. Applied to 3D meshes of third molars derived from CBCT
images, for Demirjian stage allocation, CGAT utilizes graph attention
convolutions and an inherent attention mechanism, visualized via attention
rollout, to explain its decision-making process. We evaluated the local mean
curvature and distance to centroid node features, both individually and in
combination, as well as model depth, finding that models incorporating directed
edges to a global CLS node produced more intuitive attention maps, while also
yielding desirable classification performance. We analyzed the attention-based
explanations of the models, and their predictive performances to propose
optimal settings for the CGAT. The combination of local mean curvature and
distance to centroid as node features yielded a slight performance increase
with 0.76 weighted F1 score, and more comprehensive attention visualizations.
The CGAT architecture's ability to generate human-understandable attention maps
can enhance trust and facilitate expert validation of model decisions. While
demonstrated on dental data, CGAT is broadly applicable to graph-based
classification and regression tasks, promoting wider adoption of transparent
and competitive deep learning models in high-stakes environments.

*Robert Jöchl,Andreas Uhl*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Comprehensive review of temporal image forensics focusing on time-dependent traces from image acquisition pipelines, examining sensor defects and dust, highlighting content bias issues, and demonstrating how neural networks can be distracted from learning true age traces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a thorough overview of temporal image forensics techniques that estimate image age using time-dependent traces from acquisition pipelines, while addressing critical issues like content bias and verifying the reliability of existing methods.

Method: Analysis and review of previous works, re-implementation of methods when required, experimental verification of sensor defect properties (growth rate and spatial distribution), investigation of neural network feature learning, and demonstration of how networks can be distracted from learning age traces.

Result: Verification of in-field sensor defect properties, demonstration that some methods claiming to use sensor defects actually exploit content bias, deeper understanding of neural network feature learning in palmprint dating, and evidence showing neural networks can be easily distracted from learning genuine age traces.

Conclusion: Temporal image forensics faces significant challenges with content bias, and eXplainable AI methods are crucial for verifying technique reliability. The field requires more realistic forensic settings and careful validation to ensure methods genuinely exploit age-related traces rather than content artifacts.

Abstract: Temporal image forensics is the science of estimating the age of a digital
image. Usually, time-dependent traces (age traces) introduced by the image
acquisition pipeline are exploited for this purpose. In this review, a
comprehensive overview of the field of temporal image forensics based on
time-dependent traces from the image acquisition pipeline is given. This
includes a detailed insight into the properties of known age traces (i.e.,
in-field sensor defects and sensor dust) and temporal image forensics
techniques. Another key aspect of this work is to highlight the problem of
content bias and to illustrate how important eXplainable Artificial
Intelligence methods are to verify the reliability of temporal image forensics
techniques. Apart from reviewing material presented in previous works, in this
review: (i) a new (probably more realistic) forensic setting is proposed; (ii)
the main properties (growth rate and spatial distribution) of in-field sensor
defects are verified; (iii) it is shown that a method proposed to utilize
in-field sensor defects for image age approximation actually exploits other
traces (most likely content bias); (iv) the features learned by a neural
network dating palmprint images are further investigated; (v) it is shown how
easily a neural network can be distracted from learning age traces. For this
purpose, previous work is analyzed, re-implemented if required and experiments
are conducted.

*Yusuke Hirota,Ryo Hachiuma,Boyi Li,Ximing Lu,Michael Ross Boone,Boris Ivanovic,Yejin Choi,Marco Pavone,Yu-Chiang Frank Wang,Noa Garcia,Yuta Nakashima,Chao-Han Huck Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Current gender bias evaluations in vision-language models are unreliable because they're heavily influenced by spurious correlations between gender and non-gender features like objects/backgrounds, not actual gender bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether spurious features in gender bias benchmarks distort evaluation results and undermine the reliability of current bias assessment methods.

Method: Systematically perturb non-gender features across four benchmarks (COCO-gender, FACET, MIAP, PHASE) and various VLMs, using techniques like object masking and background blurring to quantify impact on bias scores.

Result: Minimal perturbations (10% object masking, weak background blurring) dramatically alter bias scores - up to 175% change in generative VLMs and 43% in CLIP variants, showing evaluations reflect spurious feature responses rather than actual gender bias.

Conclusion: Since creating spurious feature-free benchmarks is fundamentally challenging, bias metrics should be reported alongside feature-sensitivity measurements for more reliable gender bias assessment.

Abstract: Gender bias in vision-language foundation models (VLMs) raises concerns about
their safe deployment and is typically evaluated using benchmarks with gender
annotations on real-world images. However, as these benchmarks often contain
spurious correlations between gender and non-gender features, such as objects
and backgrounds, we identify a critical oversight in gender bias evaluation: Do
spurious features distort gender bias evaluation? To address this question, we
systematically perturb non-gender features across four widely used benchmarks
(COCO-gender, FACET, MIAP, and PHASE) and various VLMs to quantify their impact
on bias evaluation. Our findings reveal that even minimal perturbations, such
as masking just 10% of objects or weakly blurring backgrounds, can dramatically
alter bias scores, shifting metrics by up to 175% in generative VLMs and 43% in
CLIP variants. This suggests that current bias evaluations often reflect model
responses to spurious features rather than gender bias, undermining their
reliability. Since creating spurious feature-free benchmarks is fundamentally
challenging, we recommend reporting bias metrics alongside feature-sensitivity
measurements to enable a more reliable bias assessment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A data-efficient fine-tuning pipeline for 3D CT-based Med-VLMs adapted to 3D MRI for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, using synthetic reports from metadata and auxiliary MMSE score prediction tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Med-VLMs underutilize patient metadata, lack clinical diagnostic knowledge integration, require extensive computational resources, and have limited effectiveness on 3D medical imaging due to missing structural information.

Method: Two key innovations: 1) Convert structured metadata into synthetic reports to enrich textual input for better image-text alignment; 2) Add auxiliary token trained to predict MMSE score for additional supervision. Uses lightweight prompt tuning on both image and text modalities.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on two AD datasets using only 1,500 training images, outperforming existing methods fine-tuned on 10,000 images.

Conclusion: The proposed approach demonstrates data-efficient fine-tuning that effectively adapts 3D CT-based models to 3D MRI for Alzheimer's diagnosis while incorporating clinical knowledge through metadata utilization and auxiliary supervision.

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (Med-VLMs) have shown impressive results in
tasks such as report generation and visual question answering, but they still
face several limitations. Most notably, they underutilize patient metadata and
lack integration of clinical diagnostic knowledge. Moreover, most existing
models are typically trained from scratch or fine-tuned on large-scale 2D
image-text pairs, requiring extensive computational resources, and their
effectiveness on 3D medical imaging is often limited due to the absence of
structural information. To address these gaps, we propose a data-efficient
fine-tuning pipeline to adapt 3D CT-based Med-VLMs for 3D MRI and demonstrate
its application in Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. Our system introduces
two key innovations. First, we convert structured metadata into synthetic
reports, enriching textual input for improved image-text alignment. Second, we
add an auxiliary token trained to predict the mini-mental state examination
(MMSE) score, a widely used clinical measure of cognitive function that
correlates with AD severity. This provides additional supervision for
fine-tuning. Applying lightweight prompt tuning to both image and text
modalities, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on two AD
datasets using 1,500 training images, outperforming existing methods fine-tuned
on 10,000 images. Code will be released upon publication.

TL;DR: A self-supervised cross-encoder framework for neurodegenerative disease diagnosis that uses temporal continuity in longitudinal MRI scans to learn interpretable static and dynamic representations, achieving superior accuracy and strong generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for neurodegenerative disease diagnosis rely heavily on large labeled datasets and produce representations that lack interpretability, limiting clinical utility.

Method: Proposes a self-supervised framework that disentangles representations into static (contrastive learning) and dynamic (input-gradient regularization) components using temporal continuity in longitudinal MRI scans for supervision.

Result: Achieves superior classification accuracy on ADNI dataset, improved interpretability, and demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization on OASIS dataset and cross-task generalization on PPMI dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses data labeling requirements and interpretability challenges in neurodegenerative disease diagnosis while showing excellent generalization capabilities across different datasets and tasks.

Abstract: Deep learning has shown significant potential in diagnosing neurodegenerative
diseases from MRI data. However, most existing methods rely heavily on large
volumes of labeled data and often yield representations that lack
interpretability. To address both challenges, we propose a novel
self-supervised cross-encoder framework that leverages the temporal continuity
in longitudinal MRI scans for supervision. This framework disentangles learned
representations into two components: a static representation, constrained by
contrastive learning, which captures stable anatomical features; and a dynamic
representation, guided by input-gradient regularization, which reflects
temporal changes and can be effectively fine-tuned for downstream
classification tasks. Experimental results on the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate that our method achieves
superior classification accuracy and improved interpretability. Furthermore,
the learned representations exhibit strong zero-shot generalization on the Open
Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) dataset and cross-task generalization
on the Parkinson Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) dataset. The code for the
proposed method will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: Proposes Hermitian Symmetric Fourier Watermarking (SFW) to maintain frequency integrity in latent diffusion models, with center-aware embedding for cropping attack resistance, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic watermarking for LDMs suffers from detection performance degradation due to loss of frequency integrity and vulnerability to cropping attacks.

Method: Hermitian Symmetric Fourier Watermarking (SFW) enforces Hermitian symmetry to maintain frequency integrity, plus center-aware embedding strategy for robust information retention against cropping.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art verification and identification performance across various attack scenarios, highest detection accuracy while maintaining superior image fidelity (FID and CLIP scores).

Conclusion: SFW is an effective framework for balancing robustness and image fidelity, addressing inherent trade-offs in semantic watermarking.

Abstract: Semantic watermarking techniques for latent diffusion models (LDMs) are
robust against regeneration attacks, but often suffer from detection
performance degradation due to the loss of frequency integrity. To tackle this
problem, we propose a novel embedding method called Hermitian Symmetric Fourier
Watermarking (SFW), which maintains frequency integrity by enforcing Hermitian
symmetry. Additionally, we introduce a center-aware embedding strategy that
reduces the vulnerability of semantic watermarking due to cropping attacks by
ensuring robust information retention. To validate our approach, we apply these
techniques to existing semantic watermarking schemes, enhancing their
frequency-domain structures for better robustness and retrieval accuracy.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our methods achieve state-of-the-art
verification and identification performance, surpassing previous approaches
across various attack scenarios. Ablation studies confirm the impact of SFW on
detection capabilities, the effectiveness of the center-aware embedding against
cropping, and how message capacity influences identification accuracy. Notably,
our method achieves the highest detection accuracy while maintaining superior
image fidelity, as evidenced by FID and CLIP scores. Conclusively, our proposed
SFW is shown to be an effective framework for balancing robustness and image
fidelity, addressing the inherent trade-offs in semantic watermarking. Code

TL;DR: Novel deep learning framework TenRPCANet for small moving target detection using tensor-based low-rank and sparse decomposition, achieving state-of-the-art performance on infrared and space object detection tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small moving target detection is crucial for defense applications but challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratios, ambiguous visual cues, and cluttered backgrounds. Existing approaches lack robustness in complex environments as they rely on target-specific features or motion cues.

Method: Reformulate detection as tensor-based low-rank and sparse decomposition. Propose TenRPCANet with tokenization strategy that enforces multi-order tensor low-rank priors through self-attention mechanism. Design feature refinement module inspired by sparse component update in tensor RPCA to enhance target saliency.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on two highly distinct and challenging tasks: multi-frame infrared small target detection and space object detection.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates both effectiveness and generalizability, requiring minimal assumptions about target characteristics while leveraging inherent low-rank structures in cluttered backgrounds as stable priors for detection.

Abstract: Small moving target detection is crucial for many defense applications but
remains highly challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratios, ambiguous visual
cues, and cluttered backgrounds. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning
framework that differs fundamentally from existing approaches, which often rely
on target-specific features or motion cues and tend to lack robustness in
complex environments. Our key insight is that small target detection and
background discrimination are inherently coupled, even cluttered video
backgrounds often exhibit strong low-rank structures that can serve as stable
priors for detection. We reformulate the task as a tensor-based low-rank and
sparse decomposition problem and conduct a theoretical analysis of the
background, target, and noise components to guide model design. Building on
these insights, we introduce TenRPCANet, a deep neural network that requires
minimal assumptions about target characteristics. Specifically, we propose a
tokenization strategy that implicitly enforces multi-order tensor low-rank
priors through a self-attention mechanism. This mechanism captures both local
and non-local self-similarity to model the low-rank background without relying
on explicit iterative optimization. In addition, inspired by the sparse
component update in tensor RPCA, we design a feature refinement module to
enhance target saliency. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on two highly distinct and challenging tasks: multi-frame infrared
small target detection and space object detection. These results demonstrate
both the effectiveness and the generalizability of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous deep image registration methods struggle with real scenes containing depth disparities due to their inherent limitations with single homography, multi-grid homography, or thin-plate spline approaches.

Method: Proposes EDFFDNet with exponential-decay free-form deformation for efficiency, Adaptive Sparse Motion Aggregator (ASMA) to replace MLP motion aggregators, and progressive correlation refinement strategy for coarse-to-fine motion estimation.

Result: Reduces parameters by 70.5%, memory by 32.6%, and total runtime by 33.7% while achieving 0.5 dB PSNR gain over state-of-the-art. EDFFDNet-2 further improves PSNR by 1.06 dB with local refinement.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates strong generalization across datasets and outperforms previous deep learning approaches while maintaining lower computational costs.

Abstract: Previous deep image registration methods that employ single homography,
multi-grid homography, or thin-plate spline often struggle with real scenes
containing depth disparities due to their inherent limitations. To address
this, we propose an Exponential-Decay Free-Form Deformation Network (EDFFDNet),
which employs free-form deformation with an exponential-decay basis function.
This design achieves higher efficiency and performs well in scenes with depth
disparities, benefiting from its inherent locality. We also introduce an
Adaptive Sparse Motion Aggregator (ASMA), which replaces the MLP motion
aggregator used in previous methods. By transforming dense interactions into
sparse ones, ASMA reduces parameters and improves accuracy. Additionally, we
propose a progressive correlation refinement strategy that leverages
global-local correlation patterns for coarse-to-fine motion estimation, further
enhancing efficiency and accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that EDFFDNet
reduces parameters, memory, and total runtime by 70.5%, 32.6%, and 33.7%,
respectively, while achieving a 0.5 dB PSNR gain over the state-of-the-art
method. With an additional local refinement stage,EDFFDNet-2 further improves
PSNR by 1.06 dB while maintaining lower computational costs. Our method also
demonstrates strong generalization ability across datasets, outperforming
previous deep learning methods.

TL;DR: Novel adversarial training framework that reduces inter-class feature overlap by projecting out inter-class dependencies, improving both robustness and clean accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard adversarial training fails to address inter-class feature overlap, which is a significant contributor to adversarial vulnerability in deep neural networks.

Method: Identifies nearest inter-class neighbors for adversarial samples and removes projections onto these neighbors to enforce feature separability, with theoretical analysis showing reduced Lipschitz constant and Rademacher complexity.

Result: Strong performance competitive with leading adversarial training techniques on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN benchmarks, achieving significant improvements in both robust and clean accuracy.

Conclusion: Explicitly addressing inter-class feature proximity is crucial for enhancing adversarial robustness in deep neural networks.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have exhibited impressive performance in image
classification tasks but remain vulnerable to adversarial examples. Standard
adversarial training enhances robustness but typically fails to explicitly
address inter-class feature overlap, a significant contributor to adversarial
susceptibility. In this work, we introduce a novel adversarial training
framework that actively mitigates inter-class proximity by projecting out
inter-class dependencies from adversarial and clean samples in the feature
space. Specifically, our approach first identifies the nearest inter-class
neighbors for each adversarial sample and subsequently removes projections onto
these neighbors to enforce stronger feature separability. Theoretically, we
demonstrate that our proposed logits correction reduces the Lipschitz constant
of neural networks, thereby lowering the Rademacher complexity, which directly
contributes to improved generalization and robustness. Extensive experiments
across standard benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN show that
our method demonstrates strong performance that is competitive with leading
adversarial training techniques, highlighting significant achievements in both
robust and clean accuracy. Our findings reveal the importance of addressing
inter-class feature proximity explicitly to bolster adversarial robustness in
DNNs.

TL;DR: A language model agent with video modules and critic mechanism achieves strong performance on complex video reasoning tasks where previous methods struggle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video perception models perform well on short clips but struggle with complex reasoning on longer videos. The paper aims to leverage existing perception capabilities for more complex video reasoning tasks.

Method: Developed a large language model agent with access to video modules as subagents/tools. The agent dynamically determines subsequent steps based on module results, and includes a critic to distinguish successful from unsuccessful sequences.

Result: The combination of agent and critic achieves strong performance on LVBench, Neptune, and ActivityNet-RTL datasets for complex video reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Dynamic agent-based approach with critic mechanism successfully leverages existing video perception capabilities to handle complex video reasoning where fixed procedural methods fail.

Abstract: Video understanding has seen significant progress in recent years, with
models' performance on perception from short clips continuing to rise. Yet,
multiple recent benchmarks, such as LVBench, Neptune, and ActivityNet-RTL, show
performance wanes for tasks requiring complex reasoning on videos as queries
grow more complex and videos grow longer. In this work, we ask: can existing
perception capabilities be leveraged to successfully perform more complex video
reasoning? In particular, we develop a large language model agent given access
to video modules as subagents or tools. Rather than following a fixed procedure
to solve queries as in previous work such as Visual Programming, ViperGPT, and
MoReVQA, the agent uses the results of each call to a module to determine
subsequent steps. Inspired by work in the textual reasoning domain, we
introduce a critic to distinguish between instances of successful and
unsuccessful sequences from the agent. We show that the combination of our
agent and critic achieve strong performance on the previously-mentioned
datasets.

*Chunhang Zheng,Zichang Ren,Dou Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SEEC proposes a segmentation-assisted multi-entropy model framework for lossless image compression that uses semantic segmentation to guide multiple specialized entropy models for different image regions, achieving state-of-the-art compression ratios with minimal latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional learned image compression methods use a single entropy model for the entire image, which fails to capture the diverse statistical characteristics of different semantic regions, limiting compression performance.

Method: The framework extracts image features, applies semantic segmentation to identify different regions, assigns specialized entropy models to each region, and uses multi-channel discrete logistic mixture likelihood to model pixel value distributions effectively.

Result: Experimental results show SEEC achieves state-of-the-art compression ratios on benchmark datasets with minimal encoding/decoding latency, and supports Regions of Interest coding based on segmentation masks.

Conclusion: SEEC demonstrates that using multiple entropy models guided by semantic segmentation significantly improves lossless image compression performance by better capturing region-specific statistical properties.

Abstract: Recently, learned image compression has attracted considerable attention due
to its superior performance over traditional methods. However, most existing
approaches employ a single entropy model to estimate the probability
distribution of pixel values across the entire image, which limits their
ability to capture the diverse statistical characteristics of different
semantic regions. To overcome this limitation, we propose Segmentation-Assisted
Multi-Entropy Models for Lossless Image Compression (SEEC). Our framework
utilizes semantic segmentation to guide the selection and adaptation of
multiple entropy models, enabling more accurate probability distribution
estimation for distinct semantic regions. Specifically, SEEC first extracts
image features and then applies semantic segmentation to identify different
regions, each assigned a specialized entropy model to better capture its unique
statistical properties. Finally, a multi-channel discrete logistic mixture
likelihood is employed to model the pixel value distributions effectively.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SEEC achieves
state-of-the-art compression ratios while introducing only minimal encoding and
decoding latency. With superior performance, the proposed model also supports
Regions of Interest (ROIs) coding condition on the provided segmentation mask.

Motivation: Stroke has high mortality rates (5.5M annual deaths) with 5-25% recurrence in first year and 40% mortality for relapses. Early detection of at-risk patients is crucial for therapy planning to reduce recurrence rates.

Method: Collected 3D intracranial CTA image data, heart diseases, age, and gender from stroke patients (2010-2024). Trained single- and multimodal deep learning networks for binary relapse detection (Task 1) and relapse-free survival time prediction with classification (Task 2). Used multimodal XSRD-net with vision:tabular modality weighting of 0.68:0.32.

Result: Tabular data achieved AUC 0.84 for binary relapse detection. Multimodal model reached c-index of 0.68 for relapse prediction and AUC of 0.71. Interpretability analysis revealed link between heart diseases (tabular) and carotid arteries (vision) for relapse detection and RFS prediction.

Conclusion: Multimodal deep learning effectively predicts stroke recurrence risk, with interpretability highlighting important clinical-radiological correlations. Ongoing data collection and model retraining will strengthen these findings for improved stroke relapse prediction.

Abstract: Stroke is the second most frequent cause of death world wide with an annual
mortality of around 5.5 million. Recurrence rates of stroke are between 5 and
25% in the first year. As mortality rates for relapses are extraordinarily high
(40%) it is of utmost importance to reduce the recurrence rates. We address
this issue by detecting patients at risk of stroke recurrence at an early stage
in order to enable appropriate therapy planning. To this end we collected 3D
intracranial CTA image data and recorded concomitant heart diseases, the age
and the gender of stroke patients between 2010 and 2024. We trained single- and
multimodal deep learning based neural networks for binary relapse detection
(Task 1) and for relapse free survival (RFS) time prediction together with a
subsequent classification (Task 2). The separation of relapse from non-relapse
patients (Task 1) could be solved with tabular data (AUC on test dataset:
0.84). However, for the main task, the regression (Task 2), our multimodal
XSRD-net processed the modalities vision:tabular with 0.68:0.32 according to
modality contribution measures. The c-index with respect to relapses for the
multimodal model reached 0.68, and the AUC is 0.71 for the test dataset. Final,
deeper interpretability analysis results could highlight a link between both
heart diseases (tabular) and carotid arteries (vision) for the detection of
relapses and the prediction of the RFS time. This is a central outcome that we
strive to strengthen with ongoing data collection and model retraining.

### [57] [HairGS: Hair Strand Reconstruction based on 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07774)
*Yimin Pan,Matthias Nießner,Tobias Kirschstein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Extends 3D Gaussian Splatting for strand-level hair reconstruction from multi-view images using a multi-stage pipeline with novel merging and refinement techniques, plus a new topological evaluation metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human hair reconstruction is challenging but important for VR and digital human modeling. Existing methods focus on geometric quality but neglect strand connectivity and topology.

Method: Multi-stage pipeline: 1) reconstructs detailed hair geometry using differentiable Gaussian rasterizer, 2) merges Gaussian segments into coherent strands via novel merging scheme, 3) refines and grows strands under photometric supervision.

Result: Robustly handles wide range of hairstyles, achieves efficient reconstruction (typically within one hour), demonstrates effectiveness on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The method provides strand-level hair reconstruction with topological accuracy, addressing limitations of previous geometric-focused approaches while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Human hair reconstruction is a challenging problem in computer vision, with
growing importance for applications in virtual reality and digital human
modeling. Recent advances in 3D Gaussians Splatting (3DGS) provide efficient
and explicit scene representations that naturally align with the structure of
hair strands. In this work, we extend the 3DGS framework to enable strand-level
hair geometry reconstruction from multi-view images. Our multi-stage pipeline
first reconstructs detailed hair geometry using a differentiable Gaussian
rasterizer, then merges individual Gaussian segments into coherent strands
through a novel merging scheme, and finally refines and grows the strands under
photometric supervision.
  While existing methods typically evaluate reconstruction quality at the
geometric level, they often neglect the connectivity and topology of hair
strands. To address this, we propose a new evaluation metric that serves as a
proxy for assessing topological accuracy in strand reconstruction. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our
method robustly handles a wide range of hairstyles and achieves efficient
reconstruction, typically completing within one hour.

*Hugo Blanc,Jean-Emmanuel Deschaud,Alexis Paljic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RayGaussX accelerates RayGauss for real-time novel-view synthesis by introducing volumetric rendering acceleration techniques, enhanced ray coherence, scale regularization, and improved densification, achieving 5-12x faster training and 50-80x higher FPS while improving visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RayGauss achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality but has high computational costs that prevent real-time rendering on real-world scenes, necessitating acceleration methods.

Method: Builds on RayGauss with volumetric rendering acceleration (empty-space skipping, adaptive sampling), enhanced ray coherence, scale regularization to reduce false intersections, and new densification criterion for better density distribution.

Result: Achieves 5x to 12x faster training and 50x to 80x higher rendering speeds (FPS) on real-world datasets while improving visual quality by up to +0.56 dB in PSNR.

Conclusion: RayGaussX successfully accelerates both training and inference of RayGauss while maintaining and even improving rendering quality, enabling real-time performance on real-world scenes.

Abstract: RayGauss has achieved state-of-the-art rendering quality for novel-view
synthesis on synthetic and indoor scenes by representing radiance and density
fields with irregularly distributed elliptical basis functions, rendered via
volume ray casting using a Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH). However, its
computational cost prevents real-time rendering on real-world scenes. Our
approach, RayGaussX, builds on RayGauss by introducing key contributions that
accelerate both training and inference. Specifically, we incorporate volumetric
rendering acceleration strategies such as empty-space skipping and adaptive
sampling, enhance ray coherence, and introduce scale regularization to reduce
false-positive intersections. Additionally, we propose a new densification
criterion that improves density distribution in distant regions, leading to
enhanced graphical quality on larger scenes. As a result, RayGaussX achieves 5x
to 12x faster training and 50x to 80x higher rendering speeds (FPS) on
real-world datasets while improving visual quality by up to +0.56 dB in PSNR.

*Maja Schlereth,Moritz Schillinger,Katharina Breininger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Self-supervised neural network for fusing two orthogonal anisotropic low-resolution MR images to reconstruct high-resolution anatomical details without requiring high-resolution training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Balancing MR image quality with acquisition time and patient comfort is challenging. Current practice of analyzing individual low-resolution scans is time-consuming and can lead to inaccurate interpretation.

Method: Multi-view neural network trained in self-supervised manner with sparse coordinate-based loss, enabling integration of low-resolution images with arbitrary scaling. Uses patient-agnostic offline and patient-specific online phases.

Result: Achieves comparable or improved super-resolution performance compared to state-of-the-art self-supervised methods for different upsampling scales, with 10x speed-up for patient-specific reconstruction.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides efficient high-quality MR image reconstruction from orthogonal low-resolution scans without requiring high-resolution training data, significantly improving both quality and processing speed.

Abstract: Acquiring images in high resolution is often a challenging task. Especially
in the medical sector, image quality has to be balanced with acquisition time
and patient comfort. To strike a compromise between scan time and quality for
Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging, two anisotropic scans with different
low-resolution (LR) orientations can be acquired. Typically, LR scans are
analyzed individually by radiologists, which is time consuming and can lead to
inaccurate interpretation. To tackle this, we propose a novel approach for
fusing two orthogonal anisotropic LR MR images to reconstruct anatomical
details in a unified representation. Our multi-view neural network is trained
in a self-supervised manner, without requiring corresponding high-resolution
(HR) data. To optimize the model, we introduce a sparse coordinate-based loss,
enabling the integration of LR images with arbitrary scaling. We evaluate our
method on MR images from two independent cohorts. Our results demonstrate
comparable or even improved super-resolution (SR) performance compared to
state-of-the-art (SOTA) self-supervised SR methods for different upsampling
scales. By combining a patient-agnostic offline and a patient-specific online
phase, we achieve a substantial speed-up of up to ten times for
patient-specific reconstruction while achieving similar or better SR quality.

### [60] [SplatFill: 3D Scene Inpainting via Depth-Guided Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07809)
*Mahtab Dahaghin,Milind G. Padalkar,Matteo Toso,Alessio Del Bue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SplatFill is a novel depth-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting inpainting method that achieves state-of-the-art results with improved efficiency, using joint depth-based supervision and consistency-aware refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting struggles with inpainting missing regions, often producing blurry details, artifacts, and inconsistent geometry in occluded or edited areas.

Method: Combines joint depth-based and object-based supervision for accurate Gaussian placement, plus a consistency-aware refinement scheme that selectively corrects inconsistent regions without disrupting the scene.

Result: Outperforms existing NeRF-based and 3DGS-based methods in visual fidelity on SPIn-NeRF dataset, reduces training time by 24.5%, and delivers sharper details with fewer artifacts across challenging viewpoints.

Conclusion: SplatFill provides an effective solution for high-quality 3D scene inpainting with both superior perceptual quality and improved computational efficiency compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled the creation of highly realistic 3D
scene representations from sets of multi-view images. However, inpainting
missing regions, whether due to occlusion or scene editing, remains a
challenging task, often leading to blurry details, artifacts, and inconsistent
geometry. In this work, we introduce SplatFill, a novel depth-guided approach
for 3DGS scene inpainting that achieves state-of-the-art perceptual quality and
improved efficiency. Our method combines two key ideas: (1) joint depth-based
and object-based supervision to ensure inpainted Gaussians are accurately
placed in 3D space and aligned with surrounding geometry, and (2) we propose a
consistency-aware refinement scheme that selectively identifies and corrects
inconsistent regions without disrupting the rest of the scene. Evaluations on
the SPIn-NeRF dataset demonstrate that SplatFill not only surpasses existing
NeRF-based and 3DGS-based inpainting methods in visual fidelity but also
reduces training time by 24.5%. Qualitative results show our method delivers
sharper details, fewer artifacts, and greater coherence across challenging
viewpoints.

*Zhuoxu Huang,Mingqi Gao,Jungong Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PLM bridges representation gap between LLMs and 3D point clouds using Object-centric Discriminative Representation and Geometric Reactivation Decoder, achieving significant improvements in 3D segmentation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address representation misalignment between LLMs (semantic tokens) and 3D point clouds (dense geometry), which limits input/output alignment and fine-grained accuracy in prior methods.

Method: Introduces Object-centric Discriminative Representation (OcDR) for object-centric tokens with hard negative-aware training, and Geometric Reactivation Decoder (GRD) to combine LLM-inferred geometry with dense features.

Result: +7.3 mIoU on ScanNetv2 and +6.0 mIoU on Multi3DRefer for 3D referring segmentation, with consistent gains across 7 benchmarks spanning 4 different tasks.

Conclusion: PLM demonstrates effectiveness of comprehensive object-centric reasoning for robust 3D understanding without requiring large-scale pre-alignment.

Abstract: 3D object segmentation with Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a
prevailing paradigm due to its broad semantics, task flexibility, and strong
generalization. However, this paradigm is hindered by representation
misalignment: LLMs process high-level semantic tokens, whereas 3D point clouds
convey only dense geometric structures. In prior methods, misalignment limits
both input and output. At the input stage, dense point patches require heavy
pre-alignment, weakening object-level semantics and confusing similar
distractors. At the output stage, predictions depend only on dense features
without explicit geometric cues, leading to a loss of fine-grained accuracy. To
address these limitations, we present the Point Linguist Model (PLM), a general
framework that bridges the representation gap between LLMs and dense 3D point
clouds without requiring large-scale pre-alignment between 3D-text or
3D-images. Specifically, we introduce Object-centric Discriminative
Representation (OcDR), which learns object-centric tokens that capture target
semantics and scene relations under a hard negative-aware training objective.
This mitigates the misalignment between LLM tokens and 3D points, enhances
resilience to distractors, and facilitates semantic-level reasoning within
LLMs. For accurate segmentation, we introduce the Geometric Reactivation
Decoder (GRD), which predicts masks by combining OcDR tokens carrying
LLM-inferred geometry with corresponding dense features, preserving
comprehensive dense features throughout the pipeline. Extensive experiments
show that PLM achieves significant improvements of +7.3 mIoU on ScanNetv2 and
+6.0 mIoU on Multi3DRefer for 3D referring segmentation, with consistent gains
across 7 benchmarks spanning 4 different tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness
of comprehensive object-centric reasoning for robust 3D understanding.

demonstrate that the proposed ensemble approach achieves superior performance
with an overall accuracy of 95%, IoU of 0.6, and F1-score of 74% on the test
dataset. The model successfully identifies burned areas across diverse
ecosystems with complex background, showing particular strength in detecting
partially burned vegetation and fire boundaries and its transferability and
high generalization in burned area mapping. This research contributes to the
advancement of automated fire damage assessment and provides a scalable
solution for global burn area monitoring using the AlphaEarth dataset.

### [63] [D-LEAF: Localizing and Correcting Hallucinations in Multimodal LLMs via Layer-to-head Attention Diagnostics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07864)
*Tiancheng Yang,Lin Zhang,Jiaye Lin,Guimin Hu,Di Wang,Lijie Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: D-LEAF method dynamically detects and corrects hallucinations in MLLMs using attention analysis, achieving 53% improvement in captioning and 4% boost in VQA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs suffer from hallucinations where generated text conflicts with visual input, and existing attention-based methods fail to accurately localize problematic layers and heads.

Method: Introduces Layer Image Attention Entropy (LIAE) to flag anomalous layers and Image Attention Focus (IAF) to score attention heads, then uses Dynamic Layer-wise Entropy and Attention Fusion (D-LEAF) for dynamic error correction during inference.

Result: 53% relative improvement on standard captioning benchmarks, and approximately 4% improvement in both accuracy and F1-score on VQA tasks with negligible overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed attention-guided diagnostics and D-LEAF method effectively suppress hallucinations while preserving efficiency, providing a task-agnostic solution for MLLM error correction.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on tasks
like image captioning and visual question answering, but remain prone to
hallucinations, where generated text conflicts with the visual input. Prior
work links this partly to insufficient visual attention, but existing
attention-based detectors and mitigation typically apply uniform adjustments
across layers and heads, obscuring where errors originate. In this paper, we
first show these methods fail to accurately localize problematic layers. Then,
we introduce two diagnostics: Layer Image Attention Entropy (LIAE) which flags
anomalous layers, and Image Attention Focus (IAF) which scores attention heads
within those layers. Analysis shows that LIAE pinpoints faulty layers and IAF
reliably ranks heads that warrant correction. Guided by these signals, we
propose Dynamic Layer-wise Entropy and Attention Fusion (D-LEAF), a
task-agnostic, attention-guided method that dynamically localizes and corrects
errors during inference with negligible overhead. Results show our D-LEAF
delivers a 53% relative improvement on standard captioning benchmarks, and on
VQA both accuracy and F1-score improve by approximately 4%, substantially
suppressing hallucinations while preserving efficiency.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To increase transparency in AI models and provide stronger safeguards for security, privacy, and copyright protection by enabling detection of training data usage.

Method: Multitask learning approach training both the original model and a secondary MINT Model that uses intermediate activation maps to identify training data through specialized MINT layers.

Result: Achieves over 80% accuracy in detecting training data usage across various neural network architectures (MobileNet to Vision Transformers) on 5 public benchmarks, significantly outperforming previous approaches.

Conclusion: Active MINT successfully enhances model auditability by incorporating detection capabilities directly into the training process, contributing to improved AI transparency and protection mechanisms.

Abstract: Active Membership Inference Test (aMINT) is a method designed to detect
whether given data were used during the training of machine learning models. In
Active MINT, we propose a novel multitask learning process that involves
training simultaneously two models: the original or Audited Model, and a
secondary model, referred to as the MINT Model, responsible for identifying the
data used for training the Audited Model. This novel multi-task learning
approach has been designed to incorporate the auditability of the model as an
optimization objective during the training process of neural networks. The
proposed approach incorporates intermediate activation maps as inputs to the
MINT layers, which are trained to enhance the detection of training data. We
present results using a wide range of neural networks, from lighter
architectures such as MobileNet to more complex ones such as Vision
Transformers, evaluated in 5 public benchmarks. Our proposed Active MINT
achieves over 80% accuracy in detecting if given data was used for training,
significantly outperforming previous approaches in the literature. Our aMINT
and related methodological developments contribute to increasing transparency
in AI models, facilitating stronger safeguards in AI deployments to achieve
proper security, privacy, and copyright protection.

### [65] [Object-level Correlation for Few-Shot Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07917)
*Chunlin Wen,Yu Zhang,Jie Fan,Hongyuan Zhu,Xiu-Shen Wei,Yijun Wang,Zhiqiang Kou,Shuzhou Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OCNet introduces object-level correlation for few-shot semantic segmentation, addressing background noise by matching support target objects with query general objects instead of entire query images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FSS methods build image-level correlations that contain hard pixel noise from irrelevant background objects, leading to background overfitting. Biological vision processes suggest object-level identification is more effective in low-data regimes.

Method: Object-level Correlation Network (OCNet) with General Object Mining Module (GOMM) to construct query general object features using saliency and similarity cues, and Correlation Construction Module (CCM) to establish object-level correlation by matching target prototypes with general object features.

Result: Extensive experiments on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i show state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: Object-level correlation effectively mines query target features while suppressing hard pixel noise, outperforming traditional image-level correlation approaches in few-shot semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) aims to segment objects of novel
categories in the query images given only a few annotated support samples.
Existing methods primarily build the image-level correlation between the
support target object and the entire query image. However, this correlation
contains the hard pixel noise, \textit{i.e.}, irrelevant background objects,
that is intractable to trace and suppress, leading to the overfitting of the
background. To address the limitation of this correlation, we imitate the
biological vision process to identify novel objects in the object-level
information. Target identification in the general objects is more valid than in
the entire image, especially in the low-data regime. Inspired by this, we
design an Object-level Correlation Network (OCNet) by establishing the
object-level correlation between the support target object and query general
objects, which is mainly composed of the General Object Mining Module (GOMM)
and Correlation Construction Module (CCM). Specifically, GOMM constructs the
query general object feature by learning saliency and high-level similarity
cues, where the general objects include the irrelevant background objects and
the target foreground object. Then, CCM establishes the object-level
correlation by allocating the target prototypes to match the general object
feature. The generated object-level correlation can mine the query target
feature and suppress the hard pixel noise for the final prediction. Extensive
experiments on PASCAL-${5}^{i}$ and COCO-${20}^{i}$ show that our model
achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous optimization methods struggle with physically plausible reconstruction results due to lack of prior knowledge about human-object interactions.

Method: Uses diffusion priors and score-guided sampling to reconstruct conditional distribution of human and object poses. Incorporates contact-driven iterative refinement to enhance contact plausibility and physical constraints during denoising.

Result: Superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmarks, achieving precise and robust improvement in joint human-object interaction reconstruction.

Conclusion: ScoreHOI effectively addresses the limitations of previous methods by leveraging diffusion priors and physical constraints, demonstrating significant advancements in human-object interaction comprehension.

Abstract: Joint reconstruction of human-object interaction marks a significant
milestone in comprehending the intricate interrelations between humans and
their surrounding environment. Nevertheless, previous optimization methods
often struggle to achieve physically plausible reconstruction results due to
the lack of prior knowledge about human-object interactions. In this paper, we
introduce ScoreHOI, an effective diffusion-based optimizer that introduces
diffusion priors for the precise recovery of human-object interactions. By
harnessing the controllability within score-guided sampling, the diffusion
model can reconstruct a conditional distribution of human and object pose given
the image observation and object feature. During inference, the ScoreHOI
effectively improves the reconstruction results by guiding the denoising
process with specific physical constraints. Furthermore, we propose a
contact-driven iterative refinement approach to enhance the contact
plausibility and improve the reconstruction accuracy. Extensive evaluations on
standard benchmarks demonstrate ScoreHOI's superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its ability to achieve a precise and
robust improvement in joint human-object interaction reconstruction.

TL;DR: ToothMCL is the first multimodal pretraining framework for tooth segmentation that combines CBCT and IOS data using contrastive learning, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 12% improvement for CBCT and 8% for IOS segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tooth segmentation methods lack rigorous validation, demonstrate limited performance, and have poor clinical applicability despite the growing importance of digital dentistry.

Method: ToothMCL uses multimodal contrastive learning to integrate volumetric (CBCT) and surface-based (IOS) modalities, capturing modality-invariant representations for precise multi-class segmentation and FDI tooth numbering. Created CBCT-IOS3.8K dataset with 3,867 patients.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 12% improvement for CBCT segmentation and 8% for IOS segmentation in Dice Similarity Coefficient. Consistently outperforms existing approaches across tooth groups and demonstrates robust generalizability.

Conclusion: ToothMCL represents a significant advancement in digital dentistry by providing accurate multimodal tooth segmentation with strong clinical applicability and generalizability across diverse imaging conditions.

Abstract: Digital dentistry represents a transformative shift in modern dental
practice. The foundational step in this transformation is the accurate digital
representation of the patient's dentition, which is obtained from segmented
Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) and Intraoral Scans (IOS). Despite the
growing interest in digital dental technologies, existing segmentation
methodologies frequently lack rigorous validation and demonstrate limited
performance and clinical applicability. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first work to introduce a multimodal pretraining framework for tooth
segmentation. We present ToothMCL, a Tooth Multimodal Contrastive Learning for
pretraining that integrates volumetric (CBCT) and surface-based (IOS)
modalities. By capturing modality-invariant representations through multimodal
contrastive learning, our approach effectively models fine-grained anatomical
features, enabling precise multi-class segmentation and accurate identification
of F\'ed\'eration Dentaire Internationale (FDI) tooth numbering. Along with the
framework, we curated CBCT-IOS3.8K, the largest paired CBCT and IOS dataset to
date, comprising 3,867 patients. We then evaluated ToothMCL on a comprehensive
collection of independent datasets, representing the largest and most diverse
evaluation to date. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
internal and external testing, with an increase of 12\% for CBCT segmentation
and 8\% for IOS segmentation in the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC).
Furthermore, ToothMCL consistently surpasses existing approaches in tooth
groups and demonstrates robust generalizability across varying imaging
conditions and clinical scenarios.

TL;DR: This paper addresses performance bottlenecks in object detection on consumer hardware by introducing a Two-Pass Adaptive Inference algorithm that achieves 1.85x speedup with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a gap between benchmark performance of object detectors and their practical viability on consumer-grade hardware, where system-level bottlenecks rather than compute limitations dominate performance.

Method: Two-Pass Adaptive Inference algorithm that uses a fast low-resolution pass and only escalates to high-resolution model pass when detection confidence is low, without requiring architectural changes.

Result: On a 5000-image COCO dataset, the method achieves 1.85x speedup over PyTorch Early-Exit baseline with only 5.51% mAP loss.

Conclusion: The work provides a practical blueprint for deploying real-time AI on consumer devices by shifting focus from pure model optimization to hardware-aware inference strategies that maximize throughput.

Abstract: As local AI grows in popularity, there is a critical gap between the
benchmark performance of object detectors and their practical viability on
consumer-grade hardware. While models like YOLOv10s promise real-time speeds,
these metrics are typically achieved on high-power, desktop-class GPUs. This
paper reveals that on resource-constrained systems, such as laptops with RTX
4060 GPUs, performance is not compute-bound but is instead dominated by
system-level bottlenecks, as illustrated by a simple bottleneck test. To
overcome this hardware-level constraint, we introduce a Two-Pass Adaptive
Inference algorithm, a model-independent approach that requires no
architectural changes. This study mainly focuses on adaptive inference
strategies and undertakes a comparative analysis of architectural early-exit
and resolution-adaptive routing, highlighting their respective trade-offs
within a unified evaluation framework. The system uses a fast, low-resolution
pass and only escalates to a high-resolution model pass when detection
confidence is low. On a 5000-image COCO dataset, our method achieves a 1.85x
speedup over a PyTorch Early-Exit baseline, with a modest mAP loss of 5.51%.
This work provides a practical and reproducible blueprint for deploying
high-performance, real-time AI on consumer-grade devices by shifting the focus
from pure model optimization to hardware-aware inference strategies that
maximize throughput.

performance of existing state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction algorithms for
dynamic scenes, focusing on their ability to generate geometrically accurate
models with high-fidelity. To support our evaluation, we developed a simulation
environment using Isaac Sim to generate physics-accurate 2D image sequences of
tumbling satellite under realistic orbital lighting conditions. Our preliminary
results on static scenes using Neuralangelo demonstrate promising
reconstruction quality. The generated 3D meshes closely match the original CAD
models with minimal errors and artifacts when compared using Cloud Compare
(CC). The reconstructed models were able to capture critical fine details for
mission planning. This provides a baseline for our ongoing evaluation of
dynamic scene reconstruction.

*Kimiaki Shirahama,Miki Yanobu,Kaduki Yamashita,Miho Ohsaki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a decoder using guided diffusion to generate images matching user-specified DNN features, enabling analysis of what attributes are encoded in neural network feature spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the black-box nature of DNNs by developing a method to visualize and understand what visual attributes are encoded in specific features of deep neural networks.

Method: Implemented as a guided diffusion model that guides reverse image generation to minimize Euclidean distance between generated image features and target features from pre-trained DNNs like CLIP, ResNet-50, and vision transformers.

Result: Generated images have features remarkably similar to user-specified ones, revealing valuable insights into DNN feature spaces without additional training, running on single commercial GPU.

Conclusion: The decoder successfully provides interpretability into DNN feature spaces by generating images that match specified features, demonstrating practical utility for analyzing various vision models.

Abstract: One of the key issues in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is the black-box nature
of their internal feature extraction process. Targeting vision-related domains,
this paper focuses on analysing the feature space of a DNN by proposing a
decoder that can generate images whose features are guaranteed to closely match
a user-specified feature. Owing to this guarantee that is missed in past
studies, our decoder allows us to evidence which of various attributes in an
image are encoded into a feature by the DNN, by generating images whose
features are in proximity to that feature. Our decoder is implemented as a
guided diffusion model that guides the reverse image generation of a
pre-trained diffusion model to minimise the Euclidean distance between the
feature of a clean image estimated at each step and the user-specified feature.
One practical advantage of our decoder is that it can analyse feature spaces of
different DNNs with no additional training and run on a single COTS GPU. The
experimental results targeting CLIP's image encoder, ResNet-50 and vision
transformer demonstrate that images generated by our decoder have features
remarkably similar to the user-specified ones and reveal valuable insights into
these DNNs' feature spaces.

### [71] [Visual-TableQA: Open-Domain Benchmark for Reasoning over Table Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07966)
*Boammani Aser Lompo,Marc Haraoui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Visual-TableQA is a large-scale multimodal dataset for evaluating visual reasoning over complex tabular data, featuring 2.5k LaTeX-rendered tables and 6k QA pairs generated through collaborative LLM pipeline at low cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for visual reasoning over tables are limited in scale, diversity, and reasoning depth, especially for rendered table images, creating a need for more comprehensive evaluation tools.

Method: Modular, scalable autonomous generation pipeline using multiple LLMs collaborating across generation, validation, and inspiration roles with cross-model prompting and LLM-jury filtering.

Result: Models fine-tuned on Visual-TableQA generalize robustly to external benchmarks and outperform several proprietary models despite the dataset's synthetic nature.

Conclusion: The Visual-TableQA dataset and generation pipeline provide an effective, low-cost solution for enhancing visual reasoning capabilities over complex tabular data, with strong generalization performance.

Abstract: Visual reasoning over structured data such as tables is a critical capability
for modern vision-language models (VLMs), yet current benchmarks remain limited
in scale, diversity, or reasoning depth, especially when it comes to rendered
table images. Addressing this gap, we introduce Visual-TableQA, a large-scale,
open-domain multimodal dataset specifically designed to evaluate and enhance
visual reasoning over complex tabular data. Our generation pipeline is modular,
scalable, and fully autonomous, involving multiple reasoning LLMs collaborating
across distinct roles: generation, validation, and inspiration. Visual-TableQA
comprises 2.5k richly structured LaTeX-rendered tables and 6k
reasoning-intensive QA pairs, all produced at a cost of under USD 100. To
promote diversity and creativity, our pipeline performs multi-model
collaborative data generation via cross-model prompting ('inspiration') and
LLM-jury filtering. Stronger models seed layouts and topics that weaker models
elaborate, collectively distilling diverse reasoning patterns and visual
structures into the dataset. Empirical results show that models fine-tuned on
Visual-TableQA generalize robustly to external benchmarks, outperforming
several proprietary models despite the dataset's synthetic nature. The full
pipeline and resources are publicly available at

### [72] [Mini-o3: Scaling Up Reasoning Patterns and Interaction Turns for Visual Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07969)
*Xin Lai,Junyi Li,Wei Li,Tao Liu,Tianjian Li,Hengshuang Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mini-o3 is a system that enables deep multi-turn reasoning for visual search tasks through scaled-up tool interactions, achieving state-of-the-art performance with tens of reasoning steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing open-source multimodal models have limited interaction turns and monotonous reasoning patterns, making them inadequate for difficult visual tasks requiring trial-and-error exploration.

Method: Three key components: 1) Visual Probe Dataset with challenging visual search problems, 2) Iterative data collection for diverse reasoning patterns, 3) Over-turn masking strategy to prevent penalization of long reasoning chains during reinforcement learning.

Result: The model generates trajectories scaling to tens of turns at inference, with accuracy improving as turn count increases, and produces rich reasoning patterns for solving challenging visual search problems.

Conclusion: Mini-o3 successfully addresses limitations of previous approaches by enabling deep multi-turn reasoning and achieves state-of-the-art performance on difficult visual search tasks through scalable tool-based interactions.

Abstract: Recent advances in large multimodal models have leveraged image-based tools
with reinforcement learning to tackle visual problems. However, existing
open-source approaches often exhibit monotonous reasoning patterns and allow
only a limited number of interaction turns, making them inadequate for
difficult tasks that require trial-and-error exploration. In this work, we
address this limitation by scaling up tool-based interactions and introduce
Mini-o3, a system that executes deep, multi-turn reasoning -- spanning tens of
steps -- and achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging visual search
tasks. Our recipe for reproducing OpenAI o3-style behaviors comprises three key
components. First, we construct the Visual Probe Dataset, a collection of
thousands of challenging visual search problems designed for exploratory
reasoning. Second, we develop an iterative data collection pipeline to obtain
cold-start trajectories that exhibit diverse reasoning patterns, including
depth-first search, trial-and-error, and goal maintenance. Third, we propose an
over-turn masking strategy that prevents penalization of over-turn responses
(those that hit the maximum number of turns) during reinforcement learning,
thereby balancing training-time efficiency with test-time scalability. Despite
training with an upper bound of only six interaction turns, our model generates
trajectories that naturally scale to tens of turns at inference time, with
accuracy improving as the number of turns increases. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Mini-o3 produces rich reasoning patterns and deep thinking
paths, effectively solving challenging visual search problems.

*Zheng Geng,Nan Wang,Shaocong Xu,Chongjie Ye,Bohan Li,Zhaoxi Chen,Sida Peng,Hao Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OnePoseViaGen enables 6D pose estimation of unseen objects from a single reference image using coarse-to-fine alignment and text-guided domain randomization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of 6D pose estimation for arbitrary unseen objects where 3D models are unavailable, single-view reconstructions lack metric scale, and domain gaps exist between synthetic and real images.

Method: A pipeline with two key components: 1) coarse-to-fine alignment module that jointly refines scale and pose using multi-view feature matching with render-and-compare refinement, and 2) text-guided generative domain randomization strategy to diversify textures for effective fine-tuning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging benchmarks (YCBInEOAT, Toyota-Light, LM-O) and demonstrates robust dexterous grasping with a real robot hand.

Conclusion: The method enables high-fidelity single-view 3D generation to support reliable one-shot 6D pose estimation, validating practical real-world manipulation capabilities.

Abstract: Estimating the 6D pose of arbitrary unseen objects from a single reference
image is critical for robotics operating in the long-tail of real-world
instances. However, this setting is notoriously challenging: 3D models are
rarely available, single-view reconstructions lack metric scale, and domain
gaps between generated models and real-world images undermine robustness. We
propose OnePoseViaGen, a pipeline that tackles these challenges through two key
components. First, a coarse-to-fine alignment module jointly refines scale and
pose by combining multi-view feature matching with render-and-compare
refinement. Second, a text-guided generative domain randomization strategy
diversifies textures, enabling effective fine-tuning of pose estimators with
synthetic data. Together, these steps allow high-fidelity single-view 3D
generation to support reliable one-shot 6D pose estimation. On challenging
benchmarks (YCBInEOAT, Toyota-Light, LM-O), OnePoseViaGen achieves
state-of-the-art performance far surpassing prior approaches. We further
demonstrate robust dexterous grasping with a real robot hand, validating the
practicality of our method in real-world manipulation. Project page:

TL;DR: VIRAL is a regularization method that aligns MLLMs' visual representations with pre-trained vision foundation models to preserve fine-grained visual details and improve performance on vision-centric tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs underperform on vision-centric tasks like object counting and spatial reasoning due to text-only supervision that causes loss of fine-grained visual details during training.

Method: VIRAL (Visual Representation Alignment) - a regularization strategy that explicitly aligns internal visual representations of MLLMs with those of pre-trained vision foundation models to retain critical visual details.

Result: Consistent improvements across all tasks on widely adopted multimodal benchmarks, with comprehensive ablation studies validating the framework's design choices.

Conclusion: This simple alignment approach opens an important direction for effective visual information integration in MLLM training, enhancing complex visual reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) trained with visual instruction
tuning have achieved strong performance across diverse tasks, yet they remain
limited in vision-centric tasks such as object counting or spatial reasoning.
We attribute this gap to the prevailing text-only supervision paradigm, which
provides only indirect guidance for the visual pathway and often leads MLLMs to
discard fine-grained visual details during training. In this paper, we present
VIsual Representation ALignment (VIRAL), a simple yet effective regularization
strategy that aligns the internal visual representations of MLLMs with those of
pre-trained vision foundation models (VFMs). By explicitly enforcing this
alignment, VIRAL enables the model not only to retain critical visual details
from the input vision encoder but also to complement additional visual
knowledge from VFMs, thereby enhancing its ability to reason over complex
visual inputs. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across all
tasks on widely adopted multimodal benchmarks. Furthermore, we conduct
comprehensive ablation studies to validate the key design choices underlying
our framework. We believe this simple finding opens up an important direction
for the effective integration of visual information in training MLLMs.
