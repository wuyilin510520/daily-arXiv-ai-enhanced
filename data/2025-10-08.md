### [1] [Attention-Enhanced Prototypical Learning for Few-Shot Infrastructure Defect Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05266)
*Christina Thrainer,Md Meftahul Ferdaus,Mahdi Abdelguerfi,Christian Guetl,Steven Sloan,Kendall N. Niles,Ken Pathak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents an Enhanced Feature Pyramid Network (E-FPN) framework for few-shot semantic segmentation of infrastructure defects, achieving 82.55% F1-score and 72.26% mIoU with attention mechanisms providing significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for few-shot semantic segmentation in infrastructure inspection where labeled training data is scarce and expensive, and enable learning new defect categories with limited data.

Method: Uses E-FPN with InceptionSepConv blocks and depth-wise separable convolutions for multi-scale feature extraction, prototypical learning with masked average pooling, and attention-based feature representation through global/local self-attention and cross-attention.

Result: Achieved excellent few-shot performance with best configuration at 82.55% F1-score and 72.26% mIoU in 2-way classification testing. Self-attention provided 2.57% F1-score and 2.9% mIoU gain over baselines.

Conclusion: The framework enables rapid response to new defect types in infrastructure inspection with limited training data, leading to more efficient and economical maintenance plans for critical infrastructure systems.

Abstract: Few-shot semantic segmentation is vital for deep learning-based
infrastructure inspection applications, where labeled training examples are
scarce and expensive. Although existing deep learning frameworks perform well,
the need for extensive labeled datasets and the inability to learn new defect
categories with little data are problematic. We present our Enhanced Feature
Pyramid Network (E-FPN) framework for few-shot semantic segmentation of culvert
and sewer defect categories using a prototypical learning framework. Our
approach has three main contributions: (1) adaptive E-FPN encoder using
InceptionSepConv blocks and depth-wise separable convolutions for efficient
multi-scale feature extraction; (2) prototypical learning with masked average
pooling for powerful prototype generation from small support examples; and (3)
attention-based feature representation through global self-attention, local
self-attention and cross-attention. Comprehensive experimentation on
challenging infrastructure inspection datasets illustrates that the method
achieves excellent few-shot performance, with the best configuration being
8-way 5-shot training configuration at 82.55% F1-score and 72.26% mIoU in 2-way
classification testing. The self-attention method had the most significant
performance improvements, providing 2.57% F1-score and 2.9% mIoU gain over
baselines. Our framework addresses the critical need to rapidly respond to new
defect types in infrastructure inspection systems with limited new training
data that lead to more efficient and economical maintenance plans for critical
infrastructure systems.

### [2] [SkinMap: Weighted Full-Body Skin Segmentation for Robust Remote Photoplethysmography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05296)
*Zahra Maleki,Amirhossein Akbari,Amirhossein Binesh,Babak Khalaj*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel skin segmentation method for remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) that improves heart rate monitoring accuracy by prioritizing skin regions while removing interference from mouth, eyes, and hair, making it more robust to movement and lighting variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy of remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) technology which is sensitive to lighting and movement, and to address the need for better skin region selection in unsupervised rPPG pipelines for reliable heart rate monitoring.

Method: Introduces a novel skin segmentation technique that detects skin regions across the entire body while removing interference areas like mouth, eyes, and hair. The method is evaluated on public datasets and a new SYNC-rPPG dataset designed to represent real-world conditions.

Result: The model demonstrates superior ability to capture heartbeats in challenging conditions (talking, head rotation) and maintains low mean absolute error (MAE) between predicted and actual heart rates where other methods fail. It also shows high accuracy across diverse skin tones.

Conclusion: The proposed skin segmentation technique is a promising solution for real-world rPPG applications, offering improved robustness to movement and lighting variations while maintaining accuracy across different skin tones.

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is an innovative method for monitoring
heart rate and vital signs by using a simple camera to record a person, as long
as any part of their skin is visible. This low-cost, contactless approach helps
in remote patient monitoring, emotion analysis, smart vehicle utilization, and
more. Over the years, various techniques have been proposed to improve the
accuracy of this technology, especially given its sensitivity to lighting and
movement. In the unsupervised pipeline, it is necessary to first select skin
regions from the video to extract the rPPG signal from the skin color changes.
We introduce a novel skin segmentation technique that prioritizes skin regions
to enhance the quality of the extracted signal. It can detect areas of skin all
over the body, making it more resistant to movement, while removing areas such
as the mouth, eyes, and hair that may cause interference. Our model is
evaluated on publicly available datasets, and we also present a new dataset,
called SYNC-rPPG, to better represent real-world conditions. The results
indicate that our model demonstrates a prior ability to capture heartbeats in
challenging conditions, such as talking and head rotation, and maintain the
mean absolute error (MAE) between predicted and actual heart rates, while other
methods fail to do so. In addition, we demonstrate high accuracy in detecting a
diverse range of skin tones, making this technique a promising option for
real-world applications.

### [3] [DeepAf: One-Shot Spatiospectral Auto-Focus Model for Digital Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05315)
*Yousef Yeganeh,Maximilian Frantzen,Michael Lee,Kun-Hsing Yu,Nassir Navab,Azade Farshad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepAf is a novel auto-focus framework that combines spatial and spectral features for single-shot focus prediction, enabling conventional microscopes to function as efficient slide scanners with 80% faster focusing and robust cross-lab generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High cost of WSI scanners limits accessibility in healthcare settings, while existing low-cost solutions face limitations in consistent focus, time-consuming methods, and poor generalization across tissue types and staining protocols.

Method: DeepAf uses a hybrid architecture combining spatial and spectral features for single-shot focus prediction, automatically regressing distance to optimal focal point and adjusting control parameters for optimal image outcomes.

Result: 80% reduction in focusing time compared to stack-based methods, focus accuracy of 0.18Î¼m, robust cross-lab generalization with 0.72% false focus predictions, and 0.90 AUC in cancer classification at 4x magnification on 536 brain tissue samples.

Conclusion: The system enables accessible, real-time digital pathology in resource-constrained settings while maintaining diagnostic accuracy, transforming conventional microscopes into efficient slide scanners.

Abstract: While Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) scanners remain the gold standard for
digitizing pathology samples, their high cost limits accessibility in many
healthcare settings. Other low-cost solutions also face critical limitations:
automated microscopes struggle with consistent focus across varying tissue
morphology, traditional auto-focus methods require time-consuming focal stacks,
and existing deep-learning approaches either need multiple input images or lack
generalization capability across tissue types and staining protocols. We
introduce a novel automated microscopic system powered by DeepAf, a novel
auto-focus framework that uniquely combines spatial and spectral features
through a hybrid architecture for single-shot focus prediction. The proposed
network automatically regresses the distance to the optimal focal point using
the extracted spatiospectral features and adjusts the control parameters for
optimal image outcomes. Our system transforms conventional microscopes into
efficient slide scanners, reducing focusing time by 80% compared to stack-based
methods while achieving focus accuracy of 0.18 {\mu}m on the same-lab samples,
matching the performance of dual-image methods (0.19 {\mu}m) with half the
input requirements. DeepAf demonstrates robust cross-lab generalization with
only 0.72% false focus predictions and 90% of predictions within the depth of
field. Through an extensive clinical study of 536 brain tissue samples, our
system achieves 0.90 AUC in cancer classification at 4x magnification, a
significant achievement at lower magnification than typical 20x WSI scans. This
results in a comprehensive hardware-software design enabling accessible,
real-time digital pathology in resource-constrained settings while maintaining
diagnostic accuracy.

### [5] [Mitigating Diffusion Model Hallucinations with Dynamic Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05356)
*Kostas Triaridis,Alexandros Graikos,Aggelina Chatziagapi,Grigorios G. Chrysos,Dimitris Samaras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dynamic Guidance reduces hallucinations in diffusion models by selectively sharpening the score function along artifact-causing directions while preserving semantic variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models often produce hallucinatory samples with structural inconsistencies due to excessive smoothing between data distribution modes, though some semantic interpolations are desirable for generation diversity.

Method: Introduces Dynamic Guidance which selectively sharpens the score function only along predetermined directions known to cause artifacts, while maintaining valid semantic variations.

Result: Dynamic Guidance substantially reduces hallucinations on both controlled and natural image datasets, significantly outperforming baseline methods.

Conclusion: This is the first approach that addresses hallucinations at generation time rather than through post-hoc filtering, providing a nuanced solution to the hallucination problem in diffusion models.

Abstract: Diffusion models, despite their impressive demos, often produce hallucinatory
samples with structural inconsistencies that lie outside of the support of the
true data distribution. Such hallucinations can be attributed to excessive
smoothing between modes of the data distribution. However, semantic
interpolations are often desirable and can lead to generation diversity, thus
we believe a more nuanced solution is required. In this work, we introduce
Dynamic Guidance, which tackles this issue. Dynamic Guidance mitigates
hallucinations by selectively sharpening the score function only along the
pre-determined directions known to cause artifacts, while preserving valid
semantic variations. To our knowledge, this is the first approach that
addresses hallucinations at generation time rather than through post-hoc
filtering. Dynamic Guidance substantially reduces hallucinations on both
controlled and natural image datasets, significantly outperforming baselines.

### [6] [LightCache: Memory-Efficient, Training-Free Acceleration for Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05367)
*Yang Xiao,Gen Li,Kaiyuan Deng,Yushu Wu,Zheng Zhan,Yanzhi Wang,Xiaolong Ma,Bo Hui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Training-free acceleration method for video diffusion models that reduces memory consumption during inference through stage-specific strategies while maintaining acceptable quality degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cache-based acceleration methods in video diffusion models often cause substantial memory surges in denoising and decoding stages, creating a need for memory-efficient acceleration techniques.

Method: Decomposes inference into encoding, denoising, and decoding stages, and proposes three stage-specific strategies: 1) Asynchronous Cache Swapping, 2) Feature chunk, and 3) Slicing latents to decode.

Result: Achieves faster inference speed and lower memory usage compared to baseline while keeping quality degradation within acceptable range.

Conclusion: The proposed LightCache method effectively reduces memory consumption in video diffusion model inference without significant quality loss, providing a practical acceleration solution.

Abstract: Training-free acceleration has emerged as an advanced research area in video
generation based on diffusion models. The redundancy of latents in diffusion
model inference provides a natural entry point for acceleration. In this paper,
we decompose the inference process into the encoding, denoising, and decoding
stages, and observe that cache-based acceleration methods often lead to
substantial memory surges in the latter two stages. To address this problem, we
analyze the characteristics of inference across different stages and propose
stage-specific strategies for reducing memory consumption: 1) Asynchronous
Cache Swapping. 2) Feature chunk. 3) Slicing latents to decode. At the same
time, we ensure that the time overhead introduced by these three strategies
remains lower than the acceleration gains themselves. Compared with the
baseline, our approach achieves faster inference speed and lower memory usage,
while maintaining quality degradation within an acceptable range. The Code is
available at https://github.com/NKUShaw/LightCache .

### [7] [See the past: Time-Reversed Scene Reconstruction from Thermal Traces Using Visual Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05408)
*Kebin Contreras,Luis Toscano-Palomino,Mauro Dalla Mura,Jorge Bacca*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A time-reversed reconstruction framework using paired RGB and thermal images to recover past scene states from thermal traces left by human interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Thermal imaging captures residual heat traces from human interactions that fade over time, providing temporal information beyond what RGB cameras can see, with applications in forensics and scene analysis.

Method: Couples Visual-Language Models (VLMs) with constrained diffusion process - one VLM generates scene descriptions and another guides image reconstruction for semantic and structural consistency.

Result: The method successfully reconstructs plausible past frames up to 120 seconds earlier in three controlled scenarios.

Conclusion: This work provides a first step toward time-reversed imaging from thermal traces, demonstrating feasibility of recovering past scene states from thermal observations.

Abstract: Recovering the past from present observations is an intriguing challenge with
potential applications in forensics and scene analysis. Thermal imaging,
operating in the infrared range, provides access to otherwise invisible
information. Since humans are typically warmer (37 C -98.6 F) than their
surroundings, interactions such as sitting, touching, or leaning leave residual
heat traces. These fading imprints serve as passive temporal codes, allowing
for the inference of recent events that exceed the capabilities of RGB cameras.
This work proposes a time-reversed reconstruction framework that uses paired
RGB and thermal images to recover scene states from a few seconds earlier. The
proposed approach couples Visual-Language Models (VLMs) with a constrained
diffusion process, where one VLM generates scene descriptions and another
guides image reconstruction, ensuring semantic and structural consistency. The
method is evaluated in three controlled scenarios, demonstrating the
feasibility of reconstructing plausible past frames up to 120 seconds earlier,
providing a first step toward time-reversed imaging from thermal traces.

### [8] [Personalizing Retrieval using Joint Embeddings or "the Return of Fluffy"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05411)
*Bruno Korbar,Andrew Zisserman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces pi-map, a method that maps object instances from images to text tokens, enabling compound queries combining visual object information with natural language descriptions for improved image retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable image retrieval using compound queries that combine object instance information from images with natural language descriptions of what the object is doing or where it is located.

Method: Design a mapping network (pi-map) that translates from local image embeddings of object instances to text tokens, which are then combined with natural language queries for CLIP-style text encoding and image retrieval. Uses frozen CLIP encoders with a simple training procedure per object instance.

Result: The approach improves state-of-the-art performance on two benchmarks designed to assess personalized retrieval.

Conclusion: The pi-map method effectively enables compound query image retrieval by mapping object instances to text tokens that work with CLIP encoders, demonstrating improved performance on personalized retrieval tasks.

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to be able to retrieve images using a compound
query that combines object instance information from an image, with a natural
text description of what that object is doing or where it is. For example, to
retrieve an image of "Fluffy the unicorn (specified by an image) on someone's
head". To achieve this we design a mapping network that can "translate" from a
local image embedding (of the object instance) to a text token, such that the
combination of the token and a natural language query is suitable for CLIP
style text encoding, and image retrieval. Generating a text token in this
manner involves a simple training procedure, that only needs to be performed
once for each object instance. We show that our approach of using a trainable
mapping network, termed pi-map, together with frozen CLIP text and image
encoders, improves the state of the art on two benchmarks designed to assess
personalized retrieval.

### [9] [ArchitectHead: Continuous Level of Detail Control for 3D Gaussian Head Avatars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05488)
*Peizhi Yan,Rabab Ward,Qiang Tang,Shan Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ArchitectHead is a framework for 3D Gaussian head avatars that enables continuous level-of-detail control by parameterizing Gaussians in 2D UV feature space, allowing dynamic resampling without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGS-based avatars use fixed numbers of Gaussians, lacking adjustable LOD control needed for balancing rendering efficiency and visual quality in practical applications.

Method: Parameterizes Gaussians in 2D UV feature space with multi-level learnable feature maps, uses a neural network decoder to transform latent features into Gaussian attributes, and controls Gaussian count through dynamic feature map resampling.

Result: Achieves SOTA quality in reenactment tasks at highest LOD, maintains near SOTA performance at lower LODs with only 6.2% Gaussians, moderate quality degradation, and nearly doubled rendering speed at lowest LOD.

Conclusion: ArchitectHead successfully enables continuous LOD control for 3D Gaussian head avatars without retraining, providing efficient rendering while maintaining high visual quality across different detail levels.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled photorealistic and real-time
rendering of 3D head avatars. Existing 3DGS-based avatars typically rely on
tens of thousands of 3D Gaussian points (Gaussians), with the number of
Gaussians fixed after training. However, many practical applications require
adjustable levels of detail (LOD) to balance rendering efficiency and visual
quality. In this work, we propose "ArchitectHead", the first framework for
creating 3D Gaussian head avatars that support continuous control over LOD. Our
key idea is to parameterize the Gaussians in a 2D UV feature space and propose
a UV feature field composed of multi-level learnable feature maps to encode
their latent features. A lightweight neural network-based decoder then
transforms these latent features into 3D Gaussian attributes for rendering.
ArchitectHead controls the number of Gaussians by dynamically resampling
feature maps from the UV feature field at the desired resolutions. This method
enables efficient and continuous control of LOD without retraining.
Experimental results show that ArchitectHead achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)
quality in self and cross-identity reenactment tasks at the highest LOD, while
maintaining near SOTA performance at lower LODs. At the lowest LOD, our method
uses only 6.2\% of the Gaussians while the quality degrades moderately (L1 Loss
+7.9\%, PSNR --0.97\%, SSIM --0.6\%, LPIPS Loss +24.1\%), and the rendering
speed nearly doubles.

### [10] [Human Action Recognition from Point Clouds over Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05506)
*James Dickens*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel 3D action recognition pipeline using point clouds from depth sensors and monocular depth estimation, combining point-based techniques with sparse convolutional networks on voxel-mapped sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage dense 3D data from consumer-grade depth sensors and Lidar for action recognition as an alternative to skeletal and video-based methods.

Method: Pipeline segments human point clouds from background, tracks individuals over time, performs body part segmentation, and uses point-based techniques with sparse convolutional networks on voxel-mapped sequences with auxiliary features.

Result: Achieves 89.3% accuracy on NTU RGB-D 120 dataset when combining sensor-based and estimated depth inputs in ensemble setup, outperforming previous point cloud action recognition methods.

Conclusion: The approach provides a competitive third way for action recognition using dense 3D data, demonstrating effectiveness with both real and estimated depth inputs.

Abstract: Recent research into human action recognition (HAR) has focused predominantly
on skeletal action recognition and video-based methods. With the increasing
availability of consumer-grade depth sensors and Lidar instruments, there is a
growing opportunity to leverage dense 3D data for action recognition, to
develop a third way. This paper presents a novel approach for recognizing
actions from 3D videos by introducing a pipeline that segments human point
clouds from the background of a scene, tracks individuals over time, and
performs body part segmentation. The method supports point clouds from both
depth sensors and monocular depth estimation. At the core of the proposed HAR
framework is a novel backbone for 3D action recognition, which combines
point-based techniques with sparse convolutional networks applied to
voxel-mapped point cloud sequences. Experiments incorporate auxiliary point
features including surface normals, color, infrared intensity, and body part
parsing labels, to enhance recognition accuracy. Evaluation on the NTU RGB- D
120 dataset demonstrates that the method is competitive with existing skeletal
action recognition algorithms. Moreover, combining both sensor-based and
estimated depth inputs in an ensemble setup, this approach achieves 89.3%
accuracy when different human subjects are considered for training and testing,
outperforming previous point cloud action recognition methods.

### [11] [Be Tangential to Manifold: Discovering Riemannian Metric for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05509)
*Shinnosuke Saito,Takashi Matsubara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Riemannian metric on the noise space of diffusion models to enable manifold-aware interpolation, addressing the limitation that diffusion models lack an explicit low-dimensional latent space for data manifold operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models lack an explicit, tractable low-dimensional latent space that parameterizes the data manifold, limiting manifold-aware analysis and operations like interpolation and editing. Existing interpolation methods follow paths through high-density regions that are not aligned with the data manifold, yielding perceptually unnatural transitions.

Method: The authors propose a novel Riemannian metric on the noise space, inspired by recent findings that the Jacobian of the score function captures the tangent spaces to the local data manifold. This metric encourages geodesics in the noise space to stay within or run parallel to the learned data manifold.

Result: Experiments on image interpolation show that the proposed metric produces perceptually more natural and faithful transitions than existing density-based and naive baselines.

Conclusion: The Riemannian metric approach successfully exploits the data manifold learned by diffusion models, enabling more natural manifold-aware interpolation compared to previous methods.

Abstract: Diffusion models are powerful deep generative models (DGMs) that generate
high-fidelity, diverse content. However, unlike classical DGMs, they lack an
explicit, tractable low-dimensional latent space that parameterizes the data
manifold. This absence limits manifold-aware analysis and operations, such as
interpolation and editing. Existing interpolation methods for diffusion models
typically follow paths through high-density regions, which are not necessarily
aligned with the data manifold and can yield perceptually unnatural
transitions. To exploit the data manifold learned by diffusion models, we
propose a novel Riemannian metric on the noise space, inspired by recent
findings that the Jacobian of the score function captures the tangent spaces to
the local data manifold. This metric encourages geodesics in the noise space to
stay within or run parallel to the learned data manifold. Experiments on image
interpolation show that our metric produces perceptually more natural and
faithful transitions than existing density-based and naive baselines.

### [12] [Teamwork: Collaborative Diffusion with Low-rank Coordination and Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05532)
*Sam Sartor,Pieter Peers*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Teamwork is a unified solution for expanding input/output channels in pretrained diffusion models without altering their architecture, using multiple coordinated model instances with LoRA adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current channel expansion methods for diffusion models are application-specific and difficult to adapt to different models or new tasks, requiring a more flexible solution.

Method: Coordinates multiple instances of base diffusion models (teammates) using a novel LoRA variation for joint adaptation and coordination, supporting dynamic activation/deactivation of teammates.

Result: Successfully applied to various generative and inverse graphics tasks including inpainting, SVBRDF estimation, intrinsic decomposition, neural shading, and intrinsic image synthesis.

Conclusion: Teamwork provides an efficient and flexible framework for channel expansion and task adaptation in diffusion models, demonstrating broad applicability across multiple graphics applications.

Abstract: Large pretrained diffusion models can provide strong priors beneficial for
many graphics applications. However, generative applications such as neural
rendering and inverse methods such as SVBRDF estimation and intrinsic image
decomposition require additional input or output channels. Current solutions
for channel expansion are often application specific and these solutions can be
difficult to adapt to different diffusion models or new tasks. This paper
introduces Teamwork: a flexible and efficient unified solution for jointly
increasing the number of input and output channels as well as adapting a
pretrained diffusion model to new tasks. Teamwork achieves channel expansion
without altering the pretrained diffusion model architecture by coordinating
and adapting multiple instances of the base diffusion model (\ie, teammates).
We employ a novel variation of Low Rank-Adaptation (LoRA) to jointly address
both adaptation and coordination between the different teammates. Furthermore
Teamwork supports dynamic (de)activation of teammates. We demonstrate the
flexibility and efficiency of Teamwork on a variety of generative and inverse
graphics tasks such as inpainting, single image SVBRDF estimation, intrinsic
decomposition, neural shading, and intrinsic image synthesis.

### [13] [Seeing the Big Picture: Evaluating Multimodal LLMs' Ability to Interpret and Grade Handwritten Student Work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05538)
*Owen Henkel,Bill Roberts,Doug Jaffe,Laurence Holt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLLMs can grade handwritten arithmetic work with near-human accuracy (95%, k=0.90) but struggle with mathematical illustrations requiring visual interpretation and pedagogical judgment, achieving only k=0.20 agreement with ground truth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore MLLMs' potential for grading handwritten student classwork in elementary and middle-school mathematics, where manual grading is time-consuming but provides valuable insights into student learning processes.

Method: Two experiments: Experiment A tested 288 handwritten arithmetic responses from Ghanaian students; Experiment B evaluated 150 mathematical illustrations from American elementary students, testing both direct grading and grading with human descriptions.

Result: MLLMs achieved near-human accuracy on objective arithmetic problems (95%, k=0.90) but struggled with mathematical illustrations (k=0.20). When given human descriptions, agreement improved to k=0.47, matching human-to-human agreement levels.

Conclusion: MLLMs can effectively 'see' and interpret arithmetic work but still struggle with visual interpretation of mathematical illustrations, suggesting current limitations in their visual capabilities for complex educational tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) raise the
question of their potential for grading, analyzing, and offering feedback on
handwritten student classwork. This capability would be particularly beneficial
in elementary and middle-school mathematics education, where most work remains
handwritten, because seeing students' full working of a problem provides
valuable insights into their learning processes, but is extremely
time-consuming to grade. We present two experiments investigating MLLM
performance on handwritten student mathematics classwork. Experiment A examines
288 handwritten responses from Ghanaian middle school students solving
arithmetic problems with objective answers. In this context, models achieved
near-human accuracy (95%, k = 0.90) but exhibited occasional errors that human
educators would be unlikely to make. Experiment B evaluates 150 mathematical
illustrations from American elementary students, where the drawings are the
answer to the question. These tasks lack single objective answers and require
sophisticated visual interpretation as well as pedagogical judgment in order to
analyze and evaluate them. We attempted to separate MLLMs' visual capabilities
from their pedagogical abilities by first asking them to grade the student
illustrations directly, and then by augmenting the image with a detailed human
description of the illustration. We found that when the models had to analyze
the student illustrations directly, they struggled, achieving only k = 0.20
with ground truth scores, but when given human descriptions, their agreement
levels improved dramatically to k = 0.47, which was in line with human-to-human
agreement levels. This gap suggests MLLMs can "see" and interpret arithmetic
work relatively well, but still struggle to "see" student mathematical
illustrations.

### [14] [Midway Network: Learning Representations for Recognition and Motion from Latent Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05558)
*Christopher Hoang,Mengye Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Midway Network is a self-supervised learning architecture that learns visual representations for both object recognition and motion understanding from natural videos using latent dynamics modeling and a midway top-down path.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-supervised learning methods focus on either recognition or motion understanding separately, while latent dynamics modeling has been successful in decision making but not applied to learning both visual representations simultaneously from natural videos.

Method: Uses a midway top-down path to infer motion latents between video frames, dense forward prediction objective, and hierarchical structure to handle complex multi-object scenes in natural videos.

Result: Achieves strong performance on semantic segmentation and optical flow tasks after pretraining on large-scale natural video datasets, outperforming prior self-supervised methods.

Conclusion: Midway Network successfully extends latent dynamics modeling to learn both object recognition and motion understanding representations from natural videos, with learned dynamics capable of capturing high-level correspondence.

Abstract: Object recognition and motion understanding are key components of perception
that complement each other. While self-supervised learning methods have shown
promise in their ability to learn from unlabeled data, they have primarily
focused on obtaining rich representations for either recognition or motion
rather than both in tandem. On the other hand, latent dynamics modeling has
been used in decision making to learn latent representations of observations
and their transformations over time for control and planning tasks. In this
work, we present Midway Network, a new self-supervised learning architecture
that is the first to learn strong visual representations for both object
recognition and motion understanding solely from natural videos, by extending
latent dynamics modeling to this domain. Midway Network leverages a midway
top-down path to infer motion latents between video frames, as well as a dense
forward prediction objective and hierarchical structure to tackle the complex,
multi-object scenes of natural videos. We demonstrate that after pretraining on
two large-scale natural video datasets, Midway Network achieves strong
performance on both semantic segmentation and optical flow tasks relative to
prior self-supervised learning methods. We also show that Midway Network's
learned dynamics can capture high-level correspondence via a novel analysis
method based on forward feature perturbation.

Method: Uses interactive scene-graph representation encoding object geometry, appearance, and physical properties. Formulates reconstruction as energy-based optimization combining observational data, physical constraints, and generative priors. Employs hybrid optimization with sampling-based exploration and gradient-based refinement.

Result: Produces digital twins with complete and precise geometry, physical stability, and realistic rendering from novel viewpoints. Demonstrates superior performance on benchmark datasets and practical applications in interactive gaming and real-time digital-twin manipulation.

Conclusion: HoloScene effectively addresses multiple limitations of current 3D reconstruction methods, providing a comprehensive solution for creating accurate simulation-ready virtual environments with broad applicability across various fields.

Abstract: Digitizing the physical world into accurate simulation-ready virtual
environments offers significant opportunities in a variety of fields such as
augmented and virtual reality, gaming, and robotics. However, current 3D
reconstruction and scene-understanding methods commonly fall short in one or
more critical aspects, such as geometry completeness, object interactivity,
physical plausibility, photorealistic rendering, or realistic physical
properties for reliable dynamic simulation. To address these limitations, we
introduce HoloScene, a novel interactive 3D reconstruction framework that
simultaneously achieves these requirements. HoloScene leverages a comprehensive
interactive scene-graph representation, encoding object geometry, appearance,
and physical properties alongside hierarchical and inter-object relationships.
Reconstruction is formulated as an energy-based optimization problem,
integrating observational data, physical constraints, and generative priors
into a unified, coherent objective. Optimization is efficiently performed via a
hybrid approach combining sampling-based exploration with gradient-based
refinement. The resulting digital twins exhibit complete and precise geometry,
physical stability, and realistic rendering from novel viewpoints. Evaluations
conducted on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance,
while practical use-cases in interactive gaming and real-time digital-twin
manipulation illustrate HoloScene's broad applicability and effectiveness.

*Bin Kang,Bin Chen,Junjie Wang,Yulin Li,Junzhi Zhao,Zhuotao Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CalibCLIP is a training-free method that calibrates dominant tokens in Visual Language Models to improve text-driven image retrieval by suppressing low-contribution tokens in visual space and enhancing discriminative concepts in textual space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs suffer from structural limitations where a few low-contribution tokens dominate global semantics and suppress discriminative features in image retrieval tasks.

Method: Proposes Contrastive Visual Enhancer (CVE) to decouple visual features and suppress dominant tokens, and Discriminative Concept Calibrator (DCC) to differentiate between general and discriminative concepts in text queries.

Result: Extensive experiments show consistent improvements across seven benchmarks spanning three image retrieval tasks.

Conclusion: CalibCLIP effectively addresses the suppressive effect of dominant tokens in VLMs and improves text-driven image retrieval performance.

Abstract: Existing Visual Language Models (VLMs) suffer structural limitations where a
few low contribution tokens may excessively capture global semantics,
dominating the information aggregation process and suppressing the
discriminative features in text-driven image retrieval tasks. To address this,
we introduce \textbf{CalibCLIP}, a training-free method designed to calibrate
the suppressive effect of dominant tokens. Specifically, in the visual space,
we propose the Contrastive Visual Enhancer (CVE), which decouples visual
features into target and low information regions. Subsequently, it identifies
dominant tokens and dynamically suppresses their representations.In the textual
space, we introduce the Discriminative Concept Calibrator (DCC), which aims to
differentiate between general and discriminative concepts within the text
query. By mitigating the challenges posed by generic concepts and improving the
representations of discriminative concepts, DCC strengthens the differentiation
among similar samples. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate consistent
improvements across seven benchmarks spanning three image retrieval tasks,
underscoring the effectiveness of CalibCLIP. Code is available at:

TL;DR: ShortCoTI is a lightweight optimization framework that reduces chain-of-thought reasoning length by 54% for image generation while maintaining or improving image quality, addressing the problem of visual overthinking in multimodal LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches using chain-of-thought reasoning for image generation introduce unnecessary redundancy (visual overthinking), which increases computational costs and can introduce contradictory details to the original prompt.

Method: ShortCoTI uses a reinforcement learning framework with an adaptive reward function that encourages more concise CoT sequences while preserving image quality, scaling rewards according to estimated task difficulty.

Result: Reduces prompt reasoning length by 54% while maintaining or slightly improving quality metrics across T2I-CompBench and GenEval benchmarks. Qualitative analysis shows elimination of verbose explanations and repetitive refinements.

Conclusion: ShortCoTI improves computational efficiency without compromising the fidelity or visual appeal of generated images, producing reasoning prompts that are both concise and semantically rich.

Abstract: Autoregressive multimodal large language models have recently gained
popularity for image generation, driven by advances in foundation models. To
enhance alignment and detail, newer approaches employ chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning, expanding user inputs into elaborated prompts prior to image
synthesis. However, this strategy can introduce unnecessary redundancy -- a
phenomenon we call visual overthinking -- which increases computational costs
and can introduce details that contradict the original prompt. In this work, we
explore how to generate more concise CoT sequences for more efficient image
generation. We introduce ShortCoTI, a lightweight optimization framework that
encourages more concise CoT while preserving output image quality. ShortCoTI
rewards more concise prompts with an adaptive function that scales according to
an estimated difficulty for each task. Incorporating this reward into a
reinforcement learning paradigm reduces prompt reasoning length by 54% while
maintaining or slightly improving quality metrics across multiple benchmarks
(T2I-CompBench, GenEval). Qualitative analysis shows that our method eliminates
verbose explanations and repetitive refinements, producing reasoning prompts
that are both concise and semantically rich. As a result, ShortCoTI improves
computational efficiency without compromising the fidelity or visual appeal of
generated images.

TL;DR: HOI-R1 explores using MLLMs with reinforcement learning for human-object interaction detection without additional detection modules, achieving 2x baseline accuracy on HICO-DET.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current HOID methods rely on complex frameworks with VLMs and object detectors, while MLLMs' inherent reasoning capabilities for HOID are under-explored.

Method: Proposes HOI-R1 using MLLMs trained with RL, introducing HOI reasoning process and HOID reward functions to solve HOID through pure text without detection modules.

Result: Achieves 2x accuracy of baseline on HICO-DET dataset with great generalization ability.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the potential of language models for HOID tasks without traditional detection components, offering a simpler yet effective alternative.

Abstract: Recent Human-object interaction detection (HOID) methods highly require prior
knowledge from VLMs to enhance the interaction recognition capabilities. The
training strategies and model architectures for connecting the knowledge from
VLMs to the HOI instance representations from the object detector are
challenging, and the whole framework is complex for further development or
application. On the other hand, the inherent reasoning abilities of MLLMs on
human-object interaction detection are under-explored. Inspired by the recent
success of training MLLMs with reinforcement learning (RL) methods, we propose
HOI-R1 and first explore the potential of the language model on the HOID task
without any additional detection modules. We introduce an HOI reasoning process
and HOID reward functions to solve the HOID task by pure text. The results on
the HICO-DET dataset show that HOI-R1 achieves 2x the accuracy of the baseline
with great generalization ability. The source code is available at

*Jiaqi Liu,Tao Huang,Chang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ECM is a plug-and-play framework with a lightweight control module for autoregressive models that enables efficient spatially-conditioned image generation without full model fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AR approaches for complex spatially-conditioned generation require expensive fine-tuning of pre-trained models, leading to significant training costs.

Method: Uses a distributed architecture with context-aware attention layers and shared gated FFN, plus early-centric sampling strategy that prioritizes learning early control sequences to reduce computational cost.

Result: Achieves high-fidelity and diverse control over image generation, surpassing existing baselines while significantly improving both training and inference efficiency.

Conclusion: ECM provides an efficient plug-and-play solution for spatially-conditioned image generation with AR models, reducing training costs while maintaining high performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in autoregressive (AR) models have demonstrated their
potential to rival diffusion models in image synthesis. However, for complex
spatially-conditioned generation, current AR approaches rely on fine-tuning the
pre-trained model, leading to significant training costs. In this paper, we
propose the Efficient Control Model (ECM), a plug-and-play framework featuring
a lightweight control module that introduces control signals via a distributed
architecture. This architecture consists of context-aware attention layers that
refine conditional features using real-time generated tokens, and a shared
gated feed-forward network (FFN) designed to maximize the utilization of its
limited capacity and ensure coherent control feature learning. Furthermore,
recognizing the critical role of early-stage generation in determining semantic
structure, we introduce an early-centric sampling strategy that prioritizes
learning early control sequences. This approach reduces computational cost by
lowering the number of training tokens per iteration, while a complementary
temperature scheduling during inference compensates for the resulting
insufficient training of late-stage tokens. Extensive experiments on
scale-based AR models validate that our method achieves high-fidelity and
diverse control over image generation, surpassing existing baselines while
significantly improving both training and inference efficiency.

### [20] [PointNSP: Autoregressive 3D Point Cloud Generation with Next-Scale Level-of-Detail Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05613)
*Ziqiao Meng,Qichao Wang,Zhiyang Dou,Zixing Song,Zhipeng Zhou,Irwin King,Peilin Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PointNSP is a coarse-to-fine autoregressive framework that overcomes limitations of traditional autoregressive point cloud generation by using multi-scale factorization and next-scale prediction, achieving SOTA quality while being more efficient than diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models for point cloud generation have lagged behind diffusion approaches due to artificial ordering constraints that undermine global structure and long-range dependencies, hindering properties like symmetry and consistent topology.

Method: Proposes PointNSP with level-of-detail principle: coarse-to-fine framework that preserves global structure at low resolutions and progressively refines geometry through next-scale prediction, enabling rich intra-scale interactions without fixed orderings.

Result: Establishes SOTA generation quality on ShapeNet within autoregressive paradigm, surpasses diffusion baselines in parameter/training/inference efficiency, and shows pronounced advantages in dense generation with 8,192 points.

Conclusion: PointNSP successfully bridges the performance gap between autoregressive and diffusion approaches for point cloud generation through multi-scale factorization, offering superior efficiency and scalability potential.

Abstract: Autoregressive point cloud generation has long lagged behind diffusion-based
approaches in quality. The performance gap stems from the fact that
autoregressive models impose an artificial ordering on inherently unordered
point sets, forcing shape generation to proceed as a sequence of local
predictions. This sequential bias emphasizes short-range continuity but
undermines the model's capacity to capture long-range dependencies, hindering
its ability to enforce global structural properties such as symmetry,
consistent topology, and large-scale geometric regularities. Inspired by the
level-of-detail (LOD) principle in shape modeling, we propose PointNSP, a
coarse-to-fine generative framework that preserves global shape structure at
low resolutions and progressively refines fine-grained geometry at higher
scales through a next-scale prediction paradigm. This multi-scale factorization
aligns the autoregressive objective with the permutation-invariant nature of
point sets, enabling rich intra-scale interactions while avoiding brittle fixed
orderings. Experiments on ShapeNet show that PointNSP establishes
state-of-the-art (SOTA) generation quality for the first time within the
autoregressive paradigm. In addition, it surpasses strong diffusion-based
baselines in parameter, training, and inference efficiency. Finally, in dense
generation with 8,192 points, PointNSP's advantages become even more
pronounced, underscoring its scalability potential.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Tear Film Multi-task (TFM) Dataset and proposes TF-Net for TFBU segmentation and TF-Collab pipeline for automated tear film analysis, addressing the lack of annotated datasets and integrated solutions for dry eye diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated tear film break-up (TFBU) analysis is critical for diagnosing dry eye syndrome but remains challenging due to lack of annotated datasets and integrated solutions.

Method: Created TFM Dataset with 15 high-resolution videos (6,247 frames) annotated for three vision tasks. Proposed TF-Net segmentation model with MobileOne-mini backbone and enhanced feature pyramid network. Designed TF-Collab pipeline that sequentially orchestrates frame classification, pupil localization, and TFBU segmentation.

Conclusion: The proposed TF-Net and TF-Collab provide a foundation for future research in ocular surface diagnostics, with code and datasets publicly available.

Abstract: Tear film break-up (TFBU) analysis is critical for diagnosing dry eye
syndrome, but automated TFBU segmentation remains challenging due to the lack
of annotated datasets and integrated solutions. This paper introduces the Tear
Film Multi-task (TFM) Dataset, the first comprehensive dataset for multi-task
tear film analysis, comprising 15 high-resolution videos (totaling 6,247
frames) annotated with three vision tasks: frame-level classification ('clear',
'closed', 'broken', 'blur'), Placido Ring detection, and pixel-wise TFBU area
segmentation. Leveraging this dataset, we first propose TF-Net, a novel and
efficient baseline segmentation model. TF-Net incorporates a MobileOne-mini
backbone with re-parameterization techniques and an enhanced feature pyramid
network to achieve a favorable balance between accuracy and computational
efficiency for real-time clinical applications. We further establish benchmark
performance on the TFM segmentation subset by comparing TF-Net against several
state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models. Furthermore, we design
TF-Collab, a novel integrated real-time pipeline that synergistically leverages
models trained on all three tasks of the TFM dataset. By sequentially
orchestrating frame classification for BUT determination, pupil region
localization for input standardization, and TFBU segmentation, TF-Collab fully
automates the analysis. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed TF-Net and TF-Collab, providing a foundation for future research
in ocular surface diagnostics. Our code and the TFM datasets are available at

TL;DR: InstaGeo is an end-to-end framework that automates geospatial data processing, distills compact models, and enables rapid deployment of geospatial foundation models for Earth observation applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current geospatial foundation models face deployment limitations due to lack of automated data pipelines and large model sizes, hindering their practical use in humanitarian and environmental applications.

Method: InstaGeo integrates automated data curation to transform raw satellite imagery into model-ready datasets, task-specific model distillation to create compact models, and seamless deployment as interactive web-map applications.

Result: The framework reproduced datasets from three studies with minimal accuracy loss (-0.73 pp for flood mapping, -0.20 pp for crop segmentation, +1.79 pp for desert locust prediction) while creating models up to 8x smaller. It also achieved state-of-the-art 60.65% mIoU for crop segmentation.

Conclusion: InstaGeo transforms research-grade geospatial foundation models into practical, low-carbon tools for real-time Earth observation by unifying data preparation, model compression, and deployment, enabling users to progress from raw data to deployment within one working day.

Abstract: Open-access multispectral imagery from missions like Landsat 8-9 and
Sentinel-2 has fueled the development of geospatial foundation models (GFMs)
for humanitarian and environmental applications. Yet, their deployment remains
limited by (i) the absence of automated geospatial data pipelines and (ii) the
large size of fine-tuned models. Existing GFMs lack workflows for processing
raw satellite imagery, and downstream adaptations often retain the full
complexity of the original encoder.
  We present InstaGeo, an open-source, end-to-end framework that addresses
these challenges by integrating: (1) automated data curation to transform raw
imagery into model-ready datasets; (2) task-specific model distillation to
derive compact, compute-efficient models; and (3) seamless deployment as
interactive web-map applications. Using InstaGeo, we reproduced datasets from
three published studies and trained models with marginal mIoU differences of
-0.73 pp for flood mapping, -0.20 pp for crop segmentation, and +1.79 pp for
desert locust prediction. The distilled models are up to 8x smaller than
standard fine-tuned counterparts, reducing FLOPs and CO2 emissions with minimal
accuracy loss.
  Leveraging InstaGeo's streamlined data pipeline, we also curated a larger
crop segmentation dataset, achieving a state-of-the-art mIoU of 60.65%, a 12 pp
improvement over prior baselines. Moreover, InstaGeo enables users to progress
from raw data to model deployment within a single working day.
  By unifying data preparation, model compression, and deployment, InstaGeo
transforms research-grade GFMs into practical, low-carbon tools for real-time,
large-scale Earth observation. This approach shifts geospatial AI toward data
quality and application-driven innovation. Source code, datasets, and model

TL;DR: This paper challenges the assumption that frequency-domain artifacts (spectral peaks) are fundamental to deep learning-based synthetic image detectors, showing most detectors don't actually rely on them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether state-of-the-art synthetic image detectors truly rely on frequency-domain artifacts (spectral peaks) as commonly assumed, since current detectors are used as black-boxes with limited interpretability and trust.

Method: Proposed a strategy to remove spectral peaks from images and analyzed the impact on detectors. Also introduced a simple linear detector that relies exclusively on frequency peaks as an interpretable baseline.

Result: Findings reveal that most detectors are not fundamentally dependent on spectral peaks, challenging a widespread assumption in the field.

Conclusion: The study paves the way for more transparent and reliable forensic tools by demonstrating that current detectors' reliance on spectral peaks is not as fundamental as previously thought.

Abstract: Over the years, the forensics community has proposed several deep
learning-based detectors to mitigate the risks of generative AI. Recently,
frequency-domain artifacts (particularly periodic peaks in the magnitude
spectrum), have received significant attention, as they have been often
considered a strong indicator of synthetic image generation. However,
state-of-the-art detectors are typically used as black-boxes, and it still
remains unclear whether they truly rely on these peaks. This limits their
interpretability and trust. In this work, we conduct a systematic study to
address this question. We propose a strategy to remove spectral peaks from
images and analyze the impact of this operation on several detectors. In
addition, we introduce a simple linear detector that relies exclusively on
frequency peaks, providing a fully interpretable baseline free from the
confounding influence of deep learning. Our findings reveal that most detectors
are not fundamentally dependent on spectral peaks, challenging a widespread
assumption in the field and paving the way for more transparent and reliable
forensic tools.

*Shozo Saeki,Minoru Kawahara,Hirohisa Aman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes CHEST loss combining hyperbolic and Euclidean proxy-based losses with hyperbolic regularization for deep metric learning, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Proxy-based losses in hyperbolic space haven't been explored despite their advantages for large-scale datasets, while hyperbolic space offers richer structural representation capabilities.

Method: Combined Hyperbolic and Euclidean Soft Triple (CHEST) loss that integrates proxy-based losses in both hyperbolic and Euclidean spaces with hyperbolic hierarchical clustering regularization.

Result: Achieved new state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark datasets, with the combination improving both accuracy and learning stability.

Conclusion: The combination of hyperbolic and Euclidean spaces in proxy-based losses effectively improves deep metric learning performance and stability.

Abstract: Deep metric learning (DML) aims to learn a neural network mapping data to an
embedding space, which can represent semantic similarity between data points.
Hyperbolic space is attractive for DML since it can represent richer
structures, such as tree structures. DML in hyperbolic space is based on
pair-based loss or unsupervised regularization loss. On the other hand,
supervised proxy-based losses in hyperbolic space have not been reported yet
due to some issues in applying proxy-based losses in a hyperbolic space.
However, proxy-based losses are attractive for large-scale datasets since they
have less training complexity. To address these, this paper proposes the
Combined Hyperbolic and Euclidean Soft Triple (CHEST) loss. CHEST loss is
composed of the proxy-based losses in hyperbolic and Euclidean spaces and the
regularization loss based on hyperbolic hierarchical clustering. We find that
the combination of hyperbolic and Euclidean spaces improves DML accuracy and
learning stability for both spaces. Finally, we evaluate the CHEST loss on four
benchmark datasets, achieving a new state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents two deep learning frameworks for diagnosing ocular-induced abnormal head posture (AHP): AHP-CADNet for automated diagnosis using multi-level attention fusion, and a curriculum learning-based imputation framework to handle missing clinical data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current clinical assessments for AHP are subjective and complicated by incomplete medical records. Early diagnosis is crucial to minimize morbidity and secondary complications like facial asymmetry.

Method: Two complementary deep learning frameworks: 1) AHP-CADNet integrates ocular landmarks, head pose features, and clinical attributes with multi-level attention fusion; 2) Curriculum learning-based imputation framework progressively leverages structured variables and unstructured clinical notes to handle missing data.

Result: AHP-CADNet achieved 96.9-99.0% accuracy across classification tasks with MAE 0.103-0.199 and R2 >0.93. Imputation framework maintained 93.46-99.78% accuracy across clinical variables with significant improvements from clinical dependency modeling (p < 0.001).

Conclusion: Both frameworks are effective for automated diagnosis and recovery from missing data in clinical settings, demonstrating robust performance on the PoseGaze-AHP dataset.

Abstract: Ocular-induced abnormal head posture (AHP) is a compensatory mechanism that
arises from ocular misalignment conditions, such as strabismus, enabling
patients to reduce diplopia and preserve binocular vision. Early diagnosis
minimizes morbidity and secondary complications such as facial asymmetry;
however, current clinical assessments remain largely subjective and are further
complicated by incomplete medical records. This study addresses both challenges
through two complementary deep learning frameworks. First, AHP-CADNet is a
multi-level attention fusion framework for automated diagnosis that integrates
ocular landmarks, head pose features, and structured clinical attributes to
generate interpretable predictions. Second, a curriculum learning-based
imputation framework is designed to mitigate missing data by progressively
leveraging structured variables and unstructured clinical notes to enhance
diagnostic robustness under realistic data conditions. Evaluation on the
PoseGaze-AHP dataset demonstrates robust diagnostic performance. AHP-CADNet
achieves 96.9-99.0 percent accuracy across classification tasks and low
prediction errors for continuous variables, with MAE ranging from 0.103 to
0.199 and R2 exceeding 0.93. The imputation framework maintains high accuracy
across all clinical variables (93.46-99.78 percent with PubMedBERT), with
clinical dependency modeling yielding significant improvements (p < 0.001).
These findings confirm the effectiveness of both frameworks for automated
diagnosis and recovery from missing data in clinical settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing educational AI approaches mostly focus on short-term or single-agent settings, limiting systematic study of classroom complexity and cross-task reuse. There's a need to capture open-ended cognition, dynamic social interaction, affective factors, and multi-session development together.

Method: Built on a layered CIE (Cognition-Interaction-Evolution) architecture with human-in-the-loop interface, supporting individual consistency, authentic interaction, and longitudinal adaptation in cognition, emotion, and behavior.

Result: Validated in middle-school Chinese classes: instructional alignment with real classrooms (IRF rates 0.28-0.64 vs 0.37-0.49), group interaction with network density 0.27-0.40, cross-session evolution with positive transition rate increase by 11.7% on average.

Conclusion: EduVerse balances realism, reproducibility, and interpretability, providing a scalable platform for educational AI that will be open-sourced to foster cross-disciplinary research.

Abstract: Reproducing cognitive development, group interaction, and long-term evolution
in virtual classrooms remains a core challenge for educational AI, as real
classrooms integrate open-ended cognition, dynamic social interaction,
affective factors, and multi-session development rarely captured together.
Existing approaches mostly focus on short-term or single-agent settings,
limiting systematic study of classroom complexity and cross-task reuse. We
present EduVerse, the first user-defined multi-agent simulation space that
supports environment, agent, and session customization. A distinctive
human-in-the-loop interface further allows real users to join the space. Built
on a layered CIE (Cognition-Interaction-Evolution) architecture, EduVerse
ensures individual consistency, authentic interaction, and longitudinal
adaptation in cognition, emotion, and behavior-reproducing realistic classroom
dynamics with seamless human-agent integration. We validate EduVerse in
middle-school Chinese classes across three text genres, environments, and
multiple sessions. Results show: (1) Instructional alignment: simulated IRF
rates (0.28-0.64) closely match real classrooms (0.37-0.49), indicating
pedagogical realism; (2) Group interaction and role differentiation: network
density (0.27-0.40) with about one-third of peer links realized, while
human-agent tasks indicate a balance between individual variability and
instructional stability; (3) Cross-session evolution: the positive transition
rate R+ increase by 11.7% on average, capturing longitudinal shifts in
behavior, emotion, and cognition and revealing structured learning
trajectories. Overall, EduVerse balances realism, reproducibility, and
interpretability, providing a scalable platform for educational AI. The system
will be open-sourced to foster cross-disciplinary research.

TL;DR: SD-MVSum extends script-driven video summarization by incorporating both visual content and spoken transcripts, using a weighted cross-modal attention mechanism to enhance relevance to user-provided scripts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve script-driven video summarization by considering not only visual content but also the relevance of user-provided scripts with the video's spoken content, addressing multimodal dependencies.

Method: Proposes SD-MVSum with a new weighted cross-modal attention mechanism that models dependencies between script-video and script-transcript pairs, explicitly exploiting semantic similarity to prioritize video parts most relevant to the script.

Result: Experimental comparisons show SD-MVSum is competitive against state-of-the-art approaches for both script-driven and generic video summarization. Two large-scale datasets (S-VideoXum, MrHiSum) were extended for multimodal training and evaluation.

Conclusion: SD-MVSum effectively leverages multimodal dependencies through cross-modal attention for improved script-driven video summarization, with extended datasets enabling better training and evaluation of such methods.

Abstract: In this work, we extend a recent method for script-driven video
summarization, originally considering just the visual content of the video, to
take into account the relevance of the user-provided script also with the
video's spoken content. In the proposed method, SD-MVSum, the dependence
between each considered pair of data modalities, i.e., script-video and
script-transcript, is modeled using a new weighted cross-modal attention
mechanism. This explicitly exploits the semantic similarity between the paired
modalities in order to promote the parts of the full-length video with the
highest relevance to the user-provided script. Furthermore, we extend two
large-scale datasets for video summarization (S-VideoXum, MrHiSum), to make
them suitable for training and evaluation of script-driven multimodal video
summarization methods. Experimental comparisons document the competitiveness of
our SD-MVSum method against other SOTA approaches for script-driven and generic
video summarization. Our new method and extended datasets are available at:

*Anwen Lu,Mingxin Liu,Yiping Jiao,Hongyi Gong,Geyang Xu,Jun Chen,Jun Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ARGUS is a novel method for liver cancer histological subtyping that captures hierarchical information from Whole Slide Images by combining micro-geometry features of cell patterns with macro-meso hierarchical interactions through a Geometry Prior Guided Fusion strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Liver cancers like HCC and ICC are highly heterogeneous with complex tissue morphology. Current approaches fail to adequately exploit crucial hierarchical pyramid structure, tumor microenvironment, and geometric representation information in WSIs, leading to limited understanding and suboptimal subtyping performance.

Method: ARGUS constructs micro-geometry features for cell-level patterns using geometric structure across nuclei, designs a Hierarchical Field-of-Views Alignment module for macro-meso level interactions, and fuses these features via Geometry Prior Guided Fusion strategy for holistic phenotype modeling.

Result: Extensive experiments on public and private cohorts demonstrate that ARGUS achieves state-of-the-art performance in histological subtyping of liver cancer.

Conclusion: ARGUS provides an effective diagnostic tool for primary liver malignancies in clinical practice by advancing histological subtyping through comprehensive hierarchical feature capture.

Abstract: Primary liver malignancies are widely recognized as the most heterogeneous
and prognostically diverse cancers of the digestive system. Among these,
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) emerge
as the two principal histological subtypes, demonstrating significantly greater
complexity in tissue morphology and cellular architecture than other common
tumors. The intricate representation of features in Whole Slide Images (WSIs)
encompasses abundant crucial information for liver cancer histological
subtyping, regarding hierarchical pyramid structure, tumor microenvironment
(TME), and geometric representation. However, recent approaches have not
adequately exploited these indispensable effective descriptors, resulting in a
limited understanding of histological representation and suboptimal subtyping
performance. To mitigate these limitations, ARGUS is proposed to advance
histological subtyping in liver cancer by capturing the macro-meso-micro
hierarchical information within the TME. Specifically, we first construct a
micro-geometry feature to represent fine-grained cell-level pattern via a
geometric structure across nuclei, thereby providing a more refined and precise
perspective for delineating pathological images. Then, a Hierarchical
Field-of-Views (FoVs) Alignment module is designed to model macro- and
meso-level hierarchical interactions inherent in WSIs. Finally, the augmented
micro-geometry and FoVs features are fused into a joint representation via
present Geometry Prior Guided Fusion strategy for modeling holistic phenotype
interactions. Extensive experiments on public and private cohorts demonstrate
that our ARGUS achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in histological
subtyping of liver cancer, which provide an effective diagnostic tool for
primary liver malignancies in clinical practice.

### [29] [Teleportraits: Training-Free People Insertion into Any Scene](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05660)
*Jialu Gao,K J Joseph,Fernando De La Torre*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Training-free pipeline for realistic human insertion into scenes using pre-trained diffusion models, achieving state-of-the-art results without task-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous approaches treat human insertion as separate problems (location/pose determination and personalization) and require training, overlooking their interconnections.

Method: Unified training-free pipeline leveraging pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models with inversion techniques, classifier-free guidance, and mask-guided self-attention mechanism.

Result: Achieves affordance-aware global editing and high-quality personalization with excellent identity preservation from single reference images.

Conclusion: First training-free method for realistic human insertion that demonstrates diffusion models inherently possess knowledge to place people in complex scenes without specific training.

Abstract: The task of realistically inserting a human from a reference image into a
background scene is highly challenging, requiring the model to (1) determine
the correct location and poses of the person and (2) perform high-quality
personalization conditioned on the background. Previous approaches often treat
them as separate problems, overlooking their interconnections, and typically
rely on training to achieve high performance. In this work, we introduce a
unified training-free pipeline that leverages pre-trained text-to-image
diffusion models. We show that diffusion models inherently possess the
knowledge to place people in complex scenes without requiring task-specific
training. By combining inversion techniques with classifier-free guidance, our
method achieves affordance-aware global editing, seamlessly inserting people
into scenes. Furthermore, our proposed mask-guided self-attention mechanism
ensures high-quality personalization, preserving the subject's identity,
clothing, and body features from just a single reference image. To the best of
our knowledge, we are the first to perform realistic human insertions into
scenes in a training-free manner and achieve state-of-the-art results in
diverse composite scene images with excellent identity preservation in
backgrounds and subjects.

### [30] [When and How to Cut Classical Concerts? A Multimodal Automated Video Editing Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05661)
*Daniel GonzÃ¡lbez-Biosca,Josep Cabacas-Maso,Carles Ventura,Ismael Benito-Altamirano*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a multimodal architecture for automated video editing of multicamera classical music concerts, addressing when to cut (temporal segmentation) and how to cut (spatial selection) using audio-visual features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated video editing is underexplored compared to video generation and scene understanding, especially for multicamera classical music concert recordings.

Method: Uses multimodal architecture with log-mel spectrograms, optional image embeddings, and temporal features through convolutional-transformer pipeline for temporal segmentation. For spatial selection, employs CLIP-based encoder instead of ResNet and constrains distractor selection to same concert segments.

Result: Models outperformed previous baselines in detecting cut points and provided competitive visual shot selection.

Conclusion: The approach advances state of the art in multimodal automated video editing for classical music concerts.

Abstract: Automated video editing remains an underexplored task in the computer vision
and multimedia domains, especially when contrasted with the growing interest in
video generation and scene understanding. In this work, we address the specific
challenge of editing multicamera recordings of classical music concerts by
decomposing the problem into two key sub-tasks: when to cut and how to cut.
Building on recent literature, we propose a novel multimodal architecture for
the temporal segmentation task (when to cut), which integrates log-mel
spectrograms from the audio signals, plus an optional image embedding, and
scalar temporal features through a lightweight convolutional-transformer
pipeline. For the spatial selection task (how to cut), we improve the
literature by updating from old backbones, e.g. ResNet, with a CLIP-based
encoder and constraining distractor selection to segments from the same
concert. Our dataset was constructed following a pseudo-labeling approach, in
which raw video data was automatically clustered into coherent shot segments.
We show that our models outperformed previous baselines in detecting cut points
and provide competitive visual shot selection, advancing the state of the art
in multimodal automated video editing.

*M. Torrente,A. Follador,A. Calcante,P. Casati,R. Oberti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A low-cost image-based system was developed to monitor R. solani's effects on lettuce seed germination, using temporal integration in image analysis to accurately count seedlings even when overlapping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the impact of R. solani pathogen on lettuce seed germination and early development using non-destructive, scalable monitoring methods.

Method: Deployed multiple cameras for continuous imaging and developed a novel image analysis pipeline that integrates morphological and spatial features with temporal data across time points.

Result: R. solani infection significantly reduced germination rates and seedling vigor. The method achieved high accuracy (RÂ²=0.98, RMSE=1.12) in counting, especially in dense growth where traditional methods fail.

Conclusion: Combining low-cost imaging with advanced computational tools enables reliable, non-destructive phenotyping, with temporal integration proving crucial for accurate seedling quantification in complex conditions.

Abstract: The study investigates the effects of R. solani inoculation on the
germination and early development of Lactuca sativa L. seeds using a low-cost,
image-based monitoring system. Multiple cameras were deployed to continuously
capture images of the germination process in both infected and control groups.
The objective was to assess the impact of the pathogen by analyzing germination
dynamics and growth over time. To achieve this, a novel image analysis pipeline
was developed. The algorithm integrates both morphological and spatial features
to identify and quantify individual seedlings, even under complex conditions
where traditional image analyses fails. A key innovation of the method lies in
its temporal integration: each analysis step considers not only the current
status but also their developmental across prior time points. This approach
enables robust discrimination of individual seedlings, especially when
overlapping leaves significantly hinder object separation. The method
demonstrated high accuracy in seedling counting and vigor assessment, even in
challenging scenarios characterized by dense and intertwined growth. Results
confirm that R. solani infection significantly reduces germination rates and
early seedling vigor. The study also validates the feasibility of combining
low-cost imaging hardware with advanced computational tools to obtain
phenotyping data in a non-destructive and scalable manner. The temporal
integration enabled accurate quantification of germinated seeds and precise
determination of seedling emergence timing. This approach proved particularly
effective in later stages of the experiment, where conventional segmentation
techniques failed due to overlapping or intertwined seedlings, making accurate
counting. The method achieved a coefficient of determination of 0.98 and a root
mean square error (RMSE) of 1.12, demonstrating its robustness and reliability.

### [32] [Context Matters: Learning Global Semantics for Visual Reasoning and Comprehension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05674)
*Jike Zhong,Yuxiang Lai,Xiaofeng Yang,Konstantinos Psounis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using object-level masking instead of random patches in masked image modeling to help vision transformers learn better semantic representations and reasoning capabilities, similar to how language models work with words.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision models lag behind language models in emergent capabilities like reasoning and in-context learning, which may be due to lack of semantic guidance in current ViT training using spatial patchification that lacks semantic information.

Method: Propose object-level masked image modeling where masks are applied to visual objects rather than random patches, treating objects as visual equivalents of words to learn global context and semantics.

Result: Object-level representation alone helps learn real-world distributions and avoids pixel-averaging shortcuts. Evaluations on VQA, GQA, and ScienceQA show improved reasoning and contextual understanding with multimodal LLMs.

Conclusion: Object-level encoding is effective for developing stronger vision encoders and tokenizers, providing a direction to bridge the gap between vision and language model capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in language modeling have witnessed the rise of highly
desirable emergent capabilities, such as reasoning and in-context learning.
However, vision models have yet to exhibit comparable progress in these areas.
In this paper, we argue that this gap could stem from the lack of semantic and
contextual guidance in current vision transformer (ViT) training schemes, and
such a gap can be narrowed through the design of a semantic-grounded objective.
Specifically, we notice that individual words in natural language are
inherently semantic, and modeling directly on word tokens naturally learns a
realistic distribution. In contrast, ViTs rely on spatial patchification, which
inevitably lacks semantic information. To bridge this gap, we propose to
directly model "object" as the visual equivalence of "word," pushing the model
to learn the global context and semantics among visual elements. We investigate
our hypotheses via masked image modeling (MIM), a framework where our approach
can be readily tested by applying masks to visual objects rather than random
patches. Considerable evidence from qualitative and quantitative evaluations
reveals a key finding: object-level representation alone helps to learn a
real-world distribution, whereas pixel-averaging shortcuts are often learned
without it. Moreover, further evaluations with multimodal LLMs (MLLM) on visual
question answering (VQA, GQA, ScienceQA) tasks demonstrate the strong reasoning
and contextual understanding gained with this simple objective. We hope our
study highlights the effectiveness of object-level encoding and provides a
plausible direction for developing stronger vision encoders and tokenizers.
Code and model will be publicly released. Keywords: Semantic Visual Tokenizer,

*Shihao Zhu,Bohan Cao,Ziheng Ouyang,Zhen Li,Peng-Tao Jiang,Qibin Hou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AgeBooth is a novel age-specific finetuning approach that enhances age control in identity personalization models without requiring expensive age-varied datasets, using age-conditioned prompt blending and age-specific LoRA fusion with SVDMix.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models struggle to accurately control age while preserving identity, and fine-tuning such models often requires costly paired images across ages.

Method: The approach uses age-conditioned prompt blending and an age-specific LoRA fusion strategy that leverages SVDMix, a matrix fusion technique, to exploit the linear nature of aging and enable high-quality generation of intermediate-age portraits.

Result: AgeBooth produces realistic and identity-consistent face images across different ages from a single reference image, achieving superior age control and visual quality compared to previous state-of-the-art editing-based methods.

Conclusion: AgeBooth effectively enhances age control capability without the need for expensive age-varied datasets, making it a practical solution for age-specific image generation.

Abstract: Recent diffusion model research focuses on generating identity-consistent
images from a reference photo, but they struggle to accurately control age
while preserving identity, and fine-tuning such models often requires costly
paired images across ages. In this paper, we propose AgeBooth, a novel
age-specific finetuning approach that can effectively enhance the age control
capability of adapterbased identity personalization models without the need for
expensive age-varied datasets. To reduce dependence on a large amount of
age-labeled data, we exploit the linear nature of aging by introducing
age-conditioned prompt blending and an age-specific LoRA fusion strategy that
leverages SVDMix, a matrix fusion technique. These techniques enable
high-quality generation of intermediate-age portraits. Our AgeBooth produces
realistic and identity-consistent face images across different ages from a
single reference image. Experiments show that AgeBooth achieves superior age
control and visual quality compared to previous state-of-the-art editing-based
methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free pipeline using ControlNet and Vision-Language Models generates synthetic images with pixel-level labels for semantic segmentation, eliminating manual annotation needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional data augmentation struggles with high-level semantic attributes like materials and textures, while existing diffusion methods are computationally expensive or compromise performance.

Method: Integrates pretrained ControlNet and VLMs with Multi-way Prompt Generator, Mask Generator, and High-quality Image Selection module to generate labeled synthetic images without training.

Result: Achieves promising performance on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i datasets, outperforming concurrent work in one-shot semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: The proposed training-free pipeline effectively generates diverse synthetic data with pixel-level labels, significantly improving downstream semantic segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Generating enough and diverse data through augmentation offers an efficient
solution to the time-consuming and labour-intensive process of collecting and
annotating pixel-wise images. Traditional data augmentation techniques often
face challenges in manipulating high-level semantic attributes, such as
materials and textures. In contrast, diffusion models offer a robust
alternative, by effectively utilizing text-to-image or image-to-image
transformation. However, existing diffusion-based methods are either
computationally expensive or compromise on performance. To address this issue,
we introduce a novel training-free pipeline that integrates pretrained
ControlNet and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to generate synthetic images
paired with pixel-level labels. This approach eliminates the need for manual
annotations and significantly improves downstream tasks. To improve the
fidelity and diversity, we add a Multi-way Prompt Generator, Mask Generator and
High-quality Image Selection module. Our results on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i
present promising performance and outperform concurrent work for one-shot
semantic segmentation.

*Amirtaha Amanzadi,Zahra Dehghanian,Hamid Beigy,Hamid R. Rabiee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces OmniGen Benchmark for evaluating synthetic image detectors across visual domains and generators, and proposes FusionDetect method that combines CLIP and Dinov2 features to achieve state-of-the-art performance with improved generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current synthetic image detectors focus too narrowly on cross-generator generalization while ignoring the equally important challenge of generalization across visual domains. There's a need for more comprehensive evaluation and better detection methods.

Method: FusionDetect leverages two frozen foundation models (CLIP and Dinov2) to derive complementary features, creating a cohesive feature space that adapts to changes in both content and generator design.

Result: FusionDetect achieves 3.87% higher accuracy than closest competitor and 6.13% higher precision on established benchmarks, plus 4.48% accuracy improvement on OmniGen benchmark with exceptional robustness to image perturbations.

Conclusion: The paper presents both a top-performing detector (FusionDetect) and a new benchmark (OmniGen) that provides a framework for advancing universal AI image detection across diverse generators and visual domains.

Abstract: The rapid development of generative models has made it increasingly crucial
to develop detectors that can reliably detect synthetic images. Although most
of the work has now focused on cross-generator generalization, we argue that
this viewpoint is too limited. Detecting synthetic images involves another
equally important challenge: generalization across visual domains. To bridge
this gap,we present the OmniGen Benchmark. This comprehensive evaluation
dataset incorporates 12 state-of-the-art generators, providing a more realistic
way of evaluating detector performance under realistic conditions. In addition,
we introduce a new method, FusionDetect, aimed at addressing both vectors of
generalization. FusionDetect draws on the benefits of two frozen foundation
models: CLIP & Dinov2. By deriving features from both complementary models,we
develop a cohesive feature space that naturally adapts to changes in both
thecontent and design of the generator. Our extensive experiments demonstrate
that FusionDetect delivers not only a new state-of-the-art, which is 3.87% more
accurate than its closest competitor and 6.13% more precise on average on
established benchmarks, but also achieves a 4.48% increase in accuracy on
OmniGen,along with exceptional robustness to common image perturbations. We
introduce not only a top-performing detector, but also a new benchmark and
framework for furthering universal AI image detection. The code and dataset are

*Yongxuan Lyu,Guangfeng Jiang,Hongsi Liu,Jun Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ALISE is a novel framework for unsupervised LiDAR instance segmentation that eliminates the need for manual annotations by using Vision Foundation Models to generate pseudo-labels and refining them through spatio-temporal voting and semantic supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual annotation of outdoor LiDAR point clouds for instance segmentation is extremely costly and time-consuming, and current methods still rely on some form of human labeling.

Method: Uses Vision Foundation Models guided by text and images to generate initial pseudo-labels, refines them through spatio-temporal voting module combining 2D and 3D semantics, and applies 2D prior-based losses and prototype-based contrastive loss for feature learning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance for unsupervised 3D instance segmentation, outperforming MWSIS (which uses GT 2D bounding box supervision) by 2.53% in mAP (50.95% vs. 48.42%).

Conclusion: ALISE successfully eliminates dependency on manual annotations while achieving superior performance through comprehensive unsupervised learning approach.

Abstract: The manual annotation of outdoor LiDAR point clouds for instance segmentation
is extremely costly and time-consuming. Current methods attempt to reduce this
burden but still rely on some form of human labeling. To completely eliminate
this dependency, we introduce ALISE, a novel framework that performs LiDAR
instance segmentation without any annotations. The central challenge is to
generate high-quality pseudo-labels in a fully unsupervised manner. Our
approach starts by employing Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), guided by text
and images, to produce initial pseudo-labels. We then refine these labels
through a dedicated spatio-temporal voting module, which combines 2D and 3D
semantics for both offline and online optimization. To achieve superior feature
learning, we further introduce two forms of semantic supervision: a set of 2D
prior-based losses that inject visual knowledge into the 3D network, and a
novel prototype-based contrastive loss that builds a discriminative feature
space by exploiting 3D semantic consistency. This comprehensive design results
in significant performance gains, establishing a new state-of-the-art for
unsupervised 3D instance segmentation. Remarkably, our approach even
outperforms MWSIS, a method that operates with supervision from ground-truth
(GT) 2D bounding boxes by a margin of 2.53% in mAP (50.95% vs. 48.42%).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OneVision is an end-to-end generative framework that addresses representation discrepancies in traditional multi-stage cascading architecture for vision search, improving both efficiency and conversion rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multi-stage cascading architecture suffers from multi-view representation discrepancies between query images and products, making it difficult to achieve optimal user experience and conversion rates.

Method: Uses VRQ (vision-aligned residual quantization encoding) to align different representations across viewpoints while preserving product distinctiveness, and employs multi-stage semantic alignment to maintain visual similarity while incorporating user-specific preferences.

Result: Offline: performs on par with online MCA while improving inference efficiency by 21% through dynamic pruning. Online A/B tests: +2.15% item CTR, +2.27% CVR, and +3.12% order volume.

Conclusion: A semantic ID centric, generative architecture can effectively unify retrieval and personalization while simplifying the serving pathway.

Abstract: Traditional vision search, similar to search and recommendation systems,
follows the multi-stage cascading architecture (MCA) paradigm to balance
efficiency and conversion. Specifically, the query image undergoes feature
extraction, recall, pre-ranking, and ranking stages, ultimately presenting the
user with semantically similar products that meet their preferences. This
multi-view representation discrepancy of the same object in the query and the
optimization objective collide across these stages, making it difficult to
achieve Pareto optimality in both user experience and conversion. In this
paper, an end-to-end generative framework, OneVision, is proposed to address
these problems. OneVision builds on VRQ, a vision-aligned residual quantization
encoding, which can align the vastly different representations of an object
across multiple viewpoints while preserving the distinctive features of each
product as much as possible. Then a multi-stage semantic alignment scheme is
adopted to maintain strong visual similarity priors while effectively
incorporating user-specific information for personalized preference generation.
In offline evaluations, OneVision performs on par with online MCA, while
improving inference efficiency by 21% through dynamic pruning. In A/B tests, it
achieves significant online improvements: +2.15% item CTR, +2.27% CVR, and
+3.12% order volume. These results demonstrate that a semantic ID centric,
generative architecture can unify retrieval and personalization while
simplifying the serving pathway.

*Gianmarco Perantoni,Lorenzo Bruzzone*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a method to train deep networks using multiple weak labeled data sources with a small reliable dataset, incorporating source reliability via transition matrices to weight labels during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning for remote sensing scene classification requires large labeled datasets, but reliable labels are costly and limited. Many weak labeled sources exist but contain errors.

Method: Combines single/multiple weak labeled sources with small reliable dataset. Uses transition matrices describing error statistics to weight labels during training, acting as gradient-level weighting scheme.

Result: Experiments on different datasets validate effectiveness, showing robustness and capability to leverage unreliable label sources.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully enables training deep networks with larger datasets by incorporating source reliability information, overcoming limitations of scarce reliable labels in remote sensing.

Abstract: Deep learning has gained broad interest in remote sensing image scene
classification thanks to the effectiveness of deep neural networks in
extracting the semantics from complex data. However, deep networks require
large amounts of training samples to obtain good generalization capabilities
and are sensitive to errors in the training labels. This is a problem in remote
sensing since highly reliable labels can be obtained at high costs and in
limited amount. However, many sources of less reliable labeled data are
available, e.g., obsolete digital maps. In order to train deep networks with
larger datasets, we propose both the combination of single or multiple weak
sources of labeled data with a small but reliable dataset to generate
multisource labeled datasets and a novel training strategy where the
reliability of each source is taken in consideration. This is done by
exploiting the transition matrices describing the statistics of the errors of
each source. The transition matrices are embedded into the labels and used
during the training process to weigh each label according to the related
source. The proposed method acts as a weighting scheme at gradient level, where
each instance contributes with different weights to the optimization of
different classes. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by
experiments on different datasets. The results proved the robustness and
capability of leveraging on unreliable source of labels of the proposed method.

TL;DR: Intermediate layers of pre-trained models contain rich signals for OOD detection. An entropy-based method automatically selects complementary layers without OOD data, improving detection accuracy by up to 10% in far-OOD and 7% in near-OOD benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most OOD detection methods only use final-layer representations from pre-trained models, ignoring potentially valuable information in intermediate layers.

Method: Use intermediate layers of pre-trained models with residual connections, and introduce an entropy-based criterion to automatically select layers with complementary information without requiring OOD data.

Result: Improves OOD detection accuracy by up to 10% in far-OOD and over 7% in near-OOD benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art training-free methods across various model architectures and training objectives.

Conclusion: Intermediate layers provide surprisingly rich signals for OOD detection, revealing a new research direction and showing the impact of training objectives and architectures on confidence-based OOD methods.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for reliably deploying
machine learning models in the wild. Yet, most methods treat large pre-trained
models as monolithic encoders and rely solely on their final-layer
representations for detection. We challenge this wisdom. We reveal the
\textit{intermediate layers} of pre-trained models, shaped by residual
connections that subtly transform input projections, \textit{can} encode
\textit{surprisingly rich and diverse signals} for detecting distributional
shifts. Importantly, to exploit latent representation diversity across layers,
we introduce an entropy-based criterion to \textit{automatically} identify
layers offering the most complementary information in a training-free setting
-- \textit{without access to OOD data}. We show that selectively incorporating
these intermediate representations can increase the accuracy of OOD detection
by up to \textbf{$10\%$} in far-OOD and over \textbf{$7\%$} in near-OOD
benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art training-free methods across various
model architectures and training objectives. Our findings reveal a new avenue
for OOD detection research and uncover the impact of various training
objectives and model architectures on confidence-based OOD detection methods.

TL;DR: A rasterization-based optimization method that accelerates Steered Mixture of Experts regression for 2D image processing while maintaining quality and sparsity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high computational cost of Steered Mixture of Experts limits practical applications despite its strong performance in image reconstruction tasks.

Method: Combines rasterized Gaussian kernel rendering efficiency with edge-aware gating mechanism, replacing global iterative optimization with rasterized formulation.

Result: Achieves significantly faster parameter updates, more memory-efficient representations, and supports native super-resolution and denoising not possible with standard rasterized approaches.

Conclusion: Provides optimal balance between computational efficiency and reconstruction fidelity for 2D image processing tasks.

Abstract: The Steered Mixture of Experts regression framework has demonstrated strong
performance in image reconstruction, compression, denoising, and
super-resolution. However, its high computational cost limits practical
applications. This work introduces a rasterization-based optimization strategy
that combines the efficiency of rasterized Gaussian kernel rendering with the
edge-aware gating mechanism of the Steered Mixture of Experts. The proposed
method is designed to accelerate two-dimensional image regression while
maintaining the model's inherent sparsity and reconstruction quality. By
replacing global iterative optimization with a rasterized formulation, the
method achieves significantly faster parameter updates and more
memory-efficient model representations. In addition, the proposed framework
supports applications such as native super-resolution and image denoising,
which are not directly achievable with standard rasterized Gaussian kernel
approaches. The combination of fast rasterized optimization with the edge-aware
structure of the Steered Mixture of Experts provides a new balance between
computational efficiency and reconstruction fidelity for two-dimensional image
processing tasks.

TL;DR: Self-supervised deep learning method detects five cardiac keyframes in CMR images using motion descriptors from deformable registration, achieving improved accuracy over volume-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard volume-based methods only detect ED and ES frames, lacking deeper insight into myocardial motion. Individual cardiac cycles complicate temporal comparison and sub-phase analysis.

Method: Uses dense deformable registration fields to compute 1D motion descriptors from CMR images, then applies rule-based detection of keyframes from characteristic motion curves.

Result: Achieved 30-51% improvement in ED/ES detection accuracy for SAX and 11-47% for 4CH views compared to volume-based approach. Detects five keyframes with mean cyclic frame difference below 1.31 frames for SAX and 1.73 for LAX.

Conclusion: Enables temporally aligned inter- and intra-patient analysis of cardiac dynamics independent of cycle or phase lengths, providing deeper insights into myocardial motion patterns.

Abstract: Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is the gold standard for assessing
cardiac function, but individual cardiac cycles complicate automatic temporal
comparison or sub-phase analysis. Accurate cardiac keyframe detection can
eliminate this problem. However, automatic methods solely derive end-systole
(ES) and end-diastole (ED) frames from left ventricular volume curves, which do
not provide a deeper insight into myocardial motion. We propose a
self-supervised deep learning method detecting five keyframes in short-axis
(SAX) and four-chamber long-axis (4CH) cine CMR. Initially, dense deformable
registration fields are derived from the images and used to compute a 1D motion
descriptor, which provides valuable insights into global cardiac contraction
and relaxation patterns. From these characteristic curves, keyframes are
determined using a simple set of rules. The method was independently evaluated
for both views using three public, multicentre, multidisease datasets. M&Ms-2
(n=360) dataset was used for training and evaluation, and M&Ms (n=345) and ACDC
(n=100) datasets for repeatability control. Furthermore, generalisability to
patients with rare congenital heart defects was tested using the German
Competence Network (GCN) dataset. Our self-supervised approach achieved
improved detection accuracy by 30% - 51% for SAX and 11% - 47% for 4CH in ED
and ES, as measured by cyclic frame difference (cFD), compared with the
volume-based approach. We can detect ED and ES, as well as three additional
keyframes throughout the cardiac cycle with a mean cFD below 1.31 frames for
SAX and 1.73 for LAX. Our approach enables temporally aligned inter- and
intra-patient analysis of cardiac dynamics, irrespective of cycle or phase
lengths. GitHub repository:

### [42] [Flow4Agent: Long-form Video Understanding via Motion Prior from Optical Flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05836)
*Ruyang Liu,Shangkun Sun,Haoran Tang,Ge Li,Wei Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Flow4Agent is a novel framework that uses optical flow motion priors to address redundancy in long-form video understanding, outperforming existing methods on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-form video understanding is challenging due to temporal and spatial redundancy, exacerbated by limited context length in MLLMs. Existing methods rely heavily on semantic-aware key extraction using CLIP, but motion information is underutilized.

Method: Flow4Agent uses two core modules: Temporal Granularity Optimization (TGO) adaptively refines frame hierarchies using coarse flow priors to group similar content and semantic priors to filter irrelevant scenes. Motion Token Pruning (MTP) refines intra-frame representations by pruning high-redundancy tokens using fine-grained optical flow.

Result: Extensive experiments show Flow4Agent outperforms existing methods across video MLLM benchmarks, achieving 64.7% on Video-MME, 71.4% on MLVU, and 60.4% on LongVideoBench, especially excelling in hour-level video understanding.

Conclusion: Incorporating motion priors from optical flow effectively addresses redundancy in long videos and significantly improves LLM-based video understanding performance, particularly for extended video content.

Abstract: Long-form video understanding has always been a challenging problem due to
the significant redundancy in both temporal and spatial contents. This
challenge is further exacerbated by the limited context length of Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs). To address this issue, many previous works have
attempted to extract key video information, where the "key" is typically
semantic-aware and heavily dependent on the CLIP model as prior. In this paper,
we propose Flow4Agent, a novel framework that pioneeringly incorporates motion
priors from optical flow to facilitate LLM-based long video understanding.
Flow4Agent mitigates the redundancy in long videos at both temporal and spatial
levels through two core modules: Temporal Granularity Optimization (TGO)
adaptively refines framelevel hierarchies, which first leverages coarse flow
priors to group similar visual contents and then applies semantic priors to
filter out highly irrelevant scene information. Motion Token Pruning (MTP)
further refines the intra-frame visual representations, pruning high-redundancy
video tokens using fine-grained optical flow information. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our Flow4Agent outperforms existing methods across a wide
range of video MLLM benchmarks, especially for hour-level video understanding
tasks, achieving 64.7% on Video-MME, 71.4% on MLVU and 60.4% on LongVideoBench.

TL;DR: The paper presents acia-workflows, a platform for automated analysis of live-cell imaging data using deep learning methods for segmentation and tracking, packaged in accessible Jupyter Notebook workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-throughput live-cell imaging generates massive data volumes that obscure biological insights, requiring automated analysis tools that are accessible and user-friendly for routine biological research applications.

Method: Developed a platform with three components: (1) acia Python library with 8 deep learning segmentation/tracking approaches, (2) reproducible Jupyter Notebook workflows combining analysis pipelines with dependencies and visualizations, and (3) application workflows for real-world use cases including microfluidic LCI experiments.

Result: Created more than ten open-source application workflows that enable analysis ranging from growth rate comparisons to minute-resolution quantitative analyses of individual cell responses to changing oxygen conditions.

Conclusion: The acia-workflows platform successfully integrates powerful deep learning tools into accessible, reproducible workflows that support systematic study of single-cell dynamics in live-cell imaging experiments.

Abstract: Live-cell imaging (LCI) technology enables the detailed spatio-temporal
characterization of living cells at the single-cell level, which is critical
for advancing research in the life sciences, from biomedical applications to
bioprocessing. High-throughput setups with tens to hundreds of parallel cell
cultivations offer the potential for robust and reproducible insights. However,
these insights are obscured by the large amount of LCI data recorded per
experiment. Recent advances in state-of-the-art deep learning methods for cell
segmentation and tracking now enable the automated analysis of such large data
volumes, offering unprecedented opportunities to systematically study
single-cell dynamics. The next key challenge lies in integrating these powerful
tools into accessible, flexible, and user-friendly workflows that support
routine application in biological research. In this work, we present
acia-workflows, a platform that combines three key components: (1) the
Automated live-Cell Imaging Analysis (acia) Python library, which supports the
modular design of image analysis pipelines offering eight deep learning
segmentation and tracking approaches; (2) workflows that assemble the image
analysis pipeline, its software dependencies, documentation, and visualizations
into a single Jupyter Notebook, leading to accessible, reproducible and
scalable analysis workflows; and (3) a collection of application workflows
showcasing the analysis and customization capabilities in real-world
applications. Specifically, we present three workflows to investigate various
types of microfluidic LCI experiments ranging from growth rate comparisons to
precise, minute-resolution quantitative analyses of individual dynamic cells
responses to changing oxygen conditions. Our collection of more than ten
application workflows is open source and publicly available at

TL;DR: BioAutoML-NAS is a neural architecture search model that uses multimodal data (images and metadata) for insect classification, achieving state-of-the-art performance on large-scale datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Insect classification is crucial for agricultural management and ecological research, but remains challenging due to complex insect characteristics, class imbalance, and large-scale datasets.

Method: Uses neural architecture search (NAS) to automatically learn best operations for each connection within cells, stacks multiple cells for feature extraction, employs multimodal fusion to combine image embeddings with metadata, and uses alternating bi-level optimization with zero operations for sparse, efficient architectures.

Result: Achieved 96.81% accuracy, 97.46% precision, 96.81% recall, and 97.05% F1 score on BIOSCAN-5M dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 16%, 10%, and 8% respectively. On Insects-1M dataset: 93.25% accuracy, 93.71% precision, 92.74% recall, and 93.22% F1 score.

Conclusion: BioAutoML-NAS provides accurate, confident insect classification that supports modern sustainable farming through its automated architecture search and multimodal fusion approach.

Abstract: Insect classification is important for agricultural management and ecological
research, as it directly affects crop health and production. However, this task
remains challenging due to the complex characteristics of insects, class
imbalance, and large-scale datasets. To address these issues, we propose
BioAutoML-NAS, the first BioAutoML model using multimodal data, including
images, and metadata, which applies neural architecture search (NAS) for images
to automatically learn the best operations for each connection within each
cell. Multiple cells are stacked to form the full network, each extracting
detailed image feature representations. A multimodal fusion module combines
image embeddings with metadata, allowing the model to use both visual and
categorical biological information to classify insects. An alternating bi-level
optimization training strategy jointly updates network weights and architecture
parameters, while zero operations remove less important connections, producing
sparse, efficient, and high-performing architectures. Extensive evaluation on
the BIOSCAN-5M dataset demonstrates that BioAutoML-NAS achieves 96.81%
accuracy, 97.46% precision, 96.81% recall, and a 97.05% F1 score, outperforming
state-of-the-art transfer learning, transformer, AutoML, and NAS methods by
approximately 16%, 10%, and 8% respectively. Further validation on the
Insects-1M dataset obtains 93.25% accuracy, 93.71% precision, 92.74% recall,
and a 93.22% F1 score. These results demonstrate that BioAutoML-NAS provides
accurate, confident insect classification that supports modern sustainable
farming.

TL;DR: Proposes D3QE method for detecting images generated by autoregressive models using discrete distribution discrepancy and quantization error analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual autoregressive models have revolutionized image generation but present new challenges for synthetic image detection due to their unique discrete token prediction approach.

Method: Leverages Discrete Distribution Discrepancy-aware Quantization Error (D3QE) with a transformer that integrates dynamic codebook frequency statistics into attention mechanism, fusing semantic features and quantization error latent.

Result: Achieves superior detection accuracy and strong generalization across 7 mainstream AR models, with robustness to real-world perturbations. Evaluated on comprehensive ARForensics dataset.

Conclusion: D3QE effectively exploits distinctive patterns and frequency distribution bias in codebook representations to detect autoregressive-generated images with high accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: The emergence of visual autoregressive (AR) models has revolutionized image
generation while presenting new challenges for synthetic image detection.
Unlike previous GAN or diffusion-based methods, AR models generate images
through discrete token prediction, exhibiting both marked improvements in image
synthesis quality and unique characteristics in their vector-quantized
representations. In this paper, we propose to leverage Discrete Distribution
Discrepancy-aware Quantization Error (D$^3$QE) for autoregressive-generated
image detection that exploits the distinctive patterns and the frequency
distribution bias of the codebook existing in real and fake images. We
introduce a discrete distribution discrepancy-aware transformer that integrates
dynamic codebook frequency statistics into its attention mechanism, fusing
semantic features and quantization error latent. To evaluate our method, we
construct a comprehensive dataset termed ARForensics covering 7 mainstream
visual AR models. Experiments demonstrate superior detection accuracy and
strong generalization of D$^3$QE across different AR models, with robustness to
real-world perturbations. Code is available at

*Jiesi Hu,Yanwu Yang,Zhiyu Ye,Jinyan Zhou,Jianfeng Cao,Hanyang Peng,Ting Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WS-ICL is a weakly supervised in-context learning approach for medical image segmentation that uses weak prompts like bounding boxes or points instead of dense labels, reducing annotation effort while maintaining comparable performance to regular ICL models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current universal models for medical image segmentation require extensive annotations - interactive models need repeated user prompts per image, while ICL models rely on dense pixel-level labels. This creates high annotation burden.

Method: Proposed Weakly Supervised In-Context Learning (WS-ICL) that leverages weak prompts (bounding boxes or points) instead of dense labels for context, eliminating the need for fine-grained masks and repeated user prompting.

Result: WS-ICL achieves performance comparable to regular ICL models at significantly lower annotation cost on three held-out benchmarks. It is also highly competitive under the interactive paradigm.

Conclusion: WS-ICL represents a promising step toward more efficient and unified universal models for medical image segmentation by reducing annotation requirements while maintaining strong performance.

Abstract: Universal models for medical image segmentation, such as interactive and
in-context learning (ICL) models, offer strong generalization but require
extensive annotations. Interactive models need repeated user prompts for each
image, while ICL relies on dense, pixel-level labels. To address this, we
propose Weakly Supervised In-Context Learning (WS-ICL), a new ICL paradigm that
leverages weak prompts (e.g., bounding boxes or points) instead of dense labels
for context. This approach significantly reduces annotation effort by
eliminating the need for fine-grained masks and repeated user prompting for all
images. We evaluated the proposed WS-ICL model on three held-out benchmarks.
Experimental results demonstrate that WS-ICL achieves performance comparable to
regular ICL models at a significantly lower annotation cost. In addition,
WS-ICL is highly competitive even under the interactive paradigm. These
findings establish WS-ICL as a promising step toward more efficient and unified
universal models for medical image segmentation. Our code and model are
publicly available at https://github.com/jiesihu/Weak-ICL.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a large-scale defect detection dataset for retail logistics that is 40x larger than existing benchmarks, addressing challenges of object diversity and pose variation that current methods struggle with.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing industrial anomaly detection benchmarks like MVTec-AD and VisA have reached saturation with near-perfect scores, but they focus on controlled manufacturing scenarios. Retail logistics presents new challenges with diverse object poses and appearances that current methods cannot handle effectively.

Method: The authors created a new benchmark dataset with over 230,000 images (including 29,000 defective instances) containing more than 48,000 distinct objects, significantly larger and more diverse than existing datasets.

Result: State-of-the-art anomaly detection methods achieve only 56.96% AUROC on this new dataset, compared to 99.9% on existing benchmarks, demonstrating the dataset's difficulty and the limitations of current approaches.

Conclusion: The new dataset sets a challenging benchmark for retail logistics anomaly detection and encourages future research to address the problems of heavy pose and appearance variation that existing methods cannot handle.

Abstract: We present a novel large-scale dataset for defect detection in a logistics
setting. Recent work on industrial anomaly detection has primarily focused on
manufacturing scenarios with highly controlled poses and a limited number of
object categories. Existing benchmarks like MVTec-AD [6] and VisA [33] have
reached saturation, with state-of-the-art methods achieving up to 99.9% AUROC
scores. In contrast to manufacturing, anomaly detection in retail logistics
faces new challenges, particularly in the diversity and variability of object
pose and appearance. Leading anomaly detection methods fall short when applied
to this new setting. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new benchmark that
overcomes the current limitations of existing datasets. With over 230,000
images (and more than 29,000 defective instances), it is 40 times larger than
MVTec-AD and contains more than 48,000 distinct objects. To validate the
difficulty of the problem, we conduct an extensive evaluation of multiple
state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods, demonstrating that they do not
surpass 56.96% AUROC on our dataset. Further qualitative analysis confirms that
existing methods struggle to leverage normal samples under heavy pose and
appearance variation. With our large-scale dataset, we set a new benchmark and
encourage future research towards solving this challenging problem in retail
logistics anomaly detection. The dataset is available for download under

*Ron Keuth,Paul Kaftan,Mattias P. Heinrich*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents the first comprehensive study of token mixers for medical imaging within the MetaFormer architecture, comparing pooling-, convolution-, and attention-based approaches on classification and segmentation tasks across eight medical datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While MetaFormer has been extensively studied on natural images, its application in medical imaging remains scarce, and existing works rarely compare different token mixers, potentially overlooking more suitable design choices for medical tasks.

Method: Systematic analysis of various token mixers (pooling-, convolution-, and attention-based) within MetaFormer architecture on both image classification and semantic segmentation tasks across eight diverse medical imaging datasets, including examination of pretrained weight transfer.

Result: For classification, low-complexity token mixers (grouped convolution or pooling) are sufficient, and pretrained weights remain useful despite domain gaps. For segmentation, convolutional token mixers with local inductive bias are essential, with grouped convolutions emerging as the preferred choice due to reduced runtime and parameters.

Conclusion: Different token mixer choices are optimal for different medical imaging tasks: simple mixers suffice for classification while convolutional mixers are essential for segmentation, with grouped convolutions providing the best balance of performance and efficiency.

Abstract: The generalization of the Transformer architecture via MetaFormer has
reshaped our understanding of its success in computer vision. By replacing
self-attention with simpler token mixers, MetaFormer provides strong baselines
for vision tasks. However, while extensively studied on natural image datasets,
its use in medical imaging remains scarce, and existing works rarely compare
different token mixers, potentially overlooking more suitable designs choices.
In this work, we present the first comprehensive study of token mixers for
medical imaging. We systematically analyze pooling-, convolution-, and
attention-based token mixers within the MetaFormer architecture on image
classification (global prediction task) and semantic segmentation (dense
prediction task). Our evaluation spans eight datasets covering diverse
modalities and common challenges in the medical domain. Given the prevalence of
pretraining from natural images to mitigate medical data scarcity, we also
examine transferring pretrained weights to new token mixers. Our results show
that, for classification, low-complexity token mixers (e.g. grouped convolution
or pooling) are sufficient, aligning with findings on natural images.
Pretrained weights remain useful despite the domain gap introduced by the new
token mixer. For segmentation, we find that the local inductive bias of
convolutional token mixers is essential. Grouped convolutions emerge as the
preferred choice, as they reduce runtime and parameter count compared to
standard convolutions, while the MetaFormer's channel-MLPs already provide the
necessary cross-channel interactions. Our code is available on GitHub.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLIE is crucial for safety-critical applications like surveillance and autonomous navigation where poor visibility affects downstream tasks. Diffusion models show promise for LLIE due to their ability to model complex image distributions through iterative denoising.

Method: The survey proposes a six-category taxonomy: Intrinsic Decomposition, Spectral & Latent, Accelerated, Guided, Multimodal, and Autonomous. It evaluates qualitative failure modes, benchmark inconsistencies, and trade-offs between interpretability, generalization, and inference efficiency.

Result: The survey provides critical comparative analysis against GAN and Transformer methods, examines practical deployment challenges, and discusses real-world constraints including memory, energy use, and ethical considerations.

Conclusion: This survey aims to guide future diffusion-based LLIE research by highlighting trends and open questions, including novel conditioning, real-time adaptation, and the potential of foundation models.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) is vital for safety-critical applications
such as surveillance, autonomous navigation, and medical imaging, where
visibility degradation can impair downstream task performance. Recently,
diffusion models have emerged as a promising generative paradigm for LLIE due
to their capacity to model complex image distributions via iterative denoising.
This survey provides an up-to-date critical analysis of diffusion models for
LLIE, distinctively featuring an in-depth comparative performance evaluation
against Generative Adversarial Network and Transformer-based state-of-the-art
methods, a thorough examination of practical deployment challenges, and a
forward-looking perspective on the role of emerging paradigms like foundation
models. We propose a multi-perspective taxonomy encompassing six categories:
Intrinsic Decomposition, Spectral & Latent, Accelerated, Guided, Multimodal,
and Autonomous; that map enhancement methods across physical priors,
conditioning schemes, and computational efficiency. Our taxonomy is grounded in
a hybrid view of both the model mechanism and the conditioning signals. We
evaluate qualitative failure modes, benchmark inconsistencies, and trade-offs
between interpretability, generalization, and inference efficiency. We also
discuss real-world deployment constraints (e.g., memory, energy use) and
ethical considerations. This survey aims to guide the next generation of

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dynamic Morphological Component Analysis (DMCA), a novel method that adapts video representations based on scene dynamics using eigenspace clustering of dynamic mode decomposition eigenvalues to create data-driven dictionaries for separating distinct video morphologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an adaptive video representation method that can effectively separate structurally distinct morphologies in videos by leveraging the dynamics of scene content variation, improving upon traditional morphological component analysis which uses predefined dictionaries.

Method: Extends morphological component analysis (MCA) by introducing eigenspace clustering of dynamic mode decomposition eigenvalues to obtain data-driven dictionaries, creating the DMCA algorithm. Applied to video denoising, signal enhancement, and target separation tasks.

Result: DMCA demonstrated effectiveness in denoising videos from Adobe 240fps dataset, enhanced signal-to-noise ratio of faint targets in sea states, and successfully separated bicycles from wind clutter in inverse synthetic aperture radar images.

Conclusion: The proposed DMCA method successfully adapts video representations based on scene dynamics and provides effective separation of distinct morphologies across various applications including video denoising, signal enhancement, and radar target separation.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel methodology of adapting the representation of
videos based on the dynamics of their scene content variation. In particular,
we demonstrate how the clustering of dynamic mode decomposition eigenvalues can
be leveraged to learn an adaptive video representation for separating
structurally distinct morphologies of a video. We extend the morphological
component analysis (MCA) algorithm, which uses multiple predefined incoherent
dictionaries and a sparsity prior to separate distinct sources in signals, by
introducing our novel eigenspace clustering technique to obtain data-driven MCA
dictionaries, which we call dynamic morphological component analysis (DMCA).
After deriving our novel algorithm, we offer a motivational example of DMCA
applied to a still image, then demonstrate DMCA's effectiveness in denoising
applications on videos from the Adobe 240fps dataset. Afterwards, we provide an
example of DMCA enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio of a faint target summed
with a sea state, and conclude the paper by applying DMCA to separate a bicycle
from wind clutter in inverse synthetic aperture radar images.

*Yunyi Ni,Finn Carter,Ze Niu,Emily Davis,Bo Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diffusion models can effectively break robust image watermarks by using image regeneration processes that erase embedded watermarks while preserving visual content, achieving near-zero recovery rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of powerful diffusion-based image generation and editing techniques poses a new threat to traditional robust watermarking schemes that were designed to resist conventional perturbations.

Method: Proposed a diffusion-driven image regeneration process and a novel guided diffusion attack that explicitly targets watermark signals during generation. Theoretically proved that sufficient diffusion-based transformation eliminates mutual information between watermarked images and embedded payloads.

Result: Achieved near-zero watermark recovery rates on state-of-the-art watermarking schemes (StegaStamp, TrustMark, VINE) while maintaining high visual fidelity in regenerated images.

Conclusion: Current robust watermarking techniques have fundamental vulnerabilities against generative model-based attacks, highlighting the need for new watermarking strategies in the generative AI era.

Abstract: Robust invisible watermarking aims to embed hidden information into images
such that the watermark can survive various image manipulations. However, the
rise of powerful diffusion-based image generation and editing techniques poses
a new threat to these watermarking schemes. In this paper, we present a
theoretical study and method demonstrating that diffusion models can
effectively break robust image watermarks that were designed to resist
conventional perturbations. We show that a diffusion-driven ``image
regeneration'' process can erase embedded watermarks while preserving
perceptual image content. We further introduce a novel guided diffusion attack
that explicitly targets the watermark signal during generation, significantly
degrading watermark detectability. Theoretically, we prove that as an image
undergoes sufficient diffusion-based transformation, the mutual information
between the watermarked image and the embedded watermark payload vanishes,
resulting in decoding failure. Experimentally, we evaluate our approach on
multiple state-of-the-art watermarking schemes (including the deep
learning-based methods StegaStamp, TrustMark, and VINE) and demonstrate
near-zero watermark recovery rates after attack, while maintaining high visual
fidelity of the regenerated images. Our findings highlight a fundamental
vulnerability in current robust watermarking techniques against generative
model-based attacks, underscoring the need for new watermarking strategies in
the era of generative AI.

TL;DR: Using pre-trained multimodal LLMs to measure hailstones from social media images with two-stage prompting strategies, achieving average MAE of 1.12cm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To complement traditional hail sensors by extracting meaningful and spatially dense information from social media imagery for faster and more detailed severe weather assessments.

Method: Used 474 crowdsourced hail images from Austria (2022-2024), compared four models with one-stage and two-stage prompting strategies that utilize reference objects like human hands for size estimation.

Result: Best model achieved average mean absolute error of 1.12cm for hail diameter estimation. Two-stage prompting improved reliability compared to single-stage prompting.

Conclusion: Off-the-shelf pretrained models without fine-tuning can effectively measure hailstones from images, enabling real-time severe weather assessment through social media imagery.

Abstract: This study examines the use of social media and news images to detect and
measure hailstones, utilizing pre-trained multimodal large language models. The
dataset for this study comprises 474 crowdsourced images of hailstones from
documented hail events in Austria, which occurred between January 2022 and
September 2024. These hailstones have maximum diameters ranging from 2 to 11cm.
We estimate the hail diameters and compare four different models utilizing
one-stage and two-stage prompting strategies. The latter utilizes additional
size cues from reference objects, such as human hands, within the image. Our
results show that pretrained models already have the potential to measure
hailstone diameters from images with an average mean absolute error of 1.12cm
for the best model. In comparison to a single-stage prompt, two-stage prompting
improves the reliability of most models. Our study suggests that these
off-the-shelf models, even without fine-tuning, can complement traditional hail
sensors by extracting meaningful and spatially dense information from social
media imagery, enabling faster and more detailed assessments of severe weather
events. The automated real-time image harvesting from social media and other
sources remains an open task, but it will make our approach directly applicable
to future hail events.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing catastrophic forgetting and difficulty in aligning evolving visual concepts with language over time in continual learning settings for image captioning.

Method: Built on ViT-GPT-2 backbone, integrates cross-entropy loss with three components: prompt-based cosine similarity loss aligning image embeddings with synthetic prompts, CLIP-style loss for image-caption alignment, and language-guided contrastive loss using triplet loss for class-level discriminability.

Result: Approach mitigates catastrophic forgetting and achieves better semantic caption alignment compared to state-of-the-art methods without additional inference overhead or prompts during generation.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-loss framework effectively addresses continual image captioning challenges by leveraging semantic guidance through prompt-based learning and contrastive alignment, demonstrating improved performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Generating accurate and coherent image captions in a continual learning
setting remains a major challenge due to catastrophic forgetting and the
difficulty of aligning evolving visual concepts with language over time. In
this work, we propose a novel multi-loss framework for continual image
captioning that integrates semantic guidance through prompt-based continual
learning and contrastive alignment. Built upon a pretrained ViT-GPT-2 backbone,
our approach combines standard cross-entropy loss with three additional
components: (1) a prompt-based cosine similarity loss that aligns image
embeddings with synthetically constructed prompts encoding objects, attributes,
and actions; (2) a CLIP-style loss that promotes alignment between image
embeddings and target caption embedding; and (3) a language-guided contrastive
loss that employs a triplet loss to enhance class-level discriminability
between tasks. Notably, our approach introduces no additional overhead at
inference time and requires no prompts during caption generation. We find that
this approach mitigates catastrophic forgetting, while achieving better
semantic caption alignment compared to state-of-the-art methods. The code can

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Generic instance search models can unintentionally develop person re-identification capabilities even when trained without human data, raising privacy concerns. Technical safeguards can reduce person ID accuracy to below 2% while maintaining most object retrieval performance, but vulnerabilities remain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy concerns about AI models developing unintended person identification capabilities through overlearning, even when trained on datasets without human subjects, and to evaluate technical safeguards against this emergent capability.

Method: Evaluated two technical safeguards: index exclusion and confusion loss. Combined these approaches to reduce person re-identification capacity while maintaining object retrieval performance.

Result: Combining index exclusion and confusion loss reduced person re-identification accuracy to below 2% while maintaining 82% of retrieval performance for non-person objects. However, identified vulnerabilities including potential circumvention using partial person images.

Conclusion: The findings highlight urgent regulatory questions about classifying and regulating systems with emergent identification capabilities, and establishing technical standards to prevent identification capabilities from developing in seemingly benign AI applications.

Abstract: Generic instance search models can dramatically reduce the manual effort
required to analyze vast surveillance footage during criminal investigations by
retrieving specific objects of interest to law enforcement. However, our
research reveals an unintended emergent capability: through overlearning, these
models can single out specific individuals even when trained on datasets
without human subjects. This capability raises concerns regarding
identification and profiling of individuals based on their personal data, while
there is currently no clear standard on how de-identification can be achieved.
We evaluate two technical safeguards to curtail a model's person
re-identification capacity: index exclusion and confusion loss. Our experiments
demonstrate that combining these approaches can reduce person re-identification
accuracy to below 2% while maintaining 82% of retrieval performance for
non-person objects. However, we identify critical vulnerabilities in these
mitigations, including potential circumvention using partial person images.
These findings highlight urgent regulatory questions at the intersection of AI
governance and data protection: How should we classify and regulate systems
with emergent identification capabilities? And what technical standards should
be required to prevent identification capabilities from developing in seemingly
benign applications?

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoMiner is a hierarchical framework for long video understanding that iteratively segments, captions, and clusters videos into tree structures, using T-GRPO reinforcement learning to dynamically identify key frames while maintaining temporal coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for video understanding with LLMs struggle with redundant information in long videos and cannot adapt to complex hierarchical structures to accurately identify key frames.

Method: Proposes VideoMiner with iterative segmentation, captioning, and clustering to form hierarchical tree structures, and introduces T-GRPO (tree-based group relative policy optimization) reinforcement learning for precise key frame identification.

Result: Achieves superior performance in all long-video understanding tasks, with T-GRPO spontaneously generating reasoning chains and tree growth auxin dynamically adjusting expansion depth for accuracy and efficiency gains.

Conclusion: VideoMiner effectively addresses challenges in long video understanding by combining hierarchical tree structures with reinforcement learning, enabling better handling of redundant information and dynamic adaptation to complex video structures.

Abstract: Understanding hour-long videos with multi-modal large language models
(MM-LLMs) enriches the landscape of human-centered AI applications. However,
for end-to-end video understanding with LLMs, uniformly sampling video frames
results in LLMs being overwhelmed by a vast amount of irrelevant information as
video length increases. Existing hierarchical key frame extraction methods
improve the accuracy of video understanding but still face two critical
challenges. 1) How can the interference of extensive redundant information in
long videos be mitigated? 2) How can a model dynamically adapt to complex
hierarchical structures while accurately identifying key frames? To address
these issues, we propose VideoMiner, which iteratively segments, captions, and
clusters long videos, forming a hierarchical tree structure. The proposed
VideoMiner progresses from long videos to events to frames while preserving
temporal coherence, effectively addressing the first challenge. To precisely
locate key frames, we introduce T-GRPO, a tree-based group relative policy
optimization in reinforcement learning method that guides the exploration of
the VideoMiner. The proposed T-GRPO is specifically designed for tree
structures, integrating spatiotemporal information at the event level while
being guided by the question, thus solving the second challenge. We achieve
superior performance in all long-video understanding tasks and uncover several
interesting insights. Our proposed T-GRPO surprisingly incentivizes the model
to spontaneously generate a reasoning chain. Additionally, the designed tree
growth auxin dynamically adjusts the expansion depth, obtaining accuracy and
efficiency gains. The code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Integrating MedFlamingo (medical Vision-Language Model) with PPO improves robotic laparoscopic surgery performance by leveraging medical expertise to process visual observations and instructions, achieving over 70% success rates across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard vision-based PPO struggles with laparoscopic surgical tasks due to high-dimensional visual input, sparse rewards, and difficulty extracting task-relevant features from raw visual data.

Method: Combine MedFlamingo (medical domain-specific VLM) with PPO, processing task observations and instructions once per episode to generate high-level planning tokens for efficient surgical decision-making.

Result: MedFlamingo PPO outperforms and converges faster than standard vision-based PPO and OpenFlamingo PPO, achieving >70% success rates across all environments with 66.67% to 1114.29% improvements over baselines.

Conclusion: Specialized medical knowledge in robotic surgical planning and decision-making provides significant value, enabling efficient combination of medical expertise with real-time visual feedback.

Abstract: Vision-based Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) struggles with visual
observation-based robotic laparoscopic surgical tasks due to the
high-dimensional nature of visual input, the sparsity of rewards in surgical
environments, and the difficulty of extracting task-relevant features from raw
visual data. We introduce a simple approach integrating MedFlamingo, a medical
domain-specific Vision-Language Model, with PPO. Our method is evaluated on
five diverse laparoscopic surgery task environments in LapGym, using only
endoscopic visual observations. MedFlamingo PPO outperforms and converges
faster compared to both standard vision-based PPO and OpenFlamingo PPO
baselines, achieving task success rates exceeding 70% across all environments,
with improvements ranging from 66.67% to 1114.29% compared to baseline. By
processing task observations and instructions once per episode to generate
high-level planning tokens, our method efficiently combines medical expertise
with real-time visual feedback. Our results highlight the value of specialized

*Python Song,Luke Tenyi Chang,Yun-Yun Tsai,Penghui Li,Junfeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAPTCHA serves as a real-world benchmark for evaluating vision-language models' spatial reasoning. Current commercial VLMs struggle with CAPTCHAs (21.9% accuracy), but step-by-step reasoning significantly improves performance. The paper introduces CAPTCHA-X benchmark and a reasoning-based framework achieving 83.9% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CAPTCHAs represent high-difficulty spatial reasoning tasks that current vision-language models struggle to solve, revealing limitations in their reasoning capabilities. The gap between human and machine performance on such tasks highlights the need for better reasoning evaluation and improvement.

Method: Introduces CAPTCHA-X benchmark with 7 CAPTCHA categories, step-by-step action solutions, and grounding annotations. Proposes 5 reasoning-oriented metrics and a general agentic VLM-based framework that leverages models' inherent reasoning abilities through step-by-step reasoning before generating final coordinates.

Result: The proposed reasoning-based framework achieves state-of-the-art performance with 83.9% average solving accuracy across five high-difficulty CAPTCHA types, substantially surpassing existing baselines (which achieve around 21.9% accuracy).

Conclusion: Step-by-step reasoning is crucial for solving CAPTCHAs and spatial reasoning tasks. Current VLMs have significant limitations in reasoning capabilities, and incorporating explicit reasoning processes can dramatically improve performance on visual-spatial challenges.

Abstract: CAPTCHA, originally designed to distinguish humans from robots, has evolved
into a real-world benchmark for assessing the spatial reasoning capabilities of
vision-language models. In this work, we first show that step-by-step reasoning
is crucial for vision-language models (VLMs) to solve CAPTCHAs, which represent
high-difficulty spatial reasoning tasks, and that current commercial
vision-language models still struggle with such reasoning. In particular, we
observe that most commercial VLMs (e.g., Gemini, Claude, GPT, etc.) fail to
effectively solve CAPTCHAs and thus achieve low accuracy (around 21.9 percent).
However, our findings indicate that requiring the model to perform step-by-step
reasoning before generating the final coordinates can significantly enhance its
solving accuracy, underscoring the severity of the gap. To systematically study
this issue, we introduce CAPTCHA-X, the first real-world CAPTCHA benchmark with
reasoning, covering seven categories of CAPTCHAs (such as Gobang, hCaptcha,
etc.) with step-by-step action solutions and grounding annotations. We further
define five reasoning-oriented metrics that enable a comprehensive evaluation
of models reasoning capabilities. To validate the effectiveness of reasoning,
we also propose a general agentic VLM-based framework that incorporates the
models inherent reasoning abilities. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance across five high-difficulty CAPTCHA types, with an average solving
accuracy of 83.9 percent, substantially surpassing existing baselines. These
results reveal the limitations of current models and highlight the importance
of reasoning in advancing visual-spatial challenges in the future.

### [60] [There is More to Attention: Statistical Filtering Enhances Explanations in Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06070)
*Meghna P Ayyar,Jenny Benois-Pineau,Akka Zemmari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a method to improve Vision Transformer explanations by combining attention maps with statistical filtering to remove noise and produce sharper, more interpretable explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ViT explanation methods often rely on attention weights that yield noisy maps, and many CNN explanation methods don't transfer well to ViTs. Attention remains valuable when properly filtered.

Method: Combines attention maps with statistical filtering (initially proposed for CNNs) to remove noisy patterns, with a class-specific variant for discriminative explanations.

Result: Produces sharper and more interpretable maps that outperform or are comparable to SOTA methods across multiple datasets. Shows better alignment with human perception using gaze data.

Conclusion: Attention is a valuable signal for ViT explanations when properly filtered. The approach is efficient, human-plausible, and demonstrates that human interpretability remains essential for XAI.

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) has become increasingly important with the rise of large
transformer models, yet many explanation methods designed for CNNs transfer
poorly to Vision Transformers (ViTs). Existing ViT explanations often rely on
attention weights, which tend to yield noisy maps as they capture
token-to-token interactions within each layer.While attribution methods
incorporating MLP blocks have been proposed, we argue that attention remains a
valuable and interpretable signal when properly filtered. We propose a method
that combines attention maps with a statistical filtering, initially proposed
for CNNs, to remove noisy or uninformative patterns and produce more faithful
explanations. We further extend our approach with a class-specific variant that
yields discriminative explanations. Evaluation against popular state-of-the-art
methods demonstrates that our approach produces sharper and more interpretable
maps. In addition to perturbation-based faithfulness metrics, we incorporate
human gaze data to assess alignment with human perception, arguing that human
interpretability remains essential for XAI. Across multiple datasets, our
approach consistently outperforms or is comparable to the SOTA methods while
remaining efficient and human plausible.

*Mi Luo,Zihui Xue,Alex Dimakis,Kristen Grauman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Chain-of-Thought reasoning often harms video understanding by causing 'visual thinking drift' - verbose but misleading reasoning that overrides correct visual intuitions. The paper introduces Visual Evidence Reward (VER) to ground reasoning in visual evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While CoT has improved text-based reasoning, its application to video understanding remains underexplored and often degrades performance by generating misleading internal monologues that override correct visual intuitions.

Method: Introduces Visual Evidence Reward (VER), a reinforcement learning framework that explicitly rewards reasoning traces that are verifiably grounded in visual evidence, counteracting the 'visual thinking drift' phenomenon.

Result: Comprehensive evaluation across 10 diverse video understanding benchmarks shows that Video-VER consistently achieves top performance by effectively grounding reasoning in visual evidence.

Conclusion: The work highlights the distinct challenges of video-centric reasoning and promotes development of AI that robustly grounds inferences in visual evidence - enabling models that 'see while thinking' rather than just 'thinking before answering'.

Abstract: Video reasoning, the task of enabling machines to infer from dynamic visual
content through multi-step logic, is crucial for advanced AI. While the
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) mechanism has enhanced reasoning in text-based tasks,
its application to video understanding remains underexplored. This paper
presents a systematic analysis revealing that CoT often degrades performance in
video reasoning, generating verbose but misleading internal monologues, and
leading to hallucinated visual details and overridden correct intuitions - a
phenomenon we term "visual thinking drift". We explain this drift through a
Bayesian lens, positing that CoT traces often diverge from actual visual
evidence, instead amplifying internal biases or language priors, causing models
to storytell rather than engage in grounded reasoning. To counteract this, we
introduce Visual Evidence Reward (VER), a novel reinforcement learning
framework that explicitly rewards the generation of reasoning traces that are
verifiably grounded in visual evidence. Comprehensive evaluation across 10
diverse video understanding benchmarks demonstrates that our Video-VER
consistently achieves top performance. Our work sheds light on the distinct
challenges of video-centric reasoning and encourages the development of AI that
robustly grounds its inferences in visual evidence - for large multimodal
models that not only "think before answering", but also "see while thinking".

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents the first open-source dataset with curated, high-resolution segmentations for left atrial appendage (LAA), coronary arteries (CAs), and pulmonary veins (PVs) on 1000 CCTA scans from ImageCAS dataset, addressing segmentation challenges for these cardiac structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate segmentation of LAA, CAs, and PVs remains challenging despite advanced frameworks like TotalSegmentator, creating a need for high-quality, anatomically coherent datasets to enable better analysis of LAA morphology and improve cardiac imaging research.

Method: Used a state-of-the-art segmentation framework trained on private dataset with manual annotations by medical readers guided by cardiologists, then transferred to ImageCAS data. Improved CA labels from original annotations and refined PV segmentations from TS outputs.

Result: Created a comprehensive open-source dataset with curated segmentations for LAA, CAs, and PVs on 1000 CCTA scans, including identification of scans with common data flaws like step artifacts and LAA extending beyond scanner field of view.

Conclusion: The dataset serves as a valuable resource for advancing research in cardiac imaging, particularly for LAA morphology analysis, and addresses the gap in high-quality segmentations for these challenging cardiac structures.

Abstract: Despite the success of advanced segmentation frameworks such as
TotalSegmentator (TS), accurate segmentations of the left atrial appendage
(LAA), coronary arteries (CAs), and pulmonary veins (PVs) remain a significant
challenge in medical imaging. In this work, we present the first open-source,
anatomically coherent dataset of curated, high-resolution segmentations for
these structures, supplemented with whole-heart labels produced by TS on the
publicly available ImageCAS dataset consisting of 1000 cardiac computed
tomography angiography (CCTA) scans. One purpose of the data set is to foster
novel approaches to the analysis of LAA morphology.
  LAA segmentations on ImageCAS were generated using a state-of-the-art
segmentation framework developed specifically for high resolution LAA
segmentation. We trained the network on a large private dataset with manual
annotations provided by medical readers guided by a trained cardiologist and
transferred the model to ImageCAS data. CA labels were improved from the
original ImageCAS annotations, while PV segmentations were refined from TS
outputs. In addition, we provide a list of scans from ImageCAS that contains
common data flaws such as step artefacts, LAAs extending beyond the scanner's
field of view, and other types of data defects.

### [63] [Compact Multi-level-prior Tensor Representation for Hyperspectral Image Super-resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06098)
*Yinjian Wang,Wei Li,Yuanyuan Gui,Gemine Vivone*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel hyperspectral image super-resolution method that fuses hyperspectral and multispectral images using multi-level tensor priors including spectral low-rankness, spatial low-rankness, and smoothness via block term decomposition and non-convex mode-shuffled tensor correlated total variation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tensor-based fusion methods can only leverage limited priors at one or two levels due to model complexity challenges. There's a need to effectively incorporate multi-level priors while managing complexity and optimization difficulties.

Method: Uses block term decomposition to decouple spectral low-rankness and spatial priors, stacks spatial maps as tensor encoding high-order spatial low-rankness and smoothness via non-convex mode-shuffled tensor correlated total variation, and employs linearized alternating direction method of multipliers for optimization.

Result: Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in achieving high-quality hyperspectral image super-resolution.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully incorporates multi-level priors within a tensor framework, providing an effective solution for hyperspectral image super-resolution with theoretical convergence guarantees.

Abstract: Fusing a hyperspectral image with a multispectral image acquired over the
same scene, \textit{i.e.}, hyperspectral image super-resolution, has become a
popular computational way to access the latent high-spatial-spectral-resolution
image. To date, a variety of fusion methods have been proposed, among which the
tensor-based ones have testified that multiple priors, such as multidimensional
low-rankness and spatial total variation at multiple levels, effectively drive
the fusion process. However, existing tensor-based models can only effectively
leverage one or two priors at one or two levels, since simultaneously
incorporating multi-level priors inevitably increases model complexity. This
introduces challenges in both balancing the weights of different priors and
optimizing multi-block structures. Concerning this, we present a novel
hyperspectral super-resolution model compactly characterizing these multi-level
priors of hyperspectral images within the tensor framework. Firstly, the
proposed model decouples the spectral low-rankness and spatial priors by
casting the latent high-spatial-spectral-resolution image into spectral
subspace and spatial maps via block term decomposition. Secondly, these spatial
maps are stacked as the spatial tensor encoding the high-order spatial
low-rankness and smoothness priors, which are co-modeled via the proposed
non-convex mode-shuffled tensor correlated total variation. Finally, we draw
inspiration from the linearized alternating direction method of multipliers to
design an efficient algorithm to optimize the resulting model, theoretically
proving its Karush-Kuhn-Tucker convergence under mild conditions. Experiments
on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
The code implementation will be available from https://github.com/WongYinJ.

TL;DR: FeatProto is a prototype-based multimodal framework that integrates whole slide images and genomic data for interpretable cancer survival prediction, addressing limitations in traditional prototype learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current survival analysis models are difficult to interpret, reducing their clinical usefulness. Traditional prototype learning methods focus on local similarities and static matching, neglecting broader tumor context and lacking semantic alignment with genomic data.

Method: Creates unified feature prototype space integrating global/local WSI features with genomic profiles. Uses phenotype representation merging critical patches with global context, EMA ProtoUp strategy for stable cross-modal associations, and hierarchical prototype matching scheme capturing global centrality, local typicality, and cohort-level trends.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations on four cancer datasets show the method surpasses current leading unimodal and multimodal survival prediction techniques in both accuracy and interoperability.

Conclusion: FeatProto provides a new perspective on prototype learning for critical medical applications, offering traceable and interpretable decision-making processes for cancer survival prediction.

Abstract: Survival analysis plays a vital role in making clinical decisions. However,
the models currently in use are often difficult to interpret, which reduces
their usefulness in clinical settings. Prototype learning presents a potential
solution, yet traditional methods focus on local similarities and static
matching, neglecting the broader tumor context and lacking strong semantic
alignment with genomic data. To overcome these issues, we introduce an
innovative prototype-based multimodal framework, FeatProto, aimed at enhancing
cancer survival prediction by addressing significant limitations in current
prototype learning methodologies within pathology. Our framework establishes a
unified feature prototype space that integrates both global and local features
of whole slide images (WSI) with genomic profiles. This integration facilitates
traceable and interpretable decision-making processes. Our approach includes
three main innovations: (1) A robust phenotype representation that merges
critical patches with global context, harmonized with genomic data to minimize
local bias. (2) An Exponential Prototype Update Strategy (EMA ProtoUp) that
sustains stable cross-modal associations and employs a wandering mechanism to
adapt prototypes flexibly to tumor heterogeneity. (3) A hierarchical prototype
matching scheme designed to capture global centrality, local typicality, and
cohort-level trends, thereby refining prototype inference. Comprehensive
evaluations on four publicly available cancer datasets indicate that our method
surpasses current leading unimodal and multimodal survival prediction
techniques in both accuracy and interoperability, providing a new perspective
on prototype learning for critical medical applications. Our source code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative medical models are constrained by modality-specific scenarios, limiting their evolution into foundation models that can learn and reason across the full spectrum of biomedical data.

Method: Built on a discrete diffusion framework, MeDiM bridges vision and language representations through a shared probabilistic space using a multimodal large language model as the diffusion backbone, with key designs including removing causal attention mask and injecting continuous timestep embeddings.

Result: Experiments show high-fidelity medical generation (FID 16.60 on MIMIC-CXR and FID 24.19 on PathGen) and accurate report generation (METEOR 0.2650 and 0.2580). Jointly generated image-report pairs enhance downstream performance significantly.

Conclusion: MeDiM supports coherent and clinically grounded multimodal outputs, demonstrating the effectiveness of unified medical generation across different modalities.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative medical models are constrained by
modality-specific scenarios that hinder the integration of complementary
evidence from imaging, pathology, and clinical notes. This fragmentation limits
their evolution into foundation models that can learn and reason across the
full spectrum of biomedical data. We propose MeDiM, the first medical discrete
diffusion model that learns shared distributions across modalities without
modality-specific components. MeDiM unifies multiple generative tasks:
translating between images and text, and jointly producing image-report pairs
across domains in response to prompts. Built on a discrete diffusion framework,
MeDiM bridges vision and language representations through a shared
probabilistic space. To enable unified and flexible medical generation, we
employ a multimodal large language model (MLLM) as the diffusion backbone,
leveraging its prior knowledge and cross-modal reasoning. Two key designs are
introduced: (1) removing the causal attention mask for bidirectional context,
and (2) injecting continuous timestep embeddings for diffusion awareness.
Experiments demonstrate high-fidelity medical generation (FID 16.60 on
MIMIC-CXR and FID 24.19 on PathGen) and accurate report generation (METEOR
0.2650 and 0.2580). Jointly generated image-report pairs further enhance
downstream performance (plus6.43 percent BLEU-1, plus18.57 percent BLEU-2,
plus31.58 percent BLEU-3, plus4.80 percent METEOR), showing that MeDiM supports
coherent and clinically grounded multimodal outputs.

TL;DR: FlowRVS proposes a novel framework for Referring Video Object Segmentation that treats the task as a conditional continuous flow problem, using language-guided deformation from video representations to target masks instead of traditional locate-then-segment approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous RVOS methods use a cascaded 'locate-then-segment' pipeline that creates information bottlenecks by simplifying semantics into coarse geometric prompts and struggles with temporal consistency due to decoupled language grounding and segmentation.

Method: Reformulates RVOS as a conditional continuous flow problem, learning direct language-guided deformation from video's holistic representation to target mask. Leverages pretrained T2V models for fine-grained pixel control, text-video alignment, and temporal coherence.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art results: 51.1 J&F in MeViS (+1.6 over prior SOTA) and 73.3 in zero-shot Ref-DAVIS17 (+2.7).

Conclusion: Demonstrates significant potential of modeling video understanding tasks as continuous deformation processes, with FlowRVS outperforming traditional approaches through its one-stage generative framework.

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) requires segmenting specific
objects in a video guided by a natural language description. The core challenge
of RVOS is to anchor abstract linguistic concepts onto a specific set of pixels
and continuously segment them through the complex dynamics of a video. Faced
with this difficulty, prior work has often decomposed the task into a pragmatic
`locate-then-segment' pipeline. However, this cascaded design creates an
information bottleneck by simplifying semantics into coarse geometric prompts
(e.g, point), and struggles to maintain temporal consistency as the segmenting
process is often decoupled from the initial language grounding. To overcome
these fundamental limitations, we propose FlowRVS, a novel framework that
reconceptualizes RVOS as a conditional continuous flow problem. This allows us
to harness the inherent strengths of pretrained T2V models, fine-grained pixel
control, text-video semantic alignment, and temporal coherence. Instead of
conventional generating from noise to mask or directly predicting mask, we
reformulate the task by learning a direct, language-guided deformation from a
video's holistic representation to its target mask. Our one-stage, generative
approach achieves new state-of-the-art results across all major RVOS
benchmarks. Specifically, achieving a $\mathcal{J}\&\mathcal{F}$ of 51.1 in
MeViS (+1.6 over prior SOTA) and 73.3 in the zero shot Ref-DAVIS17 (+2.7),
demonstrating the significant potential of modeling video understanding tasks
as continuous deformation processes.

Abstract: We tackle the problem of forecasting bimanual 3D hand motion & articulation
from a single image in everyday settings. To address the lack of 3D hand
annotations in diverse settings, we design an annotation pipeline consisting of
a diffusion model to lift 2D hand keypoint sequences to 4D hand motion. For the
forecasting model, we adopt a diffusion loss to account for the multimodality
in hand motion distribution. Extensive experiments across 6 datasets show the
benefits of training on diverse data with imputed labels (14% improvement) and
effectiveness of our lifting (42% better) & forecasting (16.4% gain) models,
over the best baselines, especially in zero-shot generalization to everyday
images.

TL;DR: A native video-to-4D shape generation framework that synthesizes dynamic 3D representations end-to-end from input videos using temporal attention, time-aware sampling, and noise sharing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To recover time-varying 3D geometry and view-consistent appearance directly from input videos, enabling accurate capture of non-rigid motion, volume changes, and topological transitions without per-frame optimization.

Method: Uses three key components based on pre-trained 3D models: temporal attention for conditioning on all frames, time-aware point sampling and 4D latent anchoring for temporal consistency, and noise sharing across frames for stability.

Result: The method accurately captures complex dynamic phenomena and improves robustness, perceptual fidelity, and reduces failure modes compared to baselines across diverse in-the-wild videos.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables end-to-end video-to-4D shape generation with superior temporal consistency and stability, handling challenging dynamic scenarios effectively.

Abstract: Video-conditioned 4D shape generation aims to recover time-varying 3D
geometry and view-consistent appearance directly from an input video. In this
work, we introduce a native video-to-4D shape generation framework that
synthesizes a single dynamic 3D representation end-to-end from the video. Our
framework introduces three key components based on large-scale pre-trained 3D
models: (i) a temporal attention that conditions generation on all frames while
producing a time-indexed dynamic representation; (ii) a time-aware point
sampling and 4D latent anchoring that promote temporally consistent geometry
and texture; and (iii) noise sharing across frames to enhance temporal
stability. Our method accurately captures non-rigid motion, volume changes, and
even topological transitions without per-frame optimization. Across diverse
in-the-wild videos, our method improves robustness and perceptual fidelity and
reduces failure modes compared with the baselines.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Drive&Gen, a framework that bridges generative video models and end-to-end driving models to evaluate video realism, investigate planner biases, and use synthetic data for improving autonomous vehicle generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address whether generated videos are realistic enough for evaluating autonomous planners and how to better understand and improve end-to-end driving models' generalization capabilities, especially for out-of-distribution scenarios.

Method: Proposes novel statistical measures using E2E drivers to evaluate video realism, exploits video generation controllability for targeted experiments on distribution gaps, and uses synthetic data from video generation models as cost-effective training data.

Result: The framework successfully evaluates video realism, investigates E2E planner performance gaps, and demonstrates that synthetic data effectively improves model generalization beyond existing operational domains.

Conclusion: Drive&Gen effectively bridges generative world models and driving models, providing tools for realistic video evaluation, planner analysis, and cost-effective data generation to expand autonomous vehicle services into new operational contexts.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have sparked exciting new possibilities
in the field of autonomous vehicles. Specifically, video generation models are
now being explored as controllable virtual testing environments.
Simultaneously, end-to-end (E2E) driving models have emerged as a streamlined
alternative to conventional modular autonomous driving systems, gaining
popularity for their simplicity and scalability. However, the application of
these techniques to simulation and planning raises important questions. First,
while video generation models can generate increasingly realistic videos, can
these videos faithfully adhere to the specified conditions and be realistic
enough for E2E autonomous planner evaluation? Second, given that data is
crucial for understanding and controlling E2E planners, how can we gain deeper
insights into their biases and improve their ability to generalize to
out-of-distribution scenarios? In this work, we bridge the gap between the
driving models and generative world models (Drive&Gen) to address these
questions. We propose novel statistical measures leveraging E2E drivers to
evaluate the realism of generated videos. By exploiting the controllability of
the video generation model, we conduct targeted experiments to investigate
distribution gaps affecting E2E planner performance. Finally, we show that
synthetic data produced by the video generation model offers a cost-effective
alternative to real-world data collection. This synthetic data effectively
improves E2E model generalization beyond existing Operational Design Domains,
facilitating the expansion of autonomous vehicle services into new operational
contexts.

*Ayush Shrivastava,Connelly Barnes,Xuaner Zhang,Lingzhi Zhang,Andrew Owens,Sohrab Amirghodsi,Eli Shechtman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A text-to-image diffusion framework that incorporates camera EXIF metadata to generate controllable lens blur effects by simulating the physical image formation process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image diffusion models struggle to incorporate fine-grained camera metadata like aperture settings, limiting their ability to generate realistic lens blur effects.

Method: The method generates an all-in-focus image, estimates monocular depth, predicts focus distance using a novel transformer, and applies differentiable lens blur modeling. Gradients flow through the entire process for unsupervised learning.

Result: The model enables precise interactive control over defocus effects while preserving scene contents, achieving superior fine-grained control compared to existing diffusion models.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully integrates camera metadata to generate controllable lens blur effects, overcoming limitations of current text-to-image diffusion models.

Abstract: Current text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating diverse,
high-quality images, yet they struggle to incorporate fine-grained camera
metadata such as precise aperture settings. In this work, we introduce a novel
text-to-image diffusion framework that leverages camera metadata, or EXIF data,
which is often embedded in image files, with an emphasis on generating
controllable lens blur. Our method mimics the physical image formation process
by first generating an all-in-focus image, estimating its monocular depth,
predicting a plausible focus distance with a novel focus distance transformer,
and then forming a defocused image with an existing differentiable lens blur
model. Gradients flow backwards through this whole process, allowing us to
learn without explicit supervision to generate defocus effects based on content
elements and the provided EXIF data. At inference time, this enables precise
interactive user control over defocus effects while preserving scene contents,
which is not achievable with existing diffusion models. Experimental results
demonstrate that our model enables superior fine-grained control without
altering the depicted scene.

*Mert Kiray,Alican Karaomer,Benjamin Busam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DropD-SLAM is a real-time monocular SLAM system that achieves RGB-D-level accuracy using pretrained vision modules instead of depth sensors, with dynamic object suppression and metric scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a cost-effective SLAM system that doesn't rely on expensive depth sensors while maintaining RGB-D-level accuracy, using modern pretrained vision models as reliable depth sources.

Method: Uses three pretrained modules: monocular depth estimator, learned keypoint detector, and instance segmentation network. Suppresses dynamic objects with dilated masks, assigns predicted depth to static keypoints, and processes with RGB-D SLAM backend.

Result: Achieves 7.4 cm mean ATE on static sequences and 1.8 cm on dynamic sequences in TUM RGB-D benchmark, matching state-of-the-art RGB-D methods while running at 22 FPS on single GPU.

Conclusion: Pretrained vision models can effectively replace active depth sensors for real-time metric scale estimation, enabling simpler and more cost-effective SLAM systems.

Abstract: We present DropD-SLAM, a real-time monocular SLAM system that achieves
RGB-D-level accuracy without relying on depth sensors. The system replaces
active depth input with three pretrained vision modules: a monocular metric
depth estimator, a learned keypoint detector, and an instance segmentation
network. Dynamic objects are suppressed using dilated instance masks, while
static keypoints are assigned predicted depth values and backprojected into 3D
to form metrically scaled features. These are processed by an unmodified RGB-D
SLAM back end for tracking and mapping. On the TUM RGB-D benchmark, DropD-SLAM
attains 7.4 cm mean ATE on static sequences and 1.8 cm on dynamic sequences,
matching or surpassing state-of-the-art RGB-D methods while operating at 22 FPS
on a single GPU. These results suggest that modern pretrained vision models can
replace active depth sensors as reliable, real-time sources of metric scale,
marking a step toward simpler and more cost-effective SLAM systems.

*Deheng Zhang,Yuqian Fu,Runyi Yang,Yang Miao,Tianwen Qian,Xu Zheng,Guolei Sun,Ajad Chhatkuli,Xuanjing Huang,Yu-Gang Jiang,Luc Van Gool,Danda Pani Paudel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EgoNight is the first comprehensive benchmark for nighttime egocentric vision, featuring day-night aligned videos and focusing on visual question answering (VQA) as the core task, with auxiliary tasks for correspondence retrieval and depth estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing egocentric vision benchmarks primarily focus on daytime scenarios, overlooking low-light conditions that are inevitable in real-world applications, creating a significant research gap.

Method: Collected both synthetic (Blender-rendered) and real-world videos with day-night alignment, developed a day-augmented night auto-labeling engine, and conducted extensive human verification to create EgoNight-VQA with 3658 QA pairs across 90 videos spanning 12 QA types.

Result: Evaluations of state-of-the-art multimodal large language models show substantial performance drops when transferring from day to night conditions, highlighting the challenges of reasoning under low-light conditions.

Conclusion: EgoNight provides a strong foundation for advancing application-driven egocentric vision research and developing models that generalize across illumination domains, addressing the critical gap in nighttime visual understanding.

Abstract: Most existing benchmarks for egocentric vision understanding focus primarily
on daytime scenarios, overlooking the low-light conditions that are inevitable
in real-world applications. To investigate this gap, we present EgoNight, the
first comprehensive benchmark for nighttime egocentric vision, with visual
question answering (VQA) as the core task. A key feature of EgoNight is the
introduction of day-night aligned videos, which enhance night annotation
quality using the daytime data and reveal clear performance gaps between
lighting conditions. To achieve this, we collect both synthetic videos rendered
by Blender and real-world recordings, ensuring that scenes and actions are
visually and temporally aligned. Leveraging these paired videos, we construct
EgoNight-VQA, supported by a novel day-augmented night auto-labeling engine and
refinement through extensive human verification. Each QA pair is double-checked
by annotators for reliability. In total, EgoNight-VQA contains 3658 QA pairs
across 90 videos, spanning 12 diverse QA types, with more than 300 hours of
human work. Evaluations of state-of-the-art multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) reveal substantial performance drops when transferring from day to
night, underscoring the challenges of reasoning under low-light conditions.
Beyond VQA, EgoNight also introduces two auxiliary tasks, day-night
correspondence retrieval and egocentric depth estimation at night, that further
explore the boundaries of existing models. We believe EgoNight-VQA provides a
strong foundation for advancing application-driven egocentric vision research
and for developing models that generalize across illumination domains. All the
data and code will be made available upon acceptance.

*Yue Chen,Xingyu Chen,Yuxuan Xue,Anpei Chen,Yuliang Xiu,Gerard Pons-Moll*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Human3R is a unified feed-forward framework for online 4D human-scene reconstruction from monocular videos, jointly recovering global multi-person bodies, dense 3D scenes, and camera trajectories in a single forward pass without iterative refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous approaches rely on multi-stage pipelines, iterative contact-aware refinement, and heavy dependencies like human detection, depth estimation, and SLAM pre-processing, which are inefficient and complex.

Method: Builds upon CUT3R using parameter-efficient visual prompt tuning to preserve spatiotemporal priors while enabling direct readout of multiple SMPL-X bodies. Eliminates dependencies and iterative refinement.

Result: Achieves real-time speed (15 FPS) with low memory (8 GB) after one-day training on BEDLAM dataset. Delivers state-of-the-art performance in human motion estimation, mesh recovery, depth estimation, and camera pose estimation.

Conclusion: Human3R serves as a simple yet strong baseline for unified human-scene reconstruction that can be easily extended for downstream applications.

Abstract: We present Human3R, a unified, feed-forward framework for online 4D
human-scene reconstruction, in the world frame, from casually captured
monocular videos. Unlike previous approaches that rely on multi-stage
pipelines, iterative contact-aware refinement between humans and scenes, and
heavy dependencies, e.g., human detection, depth estimation, and SLAM
pre-processing, Human3R jointly recovers global multi-person SMPL-X bodies
("everyone"), dense 3D scene ("everywhere"), and camera trajectories in a
single forward pass ("all-at-once"). Our method builds upon the 4D online
reconstruction model CUT3R, and uses parameter-efficient visual prompt tuning,
to strive to preserve CUT3R's rich spatiotemporal priors, while enabling direct
readout of multiple SMPL-X bodies. Human3R is a unified model that eliminates
heavy dependencies and iterative refinement. After being trained on the
relatively small-scale synthetic dataset BEDLAM for just one day on one GPU, it
achieves superior performance with remarkable efficiency: it reconstructs
multiple humans in a one-shot manner, along with 3D scenes, in one stage, at
real-time speed (15 FPS) with a low memory footprint (8 GB). Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Human3R delivers state-of-the-art or competitive
performance across tasks, including global human motion estimation, local human
mesh recovery, video depth estimation, and camera pose estimation, with a
single unified model. We hope that Human3R will serve as a simple yet strong
baseline, be easily extended for downstream applications.Code available in
