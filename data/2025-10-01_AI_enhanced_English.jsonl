To achieve\nthis, we propose a three-stage progressive training strategy. First, we connect\nthe VLM to a lightweight diffusion head via multimodal kontext tokens to\nunleash the VLM's generative reasoning ability. Second, we scale this head to a\nlarge, pre-trained diffusion model to enhance visual detail and realism.\nFinally, we introduce a low-level image encoder to improve image fidelity and\nperform instruction tuning on downstream tasks.
