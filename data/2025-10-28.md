### [1] [Diagnosing Bottlenecks in Data Visualization Understanding by Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21740)
*Alexa R. Tartaglini,Satchel Grant,Daniel Wurgaft,Christopher Potts,Judith E. Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FUGU is a diagnostic suite that reveals VLMs struggle with data visualization understanding due to vision-language handoff issues, not vision encoding problems. Providing correct coordinates helps with single data point tasks but worsens performance for statistical analysis across multiple points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models perform poorly on data visualization tasks, but the specific causes of failure (vision encoding, vision-language handoff, or language processing) remain unclear.

Method: Developed FUGU diagnostic tasks to characterize difficulty sources, used activation patching and linear probes to trace information flow, and tested three widely used VLMs with various prompting strategies.

Result: Models fail to generate correct coordinates for data points, leading to erroneous responses. Correct coordinates can be read from vision encoder representations, indicating handoff issues. Providing coordinates helps single-point tasks but hurts statistical analysis tasks. Fine-tuning doesn't achieve ceiling performance.

Conclusion: Current VLMs have architectural constraints in vision-language handoff that pose significant challenges for reliable data visualization understanding, particularly for statistical analysis across multiple data points.

Abstract: Data visualizations are vital components of many scientific articles and news
stories. Current vision-language models (VLMs) still struggle on basic data
visualization understanding tasks, but the causes of failure remain unclear.
Are VLM failures attributable to limitations in how visual information in the
data visualization is encoded, how information is transferred between the
vision and language modules, or how information is processed within the
language module? We developed FUGU, a suite of data visualization understanding
tasks, to precisely characterize potential sources of difficulty (e.g.,
extracting the position of data points, distances between them, and other
summary statistics). We used FUGU to investigate three widely used VLMs. To
diagnose the sources of errors produced by these models, we used activation
patching and linear probes to trace information flow through models across a
variety of prompting strategies. We found that some models fail to generate the
coordinates of individual data points correctly, and these initial errors often
lead to erroneous final responses. When these models are provided with the
correct coordinates, performance improves substantially. Moreover, even when
the model generates an incorrect response, the correct coordinates can be
successfully read out from the latent representations in the vision encoder,
suggesting that the source of these errors lies in the vision-language handoff.
We further found that while providing correct coordinates helps with tasks
involving one or a small number of data points, it generally worsens
performance for tasks that require extracting statistical relationships across
many data points. Fine-tuning models on FUGU also fails to yield ceiling
performance. These findings point to architectural constraints in current VLMs
that might pose significant challenges for reliable data visualization
understanding.

### [2] [Agro-Consensus: Semantic Self-Consistency in Vision-Language Models for Crop Disease Management in Developing Countries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21757)
*Mihir Gupta,Pratik Desai,Ross Greer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A cost-effective self-consistency framework improves vision-language model reliability for agricultural disease diagnosis using semantic clustering and human-in-the-loop verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agricultural disease management in developing countries faces challenges including limited expert access, unreliable internet, and cost constraints that hinder large-scale AI deployment.

Method: Uses semantic clustering with a lightweight embedding model to group candidate responses, then selects the most coherent caption through cosine similarity consensus. Incorporates human-in-the-loop crop type confirmation to filter errors.

Result: Achieved 83.1% accuracy with 10 candidate generations vs 77.5% baseline. With multiple clusters, accuracy rose to 94.0% when correct response found in top four clusters, outperforming 88.5% baseline.

Conclusion: The framework effectively improves VLM reliability for agricultural image captioning, providing a cost-effective solution for developing countries with limited resources.

Abstract: Agricultural disease management in developing countries such as India, Kenya,
and Nigeria faces significant challenges due to limited access to expert plant
pathologists, unreliable internet connectivity, and cost constraints that
hinder the deployment of large-scale AI systems. This work introduces a
cost-effective self-consistency framework to improve vision-language model
(VLM) reliability for agricultural image captioning. The proposed method
employs semantic clustering, using a lightweight (80MB) pre-trained embedding
model to group multiple candidate responses. It then selects the most coherent
caption -- containing a diagnosis, symptoms, analysis, treatment, and
prevention recommendations -- through a cosine similarity-based consensus. A
practical human-in-the-loop (HITL) component is incorporated, wherein user
confirmation of the crop type filters erroneous generations, ensuring
higher-quality input for the consensus mechanism. Applied to the publicly
available PlantVillage dataset using a fine-tuned 3B-parameter PaliGemma model,
our framework demonstrates improvements over standard decoding methods.
Evaluated on 800 crop disease images with up to 21 generations per image, our
single-cluster consensus method achieves a peak accuracy of 83.1% with 10
candidate generations, compared to the 77.5% baseline accuracy of greedy
decoding. The framework's effectiveness is further demonstrated when
considering multiple clusters; accuracy rises to 94.0% when a correct response
is found within any of the top four candidate clusters, outperforming the 88.5%
achieved by a top-4 selection from the baseline.

### [3] [Proportion and Perspective Control for Flow-Based Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21763)
*Julien Boudier,Hugo Caselles-Dupr√©*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces two specialized ControlNets for artistic control in text-to-image diffusion models: one for proportion control using bounding boxes, and another for perspective control using vanishing lines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern text-to-image diffusion models generate high-fidelity images but offer limited control over spatial and geometric structure, which this work aims to address.

Method: Two ControlNets are developed: (1) proportion ControlNet using bounding boxes for object position and scale, and (2) perspective ControlNet using vanishing lines for 3D geometry control. Training uses data pipelines with vision-language models for annotation and specialized algorithms for conditioning image synthesis.

Result: Experiments show both modules provide effective control but exhibit limitations with complex constraints.

Conclusion: The two ControlNet models are released publicly on HuggingFace for artistic control applications.

Abstract: While modern text-to-image diffusion models generate high-fidelity images,
they offer limited control over the spatial and geometric structure of the
output. To address this, we introduce and evaluate two ControlNets specialized
for artistic control: (1) a proportion ControlNet that uses bounding boxes to
dictate the position and scale of objects, and (2) a perspective ControlNet
that employs vanishing lines to control the 3D geometry of the scene. We
support the training of these modules with data pipelines that leverage
vision-language models for annotation and specialized algorithms for
conditioning image synthesis. Our experiments demonstrate that both modules
provide effective control but exhibit limitations with complex constraints.
Both models are released on HuggingFace:

### [4] [H2OFlow: Grounding Human-Object Affordances with 3D Generative Models and Dense Diffused Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21769)
*Harry Zhang,Luca Carlone*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: H2OFlow is a novel framework that learns 3D human-object interaction affordances (contact, orientation, spatial occupancy) using only synthetic data from 3D generative models, eliminating the need for human annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches rely on labor-intensive hand-labeled datasets and are limited to contact-based analysis, neglecting important aspects like orientation preferences and spatial occupancy patterns in human-object interactions.

Method: Uses a dense 3D-flow-based representation learned through a dense diffusion process on point clouds, trained exclusively on synthetic data from 3D generative models.

Result: H2OFlow generalizes effectively to real-world objects and outperforms prior methods that use manual annotations or mesh-based representations in modeling 3D affordance.

Conclusion: The framework successfully demonstrates comprehensive 3D affordance learning without human annotations, addressing limitations of current approaches through synthetic data and flow-based representations.

Abstract: Understanding how humans interact with the surrounding environment, and
specifically reasoning about object interactions and affordances, is a critical
challenge in computer vision, robotics, and AI. Current approaches often depend
on labor-intensive, hand-labeled datasets capturing real-world or simulated
human-object interaction (HOI) tasks, which are costly and time-consuming to
produce. Furthermore, most existing methods for 3D affordance understanding are
limited to contact-based analysis, neglecting other essential aspects of
human-object interactions, such as orientation (\eg, humans might have a
preferential orientation with respect certain objects, such as a TV) and
spatial occupancy (\eg, humans are more likely to occupy certain regions around
an object, like the front of a microwave rather than its back). To address
these limitations, we introduce \emph{H2OFlow}, a novel framework that
comprehensively learns 3D HOI affordances -- encompassing contact, orientation,
and spatial occupancy -- using only synthetic data generated from 3D generative
models. H2OFlow employs a dense 3D-flow-based representation, learned through a
dense diffusion process operating on point clouds. This learned flow enables
the discovery of rich 3D affordances without the need for human annotations.
Through extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we demonstrate that
H2OFlow generalizes effectively to real-world objects and surpasses prior
methods that rely on manual annotations or mesh-based representations in
modeling 3D affordance.

### [6] [Face-MakeUpV2: Facial Consistency Learning for Controllable Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21775)
*Dawei Dai,Yinxiu Zhou,Chenghang Li,Guolai Jiang,Chengfang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Face-MakeUpV2 is a facial image generation model that addresses facial attribute leakage and physical consistency issues by using a large-scale dataset with precise spatial supervision and dual facial information injection channels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models suffer from facial attribute leakage and insufficient physical consistency when responding to local semantic instructions in facial image generation.

Method: Used a large-scale FaceCaptionMask-1M dataset with image-text-mask pairs for spatial supervision, employed a pretrained text-to-image model as backbone with 3D facial rendering and global facial feature channels, and implemented semantic alignment and perceptual loss objectives.

Result: Face-MakeUpV2 achieves best overall performance in preserving face ID and maintaining physical consistency of reference images, demonstrating practical potential for reliable facial editing.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses facial attribute leakage and physical consistency issues, making Face-MakeUpV2 suitable for diverse facial editing applications.

Abstract: In facial image generation, current text-to-image models often suffer from
facial attribute leakage and insufficient physical consistency when responding
to local semantic instructions. In this study, we propose Face-MakeUpV2, a
facial image generation model that aims to maintain the consistency of face ID
and physical characteristics with the reference image. First, we constructed a
large-scale dataset FaceCaptionMask-1M comprising approximately one million
image-text-masks pairs that provide precise spatial supervision for the local
semantic instructions. Second, we employed a general text-to-image pretrained
model as the backbone and introduced two complementary facial information
injection channels: a 3D facial rendering channel to incorporate the physical
characteristics of the image and a global facial feature channel. Third, we
formulated two optimization objectives for the supervised learning of our
model: semantic alignment in the model's embedding space to mitigate the
attribute leakage problem and perceptual loss on facial images to preserve ID
consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our Face-MakeUpV2 achieves
best overall performance in terms of preserving face ID and maintaining
physical consistency of the reference images. These results highlight the
practical potential of Face-MakeUpV2 for reliable and controllable facial
editing in diverse applications.

### [7] [Ageing Drift in Binary Face Templates: A Bits-per-Decade Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21778)
*Abdelilah Ganmati,Karim Afdel,Lahcen Koutti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper studies the longitudinal stability of compact binary face templates, quantifying aging drift in bits per decade. Using PCA-ITQ compressed 64- and 128-bit codes from face CNN embeddings, the research shows systematic increases in intra-class Hamming distance over time, with shorter codes being more age-stable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how facial aging affects the stability of compact binary face templates over time, which is crucial for long-term biometric deployments like smart-cards and match-on-card systems where template stability is essential.

Method: Float embeddings from a modern face CNN are compressed with PCA-ITQ into 64- and 128-bit codes. For each identity in AgeDB with at least three distinct ages, genuine pairs are formed and per-identity linear models of Hamming distance versus absolute age gap are fitted.

Result: Across 566 identities, median slopes are 1.357 bits per decade for 64-bit templates and 2.571 bits per decade for 128-bit templates. The distributions are predominantly positive, showing systematic increase in intra-class distance over time. Shorter codes are more age-stable at fixed decision thresholds.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates measurable aging drift in binary face templates, with implications for biometric deployments. Simple mitigations include periodic re-enrollment and targeted parity on unstable bit positions. Code and CSV artifacts are provided for reproducibility.

Abstract: We study the longitudinal stability of compact binary face templates and
quantify ageing drift directly in bits per decade. Float embeddings from a
modern face CNN are compressed with PCA-ITQ into 64- and 128-bit codes. For
each identity in AgeDB with at least three distinct ages, we form all genuine
pairs and fit a per-identity linear model of Hamming distance versus absolute
age gap. Across 566 identities, the median slope is 1.357 bits per decade for
64-bit templates and 2.571 bits per decade for 128-bit templates, with tight
non-parametric 95 percent bootstrap confidence intervals. The distributions are
predominantly positive, indicating a small but systematic increase in
intra-class distance over time. Because drift scales with code length, shorter
codes are inherently more age-stable at a fixed decision threshold. We connect
these slopes to operating characteristics by reporting EER and TPR at FAR = 1
percent in three age bins. We discuss implications for smart-card and
match-on-card deployments, including simple mitigations such as periodic
re-enrolment and targeted parity on empirically unstable bit positions. Code
and CSV artifacts are provided to support reproducibility.

### [8] [Bridging Accuracy and Interpretability: Deep Learning with XAI for Breast Cancer Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21780)
*Bishal Chhetri,B. V. Rathish Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An interpretable deep learning framework for early breast cancer detection using FNA images, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 99.2% accuracy and incorporating SHAP/LIME explanations to enhance clinical trust.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an accurate yet interpretable breast cancer detection system that bridges the gap between high performance and clinical trust, addressing the black-box nature of deep learning models in medical applications.

Method: Deep neural network with ReLU activations, Adam optimizer, and binary cross-entropy loss, trained on quantitative features from digitized FNA images. Model-agnostic Explainable AI techniques (SHAP and LIME) were incorporated for interpretability.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance: accuracy 0.992, precision 1.000, recall 0.977, F1 score 0.988. Outperformed traditional algorithms (logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, etc.). Identified concave points feature as most influential for classification.

Conclusion: The framework successfully combines high predictive accuracy with interpretability through XAI techniques, making it suitable for clinical adoption by providing transparent decision-making insights and identifying key diagnostic features like concave points in cell nuclei.

Abstract: In this study, we present an interpretable deep learning framework for the
early detection of breast cancer using quantitative features extracted from
digitized fine needle aspirate (FNA) images of breast masses. Our deep neural
network, using ReLU activations, the Adam optimizer, and a binary cross-entropy
loss, delivers state-of-the-art classification performance, achieving an
accuracy of 0.992, precision of 1.000, recall of 0.977, and an F1 score of
0.988. These results substantially exceed the benchmarks reported in the
literature. We evaluated the model under identical protocols against a suite of
well-established algorithms (logistic regression, decision trees, random
forests, stochastic gradient descent, K-nearest neighbors, and XGBoost) and
found the deep model consistently superior on the same metrics. Recognizing
that high predictive accuracy alone is insufficient for clinical adoption due
to the black-box nature of deep learning models, we incorporated model-agnostic
Explainable AI techniques such as SHAP and LIME to produce feature-level
attributions and human-readable visualizations. These explanations quantify the
contribution of each feature to individual predictions, support error analysis,
and increase clinician trust, thus bridging the gap between performance and
interpretability for real-world clinical use. The concave points feature of the
cell nuclei is found to be the most influential feature positively impacting
the classification task. This insight can be very helpful in improving the
diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer by highlighting the key
characteristics of breast tumor.

### [9] [EdgeSync: Accelerating Edge-Model Updates for Data Drift through Adaptive Continuous Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21781)
*Runchu Donga,Peng Zhao,Guiqin Wang,Nan Qi,Jie Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EdgeSync is an efficient edge-model updating approach that improves real-time video analytics by enhancing sample filtering with timeliness and inference results, and optimizing update timing to address model accuracy degradation from changing data distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time video analytics systems face accuracy degradation due to changing data distributions (lighting, weather conditions). Existing cloud-based retraining methods are compute-intensive with significant delays and may not align well with current video stream distributions.

Method: EdgeSync enhances sample filtering by incorporating timeliness and inference results to ensure training samples are relevant to current video content. It also features a dynamic training management module that optimizes timing and sequencing of model updates.

Result: Evaluations on diverse real-world datasets show EdgeSync improves accuracy by approximately 3.4% compared to existing methods and by about 10% compared to traditional approaches.

Conclusion: EdgeSync effectively addresses the challenges of compute-intensive retraining and misalignment with evolving data distributions, providing more timely and relevant model updates for real-time video analytics.

Abstract: Real-time video analytics systems typically deploy lightweight models on edge
devices to reduce latency. However, the distribution of data features may
change over time due to various factors such as changing lighting and weather
conditions, leading to decreased model accuracy. Recent frameworks try to
address this issue by leveraging remote servers to continuously train and adapt
lightweight edge models using more complex models in the cloud. Despite these
advancements, existing methods face two key challenges: first, the retraining
process is compute-intensive, causing significant delays in model updates;
second, the new model may not align well with the evolving data distribution of
the current video stream. To address these challenges, we introduce EdgeSync,
an efficient edge-model updating approach that enhances sample filtering by
incorporating timeliness and inference results, thus ensuring training samples
are more relevant to the current video content while reducing update delays.
Additionally, EdgeSync features a dynamic training management module that
optimizes the timing and sequencing of model updates to improve their
timeliness. Evaluations on diverse and complex real-world datasets demonstrate
that EdgeSync improves accuracy by approximately 3.4% compared to existing
methods and by about 10% compared to traditional approaches.

### [10] [Promptable Fire Segmentation: Unleashing SAM2's Potential for Real-Time Mobile Deployment with Strategic Bounding Box Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21782)
*Emmanuel U. Ugwu,Zhang Xinming*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents the first comprehensive evaluation of SAM2 variants for fire segmentation, showing that bounding box prompts outperform other methods and lightweight models like TinySAM are suitable for edge deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fire segmentation is challenging due to flames' irregular boundaries and variable intensities. While SAM models show cross-domain generalization, their effectiveness in fire segmentation under mobile constraints remains unexplored.

Method: Systematically evaluated four SAM2.1 variants and mobile-oriented variants across three fire datasets using multiple prompting strategies: automatic, single/multiple points, bounding boxes, and hybrid approaches.

Result: Bounding box prompts consistently outperformed other methods, with Box+MP achieving highest mean IoU (0.64) and Dice coefficient (0.75). Lightweight variants reduced memory and computational costs for edge deployment.

Conclusion: This work provides critical insights for deploying promptable segmentation models in fire monitoring systems and establishes benchmarks for domain-specific SAM applications.

Abstract: Fire segmentation remains a critical challenge in computer vision due to
flames' irregular boundaries, translucent edges, and highly variable
intensities. While the Segment Anything Models (SAM and SAM2) have demonstrated
impressive cross-domain generalization capabilities, their effectiveness in
fire segmentation -- particularly under mobile deployment constraints --
remains largely unexplored. This paper presents the first comprehensive
evaluation of SAM2 variants for fire segmentation, focusing on bounding box
prompting strategies to enhance deployment feasibility. We systematically
evaluate four SAM2.1 variants (tiny, small, base_plus, large) alongside
mobile-oriented variants (TinySAM, MobileSAM) across three fire datasets using
multiple prompting strategies: automatic, single positive point (SP), single
positive point + single negative point (SP+SN), multiple positive points (MP),
bounding box (Box), and hybrid variants (Box+SP and Box+MP). Our experimental
results demonstrate that bounding box prompts consistently outperform automatic
and single point-based approaches, with Box+MP achieving the highest mean IoU
(0.64) and Dice coefficient (0.75) on the Khan dataset. Lightweight variants
such as TinySAM and MobileSAM further reduce memory and computational costs,
making them more suitable for latency-tolerant edge scenarios. Overall, this
work provides critical insights for deploying promptable segmentation models in
fire monitoring systems and establishes benchmarks for future research in
domain-specific SAM applications. Code is available at:

### [11] [Noise Aggregation Analysis Driven by Small-Noise Injection: Efficient Membership Inference for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21783)
*Guo Li,Yuyang Yu,Xuemiao Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an efficient membership inference attack method against diffusion models by injecting slight noise and analyzing noise distribution aggregation patterns to distinguish training vs non-training samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models like Stable Diffusion pose privacy risks through membership inference attacks that can determine if specific data was used in training, raising concerns about data privacy.

Method: Inject slight noise into test images and evaluate aggregation degree of noise distribution predicted by the model. Member images show higher noise aggregation around certain time steps, while non-members exhibit more discrete noise patterns.

Result: Achieves superior performance across multiple datasets with fewer model visits compared to existing methods. Shows better attack effects in ASR and AUC metrics when applied to large-scale text-to-image diffusion models.

Conclusion: The proposed method is efficient, scalable, and effective for membership inference attacks against diffusion models, demonstrating distinguishable noise prediction patterns between member and non-member images.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated powerful performance in generating
high-quality images. A typical example is text-to-image generator like Stable
Diffusion. However, their widespread use also poses potential privacy risks. A
key concern is membership inference attacks, which attempt to determine whether
a particular data sample was used in the model training process. We propose an
efficient membership inference attack method against diffusion models. This
method is based on the injection of slight noise and the evaluation of the
aggregation degree of the noise distribution. The intuition is that the noise
prediction patterns of diffusion models for training set samples and
non-training set samples exhibit distinguishable differences.Specifically, we
suppose that member images exhibit higher aggregation of predicted noise around
a certain time step of the diffusion process. In contrast, the predicted noises
of non-member images exhibit a more discrete characteristic around the certain
time step. Compared with other existing methods, our proposed method requires
fewer visits to the target diffusion model. We inject slight noise into the
image under test and then determine its membership by analyzing the aggregation
degree of the noise distribution predicted by the model. Empirical findings
indicate that our method achieves superior performance across multiple
datasets. At the same time, our method can also show better attack effects in
ASR and AUC when facing large-scale text-to-image diffusion models, proving the
scalability of our method.

### [12] [Multi-Agent Pose Uncertainty: A Differentiable Rendering Cram√©r-Rao Bound](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21785)
*Arun Muthukkumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A closed-form lower bound on camera pose estimation covariance using differentiable renderers as measurement functions, extending classical bundle adjustment uncertainty to learned models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pose estimation is crucial for computer vision and robotics, but few works provide rigorous uncertainty quantification for poses under dense or learned models.

Method: Treat differentiable renderer as measurement function, linearize image formation with respect to small pose perturbations on manifold to derive render-aware Cram√©r-Rao bound.

Result: Derives closed-form lower bound on pose covariance that reduces to classical bundle-adjustment uncertainty and extends to multi-agent settings by fusing Fisher information.

Conclusion: Provides statistical formulation with applications for cooperative perception and novel view synthesis without requiring explicit keypoint correspondences.

Abstract: Pose estimation is essential for many applications within computer vision and
robotics. Despite its uses, few works provide rigorous uncertainty
quantification for poses under dense or learned models. We derive a closed-form
lower bound on the covariance of camera pose estimates by treating a
differentiable renderer as a measurement function. Linearizing image formation
with respect to a small pose perturbation on the manifold yields a render-aware
Cram\'er-Rao bound. Our approach reduces to classical bundle-adjustment
uncertainty, ensuring continuity with vision theory. It also naturally extends
to multi-agent settings by fusing Fisher information across cameras. Our
statistical formulation has downstream applications for tasks such as
cooperative perception and novel view synthesis without requiring explicit
keypoint correspondences.

### [13] [EventFormer: A Node-graph Hierarchical Attention Transformer for Action-centric Video Event Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21786)
*Qile Su,Shoutai Zhu,Shuai Zhang,Baoyu Liang,Chao Tong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AVEP (Action-centric Video Event Prediction), a new task for predicting subsequent events in videos using complex logic and semantic information, along with a large annotated dataset and EventFormer model that outperforms existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human events are mostly recorded in videos rather than scripts, but there's a lack of research on event prediction in the vision domain. Existing video prediction tasks don't capture the complex logic and rich semantic information needed for event prediction.

Method: Created a large structured dataset with 35K annotated videos and 178K video clips, using multimodal event argument nodes as atomic units. Proposed EventFormer, a node-graph hierarchical attention model that captures relationships between events and arguments, and coreferential relationships between arguments.

Result: Experiments with SOTA video prediction models and LVLMs on AVEP demonstrated the task's complexity and dataset's value. EventFormer outperformed all existing video prediction models.

Conclusion: AVEP addresses the gap in video event prediction research, providing a challenging task with complex event structures. The proposed dataset and EventFormer model show promising results, with plans to release the dataset and code for reproducibility.

Abstract: Script event induction, which aims to predict the subsequent event based on
the context, is a challenging task in NLP, achieving remarkable success in
practical applications. However, human events are mostly recorded and presented
in the form of videos rather than scripts, yet there is a lack of related
research in the realm of vision. To address this problem, we introduce AVEP
(Action-centric Video Event Prediction), a task that distinguishes itself from
existing video prediction tasks through its incorporation of more complex logic
and richer semantic information. We present a large structured dataset, which
consists of about $35K$ annotated videos and more than $178K$ video clips of
event, built upon existing video event datasets to support this task. The
dataset offers more fine-grained annotations, where the atomic unit is
represented as a multimodal event argument node, providing better structured
representations of video events. Due to the complexity of event structures,
traditional visual models that take patches or frames as input are not
well-suited for AVEP. We propose EventFormer, a node-graph hierarchical
attention based video event prediction model, which can capture both the
relationships between events and their arguments and the coreferencial
relationships between arguments. We conducted experiments using several SOTA
video prediction models as well as LVLMs on AVEP, demonstrating both the
complexity of the task and the value of the dataset. Our approach outperforms
all these video prediction models. We will release the dataset and code for
replicating the experiments and annotations.

### [14] [Mismatch reconstruction theory for unknown measurement matrix in imaging through multimode fiber bending](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21787)
*Le Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel mismatch reconstruction theory for multimode fiber imaging that enables image reconstruction when the measurement matrix is unknown, using mismatch equations and calibration algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional reconstruction algorithms fail when measurement matrix is unknown due to system configuration issues or fiber bending, making practical applications challenging.

Method: Proposed mismatch equation and designed matched/calibration solution algorithms to construct new measurement matrices, with detailed proofs provided.

Result: Successfully reconstructed images under low noise levels using constructed matrices, with analysis showing robustness to noise, computational precision, and orthogonality.

Conclusion: The theory provides a practical solution for unknown measurement matrix scenarios with demonstrated robustness, though limitations exist and potential applications are discussed.

Abstract: Multimode fiber imaging requires strict matching between measurement value
and measurement matrix to achieve image reconstruction. However, in practical
applications, the measurement matrix often cannot be obtained due to unknown
system configuration or difficulty in real-time alignment after arbitrary fiber
bending, resulting in the failure of traditional reconstruction algorithms.
This paper presents a novel mismatch reconstruction theory for solving the
problem of image reconstruction when measurement matrix is unknown. We first
propose mismatch equation and design matched and calibration solution
algorithms to construct a new measurement matrix. In addition, we also provide

Abstract: Data fusion is an essential task in various domains, enabling the integration
of multi-source information to enhance data quality and insights. One key
application is in satellite remote sensing, where fusing multi-sensor
observations can improve spatial and temporal resolution. In this study, we
explore the design space of diffusion and flow models for data fusion, focusing
on the integration of Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational
Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite
(VIIRS) nighttime lights data. Our approach leverages a diverse set of 2D
image-to-image generative models, including UNET, diffusion, and flow modeling
architectures. We evaluate the effectiveness of these architectures in
satellite remote sensing data fusion, identifying diffusion models based on
UNet as particularly adept at preserving fine-grained spatial details and
generating high-fidelity fused images. We also provide guidance on the
selection of noise schedulers in diffusion-based models, highlighting the
trade-offs between iterative solvers for faster inference and discrete
schedulers for higher-quality reconstructions. Additionally, we explore
quantization techniques to optimize memory efficiency and computational cost
without compromising performance. Our findings offer practical insights into
selecting the most effective diffusion and flow model architectures for data
fusion tasks, particularly in remote sensing applications, and provide
recommendations for leveraging noise scheduling strategies to enhance fusion
quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial anomaly detection benefits from integrating 2D and 3D data, but robust cross-modal fusion remains challenging.

Method: Proposes Multi-Modal Attention-Driven Fusion Restoration (MAFR) with a shared fusion encoder for RGB images and point clouds, followed by attention-guided modality-specific decoders. Anomalies are detected by measuring reconstruction errors between input features and their restored counterparts.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on MVTec 3D-AD (mean I-AUROC 0.972) and Eyecandies (0.901) benchmarks, with strong few-shot learning performance. Ablation studies confirm importance of fusion architecture and composite loss.

Conclusion: MAFR offers a principled approach for fusing visual and geometric information, advancing the robustness and accuracy of industrial anomaly detection.

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) increasingly benefits from integrating 2D
and 3D data, but robust cross-modal fusion remains challenging. We propose a
novel unsupervised framework, Multi-Modal Attention-Driven Fusion Restoration
(MAFR), which synthesises a unified latent space from RGB images and point
clouds using a shared fusion encoder, followed by attention-guided,
modality-specific decoders. Anomalies are localised by measuring reconstruction
errors between input features and their restored counterparts. Evaluations on
the MVTec 3D-AD and Eyecandies benchmarks demonstrate that MAFR achieves
state-of-the-art results, with a mean I-AUROC of 0.972 and 0.901, respectively.
The framework also exhibits strong performance in few-shot learning settings,
and ablation studies confirm the critical roles of the fusion architecture and
composite loss. MAFR offers a principled approach for fusing visual and
geometric information, advancing the robustness and accuracy of industrial
anomaly detection. Code is available at https://github.com/adabrh/MAFR

*Kejia Chen,Jiawen Zhang,Jiacong Hu,Kewei Gao,Jian Lou,Zunlei Feng,Mingli Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TITA is a lightweight framework that reduces hallucinations in Vision-Language Models by providing token-level inference-time alignment using a trained reward model, without fine-tuning the base model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing alignment approaches for VLMs rely on expensive fine-tuning or provide only coarse, delayed feedback, making them inefficient for addressing hallucination issues.

Method: Freezes the base VLM and trains a reward model to approximate its distribution. During inference, extracts implicit preference signals as log-probability ratios between the reward model and target VLM, providing dense autoregressive feedback.

Result: Consistent gains across 12 benchmarks: 8.6% improvement on MMVet, 6.7% on POPE, with stronger general understanding and reduced hallucinations. Comparable gains on other models with negligible inference overhead.

Conclusion: TITA effectively reduces hallucinations in VLMs through token-level inference-time alignment, achieving significant performance improvements without retraining the backbone model.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become essential backbones of modern
multimodal intelligence, yet their outputs remain prone to
hallucination-plausible text misaligned with visual inputs. Existing alignment
approaches often rely on expensive fine-tuning with annotated preference data
or sequence-level inference strategies that provide only coarse, delayed
feedback. To overcome these limitations, we present TITA (Token-level
Inference-Time Alignment), a lightweight framework that freezes the base VLM
and instead trains a reward model to approximate its distribution. During
inference, implicit preference signals are extracted as log-probability ratios
between the reward model and the target VLM, yielding dense autoregressive
feedback. This formulation can be viewed as an inference-time variant of Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), providing token-level corrective signals without
retraining the backbone. Extensive evaluations on LLaVA-1.5-7B and 13B show
consistent gains across 12 benchmarks, with improvements of 8.6% on MMVet and
6.7% on POPE, indicating stronger general understanding and reduced
hallucinations. Additional experiments on Qwen2.5-VL-7B and DeepSeek-VL2-27.5B
show comparable gains, especially in hallucination reduction and VQA accuracy,
while incurring negligible inference overhead.

TL;DR: Proposes HIBA architecture with hierarchical sparse attention for time series foundation models, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot performance across parameter scales from 9.5M to 1.5B.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing time series foundation models directly adopt cross-domain architectures, limiting their ability to capture multiscale temporal dependencies, especially during zero-shot transfer across datasets with divergent patterns.

Method: Hierarchical Interleaved Block Attention (HIBA) with inter- and intra-block sparse attention: intra-block for local information exchange, inter-block for global temporal pattern interaction and dynamic evolution.

Result: Xihe-tiny (9.5M) surpasses most contemporary TSFMs, while Xihe-max (1.5B) establishes new state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on GIFT-Eval benchmark with substantial margin over previous best results.

Conclusion: HIBA architecture demonstrates exceptional generalization capabilities and architectural superiority across the entire parameter spectrum, providing compelling evidence for its effectiveness in time series modeling.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of time series foundation models (TSFMs) has been
propelled by migrating architectures from language models. While existing TSFMs
demonstrate impressive performance, their direct adoption of cross-domain
architectures constrains effective capture of multiscale temporal dependencies
inherent to time series data. This limitation becomes particularly pronounced
during zero-shot transfer across datasets with divergent underlying patterns
and sampling strategies. To address these challenges, we propose Hierarchical
Interleaved Block Attention (HIBA) which employs hierarchical inter- and
intra-block sparse attention to effectively capture multi-scale dependencies.
Intra-block attention facilitates local information exchange, and inter-block
attention operates across blocks to capture global temporal pattern interaction
and dynamic evolution. Leveraging the HIBA architecture, we introduce Xihe, a
scalable TSFM family spanning from an ultra-efficient 9.5M parameter
configuration to high-capacity 1.5B variant. Evaluated on the comprehensive
GIFT-Eval benchmark, our most compact Xihe-tiny model (9.5M) surpasses the
majority of contemporary TSFMs, demonstrating remarkable parameter efficiency.
More impressively, Xihe-max (1.5B) establishes new state-of-the-art zero-shot
performance, surpassing previous best results by a substantial margin. This
consistent performance excellence across the entire parameter spectrum provides
compelling evidence for the exceptional generalization capabilities and
architectural superiority of HIBA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance video annotation efficiency and quality by integrating automatic AI capabilities to ease human annotators' workload and improve performance.

Method: Implemented single-iteration Human-in-the-Loop scheme using Label Studio with AI-powered zero-shot pre-annotations, tested on UCF-Crime dataset for normal/abnormal activity discrimination.

Result: 35% reduction in annotation time for 70% of annotators with similar quality; more coherent annotations and better alignment with natural video frame clustering.

Conclusion: AI-based pre-annotation effectively streamlines video annotation workflow, empowers human annotators, and optimizes the overall pipeline while maintaining annotation quality.

Abstract: We explore the enhancement of Human-in-the-Loop video annotation by
integrating automatic capabilities to ease the task for annotators and assess
their performance. The research delves into the practical implications of the
annotation processes, the integration of AI components, and the evaluation of
its outcomes. We analyze their impact on efficiency, accuracy, and overall
annotation quality. Focusing on the Human-in-the-Loop for video annotation
tasks, we implemented a single-iteration scheme using Label Studio and
AI-powered zero-shot pre-annotations. Using this framework, we designed a test
based on the annotation of the UCF-Crime dataset to discriminate between normal
and abnormal activities in video footage. Our results evidence how automatic
AI-based pre-annotation can streamline the video annotation workflow,
empowering human annotators and optimizing the overall pipeline. Using the
pre-annotated data, we observed a 35% reduction in the annotation time for 70%
of the annotators with similar quality annotations, compared to the traditional
manual annotation task. Results are consistent with asset duration and
complexity. We also observed that while annotators rapidly learned to use the
tool, the produced annotations are more coherent among annotators and better
match the natural clustering of the video frames.

TL;DR: A multimodal framework combining anatomical graph representations from SAM segmentations with vision encoders improves knee osteoarthritis diagnosis accuracy by 10% over single-modality baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Knee osteoarthritis diagnosis from radiographs is challenging due to subtle morphological details that standard deep learning models struggle to capture effectively.

Method: Integrates morphological graph representations from Segment Anything Model segmentations with vision encoders, enforcing alignment between geometry-informed graph embeddings and radiographic features through mutual information maximization.

Result: Achieves nearly 80% accuracy on Osteoarthritis Initiative dataset, surpassing single-modality baselines by up to 10% and outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 8% in accuracy and 11% in F1 score.

Conclusion: Incorporating anatomical structure into radiographic analysis is critical for accurate KOA severity grading.

Abstract: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) diagnosis from radiographs remains challenging due
to the subtle morphological details that standard deep learning models struggle
to capture effectively. We propose a novel multimodal framework that combines
anatomical structure with radiographic features by integrating a morphological
graph representation - derived from Segment Anything Model (SAM) segmentations
- with a vision encoder. Our approach enforces alignment between
geometry-informed graph embeddings and radiographic features through mutual
information maximization, significantly improving KOA classification accuracy.
By constructing graphs from anatomical features, we introduce explicit
morphological priors that mirror clinical assessment criteria, enriching the
feature space and enhancing the model's inductive bias. Experiments on the
Osteoarthritis Initiative dataset demonstrate that our approach surpasses
single-modality baselines by up to 10\% in accuracy (reaching nearly 80\%),
while outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods by 8\% in accuracy and
11\% in F1 score. These results underscore the critical importance of
incorporating anatomical structure into radiographic analysis for accurate KOA
severity grading.

### [21] [It Takes Two to Tango: Two Parallel Samplers Improve Quality in Diffusion Models for Limited Steps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21802)
*Pedro Cisneros-Velarde*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method using two parallel samplers with limited denoising steps improves diffusion model sampling quality through information integration at successive times, without requiring fine-tuning or external models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the quality of sampled images from diffusion models when limited to a small number of denoising steps, addressing the computational constraints of real-world applications.

Method: Two parallel processors/samplers perform denoising steps at successive times and appropriately integrate their information in the latent image. The approach is plug-and-play, model-agnostic, and requires no additional fine-tuning.

Result: The method improves sample quality in both automated and human evaluations across different diffusion models. Naive integration of sampler information lowers quality, and adding more than two samplers doesn't necessarily improve results.

Conclusion: Two parallel samplers with proper information integration can effectively enhance diffusion model sampling quality under step limitations, offering a simple yet effective solution without additional training requirements.

Abstract: We consider the situation where we have a limited number of denoising steps,
i.e., of evaluations of a diffusion model. We show that two parallel processors
or samplers under such limitation can improve the quality of the sampled image.
Particularly, the two samplers make denoising steps at successive times, and
their information is appropriately integrated in the latent image. Remarkably,
our method is simple both conceptually and to implement: it is plug-&-play,
model agnostic, and does not require any additional fine-tuning or external
models. We test our method with both automated and human evaluations for
different diffusion models. We also show that a naive integration of the
information from the two samplers lowers sample quality. Finally, we find that
adding more parallel samplers does not necessarily improve sample quality.

*Jiaao Yu,Mingjie Han,Tao Gong,Jian Zhang,Man Lan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FDA-CLIP is a CLIP-based framework that uses frame differences to guide video-text retrieval by focusing on dynamic regions and suppressing static background redundancy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in text-video retrieval: high data acquisition costs from large-scale annotations and modal gap between video-text features. Existing CLIP adaptation methods lack dynamic feature enhancement and fail to suppress static redundancy.

Method: Proposes FDA-CLIP using frame differences to generate dynamic region masks, input as Alpha channel to Alpha-CLIP to guide focus on critical dynamic regions while suppressing static background.

Result: Experiments show frame difference-guided video semantic encoding effectively balances retrieval efficiency and accuracy.

Conclusion: FDA-CLIP successfully enhances text-video alignment by leveraging dynamic region information to improve retrieval performance while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of video data, text-video retrieval technology has
become increasingly important in numerous application scenarios such as
recommendation and search. Early text-video retrieval methods suffer from two
critical drawbacks: first, they heavily rely on large-scale annotated
video-text pairs, leading to high data acquisition costs; second, there is a
significant modal gap between video and text features, which limits cross-modal
alignment accuracy. With the development of vision-language model, adapting
CLIP to video tasks has attracted great attention. However, existing adaptation
methods generally lack enhancement for dynamic video features and fail to
effectively suppress static redundant features. To address this issue, this
paper proposes FDA-CLIP (Frame Difference Alpha-CLIP), which is a concise
CLIP-based training framework for text-video alignment. Specifically, the
method uses frame differences to generate dynamic region masks, which are input
into Alpha-CLIP as an additional Alpha channel. This proactively guides the
model to focus on semantically critical dynamic regions while suppressing
static background redundancy. Experiments demonstrate that frame
difference-guided video semantic encoding can effectively balance retrieval
efficiency and accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel fine-tuning task called Masked Prediction via Context and Commonsense (MPCC) to enhance multimodal reasoning in vision-language models by forcing integration of visual context and commonsense reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reasoning models focus heavily on single-modal language settings, failing to adapt to real-world multimodal scenarios and fully exploit visual context and commonsense knowledge, which limits generalization across diverse multimodal environments.

Method: Proposed MPCC task that reconstructs semantically meaningful content from occluded images, developed MPCC Eval benchmark, and introduced Reinforcement Fine-tuning with Prior Sampling training method to enhance generalized reasoning capabilities.

Result: The approach improves model performance and enhances generalized reasoning capabilities in out-of-distribution (OOD) and cross-task scenarios.

Conclusion: The MPCC framework successfully bridges the gap in multimodal reasoning by integrating visual context and commonsense knowledge, enabling better generalization across diverse multimodal environments.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in reasoning models have markedly advanced the reasoning
capabilities of large language models, particularly via training on tasks with
verifiable rewards. Yet, a significant gap persists in their adaptation to real
world multimodal scenarios, most notably, vision language tasks, due to a heavy
focus on single modal language settings. While efforts to transplant
reinforcement learning techniques from NLP to VLMs have emerged, these
approaches often remain confined to perception centric tasks or reduce images
to textual summaries, failing to fully exploit visual context and commonsense
knowledge, ultimately constraining the generalization of reasoning capabilities
across diverse multimodal environments. To address this limitation, we
introduce a novel fine tuning task, Masked Prediction via Context and
Commonsense, which forces models to integrate visual context and commonsense
reasoning by reconstructing semantically meaningful content from occluded
images, thereby laying the foundation for generalized reasoning. To
systematically evaluate the model performance in generalized reasoning, we
developed a specialized evaluation benchmark, MPCC Eval, and employed various
fine tuning strategies to guide reasoning. Among these, we introduced an
innovative training method, Reinforcement Fine tuning with Prior Sampling,
which not only enhances model performance but also improves its generalized
reasoning capabilities in OOD and cross task scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes SRE-CLIP Adapter, a CLIP-based framework for Domain-Adaptive Zero-Shot Learning that addresses inefficient cross-category knowledge transfer and degraded cross-modal alignment through semantic relation guidance and alignment retention strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High data annotation costs drive need for data-efficient learning, but existing methods fail to balance cross-domain transfer and cross-category generalization, creating demand for DAZSL. CLIP has inherent advantages but current approaches don't fully exploit its potential.

Method: Semantic Relation-Enhanced CLIP (SRE-CLIP) Adapter framework with Semantic Relation Structure Loss for efficient cross-category knowledge transfer and Cross-Modal Alignment Retention Strategy to maintain alignment during target domain fine-tuning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on I2AwA and I2WebV benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing approaches.

Conclusion: SRE-CLIP is the first CLIP-based DAZSL method that successfully addresses core challenges in the field and demonstrates superior performance through semantic relation guidance and cross-modal alignment preservation.

Abstract: The high cost of data annotation has spurred research on training deep
learning models in data-limited scenarios. Existing paradigms, however, fail to
balance cross-domain transfer and cross-category generalization, giving rise to
the demand for Domain-Adaptive Zero-Shot Learning (DAZSL). Although
vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have inherent advantages in the DAZSL
field, current studies do not fully exploit their potential. Applying CLIP to
DAZSL faces two core challenges: inefficient cross-category knowledge transfer
due to the lack of semantic relation guidance, and degraded cross-modal
alignment during target domain fine-tuning. To address these issues, we propose
a Semantic Relation-Enhanced CLIP (SRE-CLIP) Adapter framework, integrating a
Semantic Relation Structure Loss and a Cross-Modal Alignment Retention
Strategy. As the first CLIP-based DAZSL method, SRE-CLIP achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the I2AwA and I2WebV benchmarks, significantly
outperforming existing approaches.

TL;DR: Proposes using language description as an auxiliary task in reinforcement learning for robot navigation, leveraging knowledge distillation from vision-language models to enable explainable navigation without performance trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between explainability and performance in robot navigation systems, where explainable systems typically underperform non-explainable ones, and overcome the challenge of lacking ground-truth data for action description.

Method: Incorporates action description in language as an auxiliary task in reinforcement learning, using knowledge distillation from pre-trained vision-language models to generate descriptions without ground-truth data.

Result: Achieves high navigation performance while providing action descriptions, and attains state-of-the-art performance in semantic audio-visual navigation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully enables explainable robot navigation without sacrificing performance, demonstrating that language description can be effectively integrated as an auxiliary task in reinforcement learning.

Abstract: The field of multimodal robot navigation in indoor environments has garnered
significant attention in recent years. However, as tasks and methods become
more advanced, the action decision systems tend to become more complex and
operate as black-boxes. For a reliable system, the ability to explain or
describe its decisions is crucial; however, there tends to be a trade-off in
that explainable systems can not outperform non-explainable systems in terms of
performance. In this paper, we propose incorporating the task of describing
actions in language into the reinforcement learning of navigation as an
auxiliary task. Existing studies have found it difficult to incorporate
describing actions into reinforcement learning due to the absence of
ground-truth data. We address this issue by leveraging knowledge distillation
from pre-trained description generation models, such as vision-language models.
We comprehensively evaluate our approach across various navigation tasks,
demonstrating that it can describe actions while attaining high navigation
performance. Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art performance in the
particularly challenging multimodal navigation task of semantic audio-visual
navigation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid AI framework combining traditional feature extraction with deep learning for improved diabetic retinopathy detection, outperforming standalone deep learning approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diabetic Retinopathy is a major vision-threatening complication affecting India's large diabetic population, requiring early screening since it's asymptomatic initially. Current methods need improvement for accurate detection.

Method: Hybrid diagnostic framework that combines traditional handcrafted feature extraction (capturing clinical markers) with deep learning (automating hierarchical pattern recognition) for multimodal analysis.

Result: The hybrid model demonstrates superior classification performance and reduces false negatives compared to standalone deep learning approaches, enabling more accurate DR screening.

Conclusion: This multimodal AI-driven approach provides scalable and accurate diabetic retinopathy screening, which is crucial for diabetes-burdened regions like India.

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), a vision-threatening complication of Dia-betes
Mellitus (DM), is a major global concern, particularly in India, which has one
of the highest diabetic populations. Prolonged hyperglycemia damages reti-nal
microvasculature, leading to DR symptoms like microaneurysms, hemor-rhages, and
fluid leakage, which, if undetected, cause irreversible vision loss. Therefore,
early screening is crucial as DR is asymptomatic in its initial stages. Fundus
imaging aids precise diagnosis by detecting subtle retinal lesions. This paper
introduces a hybrid diagnostic framework combining traditional feature
extraction and deep learning (DL) to enhance DR detection. While handcrafted
features capture key clinical markers, DL automates hierarchical pattern
recog-nition, improving early diagnosis. The model synergizes interpretable
clinical data with learned features, surpassing standalone DL approaches that
demon-strate superior classification and reduce false negatives. This
multimodal AI-driven approach enables scalable, accurate DR screening, crucial
for diabetes-burdened regions.

*Samuel J. Barrett,Docko Sow*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SITS-DECO is a decoder-only generative model for Earth Observation data that uses unified token sequences and symbolic prompting to perform multiple tasks without task-specific adaptation, outperforming larger models on crop classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing EO foundation models that require adaptation and are rigidly structured around specific data sources or training approaches, by applying the unified-sequence approach from large language models to EO data.

Method: Uses a simple GPT-style decoder-only architecture with symbolic prompting to perform multiple supervised and self-supervised tasks within a single unified framework, without task- or modality-specific adaptation.

Result: Despite its simplicity and lack of spatial context, SITS-DECO outperforms much larger EO foundation models on crop-type classification (PASTIS-R), demonstrating that dense temporal sequence modeling is critical.

Conclusion: This work exemplifies a data-centric modeling paradigm where capability arises from training data diversity rather than architectural complexity, providing a lightweight route to multi-modal, multi-task EO modeling and bridging toward future generative EO foundation models.

Abstract: Earth Observation (EO) Foundation Modelling (FM) holds great promise for
simplifying and improving the use of EO data for diverse real-world tasks.
However, most existing models require additional adaptation before they can be
used and are structured rigidly around particular data sources or training
approaches. To address this, we take inspiration from large language models,
where diverse tasks, both pre-training and downstream, are implicitly captured
through next-token prediction over unified token sequences, leveraging the
structure and diversity of the training data.
  We introduce SITS-DECO (Satellite Image Time Series-DECoder Only), a
proof-of-concept generative model that applies this unified-sequence framing to
EO data. Using a simple GPT-style decoder-only architecture, and demonstrate
its ability to perform useful EO tasks (pixel-wise, multi-temporal, multi-modal
crop-type classification) in a purely generative framework. Through symbolic
prompting, we show that the model can perform multiple supervised and
self-supervised tasks within a single unified architecture, without task- or
modality-specific adaptation. Despite its simplicity and lack of spatial
context, SITS-DECO outperforms much larger EO foundation models on crop-type
classification (PASTIS-R) demonstrating that dense temporal sequence modelling
is a critical missing ingredient in the current paradigm.
  This work exemplifies a data-centric modelling paradigm in which capability
arises from the diversity and structure of the training data rather than from
architectural complexity. SITS-DECO provides a lightweight, practical route to
multi-modal, multi-task EO modelling, and a conceptual bridge toward future

*Zhuoming Li,Aitong Liu,Mengxi Jia,Tengxiang Zhang,Dell Zhang,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Gestura is an end-to-end system that uses a pre-trained Large Vision-Language Model enhanced with anatomical hand priors and Chain-of-Thought reasoning to achieve robust free-form gesture understanding, outperforming the existing GestureGPT solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing free-form gesture understanding solutions like GestureGPT suffer from limited recognition accuracy and slow response times, creating a need for more effective systems that can handle the highly dynamic and diverse patterns of free-form gestures.

Method: Gestura combines a pre-trained LVLM with a Landmark Processing Module that embeds anatomical hand priors to capture subtle movements, and uses Chain-of-Thought reasoning for step-by-step semantic inference to transform shallow knowledge into deep understanding.

Result: The system achieves robust and adaptable free-form gesture comprehension and the authors have developed the first open-source dataset for free-form gesture intention reasoning with over 300,000 annotated QA pairs.

Conclusion: Gestura successfully addresses the limitations of existing solutions by integrating LVLMs with domain-specific anatomical knowledge and semantic reasoning strategies, enabling effective interpretation of ambiguous or unconventional gestures.

Abstract: Free-form gesture understanding is highly appealing for human-computer
interaction, as it liberates users from the constraints of predefined gesture
categories. However, the sole existing solution GestureGPT suffers from limited
recognition accuracy and slow response times. In this paper, we propose
Gestura, an end-to-end system for free-form gesture understanding. Gestura
harnesses a pre-trained Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) to align the highly
dynamic and diverse patterns of free-form gestures with high-level semantic
concepts. To better capture subtle hand movements across different styles, we
introduce a Landmark Processing Module that compensate for LVLMs' lack of
fine-grained domain knowledge by embedding anatomical hand priors. Further, a
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning strategy enables step-by-step semantic
inference, transforming shallow knowledge into deep semantic understanding and
significantly enhancing the model's ability to interpret ambiguous or
unconventional gestures. Together, these components allow Gestura to achieve
robust and adaptable free-form gesture comprehension. Additionally, we have
developed the first open-source dataset for free-form gesture intention
reasoning and understanding with over 300,000 annotated QA pairs.

Abstract: This study examines the prompt fidelity of ChatGPT4o / DALL-E3 text-to-image
visualisations by analysing whether attributes explicitly specified in
autogenously generated prompts are correctly rendered in the resulting images.
Using two public-domain datasets comprising 200 visualisations of women working
in the cultural and creative industries and 230 visualisations of museum
curators, the study assessed accuracy across personal attributes (age, hair),
appearance (attire, glasses), and paraphernalia (name tags, clipboards). While
correctly rendered in most cases, DALL-E3 deviated from prompt specifications
in 15.6% of all attributes (n=710). Errors were lowest for paraphernalia,
moderate for personal appearance, and highest for depictions of the person
themselves, particularly age. These findings demonstrate measurable
prompt-to-image fidelity gaps with implications for bias detection and model

*Sai Teja Erukude,Suhasnadh Reddy Veluru,Viswa Chaitanya Marella*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A wavelet-based method using DWT preprocessing and ResNet50 classifier effectively detects StyleGAN-generated images with 95.1% accuracy, outperforming spatial domain approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identifying GAN-generated images has become a significant challenge in digital image forensics, requiring effective detection methods.

Method: Uses discrete wavelet transform (DWT) preprocessing with Haar and Daubechies filters to create multi-resolution representations, then feeds them to ResNet50 for classification to capture subtle generative artifacts.

Result: Wavelet-based models achieved 93.8% (Haar) and 95.1% (Daubechies) accuracy, significantly higher than spatial domain model (81.5%). Daubechies outperformed Haar, showing better distinguishing power.

Conclusion: GAN-generated images have unique wavelet-domain artifacts, and wavelet-domain analysis is highly effective for GAN image detection, with potential for enhancing future deepfake detection systems.

Abstract: Identifying images generated by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) has
become a significant challenge in digital image forensics. This research
presents a wavelet-based detection method that uses discrete wavelet transform
(DWT) preprocessing and a ResNet50 classification layer to differentiate the
StyleGAN-generated images from real ones. Haar and Daubechies wavelet filters
are applied to convert the input images into multi-resolution representations,
which will then be fed to a ResNet50 network for classification, capitalizing
on subtle artifacts left by the generative process. Moreover, the wavelet-based
models are compared to an identical ResNet50 model trained on spatial data. The
Haar and Daubechies preprocessed models achieved a greater accuracy of 93.8
percent and 95.1 percent, much higher than the model developed in the spatial
domain (accuracy rate of 81.5 percent). The Daubechies-based model outperforms
Haar, showing that adding layers of descriptive frequency patterns can lead to
even greater distinguishing power. These results indicate that the
GAN-generated images have unique wavelet-domain artifacts or "fingerprints."
The method proposed illustrates the effectiveness of wavelet-domain analysis to
detect GAN images and emphasizes the potential of further developing the
capabilities of future deepfake detection systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents an explainable deep learning framework using ResNet50 and DenseNet121 for medical image classification (brain tumors and pneumonia), achieving high accuracy with DenseNet121 performing better, and uses Grad-CAM for interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of interpretability in deep learning models for medical imaging, which hampers clinical trust and adoption, by developing an explainable framework that combines high performance with transparency.

Method: Used two CNN architectures (ResNet50 and DenseNet121) trained on Kaggle datasets (7,023 brain MRI and 5,863 chest X-ray images), and integrated Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to create heatmap visualizations showing influential regions in decision-making.

Result: DenseNet121 outperformed ResNet50 with 94.3% vs. 92.5% accuracy for brain tumors and 89.1% vs. 84.4% accuracy for pneumonia. Grad-CAM revealed DenseNet121 consistently focused on core pathological regions while ResNet50 sometimes scattered attention to peripheral areas.

Conclusion: Combining deep learning with explainable AI offers a promising path toward reliable, interpretable, and clinically useful diagnostic tools in medical imaging.

Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) holds enormous potential for improving medical imaging
diagnostics, yet the lack of interpretability in most models hampers clinical
trust and adoption. This paper presents an explainable deep learning framework
for detecting brain tumors in MRI scans and pneumonia in chest X-ray images
using two leading Convolutional Neural Networks, ResNet50 and DenseNet121.
These models were trained on publicly available Kaggle datasets comprising
7,023 brain MRI images and 5,863 chest X-ray images, achieving high
classification performance. DenseNet121 consistently outperformed ResNet50 with
94.3 percent vs. 92.5 percent accuracy for brain tumors and 89.1 percent vs.
84.4 percent accuracy for pneumonia. For better explainability,
Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) was integrated to create
heatmap visualizations superimposed on the test images, indicating the most
influential image regions in the decision-making process. Interestingly, while
both models produced accurate results, Grad-CAM showed that DenseNet121
consistently focused on core pathological regions, whereas ResNet50 sometimes
scattered attention to peripheral or non-pathological areas. Combining deep
learning and explainable AI offers a promising path toward reliable,
interpretable, and clinically useful diagnostic tools.

*Mojtaba Moattari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper improves chromosome classification precision for low-quality images using reliability thresholding metrics and engineered features, achieving over 90% accuracy for chromosomes with common defects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current karyotyping systems require high-quality training data which is unavailable in some pathological labs, leading to false positives in low-cost systems with poor image quality.

Method: Proposed reliability thresholding metrics and engineered features, evaluated using Alex-Net neural network, SVM, KNN, and cascade pipelines for automated filtering of semi-straight chromosomes.

Result: Classification accuracy improved over 90% for chromosomes with common defects and translocations, with comparative analysis identifying the best thresholding metric.

Conclusion: The method is suitable for karyotyping facilities in poor countries and low-budget labs, verified by high precision results on low-quality G-banding database.

Abstract: In the last decade, due to high resolution cameras and accurate meta-phase
analyzes, the accuracy of chromosome classification has improved substantially.
However, current Karyotyping systems demand large number of high quality train
data to have an adequately plausible Precision per each chromosome. Such
provision of high quality train data with accurate devices are not yet
accomplished in some out-reached pathological laboratories. To prevent false
positive detections in low-cost systems and low-quality images settings, this
paper improves the classification Precision of chromosomes using proposed
reliability thresholding metrics and deliberately engineered features. The
proposed method has been evaluated using a variation of deep Alex-Net neural
network, SVM, K Nearest-Neighbors, and their cascade pipelines to an automated
filtering of semi-straight chromosome. The classification results have highly
improved over 90% for the chromosomes with more common defections and
translocations. Furthermore, a comparative analysis over the proposed
thresholding metrics has been conducted and the best metric is bolded with its
salient characteristics. The high Precision results provided for a very
low-quality G-banding database verifies suitability of the proposed metrics and
pruning method for Karyotyping facilities in poor countries and lowbudget
pathological laboratories.

### [34] [Structured and Abstractive Reasoning on Multi-modal Relational Knowledge Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21828)
*Yichi Zhang,Zhuo Chen,Lingbing Guo,Lei Liang,Wen Zhang,Huajun Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of abstractive reasoning in multi-modal large language models by introducing a framework for Multi-Modal Relational Knowledge (MMRK) and STructured and Abstractive Reasoning (STAR).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs struggle with understanding and reasoning about abstract relational structures in visual data, particularly Multi-Modal Relational Knowledge represented in node-edge formats, which remains largely unexplored.

Method: The paper introduces: (1) an automatic STAR data engine that synthesizes images with MMRK to create multi-modal instruction data with chain-of-thought thinking, and (2) a comprehensive two-stage capability enhancement training framework with tailored evaluation protocols for STAR tasks.

Result: The authors created STAR-64K dataset with 64K high-quality multi-modal instruction samples. Experiments across 5 open-source MLLMs show their two-stage framework enables smaller 3B/7B models to significantly outperform GPT-4o in STAR tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively bridges gaps in data and methodology for abstractive multi-modal reasoning, demonstrating that smaller models can achieve superior performance in structured abstractive reasoning tasks through proper training and data synthesis.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning with abstractive information from the visual
modality presents significant challenges for current multi-modal large language
models (MLLMs). Among the various forms of abstractive information, Multi-Modal
Relational Knowledge (MMRK), which represents abstract relational structures
between multi-modal entities using node-edge formats, remains largely
under-explored. In particular, STructured and Abstractive Reasoning (STAR) on
such data has received little attention from the research community. To bridge
the dual gaps in large-scale high-quality data and capability enhancement
methodologies, this paper makes the following key contributions: (i). An
automatic STAR data engine capable of synthesizing images with MMRK to build
multi-modal instruction data with reliable chain-of-thought thinking for
various STAR tasks and (ii). A comprehsive two-stage capability enhancement
training framework, accompanied by a suite of evaluation protocols tailored to
different STAR tasks. Based upon these contributions, we introduce STAR-64K, a
dataset comprising 64K high-quality multi-modal instruction samples, and
conduct experiments across 5 open-source MLLMs. Experimental results show that
our two-stage enhancement framework enables smaller 3B/7B models to
significantly outperform GPT-4o in STAR. Additionally, we provide in-depth
analysis regarding the effectiveness of various designs, data transferability,
and scalability.

### [35] [A Flow Model with Low-Rank Transformers for Incomplete Multimodal Survival Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21829)
*Yi Yin,Yuntao Shou,Zao Dai,Yun Peng,Tao Meng,Wei Ai,Keqin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework combining low-rank Transformer with flow-based generative model for robust multimodal survival prediction that handles incomplete medical data modalities through cross-modal distribution alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world multimodal medical datasets often have incomplete modalities due to acquisition limitations, and existing methods ignore distributional discrepancies across modalities, leading to unreliable reconstruction.

Method: Uses class-specific flow for cross-modal distribution alignment, normalizing flow models for distribution-consistent latent space construction, and lightweight low-rank Transformer for intra-modal dependency modeling to prevent overfitting.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in complete modality settings and maintains robust accuracy under incomplete modality scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses incomplete multimodal survival analysis by ensuring distribution consistency in modality reconstruction and demonstrates superior performance across various modality conditions.

Abstract: In recent years, multimodal medical data-based survival analysis has
attracted much attention. However, real-world datasets often suffer from the
problem of incomplete modality, where some patient modality information is
missing due to acquisition limitations or system failures. Existing methods
typically infer missing modalities directly from observed ones using deep
neural networks, but they often ignore the distributional discrepancy across
modalities, resulting in inconsistent and unreliable modality reconstruction.
To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that combines a
low-rank Transformer with a flow-based generative model for robust and flexible
multimodal survival prediction. Specifically, we first formulate the concerned
problem as incomplete multimodal survival analysis using the multi-instance
representation of whole slide images (WSIs) and genomic profiles. To realize
incomplete multimodal survival analysis, we propose a class-specific flow for
cross-modal distribution alignment. Under the condition of class labels, we
model and transform the cross-modal distribution. By virtue of the reversible
structure and accurate density modeling capabilities of the normalizing flow
model, the model can effectively construct a distribution-consistent latent
space of the missing modality, thereby improving the consistency between the
reconstructed data and the true distribution. Finally, we design a lightweight
Transformer architecture to model intra-modal dependencies while alleviating
the overfitting problem in high-dimensional modality fusion by virtue of the
low-rank Transformer. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our method
not only achieves state-of-the-art performance under complete modality
settings, but also maintains robust and superior accuracy under the incomplete
modalities scenario.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated image-based garbage classification is critical for global waste management, but systematic benchmarks integrating ML, DL, and hybrid solutions remain underdeveloped.

Method: Comprehensive comparison of three paradigms: (1) ML with handcrafted features, (2) DL architectures (ResNet variants, EfficientNetV2S), and (3) hybrid approach using deep models for feature extraction combined with classical classifiers (SVM, Logistic Regression).

Result: Hybrid method consistently outperforms others, achieving up to 100% accuracy on TrashNet and refined Household dataset, and 99.87% on Garbage Classification dataset, surpassing state-of-the-art benchmarks. Feature selection reduces dimensionality by over 95% without compromising accuracy.

Conclusion: This work establishes reliable benchmarks for waste classification and introduces an efficient hybrid framework that achieves high accuracy while reducing inference cost, making it suitable for scalable deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Automated image-based garbage classification is a critical component of
global waste management; however, systematic benchmarks that integrate Machine

a hybrid approach that utilizes deep models for feature extraction combined
with classical classifiers such as Support Vector Machine and Logistic
Regression to identify the most effective strategy. Experiments on three public

Dataset (with 43 corrected mislabels)- demonstrate that the hybrid method
consistently outperforms the others, achieving up to 100% accuracy on TrashNet

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPT-4o was tested for zero-shot classification of chest X-rays as NORMAL or PNEUMONIA, achieving 74% accuracy with concise prompts but lower performance with reasoning-based prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the emerging potential of large language models like GPT-4o for medical image interpretation without fine-tuning, assessing their readiness for clinical applications.

Method: Used a balanced test set of 400 chest X-ray images (200 per class) and tested four different prompt designs ranging from minimal instructions to detailed reasoning-based prompts in a zero-shot setting.

Result: Concise, feature-focused prompts achieved the highest classification accuracy of 74%, while reasoning-oriented prompts resulted in lower performance, indicating limited diagnostic reliability.

Conclusion: While GPT-4o shows emerging potential for medical image interpretation, its diagnostic reliability remains limited and requires further advances in visual reasoning and domain-specific adaptation before safe clinical application.

Abstract: In this study, we evaluate the ability of OpenAI's gpt-4o model to classify
chest X-ray images as either NORMAL or PNEUMONIA in a zero-shot setting,
without any prior fine-tuning. A balanced test set of 400 images (200 from each
class) was used to assess performance across four distinct prompt designs,
ranging from minimal instructions to detailed, reasoning-based prompts. The
results indicate that concise, feature-focused prompts achieved the highest
classification accuracy of 74\%, whereas reasoning-oriented prompts resulted in
lower performance. These findings highlight that while ChatGPT exhibits
emerging potential for medical image interpretation, its diagnostic reliability
remains limited. Continued advances in visual reasoning and domain-specific
adaptation are required before such models can be safely applied in clinical
practice.

TL;DR: The winning entry of PhysicsIQ Challenge uses SSL-based video world models (VJEPA-2) to guide MAGI-1 video generation, improving physics plausibility by ~6%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art video generative models lack physical understanding despite visual realism, and SSL pretraining has shown to enable intuitive physics understanding.

Method: Couple MAGI-1 video generative model with VJEPA-2 using it as reward signal to guide the generation process.

Result: Improved physics plausibility of state-of-the-art video generative models by approximately 6%.

Conclusion: SSL-based video world models can effectively enhance the physics plausibility of video generation systems.

Abstract: This is a short technical report describing the winning entry of the
PhysicsIQ Challenge, presented at the Perception Test Workshop at ICCV 2025.
State-of-the-art video generative models exhibit severely limited physical
understanding, and often produce implausible videos. The Physics IQ benchmark
has shown that visual realism does not imply physics understanding. Yet,
intuitive physics understanding has shown to emerge from SSL pretraining on
natural videos. In this report, we investigate whether we can leverage
SSL-based video world models to improve the physics plausibility of video
generative models. In particular, we build ontop of the state-of-the-art video
generative model MAGI-1 and couple it with the recently introduced Video Joint
Embedding Predictive Architecture 2 (VJEPA-2) to guide the generation process.
We show that by leveraging VJEPA-2 as reward signal, we can improve the physics
plausibility of state-of-the-art video generative models by ~6%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RatioWaveNet enhances motor imagery EEG decoding by adding a trainable wavelet front end to a CNN-Transformer backbone, improving robustness especially for challenging subjects while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable decoding from non-invasive EEG remains challenging due to nonstationarity, low SNR, and subject variability. The goal is to improve robustness where BCIs typically fail - on the hardest subjects.

Method: Augments TCFormer (temporal CNN-Transformer backbone) with Rationally-Dilated Wavelet Transform front end that performs undecimated multi-resolution subband decomposition, followed by grouped 1-D convolutions, multi-kernel CNN, grouped-query attention encoder, and compact TCN head.

Result: On BCI-IV-2a and BCI-IV-2b datasets, improves worst-subject accuracy by +0.17/+0.42 pp (Sub-Dependent/LOSO) on 2a and +1.07/+2.54 pp on 2b, with consistent average-case gains and modest computational overhead.

Conclusion: A simple, trainable wavelet front end effectively strengthens Transformer-based BCIs, improving worst-case reliability without sacrificing efficiency.

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) based on motor imagery (MI) translate covert
movement intentions into actionable commands, yet reliable decoding from
non-invasive EEG remains challenging due to nonstationarity, low SNR, and
subject variability. We present RatioWaveNet, which augments a strong temporal
CNN-Transformer backbone (TCFormer) with a trainable, Rationally-Dilated
Wavelet Transform (RDWT) front end. The RDWT performs an undecimated,
multi-resolution subband decomposition that preserves temporal length and
shift-invariance, enhancing sensorimotor rhythms while mitigating jitter and
mild artifacts; subbands are fused via lightweight grouped 1-D convolutions and
passed to a multi-kernel CNN for local temporal-spatial feature extraction, a
grouped-query attention encoder for long-range context, and a compact TCN head
for causal temporal integration.
  Our goal is to test whether this principled wavelet front end improves
robustness precisely where BCIs typically fail - on the hardest subjects - and
whether such gains persist on average across seeds under both intra- and
inter-subject protocols. On BCI-IV-2a and BCI-IV-2b, across five seeds,
RatioWaveNet improves worst-subject accuracy over the Transformer backbone by
+0.17 / +0.42 percentage points (Sub-Dependent / LOSO) on 2a and by +1.07 /
+2.54 percentage points on 2b, with consistent average-case gains and modest
computational overhead. These results indicate that a simple, trainable wavelet
front end is an effective plug-in to strengthen Transformer-based BCIs,
improving worst-case reliability without sacrificing efficiency.

*Michael Aerni,Joshua Swanson,Kristina Nikoliƒá,Florian Tram√®r*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Modal aphasia is a systematic dissociation in multimodal models where they accurately memorize concepts visually but fail to articulate them in text, creating safety vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify and study a fundamental limitation in current unified multimodal models where they exhibit inconsistent performance across modalities despite being trained on both images and text simultaneously.

Method: Conducted controlled experiments on synthetic datasets using multiple architectures, tested leading frontier models' ability to reproduce movie artwork vs. provide textual descriptions, and demonstrated safety vulnerabilities through modality-specific alignment.

Result: Models can generate near-perfect visual reproductions of concepts but confuse crucial details in textual descriptions, and text-only alignment fails to prevent unsafe image generation.

Conclusion: Modal aphasia is a fundamental property of current unified multimodal models that creates significant safety vulnerabilities, as safeguards in one modality don't transfer to others.

Abstract: We present modal aphasia, a systematic dissociation in which current unified
multimodal models accurately memorize concepts visually but fail to articulate
them in writing, despite being trained on images and text simultaneously. For
one, we show that leading frontier models can generate near-perfect
reproductions of iconic movie artwork, but confuse crucial details when asked
for textual descriptions. We corroborate those findings through controlled
experiments on synthetic datasets in multiple architectures. Our experiments
confirm that modal aphasia reliably emerges as a fundamental property of
current unified multimodal models, not just as a training artifact. In
practice, modal aphasia can introduce vulnerabilities in AI safety frameworks,
as safeguards applied to one modality may leave harmful concepts accessible in
other modalities. We demonstrate this risk by showing how a model aligned
solely on text remains capable of generating unsafe images.

TL;DR: SCoPE VLM is a document navigation expert that uses Chain of Scroll mechanism for selective document navigation, reducing memory usage and modeling human-like reading behaviors for multimodal agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models struggle with long-context visual information in agentic tasks like GUI control and web navigation, neglecting decision-oriented document understanding and being memory-intensive for local deployment.

Method: Proposes Chain of Scroll mechanism for selective and recursive document navigation, dedicated data generation pipeline for Chain of Scroll trajectories, and Episodic Group Relative Policy Optimization reinforcement learning method.

Result: Substantially reduces memory usage and effectively models human-like reading behaviors in multi-page document question answering.

Conclusion: SCoPE VLM is the first framework to explicitly model agentic reading patterns in multi-page document question answering, advancing multimodal agent capabilities.

Abstract: Understanding long-context visual information remains a fundamental challenge
for vision-language models, particularly in agentic tasks such as GUI control
and web navigation. While web pages and GUI environments are inherently
structured documents, current VLMs typically neglect decision-oriented document
understanding in their training objectives. Existing approaches primarily
extend visual embeddings to process long, high-resolution inputs, but these
methods are memory-intensive and impractical for locally deployable solutions.
To address these issues, we propose SCoPE VLM, a document navigation expert
that leverages a novel Chain of Scroll mechanism to selectively and recursively
navigate documents, focusing exclusively on relevant segments. We introduce a
dedicated data generation pipeline to construct informative Chain of Scroll
trajectories and Episodic Group Relative Policy Optimization, a tailored
reinforcement learning method to reduce the gap between training and inference.
Our method substantially reduces memory usage and effectively models human-like
reading behaviors. To the best of our knowledge, SCoPE VLM is the first
framework to explicitly model agentic reading patterns in multi-page document
question answering, advancing the capabilities of multimodal agents.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PFCT enables training Poisson Flow Consistency Models without distillation, using perturbation kernels and new scheduling/noise techniques for improved CT image denoising performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PFCM was limited to distillation training, restricting its potential across data modalities. The research aimed to develop an isolated training method for PFCM.

Method: Leveraged perturbation kernel to remove dependency on pretrained PFGM++, introduced sinusoidal discretization schedule and Beta noise distribution for adaptability and sample quality improvement.

Result: Applied to low dose CT image denoising, improved LPIPS and SSIM metrics, showed similar denoising effectiveness as Consistency Model, achieved competitive results to other generative models.

Conclusion: PFCT is a valid training method for PFCM with demonstrated effectiveness in CT denoising, creating more flexibility for PFCM applications in generative modeling.

Abstract: The Poisson Flow Consistency Model (PFCM) is a consistency-style model based
on the robust Poisson Flow Generative Model++ (PFGM++) which has achieved
success in unconditional image generation and CT image denoising. Yet the PFCM
can only be trained in distillation which limits the potential of the PFCM in
many data modalities. The objective of this research was to create a method to
train the PFCM in isolation called Poisson Flow Consistency Training (PFCT).
The perturbation kernel was leveraged to remove the pretrained PFGM++, and the
sinusoidal discretization schedule and Beta noise distribution were introduced
in order to facilitate adaptability and improve sample quality. The model was
applied to the task of low dose computed tomography image denoising and
improved the low dose image in terms of LPIPS and SSIM. It also displayed
similar denoising effectiveness as models like the Consistency Model. PFCT is
established as a valid method of training the PFCM from its effectiveness in
denoising CT images, showing potential with competitive results to other
generative models. Further study is needed in the precise optimization of PFCT
and in its applicability to other generative modeling tasks. The framework of
PFCT creates more flexibility for the ways in which a PFCM can be created and
can be applied to the field of generative modeling.

TL;DR: A three-stage hybrid framework using YOLOv11 models for layout segmentation and annotation detection, combined with Donut-based vision language models for semantic parsing of engineering drawings, achieving high performance in automated interpretation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual interpretation of complex multi-view engineering drawings with dense annotations is challenging due to varied layouts, orientations, and mixed symbolic-textual content, requiring automated solutions.

Method: Three-stage framework: 1) YOLOv11-det for layout segmentation, 2) YOLOv11-obb for orientation-aware annotation detection, 3) Two Donut-based VLMs for semantic parsing (Alphabetical VLM for text/categorical data, Numerical VLM for quantitative data).

Result: Alphabetical VLM achieved F1 score of 0.672, Numerical VLM achieved 0.963 F1 score. Two specialized datasets used: 1,000 drawings for layout detection and 1,406 for annotation-level training.

Conclusion: The framework provides scalable automated interpretation of engineering drawings with unified JSON output for seamless integration with CAD and manufacturing systems.

Abstract: Engineering drawings are fundamental to manufacturing communication, serving
as the primary medium for conveying design intent, tolerances, and production
details. However, interpreting complex multi-view drawings with dense
annotations remains challenging using manual methods, generic optical character
recognition (OCR) systems, or traditional deep learning approaches, due to
varied layouts, orientations, and mixed symbolic-textual content. To address
these challenges, this paper proposes a three-stage hybrid framework for the
automated interpretation of 2D multi-view engineering drawings using modern
detection and vision language models (VLMs). In the first stage, YOLOv11-det
performs layout segmentation to localize key regions such as views, title
blocks, and notes. The second stage uses YOLOv11-obb for orientation-aware,
fine-grained detection of annotations, including measures, GD&T symbols, and
surface roughness indicators. The third stage employs two Donut-based, OCR-free
VLMs for semantic content parsing: the Alphabetical VLM extracts textual and
categorical information from title blocks and notes, while the Numerical VLM
interprets quantitative data such as measures, GD&T frames, and surface
roughness. Two specialized datasets were developed to ensure robustness and
generalization: 1,000 drawings for layout detection and 1,406 for
annotation-level training. The Alphabetical VLM achieved an overall F1 score of
0.672, while the Numerical VLM reached 0.963, demonstrating strong performance
in textual and quantitative interpretation, respectively. The unified JSON
output enables seamless integration with CAD and manufacturing databases,
providing a scalable solution for intelligent engineering drawing analysis.

*Xin Lu,Chuanqing Zhuang,Chenxi Jin,Zhengda Lu,Yiqun Wang,Wu Liu,Jun Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LSF-Animation is a speech-driven 3D facial animation framework that implicitly extracts emotion from speech and identity from neutral facial meshes, eliminating the need for explicit emotion/identity labels and improving generalization to unseen speakers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing emotion-aware animation methods rely on explicit one-hot encodings for identity and emotion, which limits generalization to unseen speakers and neglects emotional cues in speech, reducing naturalness.

Method: Proposes LSF-Animation framework that implicitly extracts emotion from speech and identity from neutral facial mesh, and introduces Hierarchical Interaction Fusion Block (HIFB) to integrate emotional, motion, and identity cues using fusion tokens.

Result: Extensive experiments on 3DMEAD dataset show the method surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in emotional expressiveness, identity generalization, and animation realism.

Conclusion: LSF-Animation provides a more natural and adaptable approach to speech-driven 3D facial animation by eliminating explicit label dependencies and better leveraging inherent speech cues.

Abstract: Speech-driven 3D facial animation has attracted increasing interest since its
potential to generate expressive and temporally synchronized digital humans.
While recent works have begun to explore emotion-aware animation, they still
depend on explicit one-hot encodings to represent identity and emotion with
given emotion and identity labels, which limits their ability to generalize to
unseen speakers. Moreover, the emotional cues inherently present in speech are
often neglected, limiting the naturalness and adaptability of generated
animations. In this work, we propose LSF-Animation, a novel framework that
eliminates the reliance on explicit emotion and identity feature
representations. Specifically, LSF-Animation implicitly extracts emotion
information from speech and captures the identity features from a neutral
facial mesh, enabling improved generalization to unseen speakers and emotional
states without requiring manual labels. Furthermore, we introduce a
Hierarchical Interaction Fusion Block (HIFB), which employs a fusion token to
integrate dual transformer features and more effectively integrate emotional,
motion-related and identity-related cues. Extensive experiments conducted on
the 3DMEAD dataset demonstrate that our method surpasses recent
state-of-the-art approaches in terms of emotional expressiveness, identity
generalization, and animation realism. The source code will be released at:

*Haicheng Liao,Bonan Wang,Junxian Yang,Chengyue Wang,Zhengbin He,Guohui Zhang,Chengzhong Xu,Zhenning Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WM-MoE is a world model-based motion forecasting framework that addresses corner-case scenarios in autonomous driving by unifying perception, memory, and decision making, leveraging LLMs for temporal reasoning and MoE for scenario decomposition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion forecasting models underperform in safety-critical corner cases due to over-representation of common scenes in training data and limited generalization capabilities, which poses risks for autonomous vehicle deployment.

Method: The framework constructs compact scene representations, uses LLMs with temporal tokenizers for long-horizon reasoning, employs mixture-of-experts to decompose corner cases into subproblems, and uses specialized experts for intent inference and counterfactual rollouts.

Result: Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets show WM-MoE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and remains robust under corner-case and data-missing conditions.

Conclusion: World model-based architectures like WM-MoE show promise for robust and generalizable motion forecasting in autonomous vehicles, particularly for handling challenging corner-case scenarios.

Abstract: Accurate and reliable motion forecasting is essential for the safe deployment
of autonomous vehicles (AVs), particularly in rare but safety-critical
scenarios known as corner cases. Existing models often underperform in these
situations due to an over-representation of common scenes in training data and
limited generalization capabilities. To address this limitation, we present
WM-MoE, the first world model-based motion forecasting framework that unifies
perception, temporal memory, and decision making to address the challenges of
high-risk corner-case scenarios. The model constructs a compact scene
representation that explains current observations, anticipates future dynamics,
and evaluates the outcomes of potential actions. To enhance long-horizon
reasoning, we leverage large language models (LLMs) and introduce a lightweight
temporal tokenizer that maps agent trajectories and contextual cues into the
LLM's feature space without additional training, enriching temporal context and
commonsense priors. Furthermore, a mixture-of-experts (MoE) is introduced to
decompose complex corner cases into subproblems and allocate capacity across
scenario types, and a router assigns scenes to specialized experts that infer
agent intent and perform counterfactual rollouts. In addition, we introduce
nuScenes-corner, a new benchmark that comprises four real-world corner-case
scenarios for rigorous evaluation. Extensive experiments on four benchmark
datasets (nuScenes, NGSIM, HighD, and MoCAD) showcase that WM-MoE consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines and remains robust under
corner-case and data-missing conditions, indicating the promise of world
model-based architectures for robust and generalizable motion forecasting in
fully AVs.

Abstract: Accurate assessment of urban canopy coverage is crucial for informed urban
planning, effective environmental monitoring, and mitigating the impacts of
climate change. Traditional practices often face limitations due to inadequate
technical requirements, difficulties in scaling and data processing, and the
lack of specialized expertise. This study presents an efficient approach for
estimating green canopy coverage using artificial intelligence, specifically
computer vision techniques, applied to aerial imageries. Our proposed
methodology utilizes object-based image analysis, based on deep learning
algorithms to accurately identify and segment green canopies from
high-resolution drone images. This approach allows the user for detailed
analysis of urban vegetation, capturing variations in canopy density and
understanding spatial distribution. To overcome the computational challenges
associated with processing large datasets, it was implemented over a cloud
platform utilizing high-performance processors. This infrastructure efficiently
manages space complexity and ensures affordable latency, enabling the rapid
analysis of vast amounts of drone imageries. Our results demonstrate the
effectiveness of this approach in accurately estimating canopy coverage at the
city scale, providing valuable insights for urban forestry management of an
industrial township. The resultant data generated by this method can be used to
optimize tree plantation and assess the carbon sequestration potential of urban
forests. By integrating these insights into sustainable urban planning, we can
foster more resilient urban environments, contributing to a greener and
healthier future.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed an increasing interest in image-text contrastive
modeling, exemplified by models such as Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining
(CLIP). In this paper, we propose the TernaryCLIP, a lightweight computational
framework that converts connection weights of both vision and text encoders of
CLIP into the ternary format, instead of full-precision or floating ones.

highlights the feasibility of extreme quantization for large multimodal models,
supporting effective and efficient deployment on resource-constrained devices.

### [49] [Sprint: Sparse-Dense Residual Fusion for Efficient Diffusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21986)
*Dogyun Park,Moayed Haji-Ali,Yanyu Li,Willi Menapace,Sergey Tulyakov,Hyunwoo J. Kim,Aliaksandr Siarohin,Anil Kag*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPRINT enables aggressive token dropping (up to 75%) in Diffusion Transformers while preserving quality through sparse-dense residual fusion and two-stage training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Transformers have quadratic training costs that make large-scale pretraining expensive, and existing token dropping methods either degrade quality or are parameter-heavy.

Method: SPRINT uses shallow layers for all tokens (dense) and deeper layers for sparse subsets, with residual fusion. Two-stage training: masked pre-training for efficiency followed by full-token fine-tuning.

Result: Achieves 9.8x training savings on ImageNet-1K 256x256 with comparable FID/FDD. Inference Path-Drop Guidance nearly halves FLOPs while improving quality.

Conclusion: SPRINT is a simple, effective, and general solution for efficient DiT training that enables aggressive token dropping without quality degradation.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) deliver state-of-the-art generative performance
but their quadratic training cost with sequence length makes large-scale
pretraining prohibitively expensive. Token dropping can reduce training cost,
yet na\"ive strategies degrade representations, and existing methods are either
parameter-heavy or fail at high drop ratios. We present SPRINT, Sparse--Dense
Residual Fusion for Efficient Diffusion Transformers, a simple method that
enables aggressive token dropping (up to 75%) while preserving quality. SPRINT
leverages the complementary roles of shallow and deep layers: early layers
process all tokens to capture local detail, deeper layers operate on a sparse
subset to cut computation, and their outputs are fused through residual
connections. Training follows a two-stage schedule: long masked pre-training
for efficiency followed by short full-token fine-tuning to close the
train--inference gap. On ImageNet-1K 256x256, SPRINT achieves 9.8x training
savings with comparable FID/FDD, and at inference, its Path-Drop Guidance (PDG)
nearly halves FLOPs while improving quality. These results establish SPRINT as
a simple, effective, and general solution for efficient DiT training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Lite-Diff is a lightweight diffusion model adaptation method that uses residual adapter modules, latent morphological autoencoder, and pixel-level discriminator to efficiently fine-tune diffusion models for specialized domains like medical imaging with minimal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning diffusion models for specialized domains is challenging due to limited domain-specific data and high computational costs of full model adaptation.

Method: Integrates lightweight adaptation layers into frozen diffusion U-Net, uses latent morphological autoencoder for domain-specific latent consistency, and pixel-level discriminator for adversarial alignment. Freezes base model weights and optimizes only small residual adapter modules.

Result: Achieves superior adaptation efficiency compared to naive full fine-tuning on three chest X-ray datasets (Kaggle Chest X-Ray Pneumonia, NIH Chest X-ray14, and VinBigData Chest X-ray).

Conclusion: Provides a promising direction for transfer learning in diffusion models, facilitating deployment in diverse low-data domains with reduced computational overhead and mitigated overfitting.

Abstract: In recent years, diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in
high-fidelity image synthesis. However, fine-tuning these models for
specialized domains, such as medical imaging, remains challenging due to
limited domain-specific data and the high computational cost of full model
adaptation. In this paper, we introduce Lite-Diff (Lightweight Diffusion Model
Adaptation), a novel finetuning approach that integrates lightweight adaptation
layers into a frozen diffusion U-Net while enhancing training with a latent
morphological autoencoder (for domain-specific latent consistency) and a pixel
level discriminator(for adversarial alignment). By freezing weights of the base
model and optimizing only small residual adapter modules, LiteDiff
significantly reduces the computational overhead and mitigates overfitting,
even in minimal-data settings. Additionally, we conduct ablation studies to
analyze the effects of selectively integrating adaptation layers in different
U-Net blocks, revealing an optimal balance between efficiency and performance.
Experiments on three chest X-ray datasets - (1) Kaggle Chest X-Ray Pneumonia,
(2) NIH Chest X-ray14 and (3) VinBigData Chest X_ray demonstrate that LiteDiff
achieves superior adaptation efficiency compared to naive full fine-tuning. Our
framework provides a promising direction for transfer learning in diffusion
models, facilitating their deployment in diverse low data domains.

*Or Ronai,Vladimir Kulikov,Tomer Michaeli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlowOpt is a zero-order optimization framework for diffusion and flow-matching models that treats the entire sampling process as a black box, enabling efficient optimization without backpropagation while maintaining state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for controlled generation in diffusion models are computationally impractical due to iterative sampling processes, requiring separate manipulation of each timestep rather than optimizing the entire process.

Method: FlowOpt uses zero-order (gradient-free) optimization to treat the entire flow process as a black box, allowing optimization through the whole sampling path without backpropagation through the model. It includes theoretical guarantees for convergence with proper step-size selection.

Result: FlowOpt achieves state-of-the-art results for image editing tasks (inversion and direct steering) while using roughly the same number of neural function evaluations (NFEs) as existing methods. It enables monitoring of intermediate optimization results and early stopping.

Conclusion: FlowOpt provides an efficient and effective optimization framework for diffusion models that bypasses the computational limitations of gradient-based methods while maintaining competitive performance and offering practical advantages like monitoring and early stopping.

Abstract: The remarkable success of diffusion and flow-matching models has ignited a
surge of works on adapting them at test time for controlled generation tasks.
Examples range from image editing to restoration, compression and
personalization. However, due to the iterative nature of the sampling process
in those models, it is computationally impractical to use gradient-based
optimization to directly control the image generated at the end of the process.
As a result, existing methods typically resort to manipulating each timestep
separately. Here we introduce FlowOpt - a zero-order (gradient-free)
optimization framework that treats the entire flow process as a black box,
enabling optimization through the whole sampling path without backpropagation
through the model. Our method is both highly efficient and allows users to
monitor the intermediate optimization results and perform early stopping if
desired. We prove a sufficient condition on FlowOpt's step-size, under which
convergence to the global optimum is guaranteed. We further show how to
empirically estimate this upper bound so as to choose an appropriate step-size.
We demonstrate how FlowOpt can be used for image editing, showcasing two
options: (i) inversion (determining the initial noise that generates a given
image), and (ii) directly steering the edited image to be similar to the source
image while conforming to a target text prompt. In both cases, FlowOpt achieves
state-of-the-art results while using roughly the same number of neural function
evaluations (NFEs) as existing methods. Code and examples are available on the
project's webpage.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a caption-based XAI method that integrates standalone ML models into CLIP using network surgery to identify dominant concepts in predictions, improving robustness against covariate shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current saliency map XAI methods can be misleading when spurious and salient features overlap in pixel space, creating robustness problems in ML models.

Method: Integrates standalone models into CLIP using novel network surgery approach to create caption-based explanations that identify dominant concepts in predictions.

Result: The proposed method minimizes the risk of models falling for covariate shifts by providing concept-based explanations rather than pixel-based saliency maps.

Conclusion: Caption-based XAI using CLIP integration through network surgery significantly contributes to developing more robust machine learning models.

Abstract: Robustness has become one of the most critical problems in machine learning
(ML). The science of interpreting ML models to understand their behavior and
improve their robustness is referred to as explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI). One of the state-of-the-art XAI methods for computer vision problems is
to generate saliency maps. A saliency map highlights the pixel space of an
image that excites the ML model the most. However, this property could be
misleading if spurious and salient features are present in overlapping pixel
spaces. In this paper, we propose a caption-based XAI method, which integrates
a standalone model to be explained into the contrastive language-image
pre-training (CLIP) model using a novel network surgery approach. The resulting
caption-based XAI model identifies the dominant concept that contributes the
most to the models prediction. This explanation minimizes the risk of the
standalone model falling for a covariate shift and contributes significantly
towards developing robust ML models.

TL;DR: VLM-SlideEval framework evaluates vision-language models on slide understanding across element extraction, robustness to perturbations, and narrative comprehension, revealing current VLMs' limitations for slide evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models are increasingly used to evaluate multimodal content like presentation slides, but their slide-specific understanding capabilities remain underexplored despite their growing role in agentic pipelines.

Method: VLM-SlideEval framework probes VLMs along three axes: element-level extraction from slide images, robustness to controlled perturbations in geometry/style/text, and higher-level comprehension including narrative order recovery from shuffled slides. Uses standardized ground-truth from PowerPoint XML and live renderings.

Result: VLMs underperform on pixel-accurate extraction, show non-trivial agreement/fidelity/consistency under perturbations, perform better on single-slide content understanding, but do not reliably capture narrative structure across slides.

Conclusion: Current VLMs have limitations for slide evaluation, motivating calibrated, critic-in-the-loop evaluators for iterative refinement in agentic pipelines.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate multimodal
content, including presentation slides, yet their slide-specific understanding
remains underexplored {despite their growing role as critics in agentic,
model-forward pipelines}. We introduce VLM-SlideEval, an evaluation framework
that probes VLMs along three axes: (1) element-level extraction from slide
images aligned to ground truth; (2) robustness to controlled perturbations in
geometry, style, and text; and (3) higher-level comprehension, such as
recovering a deck's narrative order from shuffled slides. Using publicly
available decks from Zenodo
(https://huggingface.co/datasets/Forceless/Zenodo10K/viewer/default/pptx), we
standardize ground-truth element metadata from PowerPoint XML and live
renderings into a unified, verifiable schema. Empirically, VLMs underperform on
pixel-accurate extraction and show non-trivial agreement, fidelity, and
consistency under controlled perturbations, while performing better on
single-slide content understanding; however, they do not reliably capture
narrative structure across slides. These results highlight the limits of
current VLMs for slide evaluation and motivate calibrated, critic-in-the-loop
evaluators that drive iterative refinement and selection in agentic pipelines.

TL;DR: A robust deep learning framework for multi-class anomaly detection in surveillance videos using human-centric preprocessing and spatio-temporal modeling, achieving 92.41% accuracy on UCF-Crime dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in surveillance video anomaly detection including diversity of abnormal events, class imbalance, and scene-dependent visual clutter.

Method: Human-centric preprocessing with YOLO-World for human detection and ByteTrack for tracking, background suppression via Gaussian blurring, spatial feature extraction with InceptionV3, and temporal modeling with BiLSTM.

Result: Achieved 92.41% mean test accuracy on five-class UCF-Crime subset with per-class F1-scores consistently exceeding 0.85, demonstrating strong generalization and resilience to class imbalance.

Conclusion: Foreground-focused preprocessing significantly enhances anomaly discrimination in real-world surveillance scenarios.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in surveillance videos remains a challenging task due to
the diversity of abnormal events, class imbalance, and scene-dependent visual
clutter. To address these issues, we propose a robust deep learning framework
that integrates human-centric preprocessing with spatio-temporal modeling for
multi-class anomaly classification. Our pipeline begins by applying YOLO-World
- an open-vocabulary vision-language detector - to identify human instances in
raw video clips, followed by ByteTrack for consistent identity-aware tracking.
Background regions outside detected bounding boxes are suppressed via Gaussian
blurring, effectively reducing scene-specific distractions and focusing the
model on behaviorally relevant foreground content. The refined frames are then
processed by an ImageNet-pretrained InceptionV3 network for spatial feature
extraction, and temporal dynamics are captured using a bidirectional LSTM
(BiLSTM) for sequence-level classification. Evaluated on a five-class subset of
the UCF-Crime dataset (Normal, Burglary, Fighting, Arson, Explosion), our
method achieves a mean test accuracy of 92.41% across three independent trials,
with per-class F1-scores consistently exceeding 0.85. Comprehensive evaluation
metrics - including confusion matrices, ROC curves, and macro/weighted averages
- demonstrate strong generalization and resilience to class imbalance. The
results confirm that foreground-focused preprocessing significantly enhances
anomaly discrimination in real-world surveillance scenarios.

*Zheng Qi,Chao Shang,Evangelia Spiliopoulou,Nikolaos Pappas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GIFT is a method that reduces hallucination in vision language models by tracking gaze shifts to identify salient visual regions and balancing cross-modal attention between visual inputs and user queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs often generate hallucinated content due to over-reliance on linguistic priors and visual attention sink problems where attention is misallocated to irrelevant visual regions, while existing methods fail to properly balance cross-modal fusion.

Method: GIFT pre-computes a holistic visual saliency map by tracking positive changes in visual attention (gaze shifts) during query comprehension, then amplifies attention to both salient visual information and user queries at each decoding step.

Result: GIFT achieves up to 20.7% improvement over greedy decoding in reducing hallucination across both generative and classification tasks, while maintaining general vision-language performance with low computational overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed GIFT method effectively addresses visual attention sink and cross-modal fusion imbalance, significantly reducing hallucination in VLMs without compromising overall performance.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) often generate hallucination, i.e., content
that cannot be substantiated by either textual or visual inputs. Prior work
primarily attributes this to over-reliance on linguistic prior knowledge rather
than visual inputs. Some methods attempt to mitigate hallucination by
amplifying visual token attention proportionally to their attention scores.
However, these methods overlook the visual attention sink problem, where
attention is frequently misallocated to task-irrelevant visual regions, and
neglect cross-modal fusion balance by enhancing only visual attention without
adjusting attention to the user query. This can result in amplifying incorrect
areas while failing to properly interpret the user query. To address these
challenges, we propose a simple yet effective method called Gaze Shift-Guided
Cross-modal Fusion Enhancement (GIFT). GIFT pre-computes a holistic visual
saliency map by tracking positive changes in visual attention, or "gaze
shifts", during user query comprehension, and leverages this map to amplify
attention to both salient visual information and the user query at each
decoding step. This reduces the impact of visual attention sink, as irrelevant
tokens exhibit minimal shifts, while ensuring balanced cross-modal fusion for
well-integrated representation. Extensive experiments show that GIFT
effectively mitigates hallucination in VLMs across both generative and
classification tasks, achieving up to 20.7% improvement over greedy decoding,
while maintaining general vision-language performance with low computational
overhead.

*Luca Caldera,Lara Cavinato,Francesca Ieva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel image-based harmonization framework for 3D T1-weighted brain MRI that disentangles anatomical content from scanner/site variations using SSIM-based loss, improving cross-site consistency and downstream task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI scanner variability across different models, protocols, and sites hinders consistent analysis and generalizability in multicenter neuroimaging studies.

Method: Uses a differentiable SSIM-based loss to separate anatomical content from scanner-specific variations, enabling separate evaluation of luminance, contrast, and structural components. Trained on multiple public datasets with diverse scanners and sites.

Result: Harmonized images achieved structural SSIM of 0.97, luminance SSIM of 0.98-0.99, and reduced Wasserstein distances. Downstream tasks improved: brain age prediction MAE decreased from 5.36 to 3.30 years, and Alzheimer's disease classification AUC increased from 0.78 to 0.85.

Conclusion: The framework enhances cross-site image consistency, preserves anatomical fidelity, and improves downstream model performance, providing a robust solution for multicenter neuroimaging studies.

Abstract: The variability introduced by differences in MRI scanner models, acquisition
protocols, and imaging sites hinders consistent analysis and generalizability
across multicenter studies. We present a novel image-based harmonization
framework for 3D T1-weighted brain MRI, which disentangles anatomical content
from scanner- and site-specific variations. The model incorporates a
differentiable loss based on the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) to preserve
biologically meaningful features while reducing inter-site variability. This
loss enables separate evaluation of image luminance, contrast, and structural
components. Training and validation were performed on multiple publicly
available datasets spanning diverse scanners and sites, with testing on both
healthy and clinical populations. Harmonization using multiple style targets,
including style-agnostic references, produced consistent and high-quality
outputs. Visual comparisons, voxel intensity distributions, and SSIM-based
metrics demonstrated that harmonized images achieved strong alignment across
acquisition settings while maintaining anatomical fidelity. Following
harmonization, structural SSIM reached 0.97, luminance SSIM ranged from 0.98 to
0.99, and Wasserstein distances between mean voxel intensity distributions
decreased substantially. Downstream tasks showed substantial improvements: mean
absolute error for brain age prediction decreased from 5.36 to 3.30 years, and
Alzheimer's disease classification AUC increased from 0.78 to 0.85. Overall,
our framework enhances cross-site image consistency, preserves anatomical
fidelity, and improves downstream model performance, providing a robust and
generalizable solution for large-scale multicenter neuroimaging studies.

### [58] [Mitigating Coordinate Prediction Bias from Positional Encoding Failures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22102)
*Xingjian Tao,Yiwei Wang,Yujun Cai,Yihong Luo,Jing Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLLMs struggle with precise coordinate prediction in high-resolution images due to weakened positional encodings, causing systematic directional biases. The paper proposes VPSG, a training-free method that corrects these biases using shuffled positional encodings as negative guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal LLMs perform well on vision-language tasks but fail at precise coordinate prediction, especially with high-resolution inputs where long token sequences degrade positional encodings and create directional biases in coordinate outputs.

Method: Proposed Vision-PE Shuffle Guidance (VPSG) - a training-free test-time method that runs auxiliary decoding with shuffled visual positional encodings to isolate position-unconditioned tendencies, then uses this as negative evidence to guide digit prediction while preserving coordinate format through a lightweight finite-state machine.

Result: Experiments on ScreenSpot-Pro dataset demonstrate reliable improvements in coordinate prediction accuracy, showing that addressing positional encoding robustness is crucial for spatial reasoning in MLLMs.

Conclusion: Positional encoding failures are a key bottleneck for accurate coordinate prediction at scale in MLLMs, and the proposed VPSG method effectively corrects directional biases without requiring retraining.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at vision-language tasks such
as VQA and document understanding, yet precise coordinate prediction remains
challenging. High-resolution inputs exacerbate this difficulty by producing
long token sequences that weaken positional encodings and introduce directional
biases in coordinate outputs. We investigate this phenomenon by analyzing how
MLLMs behave when visual positional encodings (VPEs) are deliberately perturbed
through shuffling. Our analysis reveals that such perturbations induce
predictable, non-random coordinate biases rather than random errors, suggesting
that models rely on internal positional priors when spatial grounding signals
are degraded. Crucially, we observe similar directional error patterns in
natural high-resolution datasets, indicating that positional encoding failures
are a key bottleneck for accurate coordinate prediction at scale. To address
this issue, we propose Vision-PE Shuffle Guidance (VPSG), a training-free
test-time method that leverages the directional nature of these biases for
correction. VPSG runs auxiliary decoding with shuffled VPEs to isolate
position-unconditioned tendencies, then uses this as negative evidence to guide
digit prediction while preserving coordinate format through a lightweight
finite-state machine. Experiments on ScreenSpot-Pro demonstrate reliable
improvements, highlighting positional encoding robustness as a critical factor
for spatial reasoning in MLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Rainbow is a conditional image generation framework that decomposes input conditions into diverse latent representations using GFlowNets to capture uncertainty and generate multiple plausible images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for diverse image generation either modify random seeds (making differences hard to interpret) or diversify input prompts (limited in verbal interpretability), failing to properly address condition uncertainty.

Method: Integrates a latent graph parameterized by GFlowNets into prompt representation, using GFlowNets' sampling capabilities to generate diverse trajectories over the graph that represent different aspects of input condition uncertainty.

Result: Evaluations on natural and medical image datasets show improvements in both diversity and fidelity across image synthesis, generation, and counterfactual generation tasks.

Conclusion: Rainbow effectively addresses condition uncertainty by decomposing input conditions into diverse latent representations, enabling generation of multiple plausible images while maintaining fidelity.

Abstract: Capturing diversity is crucial in conditional and prompt-based image
generation, particularly when conditions contain uncertainty that can lead to
multiple plausible outputs. To generate diverse images reflecting this
diversity, traditional methods often modify random seeds, making it difficult
to discern meaningful differences between samples, or diversify the input
prompt, which is limited in verbally interpretable diversity. We propose
Rainbow, a novel conditional image generation framework, applicable to any
pretrained conditional generative model, that addresses inherent
condition/prompt uncertainty and generates diverse plausible images. Rainbow is
based on a simple yet effective idea: decomposing the input condition into
diverse latent representations, each capturing an aspect of the uncertainty and
generating a distinct image. First, we integrate a latent graph, parameterized
by Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets), into the prompt representation
computation. Second, leveraging GFlowNets' advanced graph sampling capabilities
to capture uncertainty and output diverse trajectories over the graph, we
produce multiple trajectories that collectively represent the input condition,
leading to diverse condition representations and corresponding output images.
Evaluations on natural image and medical image datasets demonstrate Rainbow's
improvement in both diversity and fidelity across image synthesis, image
generation, and counterfactual generation tasks.

*Karim Elmaaroufi,Liheng Lai,Justin Svegliato,Yutong Bai,Sanjit A. Seshia,Matei Zaharia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRAID is a framework that generates high-quality spatial reasoning datasets for VLMs using 2D bounding boxes instead of 3D reconstruction, achieving 91.16% human-validated accuracy compared to 57.6% from existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle with spatial reasoning, and existing dataset generation methods have limitations: 3D reconstruction introduces cascading errors requiring wide tolerances, while caption-based methods need hyper-detailed annotations and suffer from hallucinations.

Method: GRAID operates exclusively on 2D bounding boxes from standard object detectors to determine qualitative spatial relationships, avoiding both 3D reconstruction errors and generative hallucinations.

Result: Generated over 8.5 million high-quality VQA pairs across BDD100k, NuImages, and Waymo datasets with 91.16% human-validated accuracy. Models trained on GRAID data show strong generalization, improving on over 10 held-out question types with accuracy gains up to 47.5%.

Conclusion: GRAID provides a reliable framework for generating high-quality spatial reasoning datasets that enable VLMs to learn spatial concepts that generalize well across different question types and benchmarks.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) achieve strong performance on many
vision-language tasks but often struggle with spatial reasoning\textemdash{}a
prerequisite for many applications. Empirically, we find that a dataset
produced by a current training data generation pipeline has a 57.6\% human
validation rate. These rates stem from current limitations: single-image 3D
reconstruction introduces cascading modeling errors and requires wide answer
tolerances, while caption-based methods require hyper-detailed annotations and
suffer from generative hallucinations. We present GRAID, built on the key
insight that qualitative spatial relationships can be reliably determined from
2D geometric primitives alone. By operating exclusively on 2D bounding boxes
from standard object detectors, GRAID avoids both 3D reconstruction errors and
generative hallucinations, resulting in datasets that are of higher quality
than existing tools that produce similar datasets as validated by human
evaluations. We apply our framework to the BDD100k, NuImages, and Waymo
datasets, generating over 8.5 million high-quality VQA pairs creating questions
spanning spatial relations, counting, ranking, and size comparisons. We
evaluate one of the datasets and find it achieves 91.16\% human-validated
accuracy\textemdash{}compared to 57.6\% on a dataset generated by recent work.
% or recent work Critically, we demonstrate that when trained on GRAID data,
models learn spatial reasoning concepts that generalize: models fine-tuned on 6
question types improve on over 10 held-out types, with accuracy gains of 47.5\%
on BDD and 37.9\% on NuImages for Llama 3.2B 11B, and when trained on all

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CogStereo is a novel stereo matching framework that embeds implicit spatial cognition using monocular depth features as priors to handle challenging regions like occlusions and weak textures, achieving state-of-the-art performance and excellent cross-domain generalization without dataset-specific priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep stereo matching methods lack zero-shot generalization capabilities seen in foundation models for other vision tasks, particularly struggling with challenging regions such as occlusions and weak textures where geometry alone is inadequate.

Method: CogStereo embeds implicit spatial cognition into refinement using monocular depth features as priors, employing a dual-conditional refinement mechanism that combines pixel-wise uncertainty with cognition-guided features for global correction of mismatches.

Result: Extensive experiments on Scene Flow, KITTI, Middlebury, ETH3D, EuRoc, and real-world datasets show CogStereo achieves state-of-the-art results and excels in cross-domain generalization.

Conclusion: CogStereo shifts stereo vision towards a cognition-driven approach by ensuring structurally coherent disparity estimation through holistic scene understanding beyond local correspondences.

Abstract: Deep stereo matching has advanced significantly on benchmark datasets through
fine-tuning but falls short of the zero-shot generalization seen in foundation
models in other vision tasks. We introduce CogStereo, a novel framework that
addresses challenging regions, such as occlusions or weak textures, without
relying on dataset-specific priors. CogStereo embeds implicit spatial cognition
into the refinement process by using monocular depth features as priors,
capturing holistic scene understanding beyond local correspondences. This
approach ensures structurally coherent disparity estimation, even in areas
where geometry alone is inadequate. CogStereo employs a dual-conditional
refinement mechanism that combines pixel-wise uncertainty with cognition-guided

*Wenxuan Bao,Ruxi Deng,Jingrui He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIP models suffer from embedding variance collapse under input corruptions, where both intra-class and inter-class variances decrease as corruption severity increases, leading to performance degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pretrained vision-language models like CLIP show strong zero-shot generalization but are vulnerable to distribution shifts caused by input corruptions, which degrade their performance.

Method: The authors propose Mint, a test-time adaptation method that maximizes pseudo-label-based inter-class variance using a mean accumulator and gradient accumulator, operating effectively with small batch sizes.

Result: Mint consistently improves performance across multiple corruption benchmarks and CLIP architectures, demonstrating enhanced embedding quality and robustness to corruptions.

Conclusion: Maximizing inter-class variance, even with pseudo-labels, can provably enhance embedding quality and mitigate the effects of embedding variance collapse in CLIP models under corruption.

Abstract: Pretrained vision-language models such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot
generalization but remain vulnerable to distribution shifts caused by input
corruptions. In this work, we investigate how corruptions affect CLIP's image
embeddings and uncover a consistent phenomenon we term as embedding variance
collapse, where both intra-class and inter-class variances shrink as corruption
severity increases. We find that this collapse is closely tied to performance
degradation, with inter-class variance strongly correlated with classification
accuracy. To explain this phenomenon, we analyze how corruptions alter the
structure of the embedding space. Our theoretical results suggest that the
visual encoder tends to encode corruption-related signals, which dilute
class-discriminative features and compress the representation geometry. We
further show that maximizing inter-class variance, even when estimated from
pseudo-labels, can provably enhance embedding quality. Based on this insight,
we propose Mint, a simple test-time adaptation method that maximizes
pseudo-label-based inter-class variance on the fly using a mean accumulator and
a gradient accumulator. Mint operates effectively with small batch sizes and
consistently improves performance across multiple corruption benchmarks and
CLIP architectures. Our code is available at https://github.com/baowenxuan/Mint .

*Matthias Jammot,Bj√∂ern Braun,Paul Streli,Rafael Wampfler,Christian Holz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: egoEMOTION is the first dataset combining egocentric visual and physiological signals with dense emotion and personality self-reports, enabling affect-driven behavior modeling in egocentric vision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current egocentric vision benchmarks ignore emotional states that shape human behavior, focusing only on physical activities and assuming neutral affect, limiting systems' ability to capture internal behavior drivers.

Method: Created egoEMOTION dataset with 50+ hours of recordings from 43 participants using Meta's Project Aria glasses, including synchronized eye-tracking video, photoplethysmography, motion data, and physiological baselines. Participants completed emotion-elicitation tasks while self-reporting affect using Circumplex Model and Mikels' Wheel, and personality via Big Five model.

Result: Established three benchmark tasks: continuous affect classification (valence, arousal, dominance), discrete emotion classification, and trait-level personality inference. Showed that classical learning methods on egocentric vision signals produce better affect estimates than processing physiological signals alone.

Conclusion: The dataset establishes emotion and personality as core dimensions in egocentric perception and opens new directions for affect-driven modeling of behavior, intent, and interaction.

Abstract: Understanding affect is central to anticipating human behavior, yet current
egocentric vision benchmarks largely ignore the person's emotional states that
shape their decisions and actions. Existing tasks in egocentric perception
focus on physical activities, hand-object interactions, and attention modeling
- assuming neutral affect and uniform personality. This limits the ability of
vision systems to capture key internal drivers of behavior. In this paper, we
present egoEMOTION, the first dataset that couples egocentric visual and
physiological signals with dense self-reports of emotion and personality across
controlled and real-world scenarios. Our dataset includes over 50 hours of
recordings from 43 participants, captured using Meta's Project Aria glasses.
Each session provides synchronized eye-tracking video, headmounted
photoplethysmography, inertial motion data, and physiological baselines for
reference. Participants completed emotion-elicitation tasks and naturalistic
activities while self-reporting their affective state using the Circumplex
Model and Mikels' Wheel as well as their personality via the Big Five model. We
define three benchmark tasks: (1) continuous affect classification (valence,
arousal, dominance); (2) discrete emotion classification; and (3) trait-level
personality inference. We show that a classical learning-based method, as a
simple baseline in real-world affect prediction, produces better estimates from
signals captured on egocentric vision systems than processing physiological
signals. Our dataset establishes emotion and personality as core dimensions in
egocentric perception and opens new directions in affect-driven modeling of
behavior, intent, and interaction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current 3DGS-based human avatars in accurately representing detailed features of non-rigid objects (clothing deformations) and dynamic regions (rapidly moving limbs) from monocular videos.

Method: Introduces a rigid-nonrigid coupled deformation framework that synergistically integrates Spacetime Gaussians (STG) with linear blend skinning (LBS), using optical flow to identify high-dynamic regions and guide adaptive densification of 3D Gaussians.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate consistent outperformance of state-of-the-art baselines in both reconstruction quality and operational efficiency, achieving superior quantitative metrics while retaining real-time rendering capabilities.

Conclusion: STG-Avatar provides an effective solution for creating realistic animatable human avatars from monocular videos, advancing human-robot interaction and immersive virtual experiences.

Abstract: Realistic animatable human avatars from monocular videos are crucial for
advancing human-robot interaction and enhancing immersive virtual experiences.
While recent research on 3DGS-based human avatars has made progress, it still
struggles with accurately representing detailed features of non-rigid objects
(e.g., clothing deformations) and dynamic regions (e.g., rapidly moving limbs).
To address these challenges, we present STG-Avatar, a 3DGS-based framework for
high-fidelity animatable human avatar reconstruction. Specifically, our
framework introduces a rigid-nonrigid coupled deformation framework that
synergistically integrates Spacetime Gaussians (STG) with linear blend skinning
(LBS). In this hybrid design, LBS enables real-time skeletal control by driving
global pose transformations, while STG complements it through spacetime
adaptive optimization of 3D Gaussians. Furthermore, we employ optical flow to
identify high-dynamic regions and guide the adaptive densification of 3D
Gaussians in these regions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both reconstruction
quality and operational efficiency, achieving superior quantitative metrics
while retaining real-time rendering capabilities. Our code is available at

TL;DR: LOC is a language-guided framework for 3D scene understanding that adapts to occupancy networks, supporting both supervised and self-supervised learning with Densely Contrastive Learning to enhance open-set recognition without dense supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models show progress in open-set challenges but face limitations in 3D scene understanding due to scarce 3D datasets.

Method: Uses multi-frame LiDAR fusion with Poisson reconstruction for dynamic/static scenes, assigns voxel semantics via KNN, and introduces Densely Contrastive Learning (DCL) to prevent feature over-homogenization by leveraging voxel semantics and textual prompts.

Result: Achieves superior performance on nuScenes dataset with high-precision known class predictions and effective unknown class distinction without extra training data.

Conclusion: LOC framework effectively bridges 3D scene understanding with VLMs, enabling robust open-set recognition through language guidance and contrastive learning.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown significant progress in open-set
challenges. However, the limited availability of 3D datasets hinders their
effective application in 3D scene understanding. We propose LOC, a general
language-guided framework adaptable to various occupancy networks, supporting
both supervised and self-supervised learning paradigms. For self-supervised
tasks, we employ a strategy that fuses multi-frame LiDAR points for
dynamic/static scenes, using Poisson reconstruction to fill voids, and
assigning semantics to voxels via K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) to obtain
comprehensive voxel representations. To mitigate feature over-homogenization
caused by direct high-dimensional feature distillation, we introduce Densely
Contrastive Learning (DCL). DCL leverages dense voxel semantic information and
predefined textual prompts. This efficiently enhances open-set recognition
without dense pixel-level supervision, and our framework can also leverage
existing ground truth to further improve performance. Our model predicts dense
voxel features embedded in the CLIP feature space, integrating textual and
image pixel information, and classifies based on text and semantic similarity.
Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the method's superior
performance, achieving high-precision predictions for known classes and
distinguishing unknown classes without additional training data.

*Renrong Shao,Wei Zhang,Jun Wang*

TL;DR: ARFNet is a novel framework for source-free domain adaptation that uses attention residual fusion, global-local attention contrast, and dynamic centroid evaluation to address negative transfer and domain shift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SFDA methods focus on domain shift but neglect negative transfer effects that hinder model performance improvement during adaptation.

Method: Uses attention mechanism to capture target object discriminative regions, decomposes attention features into spatial/channel-wise attentions for cross-layer fusion and self-distillation, contrasts global-local representations for better category discrimination, and employs dynamic centroid evaluation for trustworthy pseudo-labels.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on five benchmarks show the method surpasses other techniques and achieves superior performance across SFDA benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed ARFNet framework effectively alleviates negative transfer and domain shift in source-free domain adaptation through attention mechanisms and contrastive learning strategies.

Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) involves training a model on source
domain and then applying it to a related target domain without access to the
source data and labels during adaptation. The complexity of scene information
and lack of the source domain make SFDA a difficult task. Recent studies have
shown promising results, but many approaches to domain adaptation concentrate
on domain shift and neglect the effects of negative transfer, which may impede
enhancements of model performance during adaptation. n this paper, addressing
this issue, we propose a novel framework of Attention Residual Fusion Network
(ARFNet) based on contrast learning for SFDA to alleviate negative transfer and
domain shift during the progress of adaptation, in which attention residual
fusion, global-local attention contrast, and dynamic centroid evaluation are
exploited. Concretely, the attention mechanism is first exploited to capture
the discriminative region of the target object. Then, in each block, attention
features are decomposed into spatial-wise and channel-wise attentions to
achieve the cross-layer attention residual fusion progressively and
self-distillation. During adaptation progress, we contrast global and local
representations to improve the perceptual capabilities of different categories,
which enables the model to discriminate variations between inner-class and
intra-class. Finally, a dynamic centroid evaluation strategy is exploited to
evaluate the trustworthy centroids and labels for self-supervised
self-distillation, which aims to accurately approximate the center of the
source domain and pseudo-labels to mitigate domain shift. To validate the
efficacy, we execute comprehensive experiments on five benchmarks of varying
scales. Experimental outcomes indicate that our method surpasses other
techniques, attaining superior performance across SFDA benchmarks.

TL;DR: I2-NeRF is a neural radiance field framework that enhances 3D metric perception under media degradation through reverse-stratified upsampling and a unified radiative formulation for complex media environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To endow generative AI with 3D physical world perception and address limitations of existing NeRF models that rely on object-centric sampling, which struggles with media degradation effects.

Method: Introduces reverse-stratified upsampling for near-uniform 3D space sampling to preserve isometry, and a general radiative formulation that unifies emission, absorption, and scattering using Beer-Lambert attenuation law for handling complex media environments.

Result: Significantly improves reconstruction fidelity and physical plausibility compared to existing approaches, enables isotropic metric perception, and can estimate medium properties like water depth.

Conclusion: I2-NeRF provides an effective framework for enhancing 3D physical world perception in generative AI, particularly for challenging media-degraded environments, with demonstrated improvements in both reconstruction quality and metric accuracy.

Abstract: Participating in efforts to endow generative AI with the 3D physical world
perception, we propose I2-NeRF, a novel neural radiance field framework that
enhances isometric and isotropic metric perception under media degradation.
While existing NeRF models predominantly rely on object-centric sampling,
I2-NeRF introduces a reverse-stratified upsampling strategy to achieve
near-uniform sampling across 3D space, thereby preserving isometry. We further
present a general radiative formulation for media degradation that unifies
emission, absorption, and scattering into a particle model governed by the
Beer-Lambert attenuation law. By composing the direct and media-induced
in-scatter radiance, this formulation extends naturally to complex media
environments such as underwater, haze, and even low-light scenes. By treating
light propagation uniformly in both vertical and horizontal directions, I2-NeRF
enables isotropic metric perception and can even estimate medium properties
such as water depth. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our
method significantly improves both reconstruction fidelity and physical
plausibility compared to existing approaches.

*Erum Mushtaq,Zalan Fabian,Yavuz Faruk Bakman,Anil Ramakrishna,Mahdi Soltanolkotabi,Salman Avestimehr*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HARMONY is a novel uncertainty estimation framework for Vision-Language Models that jointly leverages multimodal activations and output distributions to assess response reliability, achieving state-of-the-art performance on VQA benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing uncertainty estimation methods for VLMs either rely solely on output probabilities or hidden representations, failing to capture complex multimodal relationships and suffering from language prior biases. There's a need for more reliable uncertainty assessment in high-stakes applications like autonomous driving and assistive technologies.

Method: Proposes HARMONY framework that combines fused multimodal information from model activations with output probability distributions. It captures both the model's internal visual understanding belief (hidden representations) and token probabilities to generate more reliable uncertainty scores.

Result: Experimental results on A-OKVQA, VizWiz, and PathVQA benchmarks with LLaVa-7b, LLaVA-13b and InstructBLIP show consistent performance improvements: up to 4% AUROC and 6% PRR improvement, establishing new state-of-the-art in VLM uncertainty estimation.

Conclusion: Jointly leveraging both model activations and output distributions provides superior uncertainty estimation compared to approaches using only one component, demonstrating the value of multimodal fusion for reliable VLM assessment in critical applications.

Abstract: The growing deployment of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in high-stakes
applications such as autonomous driving and assistive technologies for visually
impaired individuals necessitates reliable mechanisms to assess the
trustworthiness of their generation. Uncertainty Estimation (UE) plays a
central role in quantifying the reliability of model outputs and reducing
unsafe generations via selective prediction. In this regard, most existing
probability-based UE approaches rely on output probability distributions,
aggregating token probabilities into a single uncertainty score using
predefined functions such as length-normalization. Another line of research
leverages model hidden representations and trains MLP-based models to predict
uncertainty. However, these methods often fail to capture the complex
multimodal relationships between semantic and textual tokens and struggle to
identify biased probabilities often influenced by language priors. Motivated by
these observations, we propose a novel UE framework, HARMONY, that jointly
leverages fused multimodal information in model activations and the output
distribution of the VLM to determine the reliability of responses. The key
hypothesis of our work is that both the model's internal belief in its visual
understanding, captured by its hidden representations, and the produced token
probabilities carry valuable reliability signals that can be jointly leveraged
to improve UE performance, surpassing approaches that rely on only one of these
components. Experimental results on three open-ended VQA benchmarks, A-OKVQA,
VizWiz, and PathVQA, and three state-of-the-art VLMs, LLaVa-7b, LLaVA-13b and
InstructBLIP demonstrate that our method consistently performs on par with or
better than existing approaches, achieving up to 4\% improvement in AUROC, and
6\% in PRR, establishing new state of the art in uncertainty estimation for
VLMs.

Motivation: To understand image generation mechanisms by stripping away complex engineering and proposing a minimal model grounded in natural image principles.

Method: Non-parametric model defining each pixel's distribution from local context windows, based on spatial non-stationarity, low-level regularities, and high-level semantics.

image generative models, yet their mechanisms still remain opaque. Rather than
advancing scaling, our goal is to strip away complicated engineering tricks and
propose a simple, non-parametric generative model. Our design is grounded in
three principles of natural images-(i) spatial non-stationarity, (ii) low-level
regularities, and (iii) high-level semantics-and defines each pixel's
distribution from its local context window. Despite its minimal architecture
and no training, the model produces high-fidelity samples on MNIST and visually
compelling CIFAR-10 images. This combination of simplicity and strong empirical
performance points toward a minimal theory of natural-image structure. The
model's white-box nature also allows us to have a mechanistic understanding of
how the model generalizes and generates diverse images. We study it by tracing
each generated pixel back to its source images. These analyses reveal a simple,
compositional procedure for "part-whole generalization", suggesting a
hypothesis for how large neural network generative models learn to generalize.

*Kunal Bhosikar,Siddharth Katageri,Vivek Madhavaram,Kai Han,Charu Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MOGRAS is a large-scale dataset for generating full-body grasping motions in 3D scenes, addressing the gap between scene-aware motion generation and precise grasping tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods either generate full-body motion in 3D scenes without fine-grained grasping fidelity, or generate precise grasping motions without considering the surrounding 3D scene context.

Method: Created MOGRAS dataset with pre-grasping walking motions and final grasping poses in annotated 3D indoor scenes. Proposed a simple yet effective method to adapt existing approaches for scene-aware grasping motion generation.

Result: Benchmarked existing methods showing limitations in scene-aware generation. The proposed adaptation method achieved significant improvements in generating physically plausible full-body grasping motions within 3D scenes.

Conclusion: MOGRAS dataset and the proposed method enable more realistic human-scene interactions by bridging the gap between full-body motion generation and fine-grained grasping tasks in 3D environments.

Abstract: Generating realistic full-body motion interacting with objects is critical
for applications in robotics, virtual reality, and human-computer interaction.
While existing methods can generate full-body motion within 3D scenes, they
often lack the fidelity for fine-grained tasks like object grasping.
Conversely, methods that generate precise grasping motions typically ignore the
surrounding 3D scene. This gap, generating full-body grasping motions that are
physically plausible within a 3D scene, remains a significant challenge. To
address this, we introduce MOGRAS (Human MOtion with GRAsping in 3D Scenes), a
large-scale dataset that bridges this gap. MOGRAS provides pre-grasping
full-body walking motions and final grasping poses within richly annotated 3D
indoor scenes. We leverage MOGRAS to benchmark existing full-body grasping
methods and demonstrate their limitations in scene-aware generation.
Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective method to adapt existing
approaches to work seamlessly within 3D scenes. Through extensive quantitative
and qualitative experiments, we validate the effectiveness of our dataset and
highlight the significant improvements our proposed method achieves, paving the
way for more realistic human-scene interactions.

*Mohammed Alduais,Xinming Li,Qipei Mei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework using YOLOv10n and DeepSORT for worker and obstacle detection/tracking, with two novel trajectory prediction models (TrajGATFormer and TrajGATFormer-Obstacle) that integrate transformer encoder-decoder with Graph Attention Networks to improve collision risk assessment in construction sites.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offsite construction introduces new safety risks due to close worker-machinery interactions. Traditional trajectory prediction methods struggle with dynamic construction environments and lack ability to capture long-term behavior and spatial-social context needed for collision risk assessment.

Method: Proposes a framework with YOLOv10n for object detection, DeepSORT for tracking, and two novel models: TrajGATFormer (worker trajectory prediction) and TrajGATFormer-Obstacle (worker+obstacle prediction), both using transformer encoder-decoder with Graph Attention Networks to capture temporal and spatial interactions.

Result: TrajGATFormer achieved ADE of 1.25m and FDE of 2.3m over 4.8s horizon. TrajGATFormer-Obstacle achieved higher accuracy with ADE 1.15m and FDE 2.2m. Both models outperformed traditional methods, reducing ADE and FDE by up to 35% and 38% respectively.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses limitations of traditional methods by integrating precise detection/tracking with advanced trajectory prediction models that capture complex spatial-temporal interactions, significantly improving collision risk assessment in construction environments.

Abstract: As the demand grows within the construction industry for processes that are
not only faster but also safer and more efficient, offsite construction has
emerged as a solution, though it brings new safety risks due to the close
interaction between workers, machinery, and moving obstacles. Predicting the
future trajectories of workers and taking into account social and environmental
factors is a crucial step for developing collision-avoidance systems to
mitigate such risks. Traditional methods often struggle to adapt to the dynamic
and unpredictable nature of construction environments. Many rely on simplified
assumptions or require hand-crafted features, limiting their ability to respond
to complex, real-time interactions between workers and moving obstacles. While
recent data-driven methods have improved the modeling of temporal patterns,
they still face challenges in capturing long-term behavior and accounting for
the spatial and social context crucial to collision risk assessment. To address
these limitations, this paper proposes a framework integrating YOLOv10n and
DeepSORT for precise detection and tracking, along with two novel trajectory
prediction models: TrajGATFormer and TrajGATFormer-Obstacle. YOLOv10n serves as
the backbone for object detection, accurately identifying workers and obstacles
in diverse scenes, while DeepSORT efficiently tracks them over time with unique
IDs for continuity. Both models employ a transformer encoder-decoder with Graph
Attention Networks (GAT) to capture temporal and spatial interactions.
TrajGATFormer predicts worker trajectories with an ADE of 1.25 m and FDE of 2.3
m over a 4.8 s horizon, while TrajGATFormer-Obstacle extends prediction to both
workers and obstacles, achieving higher accuracy (ADE 1.15 m, FDE 2.2 m).
Comparative analysis shows both models outperform traditional methods, reducing
ADE and FDE by up to 35% and 38%, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DynamicTree is a framework for generating long-term, interactive 3D Gaussian Splatting tree animations using a compact sparse voxel spectrum representation, enabling fast feed-forward dynamics and real-time responses to external forces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods face challenges in generating realistic 4D motion for complex real trees, which has applications in virtual reality, games, and world simulation.

Method: Uses a compact sparse voxel spectrum to represent tree movement, generates mesh motion from 3D Gaussian Splatting trees, binds Gaussians to deform mesh, and enables fast modal analysis for real-time interactive responses.

Result: Achieves realistic and responsive tree animations, significantly outperforming existing approaches in both visual quality and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: DynamicTree successfully generates dynamic and interactive 3D tree animations with superior performance compared to prior methods.

Abstract: Generating dynamic and interactive 3D objects, such as trees, has wide
applications in virtual reality, games, and world simulation. Nevertheless,
existing methods still face various challenges in generating realistic 4D
motion for complex real trees. In this paper, we propose DynamicTree, the first
framework that can generate long-term, interactive animation of 3D Gaussian
Splatting trees. Unlike prior optimization-based methods, our approach
generates dynamics in a fast feed-forward manner. The key success of our
approach is the use of a compact sparse voxel spectrum to represent the tree
movement. Given a 3D tree from Gaussian Splatting reconstruction, our pipeline
first generates mesh motion using the sparse voxel spectrum and then binds
Gaussians to deform the mesh. Additionally, the proposed sparse voxel spectrum
can also serve as a basis for fast modal analysis under external forces,
allowing real-time interactive responses. To train our model, we also introduce
4DTree, the first large-scale synthetic 4D tree dataset containing 8,786
animated tree meshes with semantic labels and 100-frame motion sequences.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves realistic and
responsive tree animations, significantly outperforming existing approaches in
both visual quality and computational efficiency.

*Juepeng Zheng,Peifeng Zhang,Yibin Wen,Qingmei Li,Yang Zhang,Haohuan Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes GALA, a multi-source active domain adaptation strategy that combines global k-means clustering with cluster-wise local selection to selectively annotate target domain samples, achieving near fully-supervised performance with only 1% target annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a substantial performance gap between domain adaptation methods and fully supervised learning. Multi-Source Active Domain Adaptation (MS-ADA) aims to enhance target-domain performance by selectively acquiring annotations from the target domain, which is more practical and challenging than standard domain adaptation.

Method: Proposed GALA strategy combines global k-means clustering for target-domain samples with cluster-wise local selection criterion. It handles inter-class diversity and multi-source domain variation in a complementary manner. GALA is plug-and-play and can be integrated into existing DA frameworks without additional trainable parameters.

Result: Extensive experiments on three standard DA benchmarks show GALA consistently outperforms prior active learning and active DA methods. It achieves performance comparable to the fully-supervised upperbound while using only 1% of the target annotations.

Conclusion: GALA effectively addresses the challenges of MS-ADA by jointly handling inter-class diversity and multi-source domain variation through complementary global clustering and local selection, demonstrating significant performance improvements with minimal annotation cost.

Abstract: Domain Adaptation (DA) provides an effective way to tackle target-domain
tasks by leveraging knowledge learned from source domains. Recent studies have
extended this paradigm to Multi-Source Domain Adaptation (MSDA), which exploits
multiple source domains carrying richer and more diverse transferable
information. However, a substantial performance gap still remains between
adaptation-based methods and fully supervised learning. In this paper, we
explore a more practical and challenging setting, named Multi-Source Active
Domain Adaptation (MS-ADA), to further enhance target-domain performance by
selectively acquiring annotations from the target domain. The key difficulty of
MS-ADA lies in designing selection criteria that can jointly handle inter-class
diversity and multi-source domain variation. To address these challenges, we
propose a simple yet effective GALA strategy (GALA), which combines a global
k-means clustering step for target-domain samples with a cluster-wise local
selection criterion, effectively tackling the above two issues in a
complementary manner. Our proposed GALA is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly
integrated into existing DA frameworks without introducing any additional
trainable parameters. Extensive experiments on three standard DA benchmarks
demonstrate that GALA consistently outperforms prior active learning and active
DA methods, achieving performance comparable to the fully-supervised upperbound
while using only 1% of the target annotations.

*Yongchuan Cui,Peng Liu,Hui Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniPAN is a novel approach that enhances the generalizability of pansharpening models by normalizing data from different satellite sensors to a unified distribution, enabling "train once, deploy forever" capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning pansharpening models suffer from performance degradation when applied to unseen satellite data due to distributional discrepancies from different sensors and imaging conditions, limiting their practical applicability.

Method: Proposes a unified distribution strategy (UniPAN) that constructs a distribution transformation function to normalize pixels from different sources to an identical distribution, allowing models to be trained and tested on consistent distributions.

Result: Extensive experiments validate UniPAN's efficacy in significantly enhancing the performance of deep pansharpening models across diverse satellite sensors, demonstrating improved generalizability.

Conclusion: UniPAN successfully bridges the gap between training and testing distributions, enabling pansharpening models to maintain performance across different satellite sensors and achieve practical "train once, deploy forever" capability.

Abstract: Existing deep learning-based models for remote sensing pansharpening exhibit
exceptional performance on training datasets. However, due to sensor-specific
characteristics and varying imaging conditions, these models suffer from
substantial performance degradation when applied to unseen satellite data,
lacking generalizability and thus limiting their applicability. We argue that
the performance drops stem primarily from distributional discrepancies from
different sources and the key to addressing this challenge lies in bridging the
gap between training and testing distributions. To validate the idea and
further achieve a "train once, deploy forever" capability, this paper
introduces a novel and intuitive approach to enpower any pansharpening models
with generalizability by employing a unified distribution strategy (UniPAN).
Specifically, we construct a distribution transformation function that
normalizes the pixels sampled from different sources to conform to an identical
distribution. The deep models are trained on the transformed domain, and during
testing on new datasets, the new data are also transformed to match the
training distribution. UniPAN aims to train and test the model on a unified and
consistent distribution, thereby enhancing its generalizability. Extensive
experiments validate the efficacy of UniPAN, demonstrating its potential to
significantly enhance the performance of deep pansharpening models across
diverse satellite sensors. Codes: https://github.com/yc-cui/UniPAN.

*Jeongin Kim,Wonho Bae,YouLee Han,Giyeong Oh,Youngjae Yu,Danica J. Sutherland,Junhyug Noh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a two-stage active learning method for semantic segmentation that uses diffusion model features to select diverse and uncertain pixels for annotation under extreme labeling budget constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic segmentation requires dense pixel-level annotations which are expensive, especially with limited labeling budgets. There's a need for efficient active learning methods that can achieve high accuracy with minimal labeled data.

Method: Two-stage selection pipeline: 1) Hierarchical representation-based candidate selection using MaxHerding to choose representative pixels per image and create a diverse global pool; 2) Entropy-augmented disagreement score (eDALD) computed over multi-scale diffusion features to select informative pixels based on uncertainty and prediction confidence.

Result: Extensive experiments on four benchmarks (CamVid, ADE-Bed, Cityscapes, Pascal-Context) show the method significantly outperforms existing baselines under extreme pixel-budget regimes.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively decouples diversity and uncertainty selection, enabling high segmentation accuracy with only a tiny fraction of labeled pixels by leveraging diffusion model features for active learning.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation demands dense pixel-level annotations, which can be
prohibitively expensive - especially under extremely constrained labeling
budgets. In this paper, we address the problem of low-budget active learning
for semantic segmentation by proposing a novel two-stage selection pipeline.
Our approach leverages a pre-trained diffusion model to extract rich
multi-scale features that capture both global structure and fine details. In
the first stage, we perform a hierarchical, representation-based candidate
selection by first choosing a small subset of representative pixels per image
using MaxHerding, and then refining these into a diverse global pool. In the
second stage, we compute an entropy-augmented disagreement score (eDALD) over
noisy multi-scale diffusion features to capture both epistemic uncertainty and
prediction confidence, selecting the most informative pixels for annotation.
This decoupling of diversity and uncertainty lets us achieve high segmentation
accuracy with only a tiny fraction of labeled pixels. Extensive experiments on
four benchmarks (CamVid, ADE-Bed, Cityscapes, and Pascal-Context) demonstrate
that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines under extreme
pixel-budget regimes. Our code is available at

TL;DR: DiffusionLane is a novel diffusion-based model for lane detection that treats lane detection as a denoising diffusion process in lane parameter space, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve lane detection performance by leveraging diffusion models to handle the parameter space of lanes and address poor feature representation issues in existing methods.

Method: 1) Treats lane detection as denoising diffusion process in lane parameter space 2) Adds Gaussian noise to ground truth lane parameters to create noisy anchors 3) Uses hybrid decoding strategy with global and local decoders 4) Employs auxiliary head during training to improve encoder feature representation

Result: Achieves strong generalization and detection performance: 1%+ accuracy improvement on Carlane domain adaptation, 81.32% F1 on CULane, 96.89% accuracy on Tusimple, and 97.59% F1 on LLAMAS.

Conclusion: DiffusionLane demonstrates superior lane detection performance across multiple benchmarks through its diffusion-based approach and hybrid decoding strategy, showing strong generalization capabilities.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel diffusion-based model for lane detection,
called DiffusionLane, which treats the lane detection task as a denoising
diffusion process in the parameter space of the lane. Firstly, we add the
Gaussian noise to the parameters (the starting point and the angle) of ground
truth lanes to obtain noisy lane anchors, and the model learns to refine the
noisy lane anchors in a progressive way to obtain the target lanes. Secondly,
we propose a hybrid decoding strategy to address the poor feature
representation of the encoder, resulting from the noisy lane anchors.
Specifically, we design a hybrid diffusion decoder to combine global-level and
local-level decoders for high-quality lane anchors. Then, to improve the
feature representation of the encoder, we employ an auxiliary head in the
training stage to adopt the learnable lane anchors for enriching the
supervision on the encoder. Experimental results on four benchmarks, Carlane,
Tusimple, CULane, and LLAMAS, show that DiffusionLane possesses a strong
generalization ability and promising detection performance compared to the
previous state-of-the-art methods. For example, DiffusionLane with ResNet18
surpasses the existing methods by at least 1\% accuracy on the domain
adaptation dataset Carlane. Besides, DiffusionLane with MobileNetV4 gets
81.32\% F1 score on CULane, 96.89\% accuracy on Tusimple with ResNet34, and
97.59\% F1 score on LLAMAS with ResNet101. Code will be available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a novel accident anticipation method that shifts from current-frame risk scoring to directly predicting accident scores at multiple future time steps, using precise accident timestamps for supervision and Transformer-based temporal decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use ambiguous binary supervision (labeling all frames in accident videos as positive) despite varying risk levels over time, leading to unreliable learning and false alarms.

Method: Uses snippet-level encoder for spatial-temporal modeling and Transformer-based temporal decoder with dedicated queries to predict accident scores for multiple future horizons simultaneously.

Result: Achieves superior performance in both recall and Time-to-Accident (TTA) under realistic false alarm rate (FAR) constraints.

Conclusion: The proposed paradigm shift from current-frame risk scoring to future accident score prediction with precise timestamp supervision enables more reliable accident anticipation with reduced false alarms.

Abstract: Accident anticipation aims to predict potential collisions in an online
manner, enabling timely alerts to enhance road safety. Existing methods
typically predict frame-level risk scores as indicators of hazard. However,
these approaches rely on ambiguous binary supervision (labeling all frames in
accident videos as positive) despite the fact that risk varies continuously
over time, leading to unreliable learning and false alarms. To address this, we
propose a novel paradigm that shifts the prediction target from current-frame
risk scoring to directly estimating accident scores at multiple future time
steps (e.g., 0.1s-2.0s ahead), leveraging precisely annotated accident
timestamps as supervision. Our method employs a snippet-level encoder to
jointly model spatial and temporal dynamics, and a Transformer-based temporal
decoder that predicts accident scores for all future horizons simultaneously
using dedicated temporal queries. Furthermore, we introduce a refined
evaluation protocol that reports Time-to-Accident (TTA) and recall (evaluated
at multiple pre-accident intervals (0.5s, 1.0s, and 1.5s)) only when the false
alarm rate (FAR) remains within an acceptable range, ensuring practical
relevance. Experiments show that our method achieves superior performance in
both recall and TTA under realistic FAR constraints.

TL;DR: GSAlign is a novel network for aerial-ground person re-identification that addresses geometric distortion and semantic misalignment through learnable thin plate spline warping and dynamic alignment modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aerial-ground person re-identification faces extreme viewpoint discrepancies, occlusions, and domain gaps between UAV and ground camera imagery, with existing methods struggling with severe pose variations and spatial misalignment.

Method: Proposes GSAlign with two key components: Learnable Thin Plate Spline (LTPS) Module that adaptively warps pedestrian features using learned keypoints, and Dynamic Alignment Module (DAM) that estimates visibility-aware representation masks to highlight visible body regions.

Result: Achieves significant improvements of +18.8% in mAP and +16.8% in Rank-1 accuracy over previous state-of-the-art methods on CARGO dataset with four matching protocols.

Conclusion: GSAlign effectively addresses geometric and semantic alignment challenges in aerial-ground person re-identification, demonstrating superior performance through joint handling of viewpoint variations and occlusions.

Abstract: Aerial-Ground person re-identification (AG-ReID) is an emerging yet
challenging task that aims to match pedestrian images captured from drastically
different viewpoints, typically from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and
ground-based surveillance cameras. The task poses significant challenges due to
extreme viewpoint discrepancies, occlusions, and domain gaps between aerial and
ground imagery. While prior works have made progress by learning cross-view
representations, they remain limited in handling severe pose variations and
spatial misalignment. To address these issues, we propose a Geometric and
Semantic Alignment Network (GSAlign) tailored for AG-ReID. GSAlign introduces
two key components to jointly tackle geometric distortion and semantic
misalignment in aerial-ground matching: a Learnable Thin Plate Spline (LTPS)
Module and a Dynamic Alignment Module (DAM). The LTPS module adaptively warps
pedestrian features based on a set of learned keypoints, effectively
compensating for geometric variations caused by extreme viewpoint changes. In
parallel, the DAM estimates visibility-aware representation masks that
highlight visible body regions at the semantic level, thereby alleviating the
negative impact of occlusions and partial observations in cross-view
correspondence. A comprehensive evaluation on CARGO with four matching
protocols demonstrates the effectiveness of GSAlign, achieving significant
improvements of +18.8\% in mAP and +16.8\% in Rank-1 accuracy over previous
state-of-the-art methods on the aerial-ground setting. The code is available

TL;DR: CityRiSE is a reinforcement learning framework that improves Large Vision-Language Models' ability to predict urban socio-economic status from street view and satellite imagery through structured reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LVLMs struggle with accurate and interpretable socio-economic predictions from visual urban data, despite the importance of urban socio-economic sensing for sustainable development goals.

Method: Uses pure reinforcement learning with carefully curated multi-modal data and verifiable reward design to guide LVLMs to focus on semantically meaningful visual cues for structured reasoning.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing baselines, improving both prediction accuracy and generalization across diverse urban contexts, especially for unseen cities and indicators.

Conclusion: Combining RL and LVLMs shows promise for interpretable and generalist urban socio-economic sensing.

Abstract: Harnessing publicly available, large-scale web data, such as street view and
satellite imagery, urban socio-economic sensing is of paramount importance for
achieving global sustainable development goals. With the emergence of Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), new opportunities have arisen to solve this
task by treating it as a multi-modal perception and understanding problem.
However, recent studies reveal that LVLMs still struggle with accurate and
interpretable socio-economic predictions from visual data. To address these
limitations and maximize the potential of LVLMs, we introduce
\textbf{CityRiSE}, a novel framework for \textbf{R}eason\textbf{i}ng urban
\textbf{S}ocio-\textbf{E}conomic status in LVLMs through pure reinforcement
learning (RL). With carefully curated multi-modal data and verifiable reward
design, our approach guides the LVLM to focus on semantically meaningful visual
cues, enabling structured and goal-oriented reasoning for generalist
socio-economic status prediction. Experiments demonstrate that CityRiSE with
emergent reasoning process significantly outperforms existing baselines,
improving both prediction accuracy and generalization across diverse urban
contexts, particularly for prediction on unseen cities and unseen indicators.
This work highlights the promise of combining RL and LVLMs for interpretable
and generalist urban socio-economic sensing.

*Jing Wang,Jiajun Liang,Jie Liu,Henglin Liu,Gongye Liu,Jun Zheng,Wanyuan Pang,Ao Ma,Zhenyu Xie,Xintao Wang,Meng Wang,Pengfei Wan,Xiaodan Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRPO-Guard addresses implicit over-optimization in flow-matching models by normalizing importance ratios and reweighting gradients to stabilize policy updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GRPO methods suffer from systematic shifts in importance-ratio distributions, causing overconfident positive updates that degrade image quality and text alignment despite increasing proxy rewards.

Method: GRPO-Guard incorporates ratio normalization to restore balanced importance ratios and gradient reweighting to equalize policy gradients across denoising timesteps.

Result: Extensive experiments show GRPO-Guard significantly reduces over-optimization while maintaining or improving generation quality across multiple diffusion models and proxy tasks.

Conclusion: GRPO-Guard provides an effective enhancement to GRPO frameworks that stabilizes optimization without heavy KL regularization, making learned policies practical for real-world use.

Abstract: Recently, GRPO-based reinforcement learning has shown remarkable progress in
optimizing flow-matching models, effectively improving their alignment with
task-specific rewards. Within these frameworks, the policy update relies on
importance-ratio clipping to constrain overconfident positive and negative
gradients. However, in practice, we observe a systematic shift in the
importance-ratio distribution-its mean falls below 1 and its variance differs
substantially across timesteps. This left-shifted and inconsistent distribution
prevents positive-advantage samples from entering the clipped region, causing
the mechanism to fail in constraining overconfident positive updates. As a
result, the policy model inevitably enters an implicit over-optimization
stage-while the proxy reward continues to increase, essential metrics such as
image quality and text-prompt alignment deteriorate sharply, ultimately making
the learned policy impractical for real-world use. To address this issue, we
introduce GRPO-Guard, a simple yet effective enhancement to existing GRPO
frameworks. Our method incorporates ratio normalization, which restores a
balanced and step-consistent importance ratio, ensuring that PPO clipping
properly constrains harmful updates across denoising timesteps. In addition, a
gradient reweighting strategy equalizes policy gradients over noise conditions,
preventing excessive updates from particular timestep regions. Together, these
designs act as a regulated clipping mechanism, stabilizing optimization and
substantially mitigating implicit over-optimization without relying on heavy KL
regularization. Extensive experiments on multiple diffusion backbones (e.g.,
SD3.5M, Flux.1-dev) and diverse proxy tasks demonstrate that GRPO-Guard
significantly reduces over-optimization while maintaining or even improving
generation quality.

*Ali Javidani,Babak Nadjar Araabi,Mohammad Amin Sadeghi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a graph-based self-supervised learning method that captures both intra-instance variations and inter-instance relationships using KNN graphs and GNNs, achieving significant accuracy improvements on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional self-supervised methods focus only on intra-instance variations from augmentations but overlook important inter-instance relationships, which limits their representation learning capabilities.

Method: Constructs KNN graphs for teacher and student streams during pretraining, then uses GNNs for representation refinement through multi-hop message propagation to capture broader contextual information.

Result: Achieved accuracy improvements of 7.3% on CIFAR-10, 3.2% on ImageNet-100, and 1.0% on ImageNet-1K over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The graph-based mechanism effectively captures inter-instance relationships and enables broader contextual integration, demonstrating superior performance in self-supervised representation learning.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates graph theory into
self-supervised representation learning. Traditional methods focus on
intra-instance variations generated by applying augmentations. However, they
often overlook important inter-instance relationships. While our method retains
the intra-instance property, it further captures inter-instance relationships
by constructing k-nearest neighbor (KNN) graphs for both teacher and student
streams during pretraining. In these graphs, nodes represent samples along with
their latent representations. Edges encode the similarity between instances.
Following pretraining, a representation refinement phase is performed. In this
phase, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) propagate messages not only among immediate
neighbors but also across multiple hops, thereby enabling broader contextual
integration. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, ImageNet-100, and ImageNet-1K
demonstrate accuracy improvements of 7.3%, 3.2%, and 1.0%, respectively, over
state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the effectiveness of the
proposed graph based mechanism. The code is publicly available at

*Xu Zhang,Ruijie Quan,Wenguan Wang,Yi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MindHier is a hierarchical fMRI-to-image reconstruction framework that uses scale-wise autoregressive modeling to better align with human visual perception by reconstructing global semantics before local details, outperforming diffusion-based methods in speed and fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based methods map fMRI to a single embedding, collapsing hierarchical neural information and misaligning with stage-dependent reconstruction needs. A more cognitively-aligned approach is needed.

Method: Three key components: Hierarchical fMRI Encoder for multi-level embeddings, Hierarchy-to-Hierarchy Alignment with CLIP features, and Scale-Aware Coarse-to-Fine Neural Guidance for injecting embeddings at matching scales during autoregression.

Result: On NSD dataset, achieves superior semantic fidelity, 4.67x faster inference than diffusion baselines, and more deterministic results.

Conclusion: MindHier provides an efficient and cognitively-aligned alternative to diffusion methods by enabling hierarchical reconstruction that mimics human visual perception.

Abstract: Reconstructing visual stimuli from fMRI signals is a central challenge
bridging machine learning and neuroscience. Recent diffusion-based methods
typically map fMRI activity to a single high-level embedding, using it as fixed
guidance throughout the entire generation process. However, this fixed guidance
collapses hierarchical neural information and is misaligned with the
stage-dependent demands of image reconstruction. In response, we propose
MindHier, a coarse-to-fine fMRI-to-image reconstruction framework built on
scale-wise autoregressive modeling. MindHier introduces three components: a
Hierarchical fMRI Encoder to extract multi-level neural embeddings, a
Hierarchy-to-Hierarchy Alignment scheme to enforce layer-wise correspondence
with CLIP features, and a Scale-Aware Coarse-to-Fine Neural Guidance strategy
to inject these embeddings into autoregression at matching scales. These
designs make MindHier an efficient and cognitively-aligned alternative to
diffusion-based methods by enabling a hierarchical reconstruction process that
synthesizes global semantics before refining local details, akin to human
visual perception. Extensive experiments on the NSD dataset show that MindHier
achieves superior semantic fidelity, 4.67x faster inference, and more
deterministic results than the diffusion-based baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate intrinsic parameter estimation is critical for endoscopic 3D reconstruction but challenging due to sterility constraints and specialized endoscopes with continuous zoom/rotation. Most existing methods don't estimate intrinsics, limiting reconstruction accuracy.

Method: Adapt Depth Anything V2 model for joint depth, pose, and intrinsics prediction. Introduce attention-based pose network and Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) strategy for efficient fine-tuning.

Result: Validated on SCARED and C3VD datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches in self-supervised monocular depth estimation and 3D reconstruction.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively integrates intrinsic parameter estimation into endoscopic 3D reconstruction framework, addressing key challenges in surgical settings and achieving improved reconstruction accuracy.

Abstract: 3D reconstruction of endoscopic surgery scenes plays a vital role in
enhancing scene perception, enabling AR visualization, and supporting
context-aware decision-making in image-guided surgery. A critical yet
challenging step in this process is the accurate estimation of the endoscope's
intrinsic parameters. In real surgical settings, intrinsic calibration is
hindered by sterility constraints and the use of specialized endoscopes with
continuous zoom and telescope rotation. Most existing methods for endoscopic 3D
reconstruction do not estimate intrinsic parameters, limiting their
effectiveness for accurate and reliable reconstruction. In this paper, we
integrate intrinsic parameter estimation into a self-supervised monocular depth
estimation framework by adapting the Depth Anything V2 (DA2) model for joint
depth, pose, and intrinsics prediction. We introduce an attention-based pose
network and a Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) strategy for
efficient fine-tuning of DA2. Our method is validated on the SCARED and C3VD
public datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to recent

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: T2SMark is a two-stage watermarking scheme for diffusion models that balances watermark robustness with generation diversity using Tail-Truncated Sampling and session keys.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Noise-as-Watermark methods struggle to balance watermark robustness with generation diversity - some sacrifice diversity for robustness while others are too fragile for real-world use.

Method: Proposes T2SMark with Tail-Truncated Sampling that embeds bits in reliable tail regions while randomly sampling central zones, plus a two-stage framework with session keys for encryption.

Result: Achieves optimal balance between robustness and diversity on diffusion models with both U-Net and DiT backbones, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: T2SMark successfully addresses the trade-off between watermark robustness and generation diversity in diffusion models through innovative sampling and encryption techniques.

Abstract: Diffusion models have advanced rapidly in recent years, producing
high-fidelity images while raising concerns about intellectual property
protection and the misuse of generative AI. Image watermarking for diffusion
models, particularly Noise-as-Watermark (NaW) methods, encode watermark as
specific standard Gaussian noise vector for image generation, embedding the
infomation seamlessly while maintaining image quality. For detection, the
generation process is inverted to recover the initial noise vector containing
the watermark before extraction. However, existing NaW methods struggle to
balance watermark robustness with generation diversity. Some methods achieve
strong robustness by heavily constraining initial noise sampling, which
degrades user experience, while others preserve diversity but prove too fragile
for real-world deployment. To address this issue, we propose T2SMark, a
two-stage watermarking scheme based on Tail-Truncated Sampling (TTS). Unlike
prior methods that simply map bits to positive or negative values, TTS enhances
robustness by embedding bits exclusively in the reliable tail regions while
randomly sampling the central zone to preserve the latent distribution. Our
two-stage framework then ensures sampling diversity by integrating a randomly
generated session key into both encryption pipelines. We evaluate T2SMark on
diffusion models with both U-Net and DiT backbones. Extensive experiments show
that it achieves an optimal balance between robustness and diversity. Our code

*Tianran Li,Marius Staring,Yuchuan Qiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A recurrent correlation-based framework for deformable image registration that dynamically relocates matching regions to efficiently handle large deformations while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods for deformable image registration struggle with large deformations. Voxel-to-region matching is efficient but limited by locality, while region-to-region matching has high redundancy. There's a need for methods that can capture long-range correspondences efficiently.

Method: Proposes a recurrent correlation framework that performs local matching at each step and uses estimated offsets to guide the next search region. Uses lightweight recurrent update module with memory capacity and decouples motion-related and texture features to reduce semantic redundancy.

Result: Achieves strong accuracy-computation trade-off, surpassing or matching state-of-the-art performance. On non-affine OASIS dataset, achieves comparable performance using only 9.5% of FLOPs and running 96% faster than RDP method.

Conclusion: The proposed recurrent correlation framework effectively handles large deformations in medical image registration while maintaining computational efficiency, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Deformable image registration estimates voxel-wise correspondences between
images through spatial transformations, and plays a key role in medical
imaging. While deep learning methods have significantly reduced runtime,
efficiently handling large deformations remains a challenging task.
Convolutional networks aggregate local features but lack direct modeling of
voxel correspondences, promoting recent works to explore explicit feature
matching. Among them, voxel-to-region matching is more efficient for direct
correspondence modeling by computing local correlation features whithin
neighbourhoods, while region-to-region matching incurs higher redundancy due to
excessive correlation pairs across large regions. However, the inherent
locality of voxel-to-region matching hinders the capture of long-range
correspondences required for large deformations. To address this, we propose a
Recurrent Correlation-based framework that dynamically relocates the matching
region toward more promising positions. At each step, local matching is
performed with low cost, and the estimated offset guides the next search
region, supporting efficient convergence toward large deformations. In
addition, we uses a lightweight recurrent update module with memory capacity
and decouples motion-related and texture features to suppress semantic
redundancy. We conduct extensive experiments on brain MRI and abdominal CT
datasets under two settings: with and without affine pre-registration. Results
show that our method exibits a strong accuracy-computation trade-off,
surpassing or matching the state-of-the-art performance. For example, it
achieves comparable performance on the non-affine OASIS dataset, while using
only 9.5% of the FLOPs and running 96% faster than RDP, a representative
high-performing method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TDSR redefines image captioning as hierarchical planning using MCTS to improve VLMs' narrative coherence and detail capture while reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs struggle with maintaining global narrative coherence while capturing rich details in image captioning due to their single-step generation approach.

Method: Proposes TDSR framework modeling captioning as MDP with efficient MCTS algorithm featuring visual-guided parallel expansion, lightweight value network, and adaptive early stopping.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on DetailCaps, COMPOSITIONCAP, and POPE benchmarks, enhancing existing VLMs with significant computational efficiency gains.

Conclusion: TDSR effectively addresses the coherence-detail tradeoff in VLMs through hierarchical planning, demonstrating superior performance across multiple captioning tasks with reduced computational overhead.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) face an inherent contradiction in image
captioning: their powerful single-step generation capabilities often lead to a
myopic decision-making process. This makes it difficult to maintain global
narrative coherence while capturing rich details, a limitation that is
particularly pronounced in tasks that require multi-step and complex scene
description. To overcome this fundamental challenge, we redefine image
captioning as a goal-oriented hierarchical refinement planning problem, and
further propose a novel framework, named Top-Down Semantic Refinement (TDSR),
which models the generation process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP).
However, planning within the vast state space of a VLM presents a significant
computational hurdle. Our core contribution, therefore, is the design of a
highly efficient Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm tailored for VLMs. By
incorporating a visual-guided parallel expansion and a lightweight value
network, our TDSR reduces the call frequency to the expensive VLM by an order
of magnitude without sacrificing planning quality. Furthermore, an adaptive
early stopping mechanism dynamically matches computational overhead to the
image's complexity. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, including
DetailCaps, COMPOSITIONCAP, and POPE, demonstrate that our TDSR, as a
plug-and-play module, can significantly enhance the performance of existing
VLMs (e.g., LLaVA-1.5, Qwen2.5-VL) by achieving state-of-the-art or highly
competitive results in fine-grained description, compositional generalization,
and hallucination suppression.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR sensors provide excellent situational awareness for autonomous driving but their performance significantly deteriorates in adverse weather like snowfall, which hasn't been adequately quantified.

Method: Developed a physics-based model to examine LiDAR failure modes in snow, investigated signal attenuation with different snowfall rates, and created synthetic snowy data by transforming clear condition data.

Result: The model successfully simulates how LiDAR signals attenuate in snowy conditions and how snow particles act as reflectors, enabling comparison between synthetic and real snowy data.

Conclusion: The physics-based model and synthetic data generation approach can help assess and improve object detection model performance under various snowfall conditions for autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Because 3D structure of a roadway environment can be characterized directly
by a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors, they can be used to obtain
exceptional situational awareness for assitive and autonomous driving systems.
Although LiDARs demonstrate good performance in clean and clear weather
conditions, their performance significantly deteriorates in adverse weather
conditions such as those involving atmospheric precipitation. This may render
perception capabilities of autonomous systems that use LiDAR data in learning
based models to perform object detection and ranging ineffective. While efforts
have been made to enhance the accuracy of these models, the extent of signal
degradation under various weather conditions remains largely not quantified. In
this study, we focus on the performance of an automotive grade LiDAR in snowy
conditions in order to develop a physics-based model that examines failure
modes of a LiDAR sensor. Specifically, we investigated how the LiDAR signal
attenuates with different snowfall rates and how snow particles near the source
serve as small but efficient reflectors. Utilizing our model, we transform data
from clear conditions to simulate snowy scenarios, enabling a comparison of our
synthetic data with actual snowy conditions. Furthermore, we employ this
synthetic data, representative of different snowfall rates, to explore the
impact on a pre-trained object detection model, assessing its performance under
varying levels of snowfall

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To eliminate the effort needed to interact with assistive wearable agents by enabling them to infer user goals from multimodal contextual observations rather than requiring explicit queries.

Method: Created WAGIBench benchmark with novel dataset collection of multimodal data (visual, audio, digital, longitudinal) and evaluated several families of modern vision-language models on goal inference tasks.

Result: Human performance achieved 93% accuracy vs 84% for best VLM. Larger models perform better but remain far from practical usefulness, producing relevant goals only 55% of the time. Models benefit from relevant modalities with minimal degradation from irrelevant ones.

Conclusion: Current vision-language models show promise for goal inference but remain significantly below human performance and practical utility, indicating substantial room for improvement in this important problem domain.

Abstract: There has been a surge of interest in assistive wearable agents: agents
embodied in wearable form factors (e.g., smart glasses) who take assistive
actions toward a user's goal/query (e.g. "Where did I leave my keys?"). In this
work, we consider the important complementary problem of inferring that goal
from multi-modal contextual observations. Solving this "goal inference" problem
holds the promise of eliminating the effort needed to interact with such an
agent. This work focuses on creating WAGIBench, a strong benchmark to measure
progress in solving this problem using vision-language models (VLMs). Given the
limited prior work in this area, we collected a novel dataset comprising 29
hours of multimodal data from 348 participants across 3,477 recordings,
featuring ground-truth goals alongside accompanying visual, audio, digital, and
longitudinal contextual observations. We validate that human performance
exceeds model performance, achieving 93% multiple-choice accuracy compared with
84% for the best-performing VLM. Generative benchmark results that evaluate
several families of modern vision-language models show that larger models
perform significantly better on the task, yet remain far from practical
usefulness, as they produce relevant goals only 55% of the time. Through a
modality ablation, we show that models benefit from extra information in
relevant modalities with minimal performance degradation from irrelevant
modalities.

Result: Improves F1 score by 10% over supervised baselines on the CZII dataset.

Conclusion: Semi-supervised learning effectively leverages unlabeled CryoET data to overcome labeling bottlenecks.

Abstract: Cryogenic Electron Tomography (CryoET) combined with sub-volume averaging
(SVA) is the only imaging modality capable of resolving protein structures
inside cells at molecular resolution. Particle picking, the task of localizing
and classifying target proteins in 3D CryoET volumes, remains the main
bottleneck. Due to the reliance on time-consuming manual labels, the vast
reserve of unlabeled tomograms remains underutilized. In this work, we present
a fast, label-efficient semi-supervised framework that exploits this untapped
data. Our framework consists of two components: (i) an end-to-end
heatmap-supervised detection model inspired by keypoint detection, and (ii) a
teacher-student co-training mechanism that enhances performance under sparse
labeling conditions. Furthermore, we introduce multi-view pseudo-labeling and a
CryoET-specific DropBlock augmentation strategy to further boost performance.
Extensive evaluations on the large-scale CZII dataset show that our approach

capturing dynamic geometry changes, especially when considering variations in
camera perspective. To address this issue, we propose DynaPose4D, an innovative
solution that integrates 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) techniques with
Category-Agnostic Pose Estimation (CAPE) technology. This framework uses 3D
Gaussian Splatting to construct a 3D model from single images, then predicts
multi-view pose keypoints based on one-shot support from a chosen view,
leveraging supervisory signals to enhance motion consistency. Experimental
results show that DynaPose4D achieves excellent coherence, consistency, and
fluidity in dynamic motion generation. These findings not only validate the
efficacy of the DynaPose4D framework but also indicate its potential
applications in the domains of computer vision and animation production.

### [97] [Single-Teacher View Augmentation: Boosting Knowledge Distillation via Angular Diversity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22480)
*Seonghoon Yu,Dongjun Nam,Dina Katabi,Jeany Son*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a cost-efficient knowledge distillation method that generates diverse multi-views from a single teacher using angular diversity objectives, outperforming existing knowledge augmentation approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing knowledge distillation methods require multiple teacher networks for diversity, leading to high computational costs. The goal is to achieve similar diversity benefits using only a single teacher model.

Method: Attaches multiple branches to a single teacher to generate diverse multi-views. Uses two angular diversity objectives: constrained inter-angle diversify loss (maximizes angles between views while preserving proximity to teacher output) and intra-angle diversify loss (encourages even distribution of views around original output).

Result: Method surpasses existing knowledge augmentation approaches across diverse configurations and provides consistent improvements in generalization performance when integrated with other KD frameworks.

Conclusion: The proposed angular diversity-based knowledge augmentation method enables cost-efficient knowledge distillation from a single teacher while maintaining performance comparable to multiple-teacher approaches.

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) aims to train a lightweight student model by
transferring knowledge from a large, high-capacity teacher. Recent studies have
shown that leveraging diverse teacher perspectives can significantly improve
distillation performance; however, achieving such diversity typically requires
multiple teacher networks, leading to high computational costs. In this work,
we propose a novel cost-efficient knowledge augmentation method for KD that
generates diverse multi-views by attaching multiple branches to a single
teacher. To ensure meaningful semantic variation across multi-views, we
introduce two angular diversity objectives: 1) constrained inter-angle
diversify loss, which maximizes angles between augmented views while preserving
proximity to the original teacher output, and 2) intra-angle diversify loss,
which encourages an even distribution of views around the original output. The
ensembled knowledge from these angularly diverse views, along with the original
teacher, is distilled into the student. We further theoretically demonstrate
that our objectives increase the diversity among ensemble members and thereby
reduce the upper bound of the ensemble's expected loss, leading to more
effective distillation. Experimental results show that our method surpasses an
existing knowledge augmentation method across diverse configurations. Moreover,
the proposed method is compatible with other KD frameworks in a plug-and-play
fashion, providing consistent improvements in generalization performance.

TL;DR: GateFuseNet is a 3D multimodal fusion network that combines QSM and T1w MRI images for Parkinson's disease diagnosis, using gated fusion modules to selectively enhance relevant features and suppress noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PD diagnosis from MRI is challenging due to symptom variability and pathological heterogeneity. T1w images are less sensitive to PD pathology than QSM, which better quantifies iron deposition in deep gray matter nuclei.

Method: Proposed GateFuseNet with adaptive 3D multimodal fusion that integrates QSM and T1w images. Uses gated fusion module with modality-specific attention weights and channel-wise gating vectors for selective feature modulation and hierarchical gating mechanism.

Result: Outperforms three state-of-the-art approaches with 85.00% accuracy and 92.06% AUC. Ablation studies validate ROI guidance, multimodal integration, and fusion positioning. Grad-CAM visualizations confirm focus on clinically relevant pathological regions.

Conclusion: GateFuseNet effectively integrates multimodal MRI data for improved PD diagnosis, demonstrating superior performance through adaptive feature fusion and selective attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) from MRI remains challenging
due to symptom variability and pathological heterogeneity. Most existing
methods rely on conventional magnitude-based MRI modalities, such as
T1-weighted images (T1w), which are less sensitive to PD pathology than
Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM), a phase-based MRI technique that
quantifies iron deposition in deep gray matter nuclei. In this study, we
propose GateFuseNet, an adaptive 3D multimodal fusion network that integrates
QSM and T1w images for PD diagnosis. The core innovation lies in a gated fusion
module that learns modality-specific attention weights and channel-wise gating
vectors for selective feature modulation. This hierarchical gating mechanism
enhances ROI-aware features while suppressing irrelevant signals. Experimental
results show that our method outperforms three existing state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving 85.00% accuracy and 92.06% AUC. Ablation studies further
validate the contributions of ROI guidance, multimodal integration, and fusion
positioning. Grad-CAM visualizations confirm the model's focus on clinically
relevant pathological regions. The source codes and pretrained models can be

*Yang Tian,Fan Liu,Jingyuan Zhang,Wei Bi,Yupeng Hu,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ORIG is an agentic open multimodal retrieval-augmented framework that improves factual image generation by iteratively retrieving and filtering web evidence to create enriched prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LMMs often generate images that contradict verifiable knowledge, especially for fine-grained attributes or time-sensitive events, due to reliance on static sources and shallow evidence integration.

Method: ORIG iteratively retrieves and filters multimodal evidence from the web, then incrementally integrates refined knowledge into enriched prompts to guide generation.

Result: Experiments show ORIG substantially improves factual consistency and overall image quality over strong baselines across ten categories in the FIG-Eval benchmark.

Conclusion: ORIG demonstrates the potential of open multimodal retrieval for factual image generation, bridging the gap between visual realism and factual accuracy.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
generating photorealistic and prompt-aligned images, but they often produce
outputs that contradict verifiable knowledge, especially when prompts involve
fine-grained attributes or time-sensitive events. Conventional
retrieval-augmented approaches attempt to address this issue by introducing
external information, yet they are fundamentally incapable of grounding
generation in accurate and evolving knowledge due to their reliance on static
sources and shallow evidence integration. To bridge this gap, we introduce
ORIG, an agentic open multimodal retrieval-augmented framework for Factual
Image Generation (FIG), a new task that requires both visual realism and
factual grounding. ORIG iteratively retrieves and filters multimodal evidence
from the web and incrementally integrates the refined knowledge into enriched
prompts to guide generation. To support systematic evaluation, we build
FIG-Eval, a benchmark spanning ten categories across perceptual, compositional,
and temporal dimensions. Experiments demonstrate that ORIG substantially
improves factual consistency and overall image quality over strong baselines,
highlighting the potential of open multimodal retrieval for factual image
generation.

*Yen-Hong Wong,Lai-Kuan Wong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AesCrop is a composition-aware hybrid image cropping model that uses VMamba encoder with Mamba Composition Attention Bias and transformer decoder to generate multiple aesthetic crops with quality scores, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hybrid image cropping methods lack explicit photographic composition guidance, which is crucial for visual appeal and user engagement in applications like view recommendation and thumbnail generation.

Method: AesCrop integrates VMamba image encoder with novel Mamba Composition Attention Bias (MCAB) and transformer decoder for end-to-end rank-based image cropping. MCAB explicitly encodes compositional cues into attention mechanism to focus on compositionally salient regions.

Result: Extensive experiments show AesCrop outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior quantitative metrics and producing qualitatively more pleasing crops.

Conclusion: AesCrop successfully bridges the gap between evaluation-based and regression-based approaches by incorporating explicit compositional guidance, delivering better diversity and globality in aesthetic image cropping.

Abstract: Aesthetic-driven image cropping is crucial for applications like view
recommendation and thumbnail generation, where visual appeal significantly
impacts user engagement. A key factor in visual appeal is composition--the
deliberate arrangement of elements within an image. Some methods have
successfully incorporated compositional knowledge through evaluation-based and
regression-based paradigms. However, evaluation-based methods lack globality
while regression-based methods lack diversity. Recently, hybrid approaches that
integrate both paradigms have emerged, bridging the gap between these two to
achieve better diversity and globality. Notably, existing hybrid methods do not
incorporate photographic composition guidance, a key attribute that defines
photographic aesthetics. In this work, we introduce AesCrop, a
composition-aware hybrid image-cropping model that integrates a VMamba image
encoder, augmented with a novel Mamba Composition Attention Bias (MCAB) and a
transformer decoder to perform end-to-end rank-based image cropping, generating
multiple crops along with the corresponding quality scores. By explicitly
encoding compositional cues into the attention mechanism, MCAB directs AesCrop
to focus on the most compositionally salient regions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that AesCrop outperforms current state-of-the-art methods,
delivering superior quantitative metrics and qualitatively more pleasing crops.

TL;DR: BoWG is a novel loop closure detection method that introduces word groups to capture spatial co-occurrence of visual words, incorporates temporal consistency, and achieves superior precision-recall with high computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional loop closure methods struggle in perceptually aliased environments like narrow pipes due to vector quantization, feature sparsity, and repetitive textures, while existing solutions often have high computational costs.

Method: Introduces Bag-of-Word-Groups (BoWG) with word groups capturing spatial co-occurrence and proximity of visual words, incorporates temporal consistency into similarity computation with adaptive scheme, adds feature distribution analysis and post-verification mechanisms.

Result: BoWG surpasses state-of-the-art methods in precision-recall and computational efficiency, achieving 16 ms average processing time per image on Bicocca25b dataset with 17,565 images, and shows excellent scalability.

Conclusion: The proposed BoWG method effectively addresses challenges in perceptually aliased environments, demonstrating superior performance in loop closure detection with high computational efficiency and robustness.

Abstract: Loop closure is critical in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
systems to reduce accumulative drift and ensure global mapping consistency.
However, conventional methods struggle in perceptually aliased environments,
such as narrow pipes, due to vector quantization, feature sparsity, and
repetitive textures, while existing solutions often incur high computational
costs. This paper presents Bag-of-Word-Groups (BoWG), a novel loop closure
detection method that achieves superior precision-recall, robustness, and
computational efficiency. The core innovation lies in the introduction of word
groups, which captures the spatial co-occurrence and proximity of visual words
to construct an online dictionary. Additionally, drawing inspiration from
probabilistic transition models, we incorporate temporal consistency directly
into similarity computation with an adaptive scheme, substantially improving
precision-recall performance. The method is further strengthened by a feature
distribution analysis module and dedicated post-verification mechanisms. To
evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on both public
datasets and a confined-pipe dataset we constructed. Results demonstrate that
BoWG surpasses state-of-the-art methods, including both traditional and
learning-based approaches, in terms of precision-recall and computational
efficiency. Our approach also exhibits excellent scalability, achieving an
average processing time of 16 ms per image across 17,565 images in the
Bicocca25b dataset.

*Chen Chen,Majid Abdolshah,Violetta Shevchenko,Hongdong Li,Chang Xu,Pulak Purkait*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes SRSR framework with SRCA and STCFG to address semantic ambiguities in diffusion-based super-resolution by refining text conditioning and preventing hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based super-resolution methods suffer from semantic ambiguities due to inaccurate text conditioning and cross-attention diversion to irrelevant pixels, leading to misalignment and hallucinations.

Method: SRSR framework with two components: Spatially Re-focused Cross-Attention (SRCA) using segmentation masks to guide cross-attention, and Spatially Targeted Classifier-Free Guidance (STCFG) to bypass text influences on ungrounded pixels.

Result: Outperforms seven state-of-the-art baselines in fidelity metrics (PSNR, SSIM) across all datasets and perceptual quality (LPIPS, DISTS) on real-world benchmarks.

Conclusion: SRSR effectively achieves high semantic fidelity and perceptual quality in super-resolution by addressing text conditioning inaccuracies and preventing hallucinations.

Abstract: Existing diffusion-based super-resolution approaches often exhibit semantic
ambiguities due to inaccuracies and incompleteness in their text conditioning,
coupled with the inherent tendency for cross-attention to divert towards
irrelevant pixels. These limitations can lead to semantic misalignment and
hallucinated details in the generated high-resolution outputs. To address
these, we propose a novel, plug-and-play spatially re-focused super-resolution
(SRSR) framework that consists of two core components: first, we introduce
Spatially Re-focused Cross-Attention (SRCA), which refines text conditioning at
inference time by applying visually-grounded segmentation masks to guide
cross-attention. Second, we introduce a Spatially Targeted Classifier-Free
Guidance (STCFG) mechanism that selectively bypasses text influences on
ungrounded pixels to prevent hallucinations. Extensive experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that SRSR consistently
outperforms seven state-of-the-art baselines in standard fidelity metrics (PSNR
and SSIM) across all datasets, and in perceptual quality measures (LPIPS and
DISTS) on two real-world benchmarks, underscoring its effectiveness in
achieving both high semantic fidelity and perceptual quality in
super-resolution.

*Mahiro Ukai,Shuhei Kurita,Nakamasa Inoue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STATUS Bench is the first benchmark for evaluating Vision-Language Models' ability to understand subtle object state variations through three simultaneous tasks: object state identification, image retrieval, and state change identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While VLMs can perform various multimodal tasks, it's unclear how precisely they can identify subtle object states like positional (open/closed) and functional (on/off) conditions.

Method: Created STATUS Bench with hand-crafted image pairs and descriptions, and STATUS Train with 13M semi-automatic descriptions. Evaluates VLMs on three simultaneous tasks: OSI, IR, and SCI.

Result: Current SOTA VLMs significantly struggle with subtle object state distinctions. Most open-weight VLMs showed chance-level zero-shot performance. After fine-tuning on STATUS Train, Qwen2.5-VL achieved performance comparable to Gemini 2.0 Flash.

Conclusion: STATUS Bench and Train are necessary for advancing object state recognition in VLM research, as current models still face challenges in capturing subtle state variations despite their general multimodal capabilities.

Abstract: Object state recognition aims to identify the specific condition of objects,
such as their positional states (e.g., open or closed) and functional states
(e.g., on or off). While recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are capable of
performing a variety of multimodal tasks, it remains unclear how precisely they
can identify object states. To alleviate this issue, we introduce the STAte and
Transition UnderStanding Benchmark (STATUS Bench), the first benchmark for
rigorously evaluating the ability of VLMs to understand subtle variations in
object states in diverse situations. Specifically, STATUS Bench introduces a
novel evaluation scheme that requires VLMs to perform three tasks
simultaneously: object state identification (OSI), image retrieval (IR), and
state change identification (SCI). These tasks are defined over our fully
hand-crafted dataset involving image pairs, their corresponding object state
descriptions and state change descriptions. Furthermore, we introduce a
large-scale training dataset, namely STATUS Train, which consists of 13 million
semi-automatically created descriptions. This dataset serves as the largest
resource to facilitate further research in this area. In our experiments, we
demonstrate that STATUS Bench enables rigorous consistency evaluation and
reveal that current state-of-the-art VLMs still significantly struggle to
capture subtle object state distinctions. Surprisingly, under the proposed
rigorous evaluation scheme, most open-weight VLMs exhibited chance-level
zero-shot performance. After fine-tuning on STATUS Train, Qwen2.5-VL achieved
performance comparable to Gemini 2.0 Flash. These findings underscore the
necessity of STATUS Bench and Train for advancing object state recognition in
VLM research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the first micro-expression dataset for conversational-in-the-wild scenarios, proposes an end-to-end localization and detection framework called MELDAE, and develops a novel boundary-aware loss function to improve temporal accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing micro-expression analysis research relies on controlled laboratory datasets and performs poorly in real-world scenarios like natural conversations, creating a need for better methods that work in wild settings.

Method: The authors propose MELDAE, an end-to-end framework for micro-expression localization and detection, along with a novel boundary-aware loss function that specifically penalizes onset and offset errors to improve temporal accuracy.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art results on the WDMD dataset, improving the F1_{DR} localization metric by 17.72% over the strongest baseline, and demonstrates excellent generalization capabilities on existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses the challenge of micro-expression analysis in wild scenarios through a new dataset, end-to-end framework, and boundary-aware loss function, achieving significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Accurately analyzing spontaneous, unconscious micro-expressions is crucial
for revealing true human emotions, but this task remains challenging in wild
scenarios, such as natural conversation. Existing research largely relies on
datasets from controlled laboratory environments, and their performance
degrades dramatically in the real world. To address this issue, we propose
three contributions: the first micro-expression dataset focused on
conversational-in-the-wild scenarios; an end-to-end localization and detection
framework, MELDAE; and a novel boundary-aware loss function that improves
temporal accuracy by penalizing onset and offset errors. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art results on the WDMD
dataset, improving the key F1_{DR} localization metric by 17.72% over the
strongest baseline, while also demonstrating excellent generalization
capabilities on existing benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Light field microscopy is emerging for neural imaging but faces challenges in 3D reconstruction due to lack of standardized datasets and efficient methods that can model angular-spatial structure while remaining physically grounded.

Method: Three key contributions: XLFM-Zebrafish benchmark dataset, Masked View Modeling for Light Fields (self-supervised learning), and Optical Rendering Consistency Loss (differentiable rendering constraint).

Result: On the XLFM-Zebrafish benchmark, the method improves PSNR by 7.7% over state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses core challenges in XLFM reconstruction through standardized benchmarking, self-supervised learning, and physically-grounded constraints, achieving significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Light field microscopy (LFM) has become an emerging tool in neuroscience for
large-scale neural imaging in vivo, notable for its single-exposure volumetric
imaging, broad field of view, and high temporal resolution. However,
learning-based 3D reconstruction in XLFM remains underdeveloped due to two core
challenges: the absence of standardized datasets and the lack of methods that
can efficiently model its angular-spatial structure while remaining physically
grounded. We address these challenges by introducing three key contributions.
First, we construct the XLFM-Zebrafish benchmark, a large-scale dataset and
evaluation suite for XLFM reconstruction. Second, we propose Masked View
Modeling for Light Fields (MVN-LF), a self-supervised task that learns angular
priors by predicting occluded views, improving data efficiency. Third, we
formulate the Optical Rendering Consistency Loss (ORC Loss), a differentiable
rendering constraint that enforces alignment between predicted volumes and
their PSF-based forward projections. On the XLFM-Zebrafish benchmark, our
method improves PSNR by 7.7% over state-of-the-art baselines.

Motivation: Existing cross-view geo-localization methods rely on resource-intensive fine-grained feature extraction and alignment, making them unsuitable for deployment on edge devices in GNSS-denied environments.

Method: Proposes PFED framework with two key components: 1) Hierarchical Distillation with Uncertainty-Aware Prediction Alignment during training to distill essential information without inference overhead, and 2) Multi-view Refinement Module during inference to filter redundant samples and utilize multi-view data efficiently.

Result: Achieves 97.15% Recall@1 on University-1652 dataset, with over 5x efficiency in FLOPs and 3x faster inference than previous methods. Runs at 251.5 FPS on AGX Orin edge device.

Conclusion: PFED demonstrates practical viability for real-time UAV applications by balancing high accuracy with computational efficiency, making it suitable for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices.

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) enables UAV localization by matching
aerial images to geo-tagged satellite databases, which is critical for
autonomous navigation in GNSS-denied environments. However, existing methods
rely on resource-intensive fine-grained feature extraction and alignment, where
multiple branches and modules significantly increase inference costs, limiting
their deployment on edge devices. We propose Precision-Focused Efficient Design
(PFED), a resource-efficient framework combining hierarchical knowledge
transfer and multi-view representation refinement. This innovative method
comprises two key components: 1) During training, Hierarchical Distillation
paradigm for fast and accurate CVGL (HD-CVGL), coupled with Uncertainty-Aware
Prediction Alignment (UAPA) to distill essential information and mitigate the
data imbalance without incurring additional inference overhead. 2) During
inference, an efficient Multi-view Refinement Module (MRM) leverages mutual

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of previous methods that rely on fully labelled or single-domain datasets, by learning from multiple partially labelled datasets with different distributions while handling both label absence and domain shift challenges.

Method: Three-branch architecture with one teacher and two student networks. Teacher generates pseudo labels from weakly augmented images.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance and superior domain generalization ability on multiple in-domain and out-of-domain fundus datasets. Shows universality and adaptability with diverse backbones including DINOv2 and evaluations on chest X-ray datasets.

Conclusion: PSScreen V2 provides an effective framework for multiple retinal disease screening that handles partial labels and domain shifts, demonstrating strong performance, generalization, and cross-domain adaptability.

Abstract: In this work, we propose PSScreen V2, a partially supervised self-training
framework for multiple retinal disease screening. Unlike previous methods that
rely on fully labelled or single-domain datasets, PSScreen V2 is designed to
learn from multiple partially labelled datasets with different distributions,
addressing both label absence and domain shift challenges. To this end,
PSScreen V2 adopts a three-branch architecture with one teacher and two student
networks. The teacher branch generates pseudo labels from weakly augmented
images to address missing labels, while the two student branches introduce
novel feature augmentation strategies: Low-Frequency Dropout (LF-Dropout),
which enhances domain robustness by randomly discarding domain-related
low-frequency components, and Low-Frequency Uncertainty (LF-Uncert), which
estimates uncertain domain variability via adversarially learned Gaussian
perturbations of low-frequency statistics. Extensive experiments on multiple
in-domain and out-of-domain fundus datasets demonstrate that PSScreen V2
achieves state-of-the-art performance and superior domain generalization
ability. Furthermore, compatibility tests with diverse backbones, including the
vision foundation model DINOv2, as well as evaluations on chest X-ray datasets,
highlight the universality and adaptability of the proposed framework. The

TL;DR: PEDB is a novel diffusion bridge model that incorporates data consistency for CT reconstruction from incomplete projection data, outperforming existing methods across sparse-view, limited-angle, and truncated projection scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion bridge models for CT reconstruction don't adequately incorporate data consistency, which is crucial for aligning reconstructed images with observed projection data and improving detail recovery.

Method: Proposes Projection Embedded Diffusion Bridge (PEDB) with a novel reverse SDE that samples clean images conditioned on both FBP reconstruction and incomplete projection data, embedding projection data into the score function and introducing stochasticity control.

Result: PEDB achieves strong performance across three types of incomplete CT data (sparse-view, limited-angle, truncated projections), outperforming state-of-the-art diffusion bridge models in standard, noisy, and domain-shift evaluations.

Conclusion: Explicitly conditioning on projection data in the sampling process enables effective data consistency incorporation, making PEDB a superior approach for ill-posed CT reconstruction problems.

Abstract: Reconstructing CT images from incomplete projection data remains challenging
due to the ill-posed nature of the problem. Diffusion bridge models have
recently shown promise in restoring clean images from their corresponding
Filtered Back Projection (FBP) reconstructions, but incorporating data
consistency into these models remains largely underexplored. Incorporating data
consistency can improve reconstruction fidelity by aligning the reconstructed
image with the observed projection data, and can enhance detail recovery by
integrating structural information contained in the projections. In this work,
we propose the Projection Embedded Diffusion Bridge (PEDB). PEDB introduces a
novel reverse stochastic differential equation (SDE) to sample from the
distribution of clean images conditioned on both the FBP reconstruction and the
incomplete projection data. By explicitly conditioning on the projection data
in sampling the clean images, PEDB naturally incorporates data consistency. We
embed the projection data into the score function of the reverse SDE. Under
certain assumptions, we derive a tractable expression for the posterior score.
In addition, we introduce a free parameter to control the level of
stochasticity in the reverse process. We also design a discretization scheme
for the reverse SDE to mitigate discretization error. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PEDB achieves strong performance in CT reconstruction from
three types of incomplete data, including sparse-view, limited-angle, and
truncated projections. For each of these types, PEDB outperforms evaluated
state-of-the-art diffusion bridge models across standard, noisy, and
domain-shift evaluations.

*Yassh Ramchandani,Vijayashekhar S S,Jignesh S. Bhatt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SWAN is a three-stage self-supervised wavelet neural network for hyperspectral unmixing that estimates endmembers and abundances without ground truth by leveraging wavelet transforms and physics-based learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address hyperspectral unmixing challenges by developing a self-supervised method that eliminates the need for ground truth data and exploits latent symmetries in wavelet-transformed hyperspectral imagery.

Method: Three-stage architecture: SWANencoder maps wavelet coefficients to latent space, SWANdecoder reconstructs wavelet coefficients, and SWANforward learns underlying physics. Uses wavelet transforms, self-supervised learning, Adam optimization, dropout, and kernel regularizers.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art neural network-based unmixing methods on synthetic and real benchmark datasets, showing enhanced performance through resilient unmixing functions and compact network parameters.

Conclusion: SWAN provides an effective self-supervised approach for hyperspectral unmixing that learns physical principles while eliminating ground truth dependency, making it practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: In this article, we present SWAN: a three-stage, self-supervised wavelet
neural network for joint estimation of endmembers and abundances from
hyperspectral imagery. The contiguous and overlapping hyperspectral band images
are first expanded to Biorthogonal wavelet basis space that provides sparse,
distributed, and multi-scale representations. The idea is to exploit latent
symmetries from thus obtained invariant and covariant features using a
self-supervised learning paradigm. The first stage, SWANencoder maps the input
wavelet coefficients to a compact lower-dimensional latent space. The second
stage, SWANdecoder uses the derived latent representation to reconstruct the
input wavelet coefficients. Interestingly, the third stage SWANforward learns
the underlying physics of the hyperspectral image. A three-stage combined loss
function is formulated in the image acquisition domain that eliminates the need
for ground truth and enables self-supervised training. Adam is employed for
optimizing the proposed loss function, while Sigmoid with a dropout of 0.3 is
incorporated to avoid possible overfitting. Kernel regularizers bound the
magnitudes and preserve spatial variations in the estimated endmember
coefficients. The output of SWANencoder represents estimated abundance maps
during inference, while weights of SWANdecoder are retrieved to extract
endmembers. Experiments are conducted on two benchmark synthetic data sets with
different signal-to-noise ratios as well as on three real benchmark
hyperspectral data sets while comparing the results with several
state-of-the-art neural network-based unmixing methods. The qualitative,
quantitative, and ablation results show performance enhancement by learning a
resilient unmixing function as well as promoting self-supervision and compact

*Mackenzie Tapp,Sibi Chakravarthy Parivendan,Kashfia Sailunaz,Suresh Neethirajan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Evaluated cross-species transfer learning using ZebraPose (ViT-based model trained on synthetic zebra data) for 27-keypoint pose estimation in dairy cows. Found promising in-distribution performance but significant generalization failures across different barn environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address scarcity of large annotated datasets for livestock pose estimation by leveraging cross-species transfer learning from synthetic zebra data to real dairy cattle.

Method: Adapted ZebraPose model for dairy cow pose estimation using three configurations: custom on-farm dataset (375 images), APT-36K subset, and their combination. Evaluated accuracy and generalization across different barn environments.

Result: Combined model achieved good in-distribution performance (AP=0.86, AR=0.87, PCK 0.5=0.869) but showed substantial generalization failures when applied to unseen barns and cow populations.

Conclusion: Synthetic-to-real domain gap is major obstacle; morphological similarity insufficient for cross-domain transfer. Calls for agriculture-first AI design prioritizing farm-level realism and cross-environment robustness.

Abstract: Pose estimation serves as a cornerstone of computer vision for understanding
animal posture, behavior, and welfare. Yet, agricultural applications remain
constrained by the scarcity of large, annotated datasets for livestock,
especially dairy cattle. This study evaluates the potential and limitations of
cross-species transfer learning by adapting ZebraPose - a vision
transformer-based model trained on synthetic zebra imagery - for 27-keypoint
detection in dairy cows under real barn conditions. Using three configurations
- a custom on-farm dataset (375 images, Sussex, New Brunswick, Canada), a
subset of the APT-36K benchmark dataset, and their combination, we
systematically assessed model accuracy and generalization across environments.
While the combined model achieved promising performance (AP = 0.86, AR = 0.87,
PCK 0.5 = 0.869) on in-distribution data, substantial generalization failures
occurred when applied to unseen barns and cow populations. These findings
expose the synthetic-to-real domain gap as a major obstacle to agricultural AI
deployment and emphasize that morphological similarity between species is
insufficient for cross-domain transfer. The study provides practical insights
into dataset diversity, environmental variability, and computational
constraints that influence real-world deployment of livestock monitoring
systems. We conclude with a call for agriculture-first AI design, prioritizing
farm-level realism, cross-environment robustness, and open benchmark datasets
to advance trustworthy and scalable animal-centric technologies.

objectives yields a robust, domain-generalizable framework for atypical mitosis
classification suitable for real-world computational pathology workflows.

*Tharun Anand,Mohammad Hassan Vali,Arno Solin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An analytical method to derive semantic editing directions directly from pretrained diffusion model parameters without additional data or fine-tuning, using self-attention weight matrices' eigenvectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for finding interpretable editing directions in diffusion models rely on sampling large image sets or training auxiliary networks, which limits efficiency.

Method: Compute eigenvectors of self-attention weight matrices in pretrained diffusion models to obtain robust and interpretable editing directions without additional data or fine-tuning.

Result: Produces high-quality edits across multiple datasets while reducing editing time by 60% over current benchmarks.

Conclusion: The method provides efficient and effective semantic control over diffusion model outputs by leveraging intrinsic structural information in pretrained parameters.

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve remarkable fidelity in image synthesis, yet precise
control over their outputs for targeted editing remains challenging. A key step
toward controllability is to identify interpretable directions in the model's
latent representations that correspond to semantic attributes. Existing
approaches for finding interpretable directions typically rely on sampling
large sets of images or training auxiliary networks, which limits efficiency.
We propose an analytical method that derives semantic editing directions
directly from the pretrained parameters of diffusion models, requiring neither
additional data nor fine-tuning. Our insight is that self-attention weight
matrices encode rich structural information about the data distribution learned
during training. By computing the eigenvectors of these weight matrices, we
obtain robust and interpretable editing directions. Experiments demonstrate
that our method produces high-quality edits across multiple datasets while
reducing editing time significantly by 60% over current benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SARCLIP is the first vision-language foundation model for SAR imagery, trained on a large-scale dataset (SARCLIP-1M) using contrastive learning to bridge SAR images and text descriptions, achieving superior performance in retrieval and zero-shot classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SAR foundation models focus on low-level visual features but overlook multimodal alignment and zero-shot target recognition. There's a need to bridge the gap between SAR imagery and textual descriptions for better semantic understanding.

Method: Constructed SARCLIP-1M dataset with 1M+ text-image pairs, then trained SARCLIP model using contrastive vision-language learning with domain transfer strategy.

Result: SARCLIP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art foundation models in image-text retrieval and zero-shot classification tasks, demonstrating superior feature extraction and interpretation capabilities.

Conclusion: SARCLIP advances semantic understanding of SAR imagery by effectively bridging visual and textual domains, with code and datasets to be released for broader use.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has emerged as a crucial imaging modality due
to its all-weather capabilities. While recent advancements in self-supervised
learning and Masked Image Modeling (MIM) have paved the way for SAR foundation
models, these approaches primarily focus on low-level visual features, often
overlooking multimodal alignment and zero-shot target recognition within SAR
imagery. To address this limitation, we construct SARCLIP-1M, a large-scale
vision language dataset comprising over one million text-image pairs aggregated
from existing datasets. We further introduce SARCLIP, the first vision language
foundation model tailored for the SAR domain. Our SARCLIP model is trained
using a contrastive vision language learning approach by domain transferring
strategy, enabling it to bridge the gap between SAR imagery and textual
descriptions. Extensive experiments on image-text retrieval and zero-shot
classification tasks demonstrate the superior performance of SARCLIP in feature
extraction and interpretation, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art
foundation models and advancing the semantic understanding of SAR imagery. The
code and datasets will be released soon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM methods rely on single representation schemes, leading to cumulative pose errors and scale ambiguity in large-scale dynamic outdoor scenes.

Method: Proposes hierarchical collaborative representation module for mutual reinforcement in mapping optimization, and joint dynamic modeling module that fuses open-world segmentation with implicit residual constraints using DINO-Depth uncertainty estimates.

Result: Extensive evaluations on KITTI, nuScenes, and self-collected datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: LVD-GS effectively mitigates scale drift and enhances reconstruction robustness in large-scale dynamic outdoor environments.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM has emerged as a widely used technique for
high-fidelity mapping in spatial intelligence. However, existing methods often
rely on a single representation scheme, which limits their performance in
large-scale dynamic outdoor scenes and leads to cumulative pose errors and
scale ambiguity. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{LVD-GS}, a
novel LiDAR-Visual 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM system. Motivated by the human
chain-of-thought process for information seeking, we introduce a hierarchical
collaborative representation module that facilitates mutual reinforcement for
mapping optimization, effectively mitigating scale drift and enhancing
reconstruction robustness. Furthermore, to effectively eliminate the influence
of dynamic objects, we propose a joint dynamic modeling module that generates
fine-grained dynamic masks by fusing open-world segmentation with implicit
residual constraints, guided by uncertainty estimates from DINO-Depth features.
Extensive evaluations on KITTI, nuScenes, and self-collected datasets
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to
existing methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Alias-Free ViT with alias-free downsampling/nonlinearities and shift-equivariant attention to address ViT's lack of translation invariance and improve robustness to image translations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers lack the architectural inductive bias of convnets, making them less translation-invariant and more sensitive to minor image translations than standard convnets.

Method: Combines alias-free downsampling and nonlinearities with linear cross-covariance attention that is shift-equivariant to both integer and fractional translations.

Result: Maintains competitive performance in image classification and outperforms similar-sized models in robustness to adversarial translations.

Conclusion: The Alias-Free ViT successfully addresses translation invariance issues in Vision Transformers while maintaining competitive performance and improving robustness.

Abstract: Transformers have emerged as a competitive alternative to convnets in vision
tasks, yet they lack the architectural inductive bias of convnets, which may
hinder their potential performance. Specifically, Vision Transformers (ViTs)
are not translation-invariant and are more sensitive to minor image
translations than standard convnets. Previous studies have shown, however, that
convnets are also not perfectly shift-invariant, due to aliasing in
downsampling and nonlinear layers. Consequently, anti-aliasing approaches have
been proposed to certify convnets' translation robustness. Building on this
line of work, we propose an Alias-Free ViT, which combines two main components.
First, it uses alias-free downsampling and nonlinearities. Second, it uses
linear cross-covariance attention that is shift-equivariant to both integer and
fractional translations, enabling a shift-invariant global representation. Our
model maintains competitive performance in image classification and outperforms
similar-sized models in terms of robustness to adversarial translations.

TL;DR: DAMap addresses task misalignment in HD map prediction through distance-aware focal loss, hybrid loss scheme, and task-modulated deformable attention to improve classification and localization quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current HD map prediction methods perform poorly in high-quality predictions due to task misalignment caused by inappropriate labels from one-to-many matching and sub-optimal features from task-shared sampling.

Method: Proposes DAMap with three components: Distance-aware Focal Loss (DAFL) for better classification labels, Task Modulated Deformable Attention (TMDA) for discriminative task-specific features, and Hybrid Loss Scheme (HLS) to optimize DAFL usage.

Result: Achieves consistent performance improvements on NuScenes and Argoverse2 benchmarks across different metrics, baselines, splits, backbones, and training schedules.

Conclusion: DAMap effectively addresses task misalignment in HD map prediction and demonstrates superior performance through its three-component architecture.

Abstract: Predicting High-definition (HD) map elements with high quality (high
classification and localization scores) is crucial to the safety of autonomous
driving vehicles. However, current methods perform poorly in high quality
predictions due to inherent task misalignment. Two main factors are responsible
for misalignment: 1) inappropriate task labels due to one-to-many matching
queries sharing the same labels, and 2) sub-optimal task features due to
task-shared sampling mechanism. In this paper, we reveal two inherent defects
in current methods and develop a novel HD map construction method named DAMap
to address these problems. Specifically, DAMap consists of three components:
Distance-aware Focal Loss (DAFL), Hybrid Loss Scheme (HLS), and Task Modulated
Deformable Attention (TMDA). The DAFL is introduced to assign appropriate
classification labels for one-to-many matching samples. The TMDA is proposed to
obtain discriminative task-specific features. Furthermore, the HLS is proposed
to better utilize the advantages of the DAFL. We perform extensive experiments
and consistently achieve performance improvement on the NuScenes and Argoverse2
benchmarks under different metrics, baselines, splits, backbones, and
schedules. Code will be available at https://github.com/jpdong-xjtu/DAMap.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Key building metadata needed for disaster risk assessment and insurance pricing are often missing or outdated, especially in the second-hand housing market, creating a need for automated prediction methods.

Method: Multi-task learning model that jointly estimates construction year, building structure, and property type from facade images, then derives fireproof classification (H/T/M) through rule-based mapping based on official insurance criteria.

Result: The model achieved high accuracy in construction-year regression and robust classification across imbalanced categories, capturing visual cues related to building age and materials.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates feasibility of scalable, interpretable, image-based risk-profiling systems with potential applications in insurance, urban planning, and disaster preparedness.

Abstract: Structural fireproof classification is vital for disaster risk assessment and
insurance pricing in Japan. However, key building metadata such as construction
year and structure type are often missing or outdated, particularly in the
second-hand housing market. This study proposes a multi-task learning model
that predicts these attributes from facade images. The model jointly estimates
the construction year, building structure, and property type, from which the
structural fireproof class - defined as H (non-fireproof), T (semi-fireproof),
or M (fireproof) - is derived via a rule-based mapping based on official
insurance criteria. We trained and evaluated the model using a large-scale
dataset of Japanese residential images, applying rigorous filtering and
deduplication. The model achieved high accuracy in construction-year regression
and robust classification across imbalanced categories. Qualitative analyses
show that it captures visual cues related to building age and materials. Our
approach demonstrates the feasibility of scalable, interpretable, image-based
risk-profiling systems, offering potential applications in insurance, urban
planning, and disaster preparedness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SVGs are fundamental for digital design and robot control, encoding both visual structure and motion paths, but existing methods lack unified multimodal guidance for interactive SVG generation.

Method: A three-stage framework: first produces multimodal guidance from input queries, then synthesizes candidate SVGs through dedicated generation modules, and finally refines them under numerical guidance. Supported by RoboDraw dataset of 1M SVG examples.

Result: Achieves superior query compliance and visual fidelity across four tasks (Text-to-SVG, Image-to-SVG, PartialSVG-to-SVG, PartialImage-to-SVG), establishing new state-of-the-art in versatile SVG generation.

Conclusion: RoboSVG provides a unified solution for interactive SVG generation with multimodal guidance, and the RoboDraw dataset enables systematic study of SVG generation tasks. Dataset and source code will be publicly available.

Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) are fundamental to digital design and robot
control, encoding not only visual structure but also motion paths in
interactive drawings. In this work, we introduce RoboSVG, a unified multimodal
framework for generating interactive SVGs guided by textual, visual, and
numerical signals. Given an input query, the RoboSVG model first produces
multimodal guidance, then synthesizes candidate SVGs through dedicated
generation modules, and finally refines them under numerical guidance to yield
high-quality outputs. To support this framework, we construct RoboDraw, a
large-scale dataset of one million examples, each pairing an SVG generation
condition (e.g., text, image, and partial SVG) with its corresponding
ground-truth SVG code. RoboDraw dataset enables systematic study of four tasks,
including basic generation (Text-to-SVG, Image-to-SVG) and interactive

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VADTree is a training-free video anomaly detection method that uses a hierarchical tree structure for flexible temporal sampling, leveraging pre-trained models for event boundary detection and language models for anomaly reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised VAD methods require large labeled datasets and lack explainability, while existing training-free methods struggle with capturing anomalies of varying temporal durations due to fixed-length window sampling.

Method: Uses Hierarchical Granularity-aware Tree (HGTree) structure with Generic Event Boundary Detection to decompose videos into event nodes, performs hierarchical structuring and redundancy removal, then uses visual language models and LLMs for anomaly perception and reasoning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in training-free settings on three challenging datasets while significantly reducing the number of sampled video segments.

Conclusion: VADTree provides an effective training-free solution for video anomaly detection that handles varying temporal spans through flexible hierarchical sampling and leverages pre-trained models for enhanced anomaly perception and reasoning.

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) focuses on identifying anomalies in videos.
Supervised methods demand substantial in-domain training data and fail to
deliver clear explanations for anomalies. In contrast, training-free methods
leverage the knowledge reserves and language interactivity of large pre-trained
models to detect anomalies. However, the current fixed-length temporal window
sampling approaches struggle to accurately capture anomalies with varying
temporal spans. Therefore, we propose VADTree that utilizes a Hierarchical
Granularityaware Tree (HGTree) structure for flexible sampling in VAD. VADTree
leverages the knowledge embedded in a pre-trained Generic Event Boundary
Detection (GEBD) model to characterize potential anomaly event boundaries.
Specifically, VADTree decomposes the video into generic event nodes based on
boundary confidence, and performs adaptive coarse-fine hierarchical structuring
and redundancy removal to construct the HGTree. Then, the multi-dimensional
priors are injected into the visual language models (VLMs) to enhance the
node-wise anomaly perception, and anomaly reasoning for generic event nodes is
achieved via large language models (LLMs). Finally, an inter-cluster node
correlation method is used to integrate the multi-granularity anomaly scores.
Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets demonstrate that VADTree
achieves state-of-the-art performance in training-free settings while
drastically reducing the number of sampled video segments. The code will be
available at https://github.com/wenlongli10/VADTree.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MRAG approaches have static retrieval strategies, inflexible modality selection, and suboptimal information utilization, leading to challenges in determining retrieval timing, modality choice, and effective information use.

Method: Introduces Windsock module for dynamic retrieval decisions and modality selection, DANCE instruction tuning for adaptive training to enhance information utilization and noise resistance, and self-assessment approach to convert QA datasets to MRAG training data.

Result: Significantly improves generation quality by 17.07% while reducing retrieval times by 8.95% in extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses key challenges in MRAG by providing dynamic retrieval strategies and enhanced training approaches, leading to substantial improvements in both response quality and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) has emerged as a promising
method to generate factual and up-to-date responses of Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) by incorporating non-parametric knowledge from external
knowledge bases. However, existing MRAG approaches suffer from static retrieval
strategies, inflexible modality selection, and suboptimal utilization of
retrieved information, leading to three critical challenges: determining when
to retrieve, what modality to incorporate, and how to utilize retrieved
information effectively. To address these challenges, we introduce Windsock, a
query-dependent module making decisions on retrieval necessity and modality
selection, effectively reducing computational overhead and improving response
quality. Additionally, we propose Dynamic Noise-Resistance (DANCE) Instruction
Tuning, an adaptive training strategy that enhances MLLMs' ability to utilize
retrieved information while maintaining robustness against noise. Moreover, we
adopt a self-assessment approach leveraging knowledge within MLLMs to convert
question-answering datasets to MRAG training datasets. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves the generation
quality by 17.07% while reducing 8.95% retrieval times.

Motivation: Address the scarcity of annotated data in remote sensing by developing self-supervised learning approaches that can build foundation models, overcoming limitations of fully supervised methods.

Method: Proposes WaveMAE with multi-level Discrete Wavelet Transform for frequency component disentanglement and scale-aware high-frequency representation learning, plus Geo-conditioned Positional Encoding using Spherical Harmonics to incorporate geographical priors.

Result: Achieves consistent improvements over prior state-of-the-art approaches with substantial gains on segmentation and regression benchmarks. Even a lightweight variant with only 26.4% parameters achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: WaveMAE establishes itself as a strong and geographically informed foundation model for multispectral remote sensing imagery, demonstrating effectiveness across diverse downstream tasks.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has recently emerged as a key strategy for
building foundation models in remote sensing, where the scarcity of annotated
data limits the applicability of fully supervised approaches. In this work, we
introduce WaveMAE, a masked autoencoding framework tailored for multispectral
satellite imagery. Unlike conventional pixel-based reconstruction, WaveMAE
leverages a multi-level Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to disentangle
frequency components and guide the encoder toward learning scale-aware
high-frequency representations. We further propose a Geo-conditioned Positional
Encoding (GPE), which incorporates geographical priors via Spherical Harmonics,
encouraging embeddings that respect both semantic and geospatial structure. To
ensure fairness in evaluation, all methods are pretrained on the same dataset
(fMoW-S2) and systematically evaluated on the diverse downstream tasks of the
PANGAEA benchmark, spanning semantic segmentation, regression, change
detection, and multilabel classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that WaveMAE achieves consistent improvements over prior state-of-the-art
approaches, with substantial gains on segmentation and regression benchmarks.
The effectiveness of WaveMAE pretraining is further demonstrated by showing
that even a lightweight variant, containing only 26.4% of the parameters,
achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our results establish WaveMAE as a
strong and geographically informed foundation model for multispectral remote
sensing imagery.

Method: Proposes InstanceGrounded Geometry Transformer (IGGT) with 3D-Consistent Contrastive Learning strategy to encode unified representations from 2D inputs. Also creates InsScene-15K dataset with comprehensive 3D-consistent annotations.

Result: IGGT enables consistent lifting of 2D visual inputs into coherent 3D scenes with explicitly distinct object instances through unified geometric and instance-level representations.

Conclusion: The proposed unified approach bridges the gap between low-level 3D reconstruction and high-level spatial understanding, enabling more comprehensive 3D scene analysis.

Abstract: Humans naturally perceive the geometric structure and semantic content of a
3D world as intertwined dimensions, enabling coherent and accurate
understanding of complex scenes. However, most prior approaches prioritize
training large geometry models for low-level 3D reconstruction and treat
high-level spatial understanding in isolation, overlooking the crucial
interplay between these two fundamental aspects of 3D-scene analysis, thereby
limiting generalization and leading to poor performance in downstream 3D
understanding tasks. Recent attempts have mitigated this issue by simply
aligning 3D models with specific language models, thus restricting perception
to the aligned model's capacity and limiting adaptability to downstream tasks.
In this paper, we propose InstanceGrounded Geometry Transformer (IGGT), an
end-to-end large unified transformer to unify the knowledge for both spatial
reconstruction and instance-level contextual understanding. Specifically, we
design a 3D-Consistent Contrastive Learning strategy that guides IGGT to encode
a unified representation with geometric structures and instance-grounded
clustering through only 2D visual inputs. This representation supports
consistent lifting of 2D visual inputs into a coherent 3D scene with explicitly
distinct object instances. To facilitate this task, we further construct
InsScene-15K, a large-scale dataset with high-quality RGB images, poses, depth
maps, and 3D-consistent instance-level mask annotations with a novel data
curation pipeline.

Abstract: Lipreading has emerged as an increasingly important research area for
developing robust speech recognition systems and assistive technologies for the
hearing-impaired. However, non-English resources for visual speech recognition
remain limited. We introduce LRW-Persian, the largest in-the-wild Persian
word-level lipreading dataset, comprising $743$ target words and over
$414{,}000$ video samples extracted from more than $1{,}900$ hours of footage
across $67$ television programs. Designed as a benchmark-ready resource,
LRW-Persian provides speaker-disjoint training and test splits, wide regional
and dialectal coverage, and rich per-clip metadata including head pose, age,

end-to-end curation pipeline encompassing transcription based on Automatic
Speech Recognition(ASR), active-speaker localization, quality filtering, and
pose/mask screening. We further fine-tune two widely used lipreading
architectures on LRW-Persian, establishing reference performance and

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper provides a comprehensive survey of cross-view visual understanding, focusing on cross-view localization (estimating ground image positions using overhead imagery) and cross-view synthesis (generating ground-level images from overhead views).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-view tasks have gained importance due to applications in autonomous navigation, urban planning, and augmented reality, but remain challenging due to significant perspective, resolution, and occlusion differences between overhead and ground-level imagery.

Method: The survey reviews datasets, analyzes key challenges, and provides an organized overview of state-of-the-art techniques. Cross-view localization is typically formulated as image retrieval using CNNs or ViTs for feature embedding, while cross-view synthesis uses GANs or diffusion models.

Result: The paper presents a comprehensive analysis of advances in both cross-view localization and synthesis, including comparative analyses of current techniques and identification of limitations.

Conclusion: The survey outlines promising directions for future research in cross-view visual understanding and provides a project page for ongoing developments in this field.

Abstract: Cross-view localization and synthesis are two fundamental tasks in cross-view
visual understanding, which deals with cross-view datasets: overhead (satellite
or aerial) and ground-level imagery. These tasks have gained increasing
attention due to their broad applications in autonomous navigation, urban
planning, and augmented reality. Cross-view localization aims to estimate the
geographic position of ground-level images based on information provided by
overhead imagery while cross-view synthesis seeks to generate ground-level
images based on information from the overhead imagery. Both tasks remain
challenging due to significant differences in viewing perspective, resolution,
and occlusion, which are widely embedded in cross-view datasets. Recent years
have witnessed rapid progress driven by the availability of large-scale
datasets and novel approaches. Typically, cross-view localization is formulated
as an image retrieval problem where ground-level features are matched with
tiled overhead images feature, extracted by convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) or vision transformers (ViTs) for cross-view feature embedding.
Cross-view synthesis, on the other hand, seeks to generate ground-level views
based on information from overhead imagery, generally using generative
adversarial networks (GANs) or diffusion models. This paper presents a
comprehensive survey of advances in cross-view localization and synthesis,
reviewing widely used datasets, highlighting key challenges, and providing an
organized overview of state-of-the-art techniques. Furthermore, it discusses
current limitations, offers comparative analyses, and outlines promising
directions for future research. We also include the project page via

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ConMatFormer is a hybrid deep learning architecture combining ConvNeXt blocks, attention mechanisms (CBAM and DANet), and transformers for diabetic foot ulcer detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance with improved accuracy and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diabetic foot ulcer detection is clinically significant but challenging due to scarce and variable public datasets, requiring better methods to handle class imbalance and accurately model small skin patterns across different DFU types.

Method: Proposed ConMatFormer hybrid architecture using ConvNeXt blocks for local features, multiple attention mechanisms (CBAM and DANet), and transformer modules for global context. Applied data augmentation for class imbalance and used explainable AI methods (Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, LIME) for transparency.

Result: Achieved accuracy of 0.8961 and precision of 0.9160 in single experiment, and 0.9755 accuracy with 0.0031 standard deviation in 4-fold cross-validation, outperforming state-of-the-art CNN and ViT models on DFUC2021 and DFU datasets.

Conclusion: ConMatFormer sets a new benchmark for DFU classification and provides a hybrid attention transformer framework for medical image analysis, demonstrating superior performance in accuracy, reliability, and flexibility.

Abstract: Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) detection is a clinically significant yet
challenging task due to the scarcity and variability of publicly available
datasets. To solve these problems, we propose ConMatFormer, a new hybrid deep
learning architecture that combines ConvNeXt blocks, multiple attention
mechanisms convolutional block attention module (CBAM) and dual attention
network (DANet), and transformer modules in a way that works together. This
design facilitates the extraction of better local features and understanding of
the global context, which allows us to model small skin patterns across
different types of DFU very accurately. To address the class imbalance, we used
data augmentation methods. A ConvNeXt block was used to obtain detailed local
features in the initial stages. Subsequently, we compiled the model by adding a
transformer module to enhance long-range dependency. This enabled us to
pinpoint the DFU classes that were underrepresented or constituted minorities.
Tests on the DS1 (DFUC2021) and DS2 (diabetic foot ulcer (DFU)) datasets showed
that ConMatFormer outperformed state-of-the-art (SOTA) convolutional neural
network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) models in terms of accuracy,
reliability, and flexibility. The proposed method achieved an accuracy of
0.8961 and a precision of 0.9160 in a single experiment, which is a significant
improvement over the current standards for classifying DFUs. In addition, by
4-fold cross-validation, the proposed model achieved an accuracy of 0.9755 with
a standard deviation of only 0.0031. We further applied explainable artificial
intelligence (XAI) methods, such as Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, and LIME, to
consistently monitor the transparency and trustworthiness of the
decision-making process.. Our findings set a new benchmark for DFU
classification and provide a hybrid attention transformer framework for medical
image analysis.

*Jiaxiang Liu,Jiawei Du,Xiao Liu,Prayag Tiwari,Mingkun Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCC is a test-time defense method that improves CLIP's zero-shot robustness against adversarial attacks through semantic and spatial consistency modules, without requiring labeled data or fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP models are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations that disrupt image-text alignment, and existing defenses rely on adversarial fine-tuning with labeled data, limiting their applicability in zero-shot settings.

Method: Self-Calibrated Consistency (SCC) uses two modules: Semantic consistency leverages soft pseudo-labels from counterattack warm-up and multi-view predictions to regularize cross-modal alignment; Spatial consistency aligns perturbed visual predictions via augmented views to stabilize inference.

Result: Extensive experiments on 22 benchmarks under diverse attack settings show SCC consistently improves CLIP's zero-shot robustness while maintaining accuracy, and can be integrated with other VLMs for further gains.

Conclusion: SCC demonstrates the potential of establishing an adversarially robust paradigm from CLIP, with implications extending to broader vision-language domains like BioMedCLIP.

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have demonstrated
strong zero-shot capabilities across diverse domains, yet remain highly
vulnerable to adversarial perturbations that disrupt image-text alignment and
compromise reliability. Existing defenses typically rely on adversarial
fine-tuning with labeled data, limiting their applicability in zero-shot
settings. In this work, we identify two key weaknesses of current CLIP
adversarial attacks -- lack of semantic guidance and vulnerability to view
variations -- collectively termed semantic and viewpoint fragility. To address
these challenges, we propose Self-Calibrated Consistency (SCC), an effective
test-time defense. SCC consists of two complementary modules: Semantic
consistency, which leverages soft pseudo-labels from counterattack warm-up and
multi-view predictions to regularize cross-modal alignment and separate the
target embedding from confusable negatives; and Spatial consistency, aligning
perturbed visual predictions via augmented views to stabilize inference under
adversarial perturbations. Together, these modules form a plug-and-play
inference strategy. Extensive experiments on 22 benchmarks under diverse attack
settings show that SCC consistently improves the zero-shot robustness of CLIP
while maintaining accuracy, and can be seamlessly integrated with other VLMs
for further gains. These findings highlight the great potential of establishing
an adversarially robust paradigm from CLIP, with implications extending to
broader vision-language domains such as BioMedCLIP.

Abstract: Explainability is critical for the clinical adoption of medical visual
question answering (VQA) systems, as physicians require transparent reasoning
to trust AI-generated diagnoses. We present MedXplain-VQA, a comprehensive
framework integrating five explainable AI components to deliver interpretable
medical image analysis. The framework leverages a fine-tuned BLIP-2 backbone,
medical query reformulation, enhanced Grad-CAM attention, precise region

framework replacing traditional NLP metrics with clinically relevant
assessments, including terminology coverage, clinical structure quality, and
attention region relevance. Experiments on 500 PathVQA histopathology samples
demonstrate substantial improvements, with the enhanced system achieving a
composite score of 0.683 compared to 0.378 for baseline methods, while

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAGIC-Talk is a one-shot diffusion-based framework for customizable and temporally stable talking face generation that addresses identity preservation, temporal consistency, and customization issues in long video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current audio-driven talking face generation methods struggle with temporal consistency, identity preservation, and customization, especially for long video generation, despite improvements in audio-lip synchronization.

Method: MAGIC-Talk uses a dual-network architecture: ReferenceNet for identity preservation and fine-grained facial editing via text prompts, and AnimateNet for motion coherence using structured motion priors. It employs progressive latent fusion strategy for long-form video quality improvement.

Result: Extensive experiments show MAGIC-Talk outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual quality, identity preservation, and synchronization accuracy.

Conclusion: MAGIC-Talk offers a robust solution for talking face generation by maintaining identity from a single image while ensuring smooth transitions and reducing motion inconsistencies in long videos.

Abstract: Audio-driven talking face generation has gained significant attention for
applications in digital media and virtual avatars. While recent methods improve
audio-lip synchronization, they often struggle with temporal consistency,
identity preservation, and customization, especially in long video generation.
To address these issues, we propose MAGIC-Talk, a one-shot diffusion-based
framework for customizable and temporally stable talking face generation.
MAGIC-Talk consists of ReferenceNet, which preserves identity and enables
fine-grained facial editing via text prompts, and AnimateNet, which enhances
motion coherence using structured motion priors. Unlike previous methods
requiring multiple reference images or fine-tuning, MAGIC-Talk maintains
identity from a single image while ensuring smooth transitions across frames.
Additionally, a progressive latent fusion strategy is introduced to improve
long-form video quality by reducing motion inconsistencies and flickering.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAGIC-Talk outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in visual quality, identity preservation, and synchronization accuracy,
offering a robust solution for talking face generation.

*Zahraa Al Sahili,Maryam Fetanat,Maimuna Nowaz,Ioannis Patras,Matthew Purver*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FairJudge is a lightweight protocol that uses instruction-following multimodal LLMs as fair judges to evaluate text-to-image systems, addressing limitations of current evaluation methods like CLIP and face classifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image evaluation methods lack reproducibility, calibrated abstention, and fail to assess social attributes like religion, culture, and disability. They rely on surface cues and miss weakly visible attributes.

Method: Uses instruction-following multimodal LLMs as fair judges with an explanation-oriented rubric scored on [-1,1], constrained to closed label sets, requiring evidence from visible content, and mandating abstention when cues are insufficient.

Result: FairJudge outperforms contrastive and face-centric baselines on demographic prediction across multiple datasets (FairFace, PaTA, FairCoT) and improves mean alignment while maintaining high profession accuracy on IdenProf, FairCoT-Professions, and DIVERSIFY-Professions.

Conclusion: FairJudge enables more reliable and reproducible fairness audits for text-to-image systems by providing accountable, evidence-aware decisions without requiring modifications to the generators themselves.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) systems lack simple, reproducible ways to evaluate how
well images match prompts and how models treat social attributes. Common
proxies -- face classifiers and contrastive similarity -- reward surface cues,
lack calibrated abstention, and miss attributes only weakly visible (for
example, religion, culture, disability). We present FairJudge, a lightweight
protocol that treats instruction-following multimodal LLMs as fair judges. It
scores alignment with an explanation-oriented rubric mapped to [-1, 1];
constrains judgments to a closed label set; requires evidence grounded in the
visible content; and mandates abstention when cues are insufficient. Unlike
CLIP-only pipelines, FairJudge yields accountable, evidence-aware decisions;
unlike mitigation that alters generators, it targets evaluation fairness. We
evaluate gender, race, and age on FairFace, PaTA, and FairCoT; extend to
religion, culture, and disability; and assess profession correctness and
alignment on IdenProf, FairCoT-Professions, and our new DIVERSIFY-Professions.
We also release DIVERSIFY, a 469-image corpus of diverse, non-iconic scenes.
Across datasets, judge models outperform contrastive and face-centric baselines
on demographic prediction and improve mean alignment while maintaining high
profession accuracy, enabling more reliable, reproducible fairness audits.

Motivation: To predict commercial/brand memorability as part of the MediaEval 2025 workshop competition, addressing the need for robust multimodal approaches.

Method: Multimodal fusion with Gemma-3 LLM backbone integrating ViT visual and E5 textual features via multi-modal projections, using LoRA adaptation and LLM-generated rationale prompts based on expert memorability aspects.

Result: The LLM-based system shows greater robustness and generalization performance on the final test set compared to the gradient boosted tree baseline.

Conclusion: LLM-based multimodal fusion with expert-grounded rationale prompts effectively improves commercial memorability prediction performance.

Abstract: This paper addresses the prediction of commercial (brand) memorability as
part of "Subtask 2: Commercial/Ad Memorability" within the "Memorability:
Predicting movie and commercial memorability" task at the MediaEval 2025
workshop competition. We propose a multimodal fusion system with a Gemma-3 LLM
backbone that integrates pre-computed visual (ViT) and textual (E5) features by
multi-modal projections. The model is adapted using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).
A heavily-tuned ensemble of gradient boosted trees serves as a baseline. A key
contribution is the use of LLM-generated rationale prompts, grounded in
expert-derived aspects of memorability, to guide the fusion model. The results
demonstrate that the LLM-based system exhibits greater robustness and
generalization performance on the final test set, compared to the baseline.

TL;DR: FastJAM is a rapid graph-based method for joint image alignment that reduces computational complexity from hours/minutes to seconds while achieving better alignment quality than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing joint alignment approaches require long training times, large models, and extensive hyperparameter tuning, creating a need for faster and more efficient methods.

Method: Uses pairwise matches from off-the-shelf image matchers with nonparametric clustering to build a graph of keypoint relations, then employs a graph neural network to propagate correspondences and predict homography parameters via image-level pooling with inverse-compositional loss.

Result: Achieves better alignment quality than modern JA methods while reducing computation time from hours/minutes to mere seconds on several benchmarks.

Conclusion: FastJAM provides an efficient and effective solution for joint image alignment that eliminates the need for regularization terms and associated hyperparameter tuning.

Abstract: Joint Alignment (JA) of images aims to align a collection of images into a
unified coordinate frame, such that semantically-similar features appear at
corresponding spatial locations. Most existing approaches often require long
training times, large-capacity models, and extensive hyperparameter tuning. We
introduce FastJAM, a rapid, graph-based method that drastically reduces the
computational complexity of joint alignment tasks. FastJAM leverages pairwise
matches computed by an off-the-shelf image matcher, together with a rapid
nonparametric clustering, to construct a graph representing intra- and
inter-image keypoint relations. A graph neural network propagates and
aggregates these correspondences, efficiently predicting per-image homography
parameters via image-level pooling. Utilizing an inverse-compositional loss,
that eliminates the need for a regularization term over the predicted
transformations (and thus also obviates the hyperparameter tuning associated
with such terms), FastJAM performs image JA quickly and effectively.
Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that FastJAM achieves
results better than existing modern JA methods in terms of alignment quality,
while reducing computation time from hours or minutes to mere seconds. Our code
is available at our project webpage, https://bgu-cs-vil.github.io/FastJAM/

*Lexiang Xiong,Chengyu Liu,Jingwen Ye,Yan Liu,Yuecong Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Semantic Surgery is a training-free, zero-shot framework for concept erasure in text-to-image diffusion models that operates on text embeddings before diffusion, using calibrated vector subtraction to neutralize target concepts while preserving image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing concept erasure methods often compromise generative quality, so there's a need for approaches that can effectively remove harmful content while maintaining image quality.

Method: Dynamic estimation of target concepts in prompts followed by calibrated vector subtraction on text embeddings, with Co-Occurrence Encoding for multi-concept erasure and visual feedback loop for latent concept persistence.

Result: Superior performance across object erasure (93.58 H-score), explicit content reduction (to just 1 instance), and style erasure (8.09 H_a) with no quality degradation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Semantic Surgery provides a practical training-free solution for safer text-to-image generation that can also function as a built-in threat detection system.

Abstract: Concept erasure in text-to-image diffusion models is crucial for mitigating
harmful content, yet existing methods often compromise generative quality. We
introduce Semantic Surgery, a novel training-free, zero-shot framework for
concept erasure that operates directly on text embeddings before the diffusion
process. It dynamically estimates the presence of target concepts in a prompt
and performs a calibrated vector subtraction to neutralize their influence at
the source, enhancing both erasure completeness and locality. The framework
includes a Co-Occurrence Encoding module for robust multi-concept erasure and a
visual feedback loop to address latent concept persistence. As a training-free
method, Semantic Surgery adapts dynamically to each prompt, ensuring precise
interventions. Extensive experiments on object, explicit content, artistic
style, and multi-celebrity erasure tasks show our method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. We achieve superior completeness and
robustness while preserving locality and image quality (e.g., 93.58 H-score in
object erasure, reducing explicit content to just 1 instance, and 8.09 H_a in
style erasure with no quality degradation). This robustness also allows our
framework to function as a built-in threat detection system, offering a
practical solution for safer text-to-image generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A zero-shot wind turbine blade inspection framework using RAG with Vision-Language Models achieves perfect classification on 30 test images without task-specific training, outperforming retrieval-free VLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional drone-based inspection with deep learning requires large labeled datasets, limiting detection of rare or evolving damage types in harsh wind turbine environments.

Method: Multimodal knowledge base with technical docs, reference images, and guidelines; hybrid text-image retriever with keyword-aware reranking to condition VLM at inference without training.

Result: RAG-grounded VLM achieved 100% accuracy on 30 labeled blade images covering diverse damage categories, outperforming same VLM without retrieval in both accuracy and precision.

Conclusion: Framework provides explainable, generalizable solution that reduces dependence on labeled datasets and enables detection of unseen defects through domain knowledge injection.

Abstract: Wind turbine blades operate in harsh environments, making timely damage
detection essential for preventing failures and optimizing maintenance.
Drone-based inspection and deep learning are promising, but typically depend on
large, labeled datasets, which limit their ability to detect rare or evolving
damage types. To address this, we propose a zero-shot-oriented inspection
framework that integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with
Vision-Language Models (VLM). A multimodal knowledge base is constructed,
comprising technical documentation, representative reference images, and
domain-specific guidelines. A hybrid text-image retriever with keyword-aware
reranking assembles the most relevant context to condition the VLM at
inference, injecting domain knowledge without task-specific training. We
evaluate the framework on 30 labeled blade images covering diverse damage
categories. Although the dataset is small due to the difficulty of acquiring
verified blade imagery, it covers multiple representative defect types. On this
test set, the RAG-grounded VLM correctly classified all samples, whereas the
same VLM without retrieval performed worse in both accuracy and precision. We
further compare against open-vocabulary baselines and incorporate uncertainty
Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals to account for the small-sample setting.
Ablation studies indicate that the key advantage of the framework lies in
explainability and generalizability: retrieved references ground the reasoning
process and enable the detection of previously unseen defects by leveraging
domain knowledge rather than relying solely on visual cues. This research
contributes a data-efficient solution for industrial inspection that reduces
dependence on extensive labeled datasets.

Result: The dataset combines visual, spectral, and structural information, enabling new approaches for precision grazing management and is released as a Kaggle competition challenge.

Conclusion: This multidimensional dataset provides valuable resources for advancing machine learning applications in pasture biomass estimation and precision grazing management.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of pasture biomass is important for decision-making in
livestock production systems. Estimates of pasture biomass can be used to
manage stocking rates to maximise pasture utilisation, while minimising the
risk of overgrazing and promoting overall system health. We present a
comprehensive dataset of 1,162 annotated top-view images of pastures collected
across 19 locations in Australia. The images were taken across multiple seasons
and include a range of temperate pasture species. Each image captures a 70cm *
30cm quadrat and is paired with on-ground measurements including biomass sorted
by component (green, dead, and legume fraction), vegetation height, and
Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Active Optical Sensors
(AOS). The multidimensional nature of the data, which combines visual,
spectral, and structural information, opens up new possibilities for advancing
the use of precision grazing management. The dataset is released and hosted in
a Kaggle competition that challenges the international Machine Learning
community with the task of pasture biomass estimation. The dataset is available
on the official Kaggle webpage:

### [138] [Gen-LangSplat: Generalized Language Gaussian Splatting with Pre-Trained Feature Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22930)
*Pranav Saxena*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Gen-LangSplat eliminates the need for scene-specific language autoencoders in 3D language fields by using a pre-trained generalized autoencoder, achieving comparable performance with better scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods like LangSplat require costly per-scene autoencoder training for feature compression, creating a scalability bottleneck for 3D language field deployment.

Method: Replace scene-specific autoencoder with a generalized autoencoder pre-trained on ScanNet dataset, using fixed latent space for language features across all scenes without scene-specific training.

Result: Achieved efficiency boost in language field construction while maintaining or exceeding LangSplat's querying performance, with optimal latent embedding dimensions validated through ablation studies.

Conclusion: Generalized embeddings enable efficient and accurate open-vocabulary querying in novel 3D scenes, supporting scalable real-time interactive 3D AI applications.

Abstract: Modeling open-vocabulary language fields in 3D is essential for intuitive
human-AI interaction and querying within physical environments.
State-of-the-art approaches, such as LangSplat, leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting
to efficiently construct these language fields, encoding features distilled
from high-dimensional models like CLIP. However, this efficiency is currently
offset by the requirement to train a scene-specific language autoencoder for
feature compression, introducing a costly, per-scene optimization bottleneck
that hinders deployment scalability. In this work, we introduce Gen-LangSplat,
that eliminates this requirement by replacing the scene-wise autoencoder with a
generalized autoencoder, pre-trained extensively on the large-scale ScanNet
dataset. This architectural shift enables the use of a fixed, compact latent
space for language features across any new scene without any scene-specific
training. By removing this dependency, our entire language field construction
process achieves a efficiency boost while delivering querying performance
comparable to, or exceeding, the original LangSplat method. To validate our
design choice, we perform a thorough ablation study empirically determining the
optimal latent embedding dimension and quantifying representational fidelity
using Mean Squared Error and cosine similarity between the original and
reprojected 512-dimensional CLIP embeddings. Our results demonstrate that
generalized embeddings can efficiently and accurately support open-vocabulary
querying in novel 3D scenes, paving the way for scalable, real-time interactive
3D AI applications.

*Mouxiao Huang,Borui Jiang,Dehua Zheng,Hailin Hu,Kai Han,Xinghao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PPE is a parameter-free positional preservation embedding method that maintains spatiotemporal structure during visual token compression in MLLMs, improving performance across vision-language benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing token merging methods reduce sequence length but disrupt spatial layouts and temporal continuity by ignoring positional relationships, leading to inefficiencies in MLLMs.

Method: PPE introduces disentangled encoding of 3D positions in the token dimension, allowing compressed tokens to encapsulate different positions from multiple original tokens. It supports cascade clustering for progressive token compression.

Result: PPE achieves 2%-5% improvements across multiple benchmarks including MMBench (general vision understanding), TextVQA (layout understanding), and VideoMME (temporal understanding).

Conclusion: Preserving positional cues is critical for efficient and effective MLLM reasoning, and PPE provides a generic solution that can be integrated into existing token merging methods without adjustments.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on
vision-language tasks, yet often suffer from inefficiencies due to redundant
visual tokens. Existing token merging methods reduce sequence length but
frequently disrupt spatial layouts and temporal continuity by disregarding
positional relationships. In this work, we propose a novel encoding operator
dubbed as \textbf{P}ositional \textbf{P}reservation \textbf{E}mbedding
(\textbf{PPE}), which has the main hallmark of preservation of spatiotemporal
structure during visual token compression. PPE explicitly introduces the
disentangled encoding of 3D positions in the token dimension, enabling each
compressed token to encapsulate different positions from multiple original
tokens. Furthermore, we show that PPE can effectively support cascade
clustering -- a progressive token compression strategy that leads to better
performance retention. PPE is a parameter-free and generic operator that can be
seamlessly integrated into existing token merging methods without any
adjustments. Applied to state-of-the-art token merging framework, PPE achieves
consistent improvements of $2\%\sim5\%$ across multiple vision-language
benchmarks, including MMBench (general vision understanding), TextVQA (layout
understanding) and VideoMME (temporal understanding). These results demonstrate
that preserving positional cues is critical for efficient and effective MLLM
reasoning.

*Matthew So,Judah Goldfeder,Mark Lis,Hod Lipson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper challenges the assumption that biometrics are statistically uncorrelated by testing fingerprint-to-fingerprint, iris-to-iris, and cross-modal fingerprint-to-iris matching using Bi-Encoder networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test the historic assumption that biometrics of an individual are statistically uncorrelated, which has been widely accepted but not thoroughly validated.

Method: Used Bi-Encoder networks with ResNet-50 and Vision Transformer backbones trained on 274 subjects with ~100k fingerprints and 7k iris images, minimizing contrastive loss between images from the same individual.

Result: Iris-to-iris matching achieved 91 ROC AUC score, showing left and right irises are correlated. Fingerprint models confirmed prior findings of positive intra-subject correlation. Cross-modal matching performed only slightly above chance.

Conclusion: The findings challenge independence assumptions of biometrics, with iris correlation clearly demonstrated. More data and sophisticated pipelines are needed for cross-modal matching. This is the first work using Vision Transformers for this task.

Abstract: There has been a historic assumption that the biometrics of an individual are
statistically uncorrelated. We test this assumption by training Bi-Encoder
networks on three verification tasks, including fingerprint-to-fingerprint
matching, iris-to-iris matching, and cross-modal fingerprint-to-iris matching
using 274 subjects with $\sim$100k fingerprints and 7k iris images. We trained
ResNet-50 and Vision Transformer backbones in Bi-Encoder architectures such
that the contrastive loss between images sampled from the same individual is
minimized. The iris ResNet architecture reaches 91 ROC AUC score for
iris-to-iris matching, providing clear evidence that the left and right irises
of an individual are correlated. Fingerprint models reproduce the positive
intra-subject suggested by prior work in this space. This is the first work
attempting to use Vision Transformers for this matching. Cross-modal matching
rises only slightly above chance, which suggests that more data and a more
sophisticated pipeline is needed to obtain compelling results. These findings
continue challenge independence assumptions of biometrics and we plan to extend
this work to other biometrics in the future. Code available:

### [141] [Switchable Token-Specific Codebook Quantization For Face Image Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22943)
*Yongbo Wang,Haonan Wang,Guodong Mu,Ruixin Zhang,Jiaqi Chen,Jingyun Zhang,Jun Wang,Yuan Xie,Zhizhong Zhang,Shouhong Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Switchable Token-Specific Codebook Quantization for face image compression, using distinct codebook groups for different image categories and independent codebooks per token to improve performance at low bit rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Global codebook strategies overlook category-specific correlations and semantic differences in facial images, leading to suboptimal performance especially at low bpp.

Method: Learns distinct codebook groups for different image categories and assigns independent codebook to each token, recording codebook group membership with minimal bits to reduce loss when decreasing codebook sizes.

Result: Achieved 93.51% average accuracy for reconstructed face images at 0.05 bpp on face recognition datasets.

Conclusion: The method enhances expressive capability and reconstruction performance at low bpp by enabling more codebooks under lower overall bit rate, and can be integrated into existing codebook-based approaches.

Abstract: With the ever-increasing volume of visual data, the efficient and lossless
transmission, along with its subsequent interpretation and understanding, has
become a critical bottleneck in modern information systems. The emerged
codebook-based solution utilize a globally shared codebook to quantize and
dequantize each token, controlling the bpp by adjusting the number of tokens or
the codebook size. However, for facial images, which are rich in attributes,
such global codebook strategies overlook both the category-specific
correlations within images and the semantic differences among tokens, resulting
in suboptimal performance, especially at low bpp. Motivated by these
observations, we propose a Switchable Token-Specific Codebook Quantization for
face image compression, which learns distinct codebook groups for different
image categories and assigns an independent codebook to each token. By
recording the codebook group to which each token belongs with a small number of
bits, our method can reduce the loss incurred when decreasing the size of each
codebook group. This enables a larger total number of codebooks under a lower
overall bpp, thereby enhancing the expressive capability and improving
reconstruction performance. Owing to its generalizable design, our method can
be integrated into any existing codebook-based representation learning approach
and has demonstrated its effectiveness on face recognition datasets, achieving
an average accuracy of 93.51% for reconstructed images at 0.05 bpp.

TL;DR: Efficient multimodal model fusion by interleaving multimodal self-attention blocks between existing generation and understanding models, achieving strong performance with minimal training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create competitive multimodal models more efficiently by fusing existing specialized models rather than training from scratch, reducing computational requirements.

Method: Strategic fusion of public models by retaining original blocks and interleaving multimodal self-attention blocks throughout networks, enabling double fusion mechanism.

Result: Achieved strong performance with only ~35B tokens: 0.91 on GenEval, 82.16 on DPG-Bench, 6.06 on GEditBench, and 3.77 on ImgEdit-Bench.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates efficient multimodal modeling through strategic fusion of existing models, with full code, weights, and datasets released to support future research.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models have recently shown remarkable gains in both
capability and versatility, yet most leading systems are still trained from
scratch and require substantial computational resources. In this paper, we show
that competitive performance can be obtained far more efficiently by
strategically fusing publicly available models specialized for either
generation or understanding. Our key design is to retain the original blocks
while additionally interleaving multimodal self-attention blocks throughout the
networks. This double fusion mechanism (1) effectively enables rich multi-modal
fusion while largely preserving the original strengths of the base models, and
(2) catalyzes synergistic fusion of high-level semantic representations from
the understanding encoder with low-level spatial signals from the generation
encoder. By training with only ~ 35B tokens, this approach achieves strong
results across multiple benchmarks: 0.91 on GenEval for compositional
text-to-image generation, 82.16 on DPG-Bench for complex text-to-image
generation, 6.06 on GEditBench, and 3.77 on ImgEdit-Bench for image editing. By
fully releasing the entire suite of code, model weights, and datasets, we hope
to support future research on unified multimodal modeling.

### [143] [FAME: Fairness-aware Attention-modulated Video Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22960)
*Zhangkai Wu,Xuhui Fan,Zhongyuan Xie,Kaize Shi,Zhidong Li,Longbing Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FAME is a fairness-aware attention-modulated video editing method that mitigates profession-related gender biases while maintaining prompt alignment and temporal consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training-free video editing models tend to reinforce gender stereotypes when rendering profession-related prompts, creating biased outputs.

Method: FAME uses fairness embeddings from minority representations, injects debiasing tokens into text encoder, and integrates fairness modulation into temporal self attention and cross attention with region constraints and time decay weighting.

Result: Extensive experiments on FairVE benchmark show FAME achieves stronger fairness alignment and semantic fidelity than existing video editing baselines.

Conclusion: FAME effectively mitigates gender biases in video editing while preserving coherence and prompt alignment through attention modulation techniques.

Abstract: Training-free video editing (VE) models tend to fall back on gender
stereotypes when rendering profession-related prompts. We propose \textbf{FAME}
for \textit{Fairness-aware Attention-modulated Video Editing} that mitigates
profession-related gender biases while preserving prompt alignment and temporal
consistency for coherent VE. We derive fairness embeddings from existing
minority representations by softly injecting debiasing tokens into the text
encoder. Simultaneously, FAME integrates fairness modulation into both temporal
self attention and prompt-to-region cross attention to mitigate the motion
corruption and temporal inconsistency caused by directly introducing fairness
cues. For temporal self attention, FAME introduces a region constrained
attention mask combined with time decay weighting, which enhances intra-region
coherence while suppressing irrelevant inter-region interactions. For cross
attention, it reweights tokens to region matching scores by incorporating
fairness sensitive similarity masks derived from debiasing prompt embeddings.
Together, these modulations keep fairness-sensitive semantics tied to the right
visual regions and prevent temporal drift across frames. Extensive experiments
on new VE fairness-oriented benchmark \textit{FairVE} demonstrate that FAME
achieves stronger fairness alignment and semantic fidelity, surpassing existing
VE baselines.

Abstract: Foundation models have transformed natural language processing and computer
vision, and their impact is now reshaping remote sensing image analysis. With
powerful generalization and transfer learning capabilities, they align
naturally with the multimodal, multi-resolution, and multi-temporal
characteristics of remote sensing data. To address unique challenges in the
field, multimodal geospatial foundation models (GFMs) have emerged as a
dedicated research frontier. This survey delivers a comprehensive review of
multimodal GFMs from a modality-driven perspective, covering five core visual
and vision-language modalities. We examine how differences in imaging physics
and data representation shape interaction design, and we analyze key techniques
for alignment, integration, and knowledge transfer to tackle modality
heterogeneity, distribution shifts, and semantic gaps. Advances in training
paradigms, architectures, and task-specific adaptation strategies are
systematically assessed alongside a wealth of emerging benchmarks.
Representative multimodal visual and vision-language GFMs are evaluated across
ten downstream tasks, with insights into their architectures, performance, and
application scenarios. Real-world case studies, spanning land cover mapping,
agricultural monitoring, disaster response, climate studies, and geospatial
intelligence, demonstrate the practical potential of GFMs. Finally, we outline
pressing challenges in domain generalization, interpretability, efficiency, and
privacy, and chart promising avenues for future research.

TL;DR: VALA is a variational alignment module that adaptively selects key frames and compresses their latent features into semantic anchors for consistent training-free video editing, improving temporal consistency and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing training-free video editing methods rely on heuristic frame selection for DDIM inversion, which introduces manual bias and reduces scalability for end-to-end inference.

Method: Proposes VALA (Variational Alignment for Latent Anchors) - a variational alignment module with contrastive learning that adaptively selects key frames and compresses latent features into semantic anchors to maintain temporal consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments show VALA achieves state-of-the-art performance in inversion fidelity, editing quality, and temporal consistency, with improved efficiency over prior methods.

Conclusion: VALA can be fully integrated into training-free text-to-image based video editing models and provides a more scalable solution for consistent video editing without manual frame selection bias.

Abstract: Recent advances in training-free video editing have enabled lightweight and
precise cross-frame generation by leveraging pre-trained text-to-image
diffusion models. However, existing methods often rely on heuristic frame
selection to maintain temporal consistency during DDIM inversion, which
introduces manual bias and reduces the scalability of end-to-end inference. In
this paper, we propose~\textbf{VALA} (\textbf{V}ariational \textbf{A}lignment
for \textbf{L}atent \textbf{A}nchors), a variational alignment module that
adaptively selects key frames and compresses their latent features into
semantic anchors for consistent video editing. To learn meaningful assignments,
VALA propose a variational framework with a contrastive learning objective.
Therefore, it can transform cross-frame latent representations into compressed
latent anchors that preserve both content and temporal coherence. Our method
can be fully integrated into training-free text-to-image based video editing
models. Extensive experiments on real-world video editing benchmarks show that
VALA achieves state-of-the-art performance in inversion fidelity, editing
quality, and temporal consistency, while offering improved efficiency over
prior methods.

TL;DR: This paper introduces UniScene, a unified framework for generating semantic occupancy, multi-view videos, and LiDAR point clouds for autonomous driving applications, using the largest semantic occupancy dataset Nuplan-Occ.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current occupancy-centric methods for driving scene generation depend heavily on annotated occupancy data, which remains scarce, limiting their performance and scalability.

Method: The authors develop a unified framework with spatio-temporal disentangled architecture for 4D dynamic occupancy generation, incorporating Gaussian splatting-based sparse point map rendering for multi-view videos and sensor-aware embedding for LiDAR simulation.

Result: Extensive experiments show superior generation fidelity and scalability compared to existing approaches, with practical value validated in downstream tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed UniScene framework effectively overcomes data scarcity limitations and achieves state-of-the-art performance in unified driving scene generation across multiple modalities.

Abstract: Driving scene generation is a critical domain for autonomous driving,
enabling downstream applications, including perception and planning evaluation.
Occupancy-centric methods have recently achieved state-of-the-art results by
offering consistent conditioning across frames and modalities; however, their
performance heavily depends on annotated occupancy data, which still remains
scarce. To overcome this limitation, we curate Nuplan-Occ, the largest semantic
occupancy dataset to date, constructed from the widely used Nuplan benchmark.
Its scale and diversity facilitate not only large-scale generative modeling but
also autonomous driving downstream applications. Based on this dataset, we
develop a unified framework that jointly synthesizes high-quality semantic
occupancy, multi-view videos, and LiDAR point clouds. Our approach incorporates
a spatio-temporal disentangled architecture to support high-fidelity spatial
expansion and temporal forecasting of 4D dynamic occupancy. To bridge modal
gaps, we further propose two novel techniques: a Gaussian splatting-based
sparse point map rendering strategy that enhances multi-view video generation,
and a sensor-aware embedding strategy that explicitly models LiDAR sensor
properties for realistic multi-LiDAR simulation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves superior generation fidelity and
scalability compared to existing approaches, and validates its practical value
in downstream tasks. Repo:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VoMP is a feed-forward method that predicts spatially-varying mechanical properties (Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, density) for 3D objects using multi-view rendering and a Geometry Transformer, trained on physically plausible material manifolds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physical simulation requires spatially-varying mechanical properties that are typically hand-crafted, which is laborious. There's a need for automated methods to predict these properties from 3D object representations.

Method: VoMP aggregates per-voxel multi-view features and uses a trained Geometry Transformer to predict per-voxel material latent codes. These codes reside on a learned manifold of physically plausible materials from real-world data. Training data is obtained through a pipeline combining segmented 3D datasets, material databases, and vision-language models.

Result: VoMP estimates accurate volumetric mechanical properties, significantly outperforming prior methods in both accuracy and speed.

Conclusion: The method successfully automates the prediction of spatially-varying mechanical properties for 3D objects, providing an efficient alternative to manual property assignment for physical simulation.

Abstract: Physical simulation relies on spatially-varying mechanical properties, often
laboriously hand-crafted. VoMP is a feed-forward method trained to predict
Young's modulus ($E$), Poisson's ratio ($\nu$), and density ($\rho$) throughout
the volume of 3D objects, in any representation that can be rendered and
voxelized. VoMP aggregates per-voxel multi-view features and passes them to our
trained Geometry Transformer to predict per-voxel material latent codes. These
latents reside on a manifold of physically plausible materials, which we learn
from a real-world dataset, guaranteeing the validity of decoded per-voxel
materials. To obtain object-level training data, we propose an annotation
pipeline combining knowledge from segmented 3D datasets, material databases,
and a vision-language model, along with a new benchmark. Experiments show that
VoMP estimates accurate volumetric properties, far outperforming prior art in
accuracy and speed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models struggle with concept consistency across images and overlook scene importance in storytelling, limiting creative applications in arts, films, and games.

Method: Proposes SceneDecorator with VLM-Guided Scene Planning for narrative coherence in a global-to-local manner, and Long-Term Scene-Sharing Attention for maintaining scene consistency and subject diversity across stories.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate SceneDecorator's superior performance in maintaining scene consistency and narrative coherence across generated stories.

Conclusion: SceneDecorator has strong potential to unleash creativity in arts, films, and games by addressing key challenges in scene-oriented story generation.

Abstract: Recent text-to-image models have revolutionized image generation, but they
still struggle with maintaining concept consistency across generated images.
While existing works focus on character consistency, they often overlook the
crucial role of scenes in storytelling, which restricts their creativity in
practice. This paper introduces scene-oriented story generation, addressing two
key challenges: (i) scene planning, where current methods fail to ensure
scene-level narrative coherence by relying solely on text descriptions, and
(ii) scene consistency, which remains largely unexplored in terms of
maintaining scene consistency across multiple stories. We propose
SceneDecorator, a training-free framework that employs VLM-Guided Scene
Planning to ensure narrative coherence across different scenes in a
``global-to-local'' manner, and Long-Term Scene-Sharing Attention to maintain
long-term scene consistency and subject diversity across generated stories.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of SceneDecorator,
highlighting its potential to unleash creativity in the fields of arts, films,
and games.

*Md Mostafijur Rahman,Radu Marculescu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoMix is a differentiable plug-and-play module that automatically learns optimal multi-scale logit fusion strategies for U-shaped networks, improving segmentation performance without inference overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current U-shaped networks treat multi-scale logits in isolation without exploring mixed-scale combinations, missing complementary cues from fusing coarse and fine predictions.

Method: LoMix mixes multi-scale decoder logits using four lightweight fusion operators (addition, multiplication, concatenation, attention) and co-optimizes loss weights with network parameters through a NAS-inspired approach.

Result: On Synapse 8-organ dataset, LoMix improves DICE by +4.2% over single-output supervision, +2.2% over deep supervision, and +1.5% over equally weighted additive fusion. With scarce data, advantage grows to +9.23%.

Conclusion: LoMix demonstrates that learnable weighted mixed-scale fusion generalizes broadly across benchmarks and networks while remaining data efficient, interpretable, and overhead-free at inference.

Abstract: U-shaped networks output logits at multiple spatial scales, each capturing a
different blend of coarse context and fine detail. Yet, training still treats
these logits in isolation - either supervising only the final,
highest-resolution logits or applying deep supervision with identical loss
weights at every scale - without exploring mixed-scale combinations.
Consequently, the decoder output misses the complementary cues that arise only
when coarse and fine predictions are fused. To address this issue, we introduce
LoMix (Logits Mixing), a NAS-inspired, differentiable plug-and-play module that
generates new mixed-scale outputs and learns how exactly each of them should
guide the training process. More precisely, LoMix mixes the multi-scale decoder
logits with four lightweight fusion operators: addition, multiplication,
concatenation, and attention-based weighted fusion, yielding a rich set of
synthetic mutant maps. Every original or mutant map is given a softplus loss
weight that is co-optimized with network parameters, mimicking a one-step
architecture search that automatically discovers the most useful scales,
mixtures, and operators. Plugging LoMix into recent U-shaped architectures
(i.e., PVT-V2-B2 backbone with EMCAD decoder) on Synapse 8-organ dataset
improves DICE by +4.2% over single-output supervision, +2.2% over deep
supervision, and +1.5% over equally weighted additive fusion, all with zero
inference overhead. When training data are scarce (e.g., one or two labeled
scans), the advantage grows to +9.23%, underscoring LoMix's data efficiency.
Across four benchmarks and diverse U-shaped networks, LoMiX improves DICE by up
to +13.5% over single-output supervision, confirming that learnable weighted
mixed-scale fusion generalizes broadly while remaining data efficient, fully
interpretable, and overhead-free at inference. Our code is available at

*Youcan Xu,Zhen Wang,Jiaxin Shi,Kexin Li,Feifei Shao,Jun Xiao,Yi Yang,Jun Yu,Long Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoMo is a framework for compositional motion customization in text-to-video generation that enables multiple distinct motions in a single video by addressing motion-appearance entanglement and multi-motion blending challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-video models struggle with precise motion control for complex multi-subject motions, and single-motion customization methods fail in compositional scenarios due to motion-appearance entanglement and ineffective multi-motion blending.

Method: Two-phase approach: 1) Single-motion learning phase with static-dynamic decoupled tuning to disentangle motion from appearance, 2) Multi-motion composition phase with plug-and-play divide-and-merge strategy that spatially isolates motion influences during denoising without additional training.

Result: CoMo achieves state-of-the-art performance in controllable video generation, successfully synthesizing multiple distinct motions within single videos as demonstrated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: CoMo significantly advances controllable video generation capabilities by enabling compositional motion customization and introduces a new benchmark and evaluation metric for multi-motion fidelity assessment.

Abstract: While recent text-to-video models excel at generating diverse scenes, they
struggle with precise motion control, particularly for complex, multi-subject
motions. Although methods for single-motion customization have been developed
to address this gap, they fail in compositional scenarios due to two primary
challenges: motion-appearance entanglement and ineffective multi-motion
blending. This paper introduces CoMo, a novel framework for
$\textbf{compositional motion customization}$ in text-to-video generation,
enabling the synthesis of multiple, distinct motions within a single video.
CoMo addresses these issues through a two-phase approach. First, in the
single-motion learning phase, a static-dynamic decoupled tuning paradigm
disentangles motion from appearance to learn a motion-specific module. Second,
in the multi-motion composition phase, a plug-and-play divide-and-merge
strategy composes these learned motions without additional training by
spatially isolating their influence during the denoising process. To facilitate
research in this new domain, we also introduce a new benchmark and a novel
evaluation metric designed to assess multi-motion fidelity and blending.

### [151] [UGAE: Unified Geometry and Attribute Enhancement for G-PCC Compressed Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23009)
*Pan Zhao,Hui Yuan,Chongzhen Tian,Tian Guo,Raouf Hamzaoui,Zhigeng Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified geometry and attribute enhancement (UGAE) framework for point cloud compression that improves both geometry reconstruction and attribute quality through three components: post-geometry enhancement, pre-attribute enhancement, and post-attribute enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lossy compression of point clouds reduces storage and transmission costs but causes irreversible distortion in geometry structure and attribute information, which needs to be addressed.

Method: UGAE framework with three components: 1) PoGE uses Transformer-based sparse convolutional U-Net for geometry reconstruction, 2) PAE uses enhanced geometry-guided recoloring with detail-aware KNN for attribute preservation, 3) PoAE uses attribute residual prediction network with weighted MSE loss for quality enhancement.

Result: Significantly outperformed existing methods on 8iVFB, Owlii, and MVUB datasets. Achieved 9.98 dB BD-PSNR gain and 90.98% BD-bitrate savings for geometry, and 3.67 dB BD-PSNR improvement with 56.88% BD-bitrate savings for attributes compared to G-PCC TMC13v29.

Conclusion: UGAE framework effectively enhances both geometry and attribute quality in point cloud compression, achieving substantial improvements in both objective metrics and perceptual quality.

Abstract: Lossy compression of point clouds reduces storage and transmission costs;
however, it inevitably leads to irreversible distortion in geometry structure
and attribute information. To address these issues, we propose a unified
geometry and attribute enhancement (UGAE) framework, which consists of three
core components: post-geometry enhancement (PoGE), pre-attribute enhancement
(PAE), and post-attribute enhancement (PoAE). In PoGE, a Transformer-based
sparse convolutional U-Net is used to reconstruct the geometry structure with
high precision by predicting voxel occupancy probabilities. Building on the
refined geometry structure, PAE introduces an innovative enhanced
geometry-guided recoloring strategy, which uses a detail-aware K-Nearest
Neighbors (DA-KNN) method to achieve accurate recoloring and effectively
preserve high-frequency details before attribute compression. Finally, at the
decoder side, PoAE uses an attribute residual prediction network with a
weighted mean squared error (W-MSE) loss to enhance the quality of
high-frequency regions while maintaining the fidelity of low-frequency regions.
UGAE significantly outperformed existing methods on three benchmark datasets:
8iVFB, Owlii, and MVUB. Compared to the latest G-PCC test model (TMC13v29),
UGAE achieved an average BD-PSNR gain of 9.98 dB and 90.98% BD-bitrate savings
for geometry under the D1 metric, as well as a 3.67 dB BD-PSNR improvement with
56.88% BD-bitrate savings for attributes on the Y component. Additionally, it
improved perceptual quality significantly.

*Huixuan Zhang,Xiaojun Wan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces M¬≥T2IBench, a challenging benchmark for evaluating text-to-image models on complex prompts with multiple instances and relations, along with AlignScore metric that correlates well with human evaluation. It also proposes a training-free Revise-Then-Enforce method to improve alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models struggle with complex prompts containing multiple instances of the same category, and existing evaluation methods either address overly simple scenarios or use metrics that don't correlate well with human judgment.

Method: Developed M¬≥T2IBench (multi-category, multi-instance, multi-relation benchmark) with AlignScore metric based on object detection. Proposed Revise-Then-Enforce approach - a training-free post-editing method to enhance image-text alignment in diffusion models.

Result: Current open-source text-to-image models perform poorly on the challenging M¬≥T2IBench benchmark. The proposed Revise-Then-Enforce method demonstrates improved image-text alignment across various diffusion models.

Conclusion: The study highlights the limitations of current text-to-image models in handling complex prompts and provides both a comprehensive evaluation benchmark and an effective post-editing solution to improve alignment without additional training.

Abstract: Text-to-image models are known to struggle with generating images that
perfectly align with textual prompts. Several previous studies have focused on
evaluating image-text alignment in text-to-image generation. However, these
evaluations either address overly simple scenarios, especially overlooking the
difficulty of prompts with multiple different instances belonging to the same
category, or they introduce metrics that do not correlate well with human
evaluation. In this study, we introduce M$^3$T2IBench, a large-scale,
multi-category, multi-instance, multi-relation along with an
object-detection-based evaluation metric, $AlignScore$, which aligns closely
with human evaluation. Our findings reveal that current open-source
text-to-image models perform poorly on this challenging benchmark.
Additionally, we propose the Revise-Then-Enforce approach to enhance image-text
alignment. This training-free post-editing method demonstrates improvements in
image-text alignment across a broad range of diffusion models. \footnote{Our
code and data has been released in supplementary material and will be made

Motivation: Current AI-generated image detection benchmarks have limited coverage of diverse generative models and image categories, often missing end-to-end image editing and artistic images, creating authenticity concerns.

Method: Developed UniAIDet benchmark that includes photographic and artistic images, covering text-to-image, image-to-image, inpainting, editing, and deepfake models. Used this benchmark to evaluate various detection methods.

Result: Comprehensive evaluation provided insights into generalization capability and the relationship between detection and localization of AI-generated content.

Conclusion: UniAIDet benchmark and analysis establish a robust foundation for future research in AI-generated image detection.

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of image generative models, the authenticity of
digital images has become a significant concern. While existing studies have
proposed various methods for detecting AI-generated content, current benchmarks
are limited in their coverage of diverse generative models and image
categories, often overlooking end-to-end image editing and artistic images. To
address these limitations, we introduce UniAIDet, a unified and comprehensive
benchmark that includes both photographic and artistic images. UniAIDet covers
a wide range of generative models, including text-to-image, image-to-image,
image inpainting, image editing, and deepfake models. Using UniAIDet, we
conduct a comprehensive evaluation of various detection methods and answer
three key research questions regarding generalization capability and the
relation between detection and localization. Our benchmark and analysis provide
a robust foundation for future research.

*Hongyu Wu,Xuhui Fan,Zhangkai Wu,Longbing Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NestAR is a nested autoregressive model that reduces computational complexity from O(n) to O(log n) for image generation while improving diversity through hierarchical multi-scale modules and flow matching loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autoregressive models for image generation are computationally intensive and often suffer from limited sample diversity, despite achieving competitive performance.

Method: Proposes nested AR architecture with hierarchical multi-scale modules where larger-scale modules are conditioned on smaller-scale outputs. Uses AR structure within each module to generate patches, incorporates flow matching for continuous tokens, and develops coordination objectives for multi-scale training.

Result: Achieves competitive image generation performance while significantly reducing computational cost compared to standard AR models.

Conclusion: NestAR provides an efficient and diverse alternative to traditional AR image generation models by leveraging nested hierarchical structures and flow matching techniques.

Abstract: AutoRegressive (AR) models have demonstrated competitive performance in image
generation, achieving results comparable to those of diffusion models. However,
their token-by-token image generation mechanism remains computationally
intensive and existing solutions such as VAR often lead to limited sample
diversity. In this work, we propose a Nested AutoRegressive~(NestAR) model,
which proposes nested AutoRegressive architectures in generating images. NestAR
designs multi-scale modules in a hierarchical order. These different scaled
modules are constructed in an AR architecture, where one larger-scale module is
conditioned on outputs from its previous smaller-scale module. Within each
module, NestAR uses another AR structure to generate ``patches'' of tokens. The
proposed nested AR architecture reduces the overall complexity from
$\mathcal{O}(n)$ to $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ in generating $n$ image tokens, as
well as increases image diversities. NestAR further incorporates flow matching
loss to use continuous tokens, and develops objectives to coordinate these
multi-scale modules in model training. NestAR achieves competitive image
generation performance while significantly lowering computational cost.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HieraMamba introduces a hierarchical architecture with Anchor-MambaPooling blocks that use Mamba's selective scanning to create compact anchor tokens summarizing video content at multiple scales, achieving state-of-the-art video temporal grounding performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for video temporal grounding often compromise temporal fidelity in long videos through over-downsampling or fixed windows, failing to capture both global context and fine-grained temporal details needed for precise localization.

Method: Uses hierarchical architecture with Anchor-MambaPooling blocks that employ Mamba's selective scanning to generate compact anchor tokens at multiple granularities, combined with anchor-conditioned and segment-pooled contrastive losses to preserve local detail while maintaining global discriminability.

Result: Sets new state-of-the-art performance on Ego4D-NLQ, MAD, and TACoS benchmarks, demonstrating precise and temporally faithful localization in long, untrimmed videos.

Conclusion: HieraMamba effectively addresses the challenge of preserving temporal structure and semantic richness across scales in video temporal grounding, enabling accurate localization in long videos through its hierarchical approach and complementary loss objectives.

Abstract: Video temporal grounding, the task of localizing the start and end times of a
natural language query in untrimmed video, requires capturing both global
context and fine-grained temporal detail. This challenge is particularly
pronounced in long videos, where existing methods often compromise temporal
fidelity by over-downsampling or relying on fixed windows. We present
HieraMamba, a hierarchical architecture that preserves temporal structure and
semantic richness across scales. At its core are Anchor-MambaPooling (AMP)
blocks, which utilize Mamba's selective scanning to produce compact anchor
tokens that summarize video content at multiple granularities. Two
complementary objectives, anchor-conditioned and segment-pooled contrastive
losses, encourage anchors to retain local detail while remaining globally
discriminative. HieraMamba sets a new state-of-the-art on Ego4D-NLQ, MAD, and
TACoS, demonstrating precise, temporally faithful localization in long,
untrimmed videos.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A simple method using MIND feature space transformation and ensembling to improve robustness of deep learning-based deformable registration for brain images across different contrasts and modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning registration methods often generalize poorly beyond their training data distribution, limiting practical usability. The LUMIR challenge aims to address this by evaluating performance on unseen contrasts and modalities.

Method: Transform input images into MIND feature space before feeding to the model, plus a special ensembling strategy for consistent improvement.

Result: Significantly improved robustness in brain registration across different contrasts and modalities not seen during training.

Conclusion: Simple MIND feature space transformation combined with ensembling effectively enhances generalization capability of deep learning registration methods for diverse imaging data.

Abstract: Deep learning based deformable registration methods have become popular in
recent years. However, their ability to generalize beyond training data
distribution can be poor, significantly hindering their usability. LUMIR brain
registration challenge for Learn2Reg 2025 aims to advance the field by
evaluating the performance of the registration on contrasts and modalities
different from those included in the training set. Here we describe our
submission to the challenge, which proposes a very simple idea for
significantly improving robustness by transforming the images into MIND feature
space before feeding them into the model. In addition, a special ensembling
strategy is proposed that shows a small but consistent improvement.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EndoWave is a 4D Gaussian Splatting framework for endoscopic 3D reconstruction that addresses photometric inconsistencies and tissue motion through optical flow constraints and multi-resolution wavelet supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Endoscopic surgery presents unique challenges like photometric inconsistencies, non-rigid tissue motion, and view-dependent highlights that mislead traditional 3DGS methods relying solely on appearance constraints.

Method: Uses unified spatio-temporal Gaussian representation in 4D domain, optical flow-based geometric constraint for temporal coherence, and multi-resolution rational orthogonal wavelet constraint to separate endoscopic details.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality and visual accuracy on EndoNeRF and StereoMIS surgical datasets compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: EndoWave effectively addresses endoscopic reconstruction challenges through geometric and wavelet constraints, demonstrating superior performance in surgical scenarios.

Abstract: In robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery, accurate 3D reconstruction from
endoscopic video is vital for downstream tasks and improved outcomes. However,
endoscopic scenarios present unique challenges, including photometric
inconsistencies, non-rigid tissue motion, and view-dependent highlights. Most
3DGS-based methods that rely solely on appearance constraints for optimizing
3DGS are often insufficient in this context, as these dynamic visual artifacts
can mislead the optimization process and lead to inaccurate reconstructions. To
address these limitations, we present EndoWave, a unified spatio-temporal
Gaussian Splatting framework by incorporating an optical flow-based geometric
constraint and a multi-resolution rational wavelet supervision. First, we adopt
a unified spatio-temporal Gaussian representation that directly optimizes
primitives in a 4D domain. Second, we propose a geometric constraint derived
from optical flow to enhance temporal coherence and effectively constrain the
3D structure of the scene. Third, we propose a multi-resolution rational
orthogonal wavelet as a constraint, which can effectively separate the details
of the endoscope and enhance the rendering performance. Extensive evaluations
on two real surgical datasets, EndoNeRF and StereoMIS, demonstrate that our
method EndoWave achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality and visual
accuracy compared to the baseline method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There has been little systematic investigation into multimodal position encoding, which is essential for vision-language models. The authors aim to fill this gap by comprehensively analyzing multimodal Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE).

Method: The authors conduct comprehensive analysis of multimodal RoPE, examining position design and frequency allocation. Based on their findings, they propose two simple plug-and-play variants: Multi-Head RoPE (MHRoPE) and MRoPE-Interleave (MRoPE-I) that require no architectural changes.

Result: The proposed methods consistently outperform existing approaches across diverse benchmarks, with significant improvements in both general and fine-grained multimodal understanding.

Conclusion: The study identifies three key guidelines for effective multimodal position encoding (positional coherence, full frequency utilization, and preservation of textual priors) and demonstrates that the proposed MHRoPE and MRoPE-I variants effectively implement these principles to enhance vision-language model performance.

Abstract: Multimodal position encoding is essential for vision-language models, yet
there has been little systematic investigation into multimodal position
encoding. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of multimodal Rotary Positional
Embedding (RoPE) by examining its two core components: position design and
frequency allocation. Through extensive experiments, we identify three key
guidelines: positional coherence, full frequency utilization, and preservation
of textual priors-ensuring unambiguous layout, rich representation, and
faithful transfer from the pre-trained LLM. Based on these insights, we propose
Multi-Head RoPE (MHRoPE) and MRoPE-Interleave (MRoPE-I), two simple and
plug-and-play variants that require no architectural changes. Our methods
consistently outperform existing approaches across diverse benchmarks, with
significant improvements in both general and fine-grained multimodal

### [159] [Residual Diffusion Bridge Model for Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23116)
*Hebaixu Wang,Jing Zhang,Haoyang Chen,Haonan Guo,Di Wang,Jiayi Ma,Bo Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Residual Diffusion Bridge Model (RDBM), a unified framework for image restoration that uses residual-based modulation to adaptively restore degraded regions while preserving intact areas, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion bridge models lack unified analytical perspective and indiscriminately reconstruct images through global noise injection/removal, which distorts undegraded regions due to imperfect reconstruction.

Method: Theoretically reformulate stochastic differential equations of generalized diffusion bridge, derive analytical formulas for forward/reverse processes, and use residuals from given distributions to modulate noise injection/removal for adaptive restoration.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance both qualitatively and quantitatively across diverse image restoration tasks, with the method showing optimality over existing bridge models.

Conclusion: RDBM provides a unified analytical framework that subsumes existing bridge models as special cases and enables adaptive restoration by leveraging residuals to preserve intact regions while restoring degraded areas.

Abstract: Diffusion bridge models establish probabilistic paths between arbitrary
paired distributions and exhibit great potential for universal image
restoration. Most existing methods merely treat them as simple variants of
stochastic interpolants, lacking a unified analytical perspective. Besides,
they indiscriminately reconstruct images through global noise injection and
removal, inevitably distorting undegraded regions due to imperfect
reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose the Residual Diffusion
Bridge Model (RDBM). Specifically, we theoretically reformulate the stochastic
differential equations of generalized diffusion bridge and derive the
analytical formulas of its forward and reverse processes. Crucially, we
leverage the residuals from given distributions to modulate the noise injection
and removal, enabling adaptive restoration of degraded regions while preserving
intact others. Moreover, we unravel the fundamental mathematical essence of
existing bridge models, all of which are special cases of RDBM and empirically
demonstrate the optimality of our proposed models. Extensive experiments are
conducted to demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method both
qualitatively and quantitatively across diverse image restoration tasks. Code

Conclusion: The task-agnostic pretraining framework provides robust multimodal fusion for time series and images, with validated cross-modal generation capabilities and superior downstream performance compared to specialized approaches.

Abstract: We propose a task-agnostic framework for multimodal fusion of time series and

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepSalt is a deep learning framework that transfers high-resolution spectral insights from lab spectroscopy to satellite hyperspectral imagery for large-scale soil salinity monitoring, using knowledge distillation and a Spectral Adaptation Unit to bridge domain gaps without extensive ground sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Soil salinization threatens ecosystems and agriculture by limiting plant water absorption and reducing crop productivity. Current methods face limitations: lab spectroscopy is precise but not scalable, while satellite imagery is scalable but lacks fine-grained interpretability.

Method: DeepSalt uses a deep-learning-based spectral transfer framework with knowledge distillation and a novel Spectral Adaptation Unit to transfer high-resolution spectral insights from laboratory-based spectroscopy to satellite-based hyperspectral sensing.

Result: DeepSalt achieves significant performance gains over methods without explicit domain adaptation, effectively generalizes to unseen geographic regions, and explains a substantial portion of the salinity variance without extensive ground sampling.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully bridges the gap between laboratory precision and satellite scalability, enabling accurate large-scale soil salinity estimation through effective domain adaptation and knowledge transfer.

Abstract: Soil salinization poses a significant threat to both ecosystems and
agriculture because it limits plants' ability to absorb water and, in doing so,
reduces crop productivity. This phenomenon alters the soil's spectral
properties, creating a measurable relationship between salinity and light
reflectance that enables remote monitoring. While laboratory spectroscopy
provides precise measurements, its reliance on in-situ sampling limits
scalability to regional or global levels. Conversely, hyperspectral satellite
imagery enables wide-area observation but lacks the fine-grained
interpretability of laboratory instruments. To bridge this gap, we introduce
DeepSalt, a deep-learning-based spectral transfer framework that leverages
knowledge distillation and a novel Spectral Adaptation Unit to transfer
high-resolution spectral insights from laboratory-based spectroscopy to
satellite-based hyperspectral sensing. Our approach eliminates the need for
extensive ground sampling while enabling accurate, large-scale salinity
estimation, as demonstrated through comprehensive empirical benchmarks.
DeepSalt achieves significant performance gains over methods without explicit
domain adaptation, underscoring the impact of the proposed Spectral Adaptation
Unit and the knowledge distillation strategy. The model also effectively
generalized to unseen geographic regions, explaining a substantial portion of
the salinity variance.

### [162] [Note on the Construction of Structure Tensor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23137)
*Josef Bigun,Fernado Alonso-Fernandez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper reconciles two different structure tensor constructions through Total Least Squares line fitting, showing they can be unified and simplified by removing unnecessary correction terms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To theoretically reconcile two seemingly different structure tensor approaches from 1987 and 1995 by viewing them through a common TLS framework.

Method: Analyzes both constructions through the lens of Total Least Squares line fitting to the power spectrum, comparing gradient-based and quadrature filter-based approaches.

Result: The correction term in the 1995 approach becomes unnecessary, ensuring positive semi-definite tensors and simpler eigenvalue interpretation. Enables multi-orientation fitting and alternative filter types.

Conclusion: Both structure tensor constructions can be unified under TLS framework, allowing broader filter choices and removing constraints while maintaining theoretical consistency.

Abstract: This note presents a theoretical discussion of two structure tensor
constructions: one proposed by Bigun and Granlund 1987, and the other by
Granlund and Knutsson 1995. At first glance, these approaches may appear quite
different--the former is implemented by averaging outer products of gradient
filter responses, while the latter constructs the tensor from weighted outer
products of tune-in frequency vectors of quadrature filters. We argue that when
both constructions are viewed through the common lens of Total Least Squares
(TLS) line fitting to the power spectrum, they can be reconciled to a large
extent, and additional benefits emerge. From this perspective, the correction
term introduced in Granlund and Knutsson 1995 becomes unnecessary. Omitting it
ensures that the resulting tensor remains positive semi-definite, thereby
simplifying the interpretation of its eigenvalues. Furthermore, this
interpretation allows fitting more than a single 0rientation to the input by
reinterpreting quadrature filter responses without relying on a structure
tensor. It also removes the constraint that responses must originate strictly
from quadrature filters, allowing the use of alternative filter types and
non-angular tessellations. These alternatives include Gabor filters--which,
although not strictly quadrature, are still suitable for structure tensor
construction--even when they tessellate the spectrum in a Cartesian fashion,
provided they are sufficiently concentrated.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DQ3D is a depth-guided query generator for 3D object detection that uses depth information and 2D detections to sample reference points from object surfaces/interiors, plus a hybrid attention mechanism to fuse historical detections for handling occlusions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use reference points for 3D object detection, but many reference points are far from target objects, leading to false positives. The paper aims to improve reference point sampling and handle occlusion issues.

Method: Proposes depth-guided query generator using depth information and 2D detections to ensure reference points are sampled from object surfaces/interiors. Introduces hybrid attention mechanism that fuses historical detection results with depth-guided queries.

Result: Evaluation on nuScenes dataset shows 6.3% improvement in mAP and 4.3% improvement in NDS compared to baseline.

Conclusion: The proposed DQ3D method effectively addresses false positive detections by improving reference point sampling and handles occlusion through hybrid queries, achieving significant performance gains on the nuScenes dataset.

Abstract: 3D object detection from multi-view images in traffic scenarios has garnered
significant attention in recent years. Many existing approaches rely on object
queries that are generated from 3D reference points to localize objects.
However, a limitation of these methods is that some reference points are often
far from the target object, which can lead to false positive detections. In
this paper, we propose a depth-guided query generator for 3D object detection
(DQ3D) that leverages depth information and 2D detections to ensure that
reference points are sampled from the surface or interior of the object.
Furthermore, to address partially occluded objects in current frame, we
introduce a hybrid attention mechanism that fuses historical detection results
with depth-guided queries, thereby forming hybrid queries. Evaluation on the
nuScenes dataset demonstrates that our method outperforms the baseline by 6.3\%
in terms of mean Average Precision (mAP) and 4.3\% in the NuScenes Detection
Score (NDS).

TL;DR: ITM is a new framework that implicitly models model transferability using DVA strategy, outperforming existing methods across diverse models and tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing transferability estimation methods struggle with emerging pre-trained models that have diverse architectures, training strategies, and task alignments.

Method: Proposes Implicit Transferability Modeling (ITM) with Divide-and-Conquer Variational Approximation (DVA) to efficiently approximate embedding space evolution.

Result: Extensive experiments show ITM consistently outperforms existing methods in stability, effectiveness, and efficiency across comprehensive benchmarks.

Conclusion: ITM enables better generalization across broader model ranges and downstream tasks, advancing the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm.

Abstract: Transferability estimation identifies the best pre-trained models for
downstream tasks without incurring the high computational cost of full
fine-tuning. This capability facilitates deployment and advances the
pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm. However, existing methods often struggle
to accurately assess transferability for emerging pre-trained models with
diverse architectures, training strategies, and task alignments. In this work,
we propose Implicit Transferability Modeling (ITM), a novel framework that
implicitly models each model's intrinsic transferability, coupled with a
Divide-and-Conquer Variational Approximation (DVA) strategy to efficiently
approximate embedding space evolution. This design enables generalization
across a broader range of models and downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on
a comprehensive benchmark--spanning extensive training regimes and a wider
variety of model types--demonstrate that ITM consistently outperforms existing
methods in terms of stability, effectiveness, and efficiency.

Method: Projects camera and LiDAR features into unified BEV space, enhances with window-based attention, and uses adaptive gated fusion module with cross-modal attention to selectively integrate reliable patterns.

Result: Achieves 93.92% accuracy on KITTI dataset and outperforms baseline by 24.88% on new Excavator3D (E3D) dataset, demonstrating superior robustness in complex industrial scenes.

Conclusion: AG-Fusion effectively handles unreliable modal information through selective cross-modal integration, providing robust 3D object detection performance in challenging environments.

Abstract: Multimodal camera-LiDAR fusion technology has found extensive application in
3D object detection, demonstrating encouraging performance. However, existing
methods exhibit significant performance degradation in challenging scenarios
characterized by sensor degradation or environmental disturbances. We propose a
novel Adaptive Gated Fusion (AG-Fusion) approach that selectively integrates
cross-modal knowledge by identifying reliable patterns for robust detection in
complex scenes. Specifically, we first project features from each modality into
a unified BEV space and enhance them using a window-based attention mechanism.
Subsequently, an adaptive gated fusion module based on cross-modal attention is
designed to integrate these features into reliable BEV representations robust
to challenging environments. Furthermore, we construct a new dataset named
Excavator3D (E3D) focusing on challenging excavator operation scenarios to
benchmark performance in complex conditions. Our method not only achieves
competitive performance on the standard KITTI dataset with 93.92% accuracy, but
also significantly outperforms the baseline by 24.88% on the challenging E3D
dataset, demonstrating superior robustness to unreliable modal information in
complex industrial scenes.

### [167] [Finding 3D Scene Analogies with Multimodal Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23184)
*Junho Kim,Young Min Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a zero-shot method using multimodal foundation models to find 3D scene analogies without additional training, enabling trajectory and waypoint transfer across different environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for 3D scene analogies require additional training and fixed object vocabularies, limiting their adaptability to new, unseen environments.

Method: Uses a hybrid neural representation combining sparse graph from vision-language model features and feature field from 3D shape foundation models, with coarse-to-fine alignment.

Result: Establishes accurate correspondences between complex scenes and successfully demonstrates applications in trajectory and waypoint transfer.

Conclusion: The approach enables zero-shot, open-vocabulary 3D scene analogy finding, supporting robot adaptation and planning in new environments without requiring additional training.

Abstract: Connecting current observations with prior experiences helps robots adapt and
plan in new, unseen 3D environments. Recently, 3D scene analogies have been
proposed to connect two 3D scenes, which are smooth maps that align scene
regions with common spatial relationships. These maps enable detailed transfer
of trajectories or waypoints, potentially supporting demonstration transfer for
imitation learning or task plan transfer across scenes. However, existing
methods for the task require additional training and fixed object vocabularies.
In this work, we propose to use multimodal foundation models for finding 3D
scene analogies in a zero-shot, open-vocabulary setting. Central to our
approach is a hybrid neural representation of scenes that consists of a sparse
graph based on vision-language model features and a feature field derived from
3D shape foundation models. 3D scene analogies are then found in a
coarse-to-fine manner, by first aligning the graph and refining the
correspondence with feature fields. Our method can establish accurate
correspondences between complex scenes, and we showcase applications in
trajectory and waypoint transfer.

*Pascal Benschop,Cristian Meo,Justin Dauwels,Jelte P. Mense*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates using vision-language models (VLMs) as zero-shot anomaly detectors in video by converting video to text descriptions and scoring via textual entailment, evaluating their spatial reasoning capabilities for anomalous action recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The overwhelming amount of video data from widespread camera use creates a critical need for automated anomaly detection in public safety and security, requiring embodied agents with spatial reasoning capabilities to interpret dynamic 3D scenes from 2D video.

Method: Frames anomalous action recognition as zero-shot language-grounded task using pre-trained vision-LLMs, converting video into text descriptions and scoring labels via textual entailment. Evaluates four open models on UCF-Crime and RWF-2000 datasets under prompting and privacy-preserving conditions.

Result: Few-shot exemplars can improve accuracy for some models but may increase false positives. Privacy filters (especially full-body GAN transforms) introduce inconsistencies that degrade accuracy. Models succeed with simple, spatially salient events but falter with noisy spatial cues and identity obfuscation.

Conclusion: Outlines paths to strengthen spatial grounding without task-specific training: structure-aware prompts, lightweight spatial memory, scene-graph or 3D-pose priors, and privacy methods preserving action-relevant geometry. Positions zero-shot language-grounded pipelines as adaptable building blocks for embodied video understanding.

Abstract: The widespread use of cameras in our society has created an overwhelming
amount of video data, far exceeding the capacity for human monitoring. This
presents a critical challenge for public safety and security, as the timely
detection of anomalous or criminal events is crucial for effective response and
prevention. The ability for an embodied agent to recognize unexpected events is
fundamentally tied to its capacity for spatial reasoning. This paper
investigates the spatial reasoning of vision-language models (VLMs) by framing
anomalous action recognition as a zero-shot, language-grounded task, addressing
the embodied perception challenge of interpreting dynamic 3D scenes from sparse
2D video. Specifically, we investigate whether small, pre-trained vision--LLMs
can act as spatially-grounded, zero-shot anomaly detectors by converting video
into text descriptions and scoring labels via textual entailment. We evaluate
four open models on UCF-Crime and RWF-2000 under prompting and
privacy-preserving conditions. Few-shot exemplars can improve accuracy for some
models, but may increase false positives, and privacy filters -- especially
full-body GAN transforms -- introduce inconsistencies that degrade accuracy.
These results chart where current vision--LLMs succeed (simple, spatially
salient events) and where they falter (noisy spatial cues, identity
obfuscation). Looking forward, we outline concrete paths to strengthen spatial
grounding without task-specific training: structure-aware prompts, lightweight
spatial memory across clips, scene-graph or 3D-pose priors during description,
and privacy methods that preserve action-relevant geometry. This positions
zero-shot, language-grounded pipelines as adaptable building blocks for
embodied, real-world video understanding. Our implementation for evaluating
VLMs is publicly available at:

*Lukas Bierling,Davide Pasero,Fleur Dolmans,Helia Ghasemi,Angelo Broere*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DECODINO improves upon DECO for human-object contact prediction by using a three-branch network with dual DINOv2 encoders, class-balanced loss, and patch-level cross-attention, achieving better accuracy and semantic labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous method DECO was limited to binary contact maps and struggled with soft surfaces, occlusions, children, and false-positive foot contacts, requiring improvements for more accurate human-object interaction modeling.

Method: Three-branch network using two DINOv2 ViT-g/14 encoders with class-balanced loss weighting, patch-level cross-attention for local reasoning, and lightweight MLP with softmax for semantic contact labeling.

Result: On DAMON benchmark: 7% higher binary-contact F1 score, halved geodesic error, added object-level semantic labels. Outperformed baseline in both DAMON Challenge tasks.

Conclusion: DECODINO successfully addresses DECO's limitations through dual encoders and LoRA fine-tuning, providing more accurate and semantically rich human-object contact predictions.

Abstract: Accurate vertex-level contact prediction between humans and surrounding
objects is a prerequisite for high fidelity human object interaction models
used in robotics, AR/VR, and behavioral simulation. DECO was the first in the
wild estimator for this task but is limited to binary contact maps and
struggles with soft surfaces, occlusions, children, and false-positive foot
contacts. We address these issues and introduce DecoDINO, a three-branch
network based on DECO's framework. It uses two DINOv2 ViT-g/14 encoders,
class-balanced loss weighting to reduce bias, and patch-level cross-attention
for improved local reasoning. Vertex features are finally passed through a
lightweight MLP with a softmax to assign semantic contact labels. We also
tested a vision-language model (VLM) to integrate text features, but the
simpler architecture performed better and was used instead. On the DAMON
benchmark, DecoDINO (i) raises the binary-contact F1 score by 7$\%$, (ii)
halves the geodesic error, and (iii) augments predictions with object-level
semantic labels. Ablation studies show that LoRA fine-tuning and the dual
encoders are key to these improvements. DecoDINO outperformed the challenge
baseline in both tasks of the DAMON Challenge. Our code is available at

*Hoonhee Cho,Jae-Young Kang,Giwon Lee,Hyemin Yang,Heejun Park,Seokwoo Jung,Kuk-Jin Yoon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VR-Drive is an end-to-end autonomous driving framework that improves viewpoint robustness through joint 3D scene reconstruction and view synthesis, enabling better planning under varying camera viewpoints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current end-to-end autonomous driving systems struggle with robustness to varying camera viewpoints, which is a common real-world challenge due to diverse vehicle configurations.

Method: VR-Drive jointly learns 3D scene reconstruction as an auxiliary task for planning-aware view synthesis, uses a viewpoint-mixed memory bank for temporal interaction across viewpoints, and employs viewpoint-consistent distillation to transfer knowledge from original to synthesized views.

Result: VR-Drive effectively mitigates synthesis-induced noise and improves planning under viewpoint shifts, demonstrating scalable and robust performance for real-world deployment.

Conclusion: VR-Drive provides a scalable and robust solution for viewpoint generalization in end-to-end autonomous driving systems, addressing a key challenge for real-world deployment.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) has emerged as a promising paradigm
that unifies perception, prediction, and planning into a holistic, data-driven
framework. However, achieving robustness to varying camera viewpoints, a common
real-world challenge due to diverse vehicle configurations, remains an open
problem. In this work, we propose VR-Drive, a novel E2E-AD framework that
addresses viewpoint generalization by jointly learning 3D scene reconstruction
as an auxiliary task to enable planning-aware view synthesis. Unlike prior
scene-specific synthesis approaches, VR-Drive adopts a feed-forward inference
strategy that supports online training-time augmentation from sparse views
without additional annotations. To further improve viewpoint consistency, we
introduce a viewpoint-mixed memory bank that facilitates temporal interaction
across multiple viewpoints and a viewpoint-consistent distillation strategy
that transfers knowledge from original to synthesized views. Trained in a fully
end-to-end manner, VR-Drive effectively mitigates synthesis-induced noise and
improves planning under viewpoint shifts. In addition, we release a new
benchmark dataset to evaluate E2E-AD performance under novel camera viewpoints,
enabling comprehensive analysis. Our results demonstrate that VR-Drive is a
scalable and robust solution for the real-world deployment of end-to-end
autonomous driving systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PathSearch is a retrieval framework for whole slide images that combines fine-grained mosaic representations with global embeddings using vision-language contrastive learning, enabling accurate image-to-image and text-to-image retrieval in digital pathology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of retrieving gigapixel whole slide images by capturing both fine-grained morphological details and high-level semantic patterns, supporting pathologists in diagnosis, consistency, and education.

Method: Unifies fine-grained attentive mosaic representations with global slide embeddings aligned through vision-language contrastive learning, trained on 6,926 slide-report pairs, supporting both image-to-image and multi-modal text-to-slide retrieval.

Result: Outperforms traditional retrieval frameworks on four public datasets and three in-house cohorts across various tasks including anatomical site retrieval, tumor subtyping, and grading. Multi-center reader study shows improved diagnostic accuracy, confidence, and inter-observer agreement.

Conclusion: PathSearch establishes itself as a scalable and generalizable retrieval solution for digital pathology that effectively supports clinical workflows and improves pathologist performance.

Abstract: The rapid digitization of histopathology slides has opened up new
possibilities for computational tools in clinical and research workflows. Among
these, content-based slide retrieval stands out, enabling pathologists to
identify morphologically and semantically similar cases, thereby supporting
precise diagnoses, enhancing consistency across observers, and assisting
example-based education. However, effective retrieval of whole slide images
(WSIs) remains challenging due to their gigapixel scale and the difficulty of
capturing subtle semantic differences amid abundant irrelevant content. To
overcome these challenges, we present PathSearch, a retrieval framework that
unifies fine-grained attentive mosaic representations with global-wise slide
embeddings aligned through vision-language contrastive learning. Trained on a
corpus of 6,926 slide-report pairs, PathSearch captures both fine-grained
morphological cues and high-level semantic patterns to enable accurate and
flexible retrieval. The framework supports two key functionalities: (1)
mosaic-based image-to-image retrieval, ensuring accurate and efficient slide
research; and (2) multi-modal retrieval, where text queries can directly
retrieve relevant slides. PathSearch was rigorously evaluated on four public
pathology datasets and three in-house cohorts, covering tasks including
anatomical site retrieval, tumor subtyping, tumor vs. non-tumor discrimination,
and grading across diverse organs such as breast, lung, kidney, liver, and
stomach. External results show that PathSearch outperforms traditional
image-to-image retrieval frameworks. A multi-center reader study further
demonstrates that PathSearch improves diagnostic accuracy, boosts confidence,
and enhances inter-observer agreement among pathologists in real clinical
scenarios. These results establish PathSearch as a scalable and generalizable
retrieval solution for digital pathology.

*Razaib Tariq,Minji Heo,Simon S. Woo,Shahroz Tariq*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deepfake detectors suffer significant performance degradation (up to 25.4%) when dealing with Moir√© artifacts from smartphone-captured screen videos, and demoir√©ing methods actually worsen detection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world deepfake detection faces challenges from Moir√© artifacts introduced when capturing media from digital screens using smartphones, an issue that has been largely overlooked in existing research.

Method: Systematic evaluation of 15 state-of-the-art deepfake detectors using a dataset of 12,832 videos (35.64 hours) from multiple sources, plus additional experiments with DeepMoir√©Fake dataset and synthetic Moir√© generation techniques.

Result: Moir√© artifacts degraded detector performance by up to 25.4%, synthetic Moir√© patterns caused 21.4% accuracy drop, and demoir√©ing methods unexpectedly reduced accuracy by up to 17.2% instead of helping.

Conclusion: There is an urgent need for detection models robust to Moir√© distortions and other real-world challenges; the introduced DMF dataset aims to bridge the gap between controlled experiments and practical deepfake detection.

Abstract: Deepfake detection remains a pressing challenge, particularly in real-world
settings where smartphone-captured media from digital screens often introduces
Moir\'e artifacts that can distort detection outcomes. This study
systematically evaluates state-of-the-art (SOTA) deepfake detectors on
Moir\'e-affected videos, an issue that has received little attention. We
collected a dataset of 12,832 videos, spanning 35.64 hours, from the Celeb-DF,
DFD, DFDC, UADFV, and FF++ datasets, capturing footage under diverse real-world
conditions, including varying screens, smartphones, lighting setups, and camera
angles. To further examine the influence of Moir\'e patterns on deepfake
detection, we conducted additional experiments using our DeepMoir\'eFake,
referred to as (DMF) dataset and two synthetic Moir\'e generation techniques.
Across 15 top-performing detectors, our results show that Moir\'e artifacts
degrade performance by as much as 25.4%, while synthetically generated Moir\'e
patterns lead to a 21.4% drop in accuracy. Surprisingly, demoir\'eing methods,
intended as a mitigation approach, instead worsened the problem, reducing
accuracy by up to 17.2%. These findings underscore the urgent need for
detection models that can robustly handle Moir\'e distortions alongside other
realworld challenges, such as compression, sharpening, and blurring. By
introducing the DMF dataset, we aim to drive future research toward closing the
gap between controlled experiments and practical deepfake detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Eruku is a new approach for Styled Handwritten Text Generation that frames the task as multimodal prompt-conditioned generation, using special textual tokens and Classifier-Free Guidance to improve content controllability and style generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autoregressive Transformer methods for HTG require additional inputs, lack proper stop mechanisms, create repetition loops and visual artifacts, and have content controllability issues.

Method: Reformulates HTG as multimodal prompt-conditioned generation with special textual input tokens for better visual alignment, and implements Classifier-Free Guidance for the autoregressive model.

Result: Eruku requires fewer inputs, generalizes better to unseen styles, follows textual prompts more faithfully, and improves content adherence compared to previous solutions.

Conclusion: The proposed Eruku approach successfully addresses key limitations of existing HTG methods by improving content controllability and style generalization through multimodal prompt conditioning and special token alignment.

Abstract: Generating faithful and readable styled text images (especially for Styled
Handwritten Text generation - HTG) is an open problem with several possible
applications across graphic design, document understanding, and image editing.
A lot of research effort in this task is dedicated to developing strategies
that reproduce the stylistic characteristics of a given writer, with promising
results in terms of style fidelity and generalization achieved by the recently
proposed Autoregressive Transformer paradigm for HTG. However, this method
requires additional inputs, lacks a proper stop mechanism, and might end up in
repetition loops, generating visual artifacts. In this work, we rethink the
autoregressive formulation by framing HTG as a multimodal prompt-conditioned
generation task, and tackle the content controllability issues by introducing
special textual input tokens for better alignment with the visual ones.
Moreover, we devise a Classifier-Free-Guidance-based strategy for our
autoregressive model. Through extensive experimental validation, we demonstrate
that our approach, dubbed Eruku, compared to previous solutions requires fewer
inputs, generalizes better to unseen styles, and follows more faithfully the
textual prompt, improving content adherence.

*Stefan M. Fischer,Johannes Kiechle,Laura Daza,Lina Felsner,Richard Osuala,Daniel M. Lang,Karim Lekadir,Jan C. Peeken,Julia A. Schnabel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Progressive Growing of Patch Size is a curriculum learning method that increases patch size during training, improving class balance and accelerating convergence for 3D medical image segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address class imbalance issues in 3D medical image segmentation and improve training efficiency by automatically adjusting patch sizes during training.

Method: Progressive curriculum learning approach that gradually increases patch size during model training, evaluated in resource-efficient and performance modes across 15 diverse 3D medical segmentation tasks.

Result: Resource-efficient mode reduces training time to 44% while matching baseline performance; performance mode achieves 1.28% relative Dice score improvement with 89% training time. Benefits are strongest for imbalanced tasks like lesion segmentation.

Conclusion: The progressive patch size curriculum is a simple, broadly applicable strategy that improves both segmentation performance and training efficiency across diverse architectures including UNet, UNETR, and SwinUNETR.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce Progressive Growing of Patch Size, an automatic
curriculum learning approach for 3D medical image segmentation. Our approach
progressively increases the patch size during model training, resulting in an
improved class balance for smaller patch sizes and accelerated convergence of
the training process. We evaluate our curriculum approach in two settings: a
resource-efficient mode and a performance mode, both regarding Dice score
performance and computational costs across 15 diverse and popular 3D medical
image segmentation tasks. The resource-efficient mode matches the Dice score
performance of the conventional constant patch size sampling baseline with a
notable reduction in training time to only 44%. The performance mode improves
upon constant patch size segmentation results, achieving a statistically
significant relative mean performance gain of 1.28% in Dice Score. Remarkably,
across all 15 tasks, our proposed performance mode manages to surpass the
constant patch size baseline in Dice Score performance, while simultaneously
reducing training time to only 89%. The benefits are particularly pronounced
for highly imbalanced tasks such as lesion segmentation tasks. Rigorous
experiments demonstrate that our performance mode not only improves mean
segmentation performance but also reduces performance variance, yielding more
trustworthy model comparison. Furthermore, our findings reveal that the
proposed curriculum sampling is not tied to a specific architecture but
represents a broadly applicable strategy that consistently boosts performance
across diverse segmentation models, including UNet, UNETR, and SwinUNETR. In
summary, we show that this simple yet elegant transformation on input data
substantially improves both Dice Score performance and training runtime, while
being compatible across diverse segmentation backbones.

### [175] [A Video Is Not Worth a Thousand Words](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23253)
*Sam Pollard,Michael Wray*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Shapley values to compute feature attributions and modality scores for evaluating vision language models (VLMs) in video question answering (VQA), revealing that current models heavily depend on text and that multiple-choice VQA tasks essentially test a model's ability to ignore distractors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is growing concern about text dominance in VLMs due to their reliance on large language model backbones, and current evaluation methods don't adequately explore modality interactions or measure if we're progressing in the right direction with multi-modal model complexity.

Method: The authors propose a joint method using Shapley values to compute both feature attributions and modality scores, where features and modalities are arbitrarily definable. They compare 6 VLM models with varying context lengths on 4 representative datasets, treating video frames and textual elements as equal features and analyzing the multiple-choice VQA task as an interaction between video, question, and answer modalities.

Result: The results demonstrate a strong dependence on text in current VLMs and reveal that the multiple-choice VQA task essentially devolves into testing a model's ability to ignore distractors rather than truly understanding multi-modal interactions.

Conclusion: Current evaluation approaches for VLMs in VQA may be misleading, as they primarily measure text processing capabilities and distractor filtering rather than genuine multi-modal understanding, highlighting the need for better evaluation metrics that properly assess modality interactions.

Abstract: As we become increasingly dependent on vision language models (VLMs) to
answer questions about the world around us, there is a significant amount of
research devoted to increasing both the difficulty of video question answering
(VQA) datasets, and the context lengths of the models that they evaluate. The
reliance on large language models as backbones has lead to concerns about
potential text dominance, and the exploration of interactions between
modalities is underdeveloped. How do we measure whether we're heading in the
right direction, with the complexity that multi-modal models introduce? We
propose a joint method of computing both feature attributions and modality
scores based on Shapley values, where both the features and modalities are
arbitrarily definable. Using these metrics, we compare $6$ VLM models of
varying context lengths on $4$ representative datasets, focusing on
multiple-choice VQA. In particular, we consider video frames and whole textual
elements as equal features in the hierarchy, and the multiple-choice VQA task
as an interaction between three modalities: video, question and answer. Our
results demonstrate a dependence on text and show that the multiple-choice VQA
task devolves into a model's ability to ignore distractors. Code available at

*Veska Tsenkova,Peter Stanchev,Daniel Petrov,Deyan Lazarov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes an end-to-end hierarchical CNN model for image detection and classification that captures natural hierarchical relationships between objects, addressing limitations of conventional flat classification methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world objects have natural hierarchical organizations that can significantly help classification tasks, but current CNN methods focus only on flat classification which overlooks these relationships and contextual understanding.

Method: Built upon YOLO model family with novel hierarchical architecture, modified loss function, and hierarchical performance metrics. Trained on two hierarchical categorizations of the same dataset - systematic categorization and visual similarity-based categorization.

Result: The proposed methodology successfully addresses the inherent hierarchical structure in real-world objects that conventional flat classification algorithms often overlook.

Conclusion: Hierarchical modeling enables better contextual understanding and control over mistake severity by capturing relationships between objects, providing advantages over traditional flat classification approaches.

Abstract: Current convolution neural network (CNN) classification methods are
predominantly focused on flat classification which aims solely to identify a
specified object within an image. However, real-world objects often possess a
natural hierarchical organization that can significantly help classification
tasks. Capturing the presence of relations between objects enables better
contextual understanding as well as control over the severity of mistakes.
Considering these aspects, this paper proposes an end-to-end hierarchical model
for image detection and classification built upon the YOLO model family. A
novel hierarchical architecture, a modified loss function, and a performance
metric tailored to the hierarchical nature of the model are introduced. The
proposed model is trained and evaluated on two different hierarchical
categorizations of the same dataset: a systematic categorization that
disregards visual similarities between objects and a categorization accounting
for common visual characteristics across classes. The results illustrate how
the suggested methodology addresses the inherent hierarchical structure present
in real-world objects, which conventional flat classification algorithms often
overlook.

TL;DR: AdaSDE is a novel single-step SDE solver that dynamically regulates error correction strength to accelerate diffusion sampling, achieving state-of-the-art performance with only 5 function evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the complementary weaknesses of ODE and SDE solvers in diffusion-based generative processes - ODE solvers accumulate irreducible gradient error while SDE methods suffer from amplified discretization errors with limited step budgets.

Method: Introduces AdaSDE with a single per-step learnable coefficient estimated via lightweight distillation, which dynamically regulates error correction strength. The framework can be integrated with existing solvers.

Result: State-of-the-art performance: at 5 NFE, achieves FID scores of 4.18 on CIFAR-10, 8.05 on FFHQ and 6.96 on LSUN Bedroom.

Conclusion: AdaSDE successfully unifies the efficiency of ODEs with the error resilience of SDEs, providing an effective solution for accelerating diffusion sampling while maintaining high sample quality.

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative processes, formulated as differential equation
solving, frequently balance computational speed with sample quality. Our
theoretical investigation of ODE- and SDE-based solvers reveals complementary
weaknesses: ODE solvers accumulate irreducible gradient error along
deterministic trajectories, while SDE methods suffer from amplified
discretization errors when the step budget is limited. Building upon this
insight, we introduce AdaSDE, a novel single-step SDE solver that aims to unify
the efficiency of ODEs with the error resilience of SDEs. Specifically, we
introduce a single per-step learnable coefficient, estimated via lightweight
distillation, which dynamically regulates the error correction strength to
accelerate diffusion sampling. Notably, our framework can be integrated with
existing solvers to enhance their capabilities. Extensive experiments
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance: at 5 NFE, AdaSDE achieves FID scores
of 4.18 on CIFAR-10, 8.05 on FFHQ and 6.96 on LSUN Bedroom. Codes are available

TL;DR: MMSD3.0 is a new multi-image sarcasm detection benchmark, and CIRM is proposed as a cross-image reasoning model that achieves state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sarcasm detection methods focus on single-image scenarios, ignoring multi-image cues that are common in real-world settings like tweets and reviews.

Method: Proposed Cross-Image Reasoning Model (CIRM) with targeted cross-image sequence modeling and relevance-guided fine-grained cross-modal fusion based on text-image correspondence.

Result: MMSD3.0 is shown to be an effective benchmark reflecting real-world conditions, and CIRM achieves state-of-the-art performance across MMSD, MMSD2.0 and MMSD3.0 datasets.

Conclusion: The work successfully addresses the gap in multi-image sarcasm detection and demonstrates CIRM's effectiveness in both single-image and multi-image scenarios.

Abstract: Despite progress in multimodal sarcasm detection, existing datasets and
methods predominantly focus on single-image scenarios, overlooking potential
semantic and affective relations across multiple images. This leaves a gap in
modeling cases where sarcasm is triggered by multi-image cues in real-world
settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMSD3.0, a new benchmark composed
entirely of multi-image samples curated from tweets and Amazon reviews. We
further propose the Cross-Image Reasoning Model (CIRM), which performs targeted
cross-image sequence modeling to capture latent inter-image connections. In
addition, we introduce a relevance-guided, fine-grained cross-modal fusion
mechanism based on text-image correspondence to reduce information loss during
integration. We establish a comprehensive suite of strong and representative
baselines and conduct extensive experiments, showing that MMSD3.0 is an
effective and reliable benchmark that better reflects real-world conditions.
Moreover, CIRM demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across MMSD, MMSD2.0
and MMSD3.0, validating its effectiveness in both single-image and multi-image
scenarios.

Motivation: Real-world ReID systems face modality inconsistencies where query and gallery images come from different sensors (RGB, NIR, TIR), but most existing methods assume modality-matched conditions, limiting their practical robustness and scalability.

Method: MDReID introduces Modality Decoupling Learning (MDL) to decompose modality features into modality-shared and modality-specific representations, and Modality-aware Metric Learning (MML) to enforce orthogonality and complementarity between these components.

Result: Extensive experiments on three multi-modality ReID benchmarks show MDReID achieves significant mAP improvements: 9.8%, 3.0%, and 11.5% in modality-matched scenarios, and average gains of 3.4%, 11.8%, and 10.9% in modality-mismatched scenarios.

Conclusion: MDReID effectively addresses modality inconsistencies in real-world ReID systems through explicit modality decomposition and specialized metric learning, demonstrating superior performance across both modality-aligned and mismatched conditions.

Abstract: Real-world object re-identification (ReID) systems often face modality
inconsistencies, where query and gallery images come from different sensors
(e.g., RGB, NIR, TIR). However, most existing methods assume modality-matched
conditions, which limits their robustness and scalability in practical
applications. To address this challenge, we propose MDReID, a flexible
any-to-any image-level ReID framework designed to operate under both
modality-matched and modality-mismatched scenarios. MDReID builds on the
insight that modality information can be decomposed into two components:
modality-shared features that are predictable and transferable, and
modality-specific features that capture unique, modality-dependent
characteristics. To effectively leverage this, MDReID introduces two key
components: the Modality Decoupling Learning (MDL) and Modality-aware Metric
Learning (MML). Specifically, MDL explicitly decomposes modality features into
modality-shared and modality-specific representations, enabling effective
retrieval in both modality-aligned and mismatched scenarios. MML, a tailored
metric learning strategy, further enforces orthogonality and complementarity
between the two components to enhance discriminative power across modalities.
Extensive experiments conducted on three challenging multi-modality ReID
benchmarks (RGBNT201, RGBNT100, MSVR310) consistently demonstrate the
superiority of MDReID. Notably, MDReID achieves significant mAP improvements of
9.8\%, 3.0\%, and 11.5\% in general modality-matched scenarios, and average
gains of 3.4\%, 11.8\%, and 10.9\% in modality-mismatched scenarios,
respectively. The code is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReconViaGen integrates reconstruction priors into diffusion-based 3D generative methods to address incompleteness in multi-view 3D object reconstruction caused by occlusions and sparse view coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-view 3D reconstruction methods suffer from severe incompleteness due to insufficient view overlap, occlusions, and sparse coverage. While diffusion-based 3D generative techniques can hallucinate invisible parts, their stochastic nature limits accuracy and reliability.

Method: Proposes ReconViaGen framework that integrates reconstruction priors into generative framework. Addresses two key issues: (1) insufficiency in constructing cross-view connections when extracting multi-view image features, and (2) poor controllability of iterative denoising during local detail generation.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReconViaGen can reconstruct complete and accurate 3D models consistent with input views in both global structure and local details.

Conclusion: ReconViaGen successfully integrates reconstruction priors into generative frameworks, overcoming limitations of both traditional reconstruction methods and diffusion-based generative approaches to achieve consistent and complete 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: Existing multi-view 3D object reconstruction methods heavily rely on
sufficient overlap between input views, where occlusions and sparse coverage in
practice frequently yield severe reconstruction incompleteness. Recent
advancements in diffusion-based 3D generative techniques offer the potential to
address these limitations by leveraging learned generative priors to
hallucinate invisible parts of objects, thereby generating plausible 3D
structures. However, the stochastic nature of the inference process limits the
accuracy and reliability of generation results, preventing existing
reconstruction frameworks from integrating such 3D generative priors. In this
work, we comprehensively analyze the reasons why diffusion-based 3D generative
methods fail to achieve high consistency, including (a) the insufficiency in
constructing and leveraging cross-view connections when extracting multi-view
image features as conditions, and (b) the poor controllability of iterative
denoising during local detail generation, which easily leads to plausible but
inconsistent fine geometric and texture details with inputs. Accordingly, we
propose ReconViaGen to innovatively integrate reconstruction priors into the
generative framework and devise several strategies that effectively address
these issues. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ReconViaGen can
reconstruct complete and accurate 3D models consistent with input views in both
global structure and local details.Project page:

*Yifan Jiao,Xinran Liu,Xiaoqiong Liu,Xiaohui Yuan,Heng Fan,Libo Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PlanarTrack is a large-scale benchmark for planar tracking with 1,150 sequences and over 733K frames, including both short-term and long-term videos recorded in unconstrained conditions to provide realistic evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The development of planar tracking in the deep learning era is limited due to the lack of large-scale platforms, making it difficult to advance the field compared to generic tracking.

Method: Created PlanarTrack benchmark with 1,150 sequences (1,000 short-term, 150 long-term) recorded in unconstrained conditions, manually annotated with four corner points per frame, and ensuring each sequence has a unique target to enhance diversity.

Result: PlanarTrack is the largest and most diverse planar tracking dataset to date. Evaluation of 10 representative trackers shows significant performance degradation on this challenging benchmark, indicating current methods are insufficient.

Conclusion: PlanarTrack provides a comprehensive benchmark for planar tracking evaluation, revealing that current state-of-the-art methods struggle with realistic challenges, highlighting the need for further research and improvement in planar tracking.

Abstract: Planar tracking has drawn increasing interest owing to its key roles in
robotics and augmented reality. Despite recent great advancement, further
development of planar tracking, particularly in the deep learning era, is
largely limited compared to generic tracking due to the lack of large-scale
platforms. To mitigate this, we propose PlanarTrack, a large-scale high-quality
and challenging benchmark for planar tracking. Specifically, PlanarTrack
consists of 1,150 sequences with over 733K frames, including 1,000 short-term
and 150 new long-term videos, which enables comprehensive evaluation of short-
and long-term tracking performance. All videos in PlanarTrack are recorded in
unconstrained conditions from the wild, which makes PlanarTrack challenging but
more realistic for real-world applications. To ensure high-quality annotations,
each video frame is manually annotated by four corner points with multi-round
meticulous inspection and refinement. To enhance target diversity of
PlanarTrack, we only capture a unique target in one sequence, which is
different from existing benchmarks. To our best knowledge, PlanarTrack is by
far the largest and most diverse and challenging dataset dedicated to planar
tracking. To understand performance of existing methods on PlanarTrack and to
provide a comparison for future research, we evaluate 10 representative planar
trackers with extensive comparison and in-depth analysis. Our evaluation
reveals that, unsurprisingly, the top planar trackers heavily degrade on the
challenging PlanarTrack, which indicates more efforts are required for
improving planar tracking. Our data and results will be released at

*Songxi Yang,Tang Sui,Qunying Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LSSR is an efficient remote sensing super resolution framework that uses frozen pretrained Stable Diffusion with cross-modal attention, auxiliary knowledge integration, and specialized losses to achieve state-of-the-art performance while maintaining fast inference speeds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of current diffusion models for remote sensing super resolution, including expensive training requirements, slow inference, limited use of auxiliary information, and lack of downstream task evaluation.

Method: Built on frozen pretrained Stable Diffusion, integrates cross-modal attention with auxiliary knowledge (DEM, land cover, month) and SAR guidance, enhanced by adapters and Fourier NDVI loss to balance spatial details and spectral fidelity.

Result: Achieved PSNR/SSIM of 32.63/0.84 (RGB) and 23.99/0.78 (IR), lowest NDVI MSE (0.042), efficient inference (0.39 sec/image), and improved crop classification (F1: 0.86) compared to Sentinel-2 (F1: 0.85).

Conclusion: LSSR demonstrates the potential of remote sensing super resolution to advance precision agriculture through efficient, high-quality image reconstruction with effective downstream task performance.

Abstract: Super resolution offers a way to harness medium even lowresolution but
historically valuable remote sensing image archives. Generative models,
especially diffusion models, have recently been applied to remote sensing super
resolution (RSSR), yet several challenges exist. First, diffusion models are
effective but require expensive training from scratch resources and have slow
inference speeds. Second, current methods have limited utilization of auxiliary
information as real-world constraints to reconstruct scientifically realistic
images. Finally, most current methods lack evaluation on downstream tasks. In
this study, we present a efficient LSSR framework for RSSR, supported by a new
multimodal dataset of paired 30 m Landsat 8 and 10 m Sentinel 2 imagery. Built
on frozen pretrained Stable Diffusion, LSSR integrates crossmodal attention
with auxiliary knowledge (Digital Elevation Model, land cover, month) and
Synthetic Aperture Radar guidance, enhanced by adapters and a tailored Fourier
NDVI loss to balance spatial details and spectral fidelity. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that LSSR significantly improves crop boundary
delineation and recovery, achieving state-of-the-art performance with Peak
Signal-to-Noise Ratio/Structural Similarity Index Measure of 32.63/0.84 (RGB)
and 23.99/0.78 (IR), and the lowest NDVI Mean Squared Error (0.042), while
maintaining efficient inference (0.39 sec/image). Moreover, LSSR transfers
effectively to NASA Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel (HLS) super resolution,
yielding more reliable crop classification (F1: 0.86) than Sentinel-2 (F1:
0.85). These results highlight the potential of RSSR to advance precision
agriculture.

*Lu Dong,Haiyu Zhang,Han Lin,Ziang Yan,Xiangyu Zeng,Hongjie Zhang,Yifei Huang,Yi Wang,Zhen-Hua Ling,Limin Wang,Yali Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoTG-R1 is a curriculum RL framework that addresses two key challenges in video temporal grounding: partially annotated samples and hard-to-ground samples, achieving superior performance with significantly reduced training data and computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs for video temporal grounding overlook challenges from training sample quality and difficulty, specifically partially annotated samples that introduce ambiguous supervision and hard-to-ground samples that produce indistinguishable rewards during RL training.

Method: Proposes VideoTG-R1 with two agents: (1) Boundary Reflection Agent that identifies and filters partially annotated samples using MLLMs to predict query-relevant timestamps, and (2) Difficulty Estimation Agent that assesses sample difficulty and implements curriculum RL by dynamically masking hard-to-ground videos based on training steps.

Result: VideoTG-R1 outperforms full-data counterparts with only 10% of training samples and 21% of computational budget on VTG and grounded VideoQA tasks, working effectively under both GRPO and supervised fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The proposed curriculum RL framework with reflected boundary annotations enables data-efficient training by addressing sample quality and difficulty issues, demonstrating significant improvements in video temporal grounding performance with reduced computational requirements.

Abstract: Video temporal grounding (VTG) aims to locate precise segments in videos
based on language queries, which is a fundamental challenge in video
understanding. While recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown
promise in tackling VTG through reinforcement learning (RL), they overlook the
challenges arising from both the quality and difficulty of training samples.
(1) Partially annotated samples. Many samples contain relevant segments beyond
the annotated interval, introducing ambiguous supervision. (2) Hard-to-ground
samples. Samples with poor zero-shot performance produce consistently low and
indistinguishable rewards during RL training, exhibiting no clear preference
among multiple outputs and thus hindering learning efficiency. To address these
challenges, we propose VideoTG-R1, a novel curriculum RL framework with
reflected boundary annotations, enabling data-efficient training. Specifically,
we propose a Boundary Reflection Agent that utilizes MLLMs to predict
query-relevant timestamps outside the annotated intervals, allowing us to
identify and filter out partially annotated samples, thereby reducing
ambiguity. Furthermore, we introduce a Difficulty Estimation Agent to assess
the training difficulty of each sample and design a curriculum RL strategy that
dynamically masks the videos of hard-to-ground samples according to the
training steps, easing the training difficulty and providing clearer
preference. Experiments on the VTG and grounded VideoQA tasks demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method. Remarkably, with only 10% of the training samples
and 21% of the computational budget, VideoTG-R1 outperforms full-data
counterparts under both group relative policy optimization (GRPO) and
supervised fine-tuning (SFT). The code is available at

Abstract: The project has carried out the re-optimization of image coloring in
accordance with the existing Autocolorization direction model DDColor. For the
experiments on the existing weights of DDColor, we found that it has
limitations in some frequency bands and the color cast problem caused by
insufficient input dimension. We construct two optimization schemes and combine
them, which achieves the performance improvement of indicators such as PSNR and
SSIM of the images after DDColor.

Conclusion: Symmetria provides a scalable, publicly available dataset with code that promotes further research and innovation in point cloud learning, along with introducing a challenging symmetry detection benchmark.

Abstract: Unlike image or text domains that benefit from an abundance of large-scale
datasets, point cloud learning techniques frequently encounter limitations due
to the scarcity of extensive datasets. To overcome this limitation, we present
Symmetria, a formula-driven dataset that can be generated at any arbitrary
scale. By construction, it ensures the absolute availability of precise ground
truth, promotes data-efficient experimentation by requiring fewer samples,
enables broad generalization across diverse geometric settings, and offers easy
extensibility to new tasks and modalities. Using the concept of symmetry, we
create shapes with known structure and high variability, enabling neural

that this dataset is highly effective for point cloud self-supervised
pre-training, yielding models with strong performance in downstream tasks such

capabilities. Additionally, our dataset can support fine-tuning models to
classify real-world objects, highlighting our approach's practical utility and
application. We also introduce a challenging task for symmetry detection and
provide a benchmark for baseline comparisons. A significant advantage of our
approach is the public availability of the dataset, the accompanying code, and
the ability to generate very large collections, promoting further research and
innovation in point cloud learning.

TL;DR: A novel workflow for efficient and accurate registration of mobile laser scanning point clouds to target models in urban environments, featuring SSC preprocessing and PV-GICP fine registration methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of registering point clouds with varying density, noise, and occlusion in complex urban street scenarios, particularly dealing with MLS drift and computational efficiency.

Method: Two main innovations: 1) Semi-sphere Check (SSC) preprocessing that fragments MLS trajectory data using mutually orthogonal planar surfaces to reduce drift impact, and 2) Planar Voxel-based Generalized Iterative Closest Point (PV-GICP) for fine registration that selectively uses planar surfaces within voxel partitions.

Result: Achieved sub-0.01 m average registration accuracy on real-world datasets from Munich's inner city, with computation time reduced by more than 50% compared to conventional point-to-plane ICP methods.

Conclusion: The proposed workflow demonstrates significant potential for advancing automated 3D urban modeling and updating, with direct applications in urban planning, infrastructure management, and dynamic city monitoring.

Abstract: This study presents a novel workflow designed to efficiently and accurately
register large-scale mobile laser scanning (MLS) point clouds to a target model
point cloud in urban street scenarios. This workflow specifically targets the
complexities inherent in urban environments and adeptly addresses the
challenges of integrating point clouds that vary in density, noise
characteristics, and occlusion scenarios, which are common in bustling city
centers. Two methodological advancements are introduced. First, the proposed
Semi-sphere Check (SSC) preprocessing technique optimally fragments MLS
trajectory data by identifying mutually orthogonal planar surfaces. This step
reduces the impact of MLS drift on the accuracy of the entire point cloud
registration, while ensuring sufficient geometric features within each fragment
to avoid local minima. Second, we propose Planar Voxel-based Generalized
Iterative Closest Point (PV-GICP), a fine registration method that selectively
utilizes planar surfaces within voxel partitions. This pre-process strategy not
only improves registration accuracy but also reduces computation time by more
than 50% compared to conventional point-to-plane ICP methods. Experiments on
real-world datasets from Munich's inner city demonstrate that our workflow
achieves sub-0.01 m average registration accuracy while significantly
shortening processing times. The results underscore the potential of the
proposed methods to advance automated 3D urban modeling and updating, with
direct applications in urban planning, infrastructure management, and dynamic

TL;DR: A novel CAD reverse engineering method using multi-plane cross-sections to extract 2D patterns and capture parametric details, enabling reconstruction of editable CAD models with sketch constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning approaches for CAD reverse engineering either fail to produce fully parametric outputs (bottom-up methods) or overlook fine geometric details (top-down methods), and none incorporate sketch-level constraints which are essential for CAD modeling.

Method: Leverages multi-plane cross-sections to extract 2D patterns and capture fine parametric details, inspired by how human designers manually perform CAD reverse engineering tasks.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods and enables reconstruction of detailed and editable CAD models with sketch constraints incorporated directly into the reconstruction process.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses limitations of existing methods by capturing both parametric details and fine geometric features while incorporating essential sketch constraints, representing a significant advancement in CAD reverse engineering.

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a foundational role in modern manufacturing
and product development, often requiring designers to modify or build upon
existing models. Converting 3D scans into parametric CAD representations--a
process known as CAD reverse engineering--remains a significant challenge due
to the high precision and structural complexity of CAD models. Existing deep
learning-based approaches typically fall into two categories: bottom-up,
geometry-driven methods, which often fail to produce fully parametric outputs,
and top-down strategies, which tend to overlook fine-grained geometric details.
Moreover, current methods neglect an essential aspect of CAD modeling:
sketch-level constraints. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to CAD
reverse engineering inspired by how human designers manually perform the task.
Our method leverages multi-plane cross-sections to extract 2D patterns and
capture fine parametric details more effectively. It enables the reconstruction
of detailed and editable CAD models, outperforming state-of-the-art methods
and, for the first time, incorporating sketch constraints directly into the

TL;DR: CURVETE is a novel deep CNN that uses curriculum learning and progressive self-supervised training to address limited samples and irregular class distribution in medical image analysis, achieving superior classification performance on three medical datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of limited annotated samples and irregular class distribution in medical image analysis, which reduces the effectiveness of transfer learning and fine-tuning.

Method: Uses curriculum learning based on sample decomposition granularity for pre-training on unlabeled samples, and incorporates class decomposition approach in downstream tasks to handle irregular class distribution.

Result: Achieved 96.60% accuracy on brain tumour dataset, 75.60% on digital knee x-ray dataset, and 93.35% on Mini-DDSM dataset with ResNet-50; and 95.77%, 80.36%, and 93.22% respectively with DenseNet-121, outperforming other training strategies.

Conclusion: CURVETE effectively addresses challenges of limited samples and irregular class distribution in medical image analysis, demonstrating superior performance across multiple medical datasets and outperforming existing training approaches.

Abstract: Identifying high-quality and easily accessible annotated samples poses a
notable challenge in medical image analysis. Transfer learning techniques,
leveraging pre-training data, offer a flexible solution to this issue. However,
the impact of fine-tuning diminishes when the dataset exhibits an irregular
distribution between classes. This paper introduces a novel deep convolutional
neural network, named Curriculum Learning and Progressive Self-supervised
Training (CURVETE). CURVETE addresses challenges related to limited samples,
enhances model generalisability, and improves overall classification
performance. It achieves this by employing a curriculum learning strategy based
on the granularity of sample decomposition during the training of generic
unlabelled samples. Moreover, CURVETE address the challenge of irregular class
distribution by incorporating a class decomposition approach in the downstream
task. The proposed method undergoes evaluation on three distinct medical image
datasets: brain tumour, digital knee x-ray, and Mini-DDSM datasets. We
investigate the classification performance using a generic self-supervised
sample decomposition approach with and without the curriculum learning
component in training the pretext task. Experimental results demonstrate that
the CURVETE model achieves superior performance on test sets with an accuracy
of 96.60% on the brain tumour dataset, 75.60% on the digital knee x-ray
dataset, and 93.35% on the Mini-DDSM dataset using the baseline ResNet-50.
Furthermore, with the baseline DenseNet-121, it achieved accuracies of 95.77%,
80.36%, and 93.22% on the brain tumour, digital knee x-ray, and Mini-DDSM
datasets, respectively, outperforming other training strategies.

Motivation: Current methods for low-light vision struggle with incomplete modeling of illumination degradation, which affects downstream tasks like detection and segmentation. The paper aims to better characterize low-light conditions by extending the Lambertian model.

Method: The authors propose FRBNet, an end-to-end trainable module that uses frequency-domain channel ratios and learnable filters to extract illumination-invariant features. It can be integrated as a plug-and-play module into existing networks.

Result: FRBNet achieves significant improvements: +2.2 mAP for dark object detection and +2.9 mIoU for nighttime segmentation across various downstream tasks.

Conclusion: The frequency-domain approach with FRBNet provides superior illumination-invariant feature enhancement for low-light vision tasks and can be easily integrated into existing architectures without modifying loss functions.

Abstract: Low-light vision remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision due to
severe illumination degradation, which significantly affects the performance of
downstream tasks such as detection and segmentation. While recent
state-of-the-art methods have improved performance through invariant feature
learning modules, they still fall short due to incomplete modeling of low-light
conditions. Therefore, we revisit low-light image formation and extend the
classical Lambertian model to better characterize low-light conditions. By
shifting our analysis to the frequency domain, we theoretically prove that the
frequency-domain channel ratio can be leveraged to extract
illumination-invariant features via a structured filtering process. We then
propose a novel and end-to-end trainable module named \textbf{F}requency-domain
\textbf{R}adial \textbf{B}asis \textbf{Net}work (\textbf{FRBNet}), which
integrates the frequency-domain channel ratio operation with a learnable
frequency domain filter for the overall illumination-invariant feature
enhancement. As a plug-and-play module, FRBNet can be integrated into existing
networks for low-light downstream tasks without modifying loss functions.
Extensive experiments across various downstream tasks demonstrate that FRBNet
achieves superior performance, including +2.2 mAP for dark object detection and
+2.9 mIoU for nighttime segmentation. Code is available at:

TL;DR: Video-Thinker extends 'Thinking with Images' to video reasoning, enabling MLLMs to autonomously use grounding and captioning capabilities for video analysis without external tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 'Thinking with Images' methods work well for images but haven't been extended to video reasoning tasks, creating a gap in dynamic reasoning for videos.

Method: Constructed Video-Thinker-10K dataset with autonomous tool usage in chain-of-thought reasoning, using SFT for format learning and GRPO for capability strengthening.

Result: Video-Thinker-7B achieves significant performance gains on in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks (Video-Holmes, CG-Bench-Reasoning, VRBench), outperforming Video-R1 and setting SOTA among 7B MLLMs.

Conclusion: Video-Thinker successfully extends dynamic reasoning to videos, enabling autonomous grounding and captioning without external tools, establishing new state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in image reasoning methods, particularly "Thinking with
Images", have demonstrated remarkable success in Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs); however, this dynamic reasoning paradigm has not yet been
extended to video reasoning tasks. In this paper, we propose Video-Thinker,
which empowers MLLMs to think with videos by autonomously leveraging their
intrinsic "grounding" and "captioning" capabilities to generate reasoning clues
throughout the inference process. To spark this capability, we construct
Video-Thinker-10K, a curated dataset featuring autonomous tool usage within
chain-of-thought reasoning sequences. Our training strategy begins with
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to learn the reasoning format, followed by Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to strengthen this reasoning capability.
Through this approach, Video-Thinker enables MLLMs to autonomously navigate
grounding and captioning tasks for video reasoning, eliminating the need for
constructing and calling external tools. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
Video-Thinker achieves significant performance gains on both in-domain tasks
and challenging out-of-domain video reasoning benchmarks, including
Video-Holmes, CG-Bench-Reasoning, and VRBench. Our Video-Thinker-7B
substantially outperforms existing baselines such as Video-R1 and establishes
state-of-the-art performance among 7B-sized MLLMs.

*Karthikeyan Chandra Sekaran,Markus Geisler,Dominik R√∂√üle,Adithya Mohan,Daniel Cremers,Wolfgang Utschick,Michael Botsch,Werner Huber,Torsten Sch√∂n*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UrbanIng-V2X is the first large-scale multi-modal dataset for cooperative perception with vehicles and infrastructure sensors across three urban intersections, addressing limitations of existing datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cooperative perception datasets are limited to single intersections or single vehicles, causing overfitting and misleading performance due to similar environments. A comprehensive dataset with multiple vehicles and infrastructure across diverse intersections is needed.

Method: Created UrbanIng-V2X dataset with 34 temporally aligned sensor sequences from three intersections in Ingolstadt, Germany, featuring 2 vehicles and up to 3 infrastructure sensor poles per sequence with RGB cameras, LiDARs, and thermal cameras.

Result: The dataset contains approximately 712k annotated 3D bounding boxes across 13 object classes at 10 Hz frequency, with comprehensive evaluations using state-of-the-art cooperative perception methods.

Conclusion: UrbanIng-V2X enables better benchmarking of cooperative perception algorithms in diverse traffic environments and helps prevent overfitting by providing data from multiple urban intersections.

Abstract: Recent cooperative perception datasets have played a crucial role in
advancing smart mobility applications by enabling information exchange between
intelligent agents, helping to overcome challenges such as occlusions and
improving overall scene understanding. While some existing real-world datasets
incorporate both vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure interactions,
they are typically limited to a single intersection or a single vehicle. A
comprehensive perception dataset featuring multiple connected vehicles and
infrastructure sensors across several intersections remains unavailable,
limiting the benchmarking of algorithms in diverse traffic environments.
Consequently, overfitting can occur, and models may demonstrate misleadingly
high performance due to similar intersection layouts and traffic participant
behavior. To address this gap, we introduce UrbanIng-V2X, the first
large-scale, multi-modal dataset supporting cooperative perception involving
vehicles and infrastructure sensors deployed across three urban intersections
in Ingolstadt, Germany. UrbanIng-V2X consists of 34 temporally aligned and
spatially calibrated sensor sequences, each lasting 20 seconds. All sequences
contain recordings from one of three intersections, involving two vehicles and
up to three infrastructure-mounted sensor poles operating in coordinated
scenarios. In total, UrbanIng-V2X provides data from 12 vehicle-mounted RGB
cameras, 2 vehicle LiDARs, 17 infrastructure thermal cameras, and 12
infrastructure LiDARs. All sequences are annotated at a frequency of 10 Hz with
3D bounding boxes spanning 13 object classes, resulting in approximately 712k
annotated instances across the dataset. We provide comprehensive evaluations
using state-of-the-art cooperative perception methods and publicly release the
codebase, dataset, HD map, and a digital twin of the complete data collection
environment.

*Xin Jin,Siyuan Li,Siyong Jian,Kai Yu,Huan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MergeMix is a training-time augmentation paradigm that bridges supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning for vision-language alignment in MLLMs, using attention-aware image mixing and preference-driven training to achieve competitive accuracy with improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of SFT (requires large-scale human annotations, cannot capture subtle preferences) and RL (suffers from overhead and instability) in vision-language alignment for MLLMs, aiming to overcome the trade-off between scalability, robustness, and alignment quality.

Method: Proposes MergeMix with two key components: 1) attention-aware image mixing via token merge with cluster representation and spatial context, and 2) preference-driven training paradigm building preference pairs with mixed and raw images, optimized via SimPO loss.

Result: Extensive experiments show MergeMix achieves competitive accuracy with improved efficiency, surpassing other heuristic-based methods in classification and providing a scalable approach to preference alignment in MLLMs.

Conclusion: MergeMix effectively bridges SFT and RL approaches, enhancing attention consistency and efficiency while providing a scalable solution for preference alignment in multi-modal large language models.

Abstract: Vision-language alignment in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs)
typically relies on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning
(RL). SFT is stable and efficient but requires large-scale human annotations
and cannot capture subtle preferences, while RL brings in a reward signal for
training, but suffers from overhead and instability. These limitations
highlight a trade-off between scalability, robustness, and alignment quality.
To address this, we propose MergeMix, a training-time augmentation paradigm
that bridges SFT and RL. It first applies an attention-aware image mixing via
token merge with more cluster representation and spatial context, and then
presents a preference-driven training paradigm for MLLMs by building preference
pairs with mixed images and raw images, and optimizing via SimPO loss. As a
mixup augmentation, MergeMix enhances attention consistency and efficiency,
surpassing other heuristic-based methods in classification. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MergeMix achieves competitive accuracy with
improved efficiency, providing a scalable approach to preference alignment in
classification and MLLMs.

### [196] [On the Faithfulness of Visual Thinking: Measurement and Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23482)
*Zujing Liu,Junwen Pan,Qi She,Yuan Gao,Guisong Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies unfaithfulness in vision-language models' multimodal chain-of-thought (MCoT) reasoning, where visual information is often inaccurate but still leads to correct answers. It proposes an automated evaluation metric and a novel learning strategy (SCCM) to improve visual faithfulness in MCoT reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLMs generate MCoT traces with inaccurate visual information that still yield correct answers, indicating unfaithfulness in reasoning. This is attributed to RL rewards in reinforcement fine-tuning that only incentivize the format of interleaved vision-text cues without ensuring visual correctness.

Method: The paper introduces an automated LVLM-based evaluation metric to quantify visual faithfulness from reliability and sufficiency perspectives. It proposes Sufficient-Component Cause Model (SCCM) learning, which encourages generating sufficient yet minimal visual components that independently lead to correct answers. SCCM is annotation-free and plug-and-play compatible with various RFT methods.

Result: Empirical results show that SCCM consistently improves visual faithfulness across fine-grained perception and reasoning benchmarks. The evaluation reveals that current MCoT traces have visual information that is both unreliable and insufficient.

Conclusion: The proposed SCCM learning strategy effectively addresses the unfaithfulness issue in MCoT reasoning by ensuring visual components are both sufficient and minimal, leading to improved visual faithfulness without requiring additional annotations.

Abstract: Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) can generate vision-text
multimodal chain-of-thought (MCoT) traces after reinforcement fine-tuning
(RFT). However, we observe that the visual information incorporated in MCoT is
often inaccurate, though still yield correct answers, indicating a lack of
faithfulness in the MCoT reasoning process. We attribute this unfaithfulness to
the RL reward in RFT, which solely incentivizes the format of interleaved
vision-text cues, ie, it encourages the model to incorporate visual information
into its text reasoning steps without considering the correctness of the visual
information. In this paper, we first probe the faithfulness of MCoT by
measuring how much the prediction changes when its visual and textual thoughts
are intervened. Surprisingly, the model's predictions remain nearly unchanged
under visual intervention but change significantly under textual intervention,
indicating that the visual evidence is largely ignored. To further analyze
visual information, we introduce an automated LVLM-based evaluation metric that
quantifies the faithfulness of visual cues from two perspectives: reliability
and sufficiency. Our evaluation reveals that the visual information in current
MCoT traces is simultaneously unreliable and insufficient. To address this
issue, we propose a novel MCoT learning strategy termed Sufficient-Component
Cause Model (SCCM) learning. This approach encourages the MCoT to generate
sufficient yet minimal visual components that are independently capable of
leading to correct answers. We note that the proposed SCCM is annotation-free
and compatible with various RFT for MCoT in a plug-and-play manner. Empirical
results demonstrate that SCCM consistently improves the visual faithfulness
across a suite of fine-grained perception and reasoning benchmarks. Code is

*Elisabeth J√ºttner,Leona Krath,Stefan Korfhage,Hannah Dr√∂ge,Matthias B. Hullin,Markus Plack*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid relighting framework combining diffusion-derived material priors with temporal regularization and physical rendering for stable volumetric video relighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches struggle with temporal stability in volumetric video relighting. Diffusion methods work for single frames but suffer from noise and instability in sequences, while video diffusion models face memory and scale limitations.

Method: Combines diffusion-based material priors with temporal regularization using optical flow guidance. Aggregates multiple stochastic estimates into consistent shading components. Uses mesh proxy from Gaussian Opacity Fields for indirect effects like shadows and reflections in standard graphics pipeline.

Result: Achieves substantially more stable relighting across sequences than diffusion-only baselines, while scaling beyond feasible clip lengths for video diffusion models.

Conclusion: Hybrid approaches that balance learned priors with physically grounded constraints are a practical step toward production-ready volumetric video relighting.

Abstract: Volumetric video relighting is essential for bringing captured performances
into virtual worlds, but current approaches struggle to deliver temporally
stable, production-ready results. Diffusion-based intrinsic decomposition
methods show promise for single frames, yet suffer from stochastic noise and
instability when extended to sequences, while video diffusion models remain
constrained by memory and scale. We propose a hybrid relighting framework that
combines diffusion-derived material priors with temporal regularization and
physically motivated rendering. Our method aggregates multiple stochastic
estimates of per-frame material properties into temporally consistent shading
components, using optical-flow-guided regularization. For indirect effects such
as shadows and reflections, we extract a mesh proxy from Gaussian Opacity
Fields and render it within a standard graphics pipeline. Experiments on real
and synthetic captures show that this hybrid strategy achieves substantially
more stable relighting across sequences than diffusion-only baselines, while
scaling beyond the clip lengths feasible for video diffusion. These results
indicate that hybrid approaches, which balance learned priors with physically
grounded constraints, are a practical step toward production-ready volumetric
video relighting.

*Walid Bousselham,Hilde Kuehne,Cordelia Schmid*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VOLD is a framework that transfers reasoning capabilities from text-only teacher models to vision-language student models using reinforcement learning with on-policy distillation, requiring cold-start alignment for effective transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training vision-language models for complex reasoning is challenging due to scarce high-quality image-text reasoning data, while text-based reasoning resources are abundant but underutilized for VLM reasoning.

Method: Combines reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with on-policy distillation, guided by text-only teacher models, and emphasizes cold-start alignment through supervised fine-tuning.

Result: VOLD significantly outperforms baseline models and improves state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks including MMMU-Pro, MathVision, MathVista, and LogicVista.

Conclusion: Cold-start alignment is essential for effective knowledge transfer from text-only teachers to vision-language students, and without sufficient distributional alignment, on-policy distillation fails to provide meaningful guidance.

Abstract: Training vision-language models (VLMs) for complex reasoning remains a
challenging task, i.a. due to the scarcity of high-quality image-text reasoning
data. Conversely, text-based reasoning resources are abundant and scalable, but
it is still an open question how to leveraging them for VLM reasoning. To
address this problem, we propose VOLD, a framework to transfer reasoning
capabilities from text-only teacher models to VLM student models. To this end,
VOLD combines reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) with on-policy distillation, which allows the student reasoning traces
to be guided by the teacher model, resulting in a significant gain over using
GRPO alone. We further show that a cold-start alignment is essential for an
effective transfer during the online training phase in this scenario and that
without sufficient distributional alignment between teacher and student,
on-policy distillation fails to provide meaningful guidance. We evaluate VOLD
across diverse benchmarks including MMMU-Pro, MathVision, MathVista, and
LogicVista, showing that VOLD outperforms the baseline model significantly and
improves over the state of the art by a margin. Our ablation shows the
importance of a cold-start alignment via SFT for on-policy distillation with a
text-only teacher.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreeFuse is a training-free method for multi-subject text-to-image generation that automatically fuses multiple subject LoRAs using dynamic masks derived from cross-attention weights, requiring no additional training or modifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multi-subject generation either use pre-inference LoRA weight merging or rely on complex techniques like segmentation models and noise blending, which are inefficient and require additional resources.

Method: Uses context-aware dynamic subject masks automatically derived from cross-attention layer weights, applied to LoRA outputs during inference to approximate individual subject LoRA usage for masked regions.

Result: Extensive experiments show FreeFuse outperforms existing approaches in both generation quality and usability for multi-subject generation tasks.

Conclusion: FreeFuse provides a superior practical and efficient solution for multi-subject text-to-image generation without requiring training, LoRA modifications, auxiliary models, or user-defined specifications.

Abstract: This paper proposes FreeFuse, a novel training-free approach for
multi-subject text-to-image generation through automatic fusion of multiple
subject LoRAs. In contrast to existing methods that either focus on
pre-inference LoRA weight merging or rely on segmentation models and complex
techniques like noise blending to isolate LoRA outputs, our key insight is that
context-aware dynamic subject masks can be automatically derived from
cross-attention layer weights. Mathematical analysis shows that directly
applying these masks to LoRA outputs during inference well approximates the
case where the subject LoRA is integrated into the diffusion model and used
individually for the masked region. FreeFuse demonstrates superior practicality
and efficiency as it requires no additional training, no modification to LoRAs,
no auxiliary models, and no user-defined prompt templates or region
specifications. Alternatively, it only requires users to provide the LoRA
activation words for seamless integration into standard workflows. Extensive
experiments validate that FreeFuse outperforms existing approaches in both
generation quality and usability under the multi-subject generation tasks. The

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Dynamic Pseudo-Label Filtering (DPLF) and Prior-Guided Data Augmentation Pipeline (PG-DAP) to improve point cloud semantic segmentation in unsupervised domain adaptation from synthetic to real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world LiDAR point cloud annotation is costly, and existing self-training UDA methods don't effectively utilize unlabeled data due to fixed confidence thresholds.

Method: DPLF for dynamic pseudo-label filtering, PG-DAP for domain shift mitigation, and data mixing consistency loss for context-free representations.

Result: Achieves superior performance on synthetic-to-real point cloud semantic segmentation tasks compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed DPLF and PG-DAP modules are effective for improving real data utilization in point cloud UDA semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Annotating real-world LiDAR point clouds for use in intelligent autonomous
systems is costly. To overcome this limitation, self-training-based
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) has been widely used to improve point
cloud semantic segmentation by leveraging synthetic point cloud data. However,
we argue that existing methods do not effectively utilize unlabeled data, as
they either rely on predefined or fixed confidence thresholds, resulting in
suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Pseudo-Label
Filtering (DPLF) scheme to enhance real data utilization in point cloud UDA
semantic segmentation. Additionally, we design a simple and efficient
Prior-Guided Data Augmentation Pipeline (PG-DAP) to mitigate domain shift
between synthetic and real-world point clouds. Finally, we utilize data mixing
consistency loss to push the model to learn context-free representations. We
implement and thoroughly evaluate our approach through extensive comparisons
with state-of-the-art methods. Experiments on two challenging synthetic-to-real
point cloud semantic segmentation tasks demonstrate that our approach achieves
superior performance. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the DPLF
and PG-DAP modules. We release the code of our method in this paper.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs excel at visible event reasoning but lack embodied, first-person understanding needed for egocentric video reasoning, which requires inferring hidden intentions and recognizing fine-grained interactions from the agent's perspective.

Method: Introduces EgoRe-5M dataset from 13M egocentric video clips with detailed CoT rationales and hand-object grounding, then uses supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) to enhance spatio-temporal localization.

Result: EgoThinker outperforms existing methods across multiple egocentric benchmarks and achieves substantial improvements in fine-grained spatio-temporal localization tasks.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges the gap in egocentric reasoning capabilities for MLLMs through structured supervision and curriculum learning, with code and data publicly released.

Abstract: Egocentric video reasoning centers on an unobservable agent behind the camera
who dynamically shapes the environment, requiring inference of hidden
intentions and recognition of fine-grained interactions. This core challenge
limits current multimodal large language models MLLMs, which excel at visible
event reasoning but lack embodied, first-person understanding. To bridge this
gap, we introduce EgoThinker, a novel framework that endows MLLMs with robust
egocentric reasoning capabilities through spatio-temporal chain-of-thought
supervision and a two-stage learning curriculum. First, we introduce EgoRe-5M,
a large-scale egocentric QA dataset constructed from 13M diverse egocentric
video clips. This dataset features multi-minute segments annotated with
detailed CoT rationales and dense hand-object grounding. Second, we employ SFT
on EgoRe-5M to instill reasoning skills, followed by reinforcement fine-tuning
RFT to further enhance spatio-temporal localization. Experimental results show
that EgoThinker outperforms existing methods across multiple egocentric
benchmarks, while achieving substantial improvements in fine-grained

TL;DR: MERGE is a unified model that enables both image generation and depth estimation using pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models without degrading image generation capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage pre-trained text-to-image models for depth estimation while preserving their original image generation capabilities, avoiding catastrophic degradation during training.

Method: Introduces a play-and-plug framework with pluggable converters for switching between modes, and a Group Reuse Mechanism to improve parameter utilization and encourage reuse.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple depth estimation benchmarks while maintaining original image generation ability.

Conclusion: MERGE demonstrates that pre-trained text-to-image models can be expanded to depth estimation without compromising their core generation capabilities, offering a unified solution for both tasks.

Abstract: Generative depth estimation methods leverage the rich visual priors stored in
pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating astonishing zero-shot
capability. However, parameter updates during training lead to catastrophic
degradation in the image generation capability of the pre-trained model. We
introduce MERGE, a unified model for image generation and depth estimation,
starting from a fixed pre-trained text-to-image model. MERGE demonstrates that
the pre-trained text-to-image model can do more than image generation, but also
expand to depth estimation effortlessly. Specifically, MERGE introduces a
play-and-plug framework that enables seamless switching between image
generation and depth estimation modes through simple and pluggable converters.
Meanwhile, we propose a Group Reuse Mechanism to encourage parameter reuse and
improve the utilization of the additional learnable parameters. MERGE unleashes
the powerful depth estimation capability of the pre-trained text-to-image model
while preserving its original image generation ability. Compared to other
unified models for image generation and depth estimation, MERGE achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple depth estimation benchmarks. The

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Lookahead Anchoring prevents identity drift in audio-driven human animation by using future keyframes as directional beacons, eliminating the need for separate keyframe generation while maintaining identity consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Audio-driven human animation models suffer from identity drift during temporal autoregressive generation, where characters gradually lose their identity over time. Existing keyframe solutions require additional generation stages and restrict natural motion dynamics.

Method: Proposes Lookahead Anchoring which leverages keyframes from future timesteps ahead of the current generation window. This transforms keyframes from fixed boundaries into directional beacons that guide generation while responding to immediate audio cues. Also enables self-keyframing using the reference image as lookahead target.

Result: Applied to three recent human animation models, Lookahead Anchoring achieves superior lip synchronization, identity preservation, and visual quality. The temporal lookahead distance naturally controls balance between expressivity and consistency.

Conclusion: Lookahead Anchoring demonstrates improved temporal conditioning across different architectures, providing persistent guidance that maintains identity consistency while allowing natural motion dynamics.

Abstract: Audio-driven human animation models often suffer from identity drift during
temporal autoregressive generation, where characters gradually lose their
identity over time. One solution is to generate keyframes as intermediate
temporal anchors that prevent degradation, but this requires an additional
keyframe generation stage and can restrict natural motion dynamics. To address
this, we propose Lookahead Anchoring, which leverages keyframes from future
timesteps ahead of the current generation window, rather than within it. This
transforms keyframes from fixed boundaries into directional beacons: the model
continuously pursues these future anchors while responding to immediate audio
cues, maintaining consistent identity through persistent guidance. This also
enables self-keyframing, where the reference image serves as the lookahead
target, eliminating the need for keyframe generation entirely. We find that the
temporal lookahead distance naturally controls the balance between expressivity
and consistency: larger distances allow for greater motion freedom, while
smaller ones strengthen identity adherence. When applied to three recent human
animation models, Lookahead Anchoring achieves superior lip synchronization,
identity preservation, and visual quality, demonstrating improved temporal
conditioning across several different architectures. Video results are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Directly modeling explicit likelihood of raw data distribution is key in machine learning, but continuous AR modeling over visual pixel data suffers from extremely long sequences and high-dimensional spaces.

Method: Uses invertible autoregressive flow to transform images into latent sequences, employs self-supervised dimension reduction to partition latent channels, and introduces one-step distillation and resampling-based classifier-free guidance.

Result: Achieves competitive performance compared to existing pixel-based generative models while providing exact likelihoods and scalable training.

Conclusion: FARMER successfully unifies NF and AR models for efficient and effective image generation with tractable likelihood estimation.

Abstract: Directly modeling the explicit likelihood of the raw data distribution is key
topic in the machine learning area, which achieves the scaling successes in
Large Language Models by autoregressive modeling. However, continuous AR
modeling over visual pixel data suffer from extremely long sequences and
high-dimensional spaces. In this paper, we present FARMER, a novel end-to-end
generative framework that unifies Normalizing Flows (NF) and Autoregressive
(AR) models for tractable likelihood estimation and high-quality image
synthesis directly from raw pixels. FARMER employs an invertible autoregressive
flow to transform images into latent sequences, whose distribution is modeled
implicitly by an autoregressive model. To address the redundancy and complexity
in pixel-level modeling, we propose a self-supervised dimension reduction
scheme that partitions NF latent channels into informative and redundant
groups, enabling more effective and efficient AR modeling. Furthermore, we
design a one-step distillation scheme to significantly accelerate inference
speed and introduce a resampling-based classifier-free guidance algorithm to
boost image generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FARMER
achieves competitive performance compared to existing pixel-based generative
models while providing exact likelihoods and scalable training.

### [206] [InFlux: A Benchmark for Self-Calibration of Dynamic Intrinsics of Video Cameras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23589)
*Erich Liang,Roma Bhattacharjee,Sreemanti Dey,Rafael Moschopoulos,Caitlin Wang,Michel Liao,Grace Tan,Andrew Wang,Karhan Kayan,Stamatis Alexandropoulos,Jia Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InFlux is a real-world benchmark providing per-frame ground truth camera intrinsics for videos with dynamic intrinsics, featuring 143K+ annotated frames from 386 videos with diverse scenes and intrinsic variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most 3D algorithms assume constant camera intrinsics, but real-world videos often have dynamic intrinsics. Existing benchmarks lack diversity in scene content and intrinsics variation, and none provide per-frame intrinsic changes for consecutive video frames.

Method: Built a comprehensive lookup table of calibration experiments and extended the Kalibr toolbox to improve accuracy and robustness for per-frame intrinsics annotation. Collected 386 high-resolution indoor and outdoor videos with dynamic camera intrinsics.

Result: Created InFlux benchmark with 143K+ annotated frames showing diverse intrinsic variations. Evaluation of existing baseline methods revealed most struggle to achieve accurate predictions on videos with dynamic intrinsics.

Conclusion: InFlux addresses the gap in dynamic camera intrinsics benchmarks and demonstrates that current methods are inadequate for handling dynamic intrinsics in real-world videos.

Abstract: Accurately tracking camera intrinsics is crucial for achieving 3D
understanding from 2D video. However, most 3D algorithms assume that camera
intrinsics stay constant throughout a video, which is often not true for many
real-world in-the-wild videos. A major obstacle in this field is a lack of
dynamic camera intrinsics benchmarks--existing benchmarks typically offer
limited diversity in scene content and intrinsics variation, and none provide
per-frame intrinsic changes for consecutive video frames. In this paper, we
present Intrinsics in Flux (InFlux), a real-world benchmark that provides
per-frame ground truth intrinsics annotations for videos with dynamic
intrinsics. Compared to prior benchmarks, InFlux captures a wider range of
intrinsic variations and scene diversity, featuring 143K+ annotated frames from
386 high-resolution indoor and outdoor videos with dynamic camera intrinsics.
To ensure accurate per-frame intrinsics, we build a comprehensive lookup table
of calibration experiments and extend the Kalibr toolbox to improve its
accuracy and robustness. Using our benchmark, we evaluate existing baseline
methods for predicting camera intrinsics and find that most struggle to achieve
accurate predictions on videos with dynamic intrinsics. For the dataset, code,

### [207] [PRISM-Bench: A Benchmark of Puzzle-Based Visual Tasks with CoT Error Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23594)
*Yusu Qian,Cheng Wan,Chao Jia,Yinfei Yang,Qingyu Zhao,Zhe Gan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRISM-Bench is a benchmark for evaluating multimodal reasoning in AI models through puzzle-based visual challenges that require identifying the first incorrect step in flawed chain-of-thought reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations only measure final-answer accuracy, lacking insight into how models reason. There's a need to assess logical consistency and error detection capabilities in multimodal reasoning.

Method: Creates visual puzzles requiring multi-step symbolic, geometric, and analogical reasoning. Models must identify the first incorrect step in chain-of-thought reasoning that contains exactly one error.

Result: Evaluation reveals a gap between fluent generation and faithful reasoning - models that produce plausible reasoning often fail to locate simple logical errors.

Conclusion: PRISM-Bench provides diagnostic evaluation for multimodal reasoning competence and highlights the need for reasoning verification protocols in developing trustworthy multimodal language models.

Abstract: We introduce \textbf{PRISM-Bench}, a benchmark of puzzle-based visual
challenges designed to evaluate not only whether models can solve problems, but
how their reasoning unfolds. Unlike prior evaluations that measure only
final-answer accuracy, PRISM-Bench introduces a diagnostic task: given a visual
puzzle and a step-by-step chain-of-thought (CoT) containing exactly one error,
models must identify the first incorrect step. This setting enables
fine-grained assessment of logical consistency, error detection, and visual
reasoning. The puzzles in PRISM-Bench require multi-step symbolic, geometric,
and analogical reasoning, resisting shortcuts based on superficial pattern
matching. Evaluations across state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal a persistent gap
between fluent generation and faithful reasoning: models that produce plausible
CoTs often fail to locate simple logical faults. By disentangling answer
generation from reasoning verification, PRISM-Bench offers a sharper lens on
multimodal reasoning competence and underscores the need for diagnostic
evaluation protocols in the development of trustworthy MLLMs.

TL;DR: PixelRefer is a unified region-level MLLM framework that enables fine-grained object-centric understanding across images and videos, with an efficient variant PixelRefer-Lite that reduces computational costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs focus on holistic scene-level understanding but lack fine-grained object-centric reasoning capabilities needed for detailed visual comprehension.

Method: Proposes Scale-Adaptive Object Tokenizer (SAOT) for compact object representations, Object-Centric Infusion module for pre-fusing global context, and PixelRefer-Lite as an efficient Object-Only Framework. Uses PixelRefer-2.2M dataset for instruction tuning.

Result: Achieves leading performance with fewer training samples across benchmarks. PixelRefer-Lite offers competitive accuracy with significant efficiency gains.

Conclusion: PixelRefer enables advanced fine-grained understanding over user-specified regions, addressing the gap in object-centric reasoning while providing efficient alternatives through PixelRefer-Lite.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong
general-purpose capabilities in open-world visual comprehension. However, most
existing MLLMs primarily focus on holistic, scene-level understanding, often
overlooking the need for fine-grained, object-centric reasoning. In this paper,
we present PixelRefer, a unified region-level MLLM framework that enables
advanced fine-grained understanding over user-specified regions across both
images and videos. Motivated by the observation that LLM attention
predominantly focuses on object-level tokens, we propose a Scale-Adaptive
Object Tokenizer (SAOT) to generate compact and semantically rich object
representations from free-form regions. Our analysis reveals that global visual
tokens contribute mainly in early LLM layers, inspiring the design of
PixelRefer-Lite, an efficient variant that employs an Object-Centric Infusion
module to pre-fuse global context into object tokens. This yields a lightweight
Object-Only Framework that substantially reduces computational cost while
maintaining high semantic fidelity. To facilitate fine-grained instruction
tuning, we curate PixelRefer-2.2M, a high-quality object-centric instruction
dataset. Extensive experiments across a range of benchmarks validate that
PixelRefer achieves leading performance with fewer training samples, while
PixelRefer-Lite offers competitive accuracy with notable gains in efficiency.

### [209] [Track, Inpaint, Resplat: Subject-driven 3D and 4D Generation with Progressive Texture Infilling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23605)
*Shuhong Zheng,Ashkan Mirzaei,Igor Gilitschenski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TIRE is a novel method for subject-driven 3D/4D generation that improves identity preservation by tracking, inpainting, and resplatting regions in existing 3D assets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D/4D generation methods fail to preserve semantic identity across viewpoints, and personalized 3D/4D generation remains underexplored despite the importance of subject-driven content creation.

Method: TIRE takes an initial 3D asset, uses video tracking to identify regions needing modification, applies subject-driven 2D inpainting to progressively fill identified regions, and resplats modified 2D multi-view observations back to 3D while maintaining consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments show TIRE significantly improves identity preservation in 3D/4D generation compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed TIRE method effectively addresses the identity preservation challenge in subject-driven 3D/4D generation through its track-inpaint-resplat pipeline.

Abstract: Current 3D/4D generation methods are usually optimized for photorealism,
efficiency, and aesthetics. However, they often fail to preserve the semantic
identity of the subject across different viewpoints. Adapting generation
methods with one or few images of a specific subject (also known as
Personalization or Subject-driven generation) allows generating visual content
that align with the identity of the subject. However, personalized 3D/4D
generation is still largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce TIRE
(Track, Inpaint, REsplat), a novel method for subject-driven 3D/4D generation.
It takes an initial 3D asset produced by an existing 3D generative model as
input and uses video tracking to identify the regions that need to be modified.
Then, we adopt a subject-driven 2D inpainting model for progressively infilling
the identified regions. Finally, we resplat the modified 2D multi-view
observations back to 3D while still maintaining consistency. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves identity
preservation in 3D/4D generation compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our

### [210] [Concerto: Joint 2D-3D Self-Supervised Learning Emerges Spatial Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23607)
*Yujia Zhang,Xiaoyang Wu,Yixing Lao,Chengyao Wang,Zhuotao Tian,Naiyan Wang,Hengshuang Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Concerto combines 3D intra-modal self-distillation with 2D-3D cross-modal joint embedding to learn superior spatial representations, outperforming SOTA methods in 3D scene perception and setting new benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspired by human multisensory concept learning where abstract representations can be recalled from single modalities, the paper aims to develop a model that learns coherent spatial features through multimodal synergy.

Method: Concerto uses 3D intra-modal self-distillation combined with 2D-3D cross-modal joint embedding. It also includes variants for video-lifted point cloud understanding and a translator to project representations into CLIP's language space.

Result: Concerto outperforms standalone SOTA 2D and 3D self-supervised models by 14.2% and 4.8% respectively in linear probing. With full fine-tuning, it achieves 80.7% mIoU on ScanNet and sets new SOTA results across multiple scene understanding benchmarks.

Conclusion: Concerto learns spatial representations with superior fine-grained geometric and semantic consistency, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining intra-modal self-distillation with cross-modal joint embedding for spatial cognition.

Abstract: Humans learn abstract concepts through multisensory synergy, and once formed,
such representations can often be recalled from a single modality. Inspired by
this principle, we introduce Concerto, a minimalist simulation of human concept
learning for spatial cognition, combining 3D intra-modal self-distillation with
2D-3D cross-modal joint embedding. Despite its simplicity, Concerto learns more
coherent and informative spatial features, as demonstrated by zero-shot
visualizations. It outperforms both standalone SOTA 2D and 3D self-supervised
models by 14.2% and 4.8%, respectively, as well as their feature concatenation,
in linear probing for 3D scene perception. With full fine-tuning, Concerto sets
new SOTA results across multiple scene understanding benchmarks (e.g., 80.7%
mIoU on ScanNet). We further present a variant of Concerto tailored for
video-lifted point cloud spatial understanding, and a translator that linearly
projects Concerto representations into CLIP's language space, enabling
open-world perception. These results highlight that Concerto emerges spatial
representations with superior fine-grained geometric and semantic consistency.
