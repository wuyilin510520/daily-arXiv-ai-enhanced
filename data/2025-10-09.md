### [1] [Milestone Determination for Autonomous Railway Operation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06229)
*Josh Hunter,John McDermid,Simon Burton,Poppy Fynes,Mia Dempster*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes route-specific milestone determination for railway vision systems to overcome limited sequential data availability, focusing on critical decision points rather than general dynamic recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses challenges in railway automation vision systems due to limited high-quality sequential data and lack of spatio-temporal context in traditional datasets, while avoiding realism issues of alternative solutions.

Method: Uses route-specific, contextually relevant cues to generate sequential datasets and develops targeted rule-based models through milestone determination, focusing on critical decision points along routes.

Result: Enables generation of rich sequential datasets aligned with real-world operational logic and simplifies learning by eliminating need for generalized dynamic component recognition.

Conclusion: This approach provides a practical framework for training vision agents in controlled environments, facilitating safer and more efficient machine learning systems for railway automation.

Abstract: In the field of railway automation, one of the key challenges has been the
development of effective computer vision systems due to the limited
availability of high-quality, sequential data. Traditional datasets are
restricted in scope, lacking the spatio temporal context necessary for
real-time decision-making, while alternative solutions introduce issues related
to realism and applicability. By focusing on route-specific, contextually
relevant cues, we can generate rich, sequential datasets that align more
closely with real-world operational logic. The concept of milestone
determination allows for the development of targeted, rule-based models that
simplify the learning process by eliminating the need for generalized
recognition of dynamic components, focusing instead on the critical decision
points along a route. We argue that this approach provides a practical
framework for training vision agents in controlled, predictable environments,
facilitating safer and more efficient machine learning systems for railway
automation.

### [2] [CML-Bench: A Framework for Evaluating and Enhancing LLM-Powered Movie Scripts Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06231)
*Mingzhe Zheng,Dingjie Song,Guanyu Zhou,Jun You,Jiahao Zhan,Xuran Ma,Xinyuan Song,Ser-Nam Lim,Qifeng Chen,Harry Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper analyzes LLMs' limitations in generating movie scripts with emotional depth, introduces CML-Dataset and CML-Bench for quality assessment, and proposes CML-Instruction to improve LLM-generated screenplays.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle to capture the nuanced storytelling and emotional depth required for compelling movie scripts despite their structural capabilities.

Method: Created CML-Dataset from movie scripts, identified three quality dimensions (Dialogue Coherence, Character Consistency, Plot Reasonableness), developed CML-Bench metrics, and introduced CML-Instruction prompting strategy.

Result: CML-Bench effectively distinguishes human-written scripts from LLM-generated ones, and CML-Instruction helps LLMs produce higher-quality screenplays aligned with human preferences.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses LLMs' deficiencies in script generation and provides effective tools for quality assessment and improvement.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
generating highly structured texts. However, while exhibiting a high degree of
structural organization, movie scripts demand an additional layer of nuanced
storytelling and emotional depth-the 'soul' of compelling cinema-that LLMs
often fail to capture. To investigate this deficiency, we first curated
CML-Dataset, a dataset comprising (summary, content) pairs for Cinematic Markup
Language (CML), where 'content' consists of segments from esteemed,
high-quality movie scripts and 'summary' is a concise description of the
content. Through an in-depth analysis of the intrinsic multi-shot continuity
and narrative structures within these authentic scripts, we identified three
pivotal dimensions for quality assessment: Dialogue Coherence (DC), Character
Consistency (CC), and Plot Reasonableness (PR). Informed by these findings, we
propose the CML-Bench, featuring quantitative metrics across these dimensions.
CML-Bench effectively assigns high scores to well-crafted, human-written
scripts while concurrently pinpointing the weaknesses in screenplays generated
by LLMs. To further validate our benchmark, we introduce CML-Instruction, a
prompting strategy with detailed instructions on character dialogue and event
logic, to guide LLMs to generate more structured and cinematically sound
scripts. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our benchmark and
demonstrate that LLMs guided by CML-Instruction generate higher-quality
screenplays, with results aligned with human preferences.

### [3] [User to Video: A Model for Spammer Detection Inspired by Video Classification Technology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06233)
*Haoyang Zhang,Zhou Yang,Yucai Pang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UVSD is a spammer detection model that treats user behavior as video frames, using pixelization and video classification techniques to identify spammers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is inspired by video classification technology, viewing user behavior subspace as frame images and consecutive behaviors as videos to detect spammers.

Method: Proposes three algorithms: user2piexl for user pixelization (quantifying stances as RGB values), behavior2image for transforming behavior subspace into frame images using representation learning and diffusion algorithms, and constructing user behavior videos based on temporal features combined with video classification.

Result: Experiments on WEIBO and TWITTER datasets show UVSD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in spammer detection.

Conclusion: The UVSD model successfully applies video classification concepts to spammer detection, demonstrating superior performance through innovative user behavior videoization approach.

Abstract: This article is inspired by video classification technology. If the user
behavior subspace is viewed as a frame image, consecutive frame images are
viewed as a video. Following this novel idea, a model for spammer detection
based on user videoization, called UVSD, is proposed. Firstly, a user2piexl
algorithm for user pixelization is proposed. Considering the adversarial
behavior of user stances, the user is viewed as a pixel, and the stance is
quantified as the pixel's RGB. Secondly, a behavior2image algorithm is proposed
for transforming user behavior subspace into frame images. Low-rank dense
vectorization of subspace user relations is performed using representation
learning, while cutting and diffusion algorithms are introduced to complete the
frame imageization. Finally, user behavior videos are constructed based on
temporal features. Subsequently, a video classification algorithm is combined
to identify the spammers. Experiments using publicly available datasets, i.e.,
WEIBO and TWITTER, show an advantage of the UVSD model over state-of-the-art
methods.

### [4] [Uncertainty Quantification In Surface Landmines and UXO Classification Using MC Dropout](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06238)
*Sagar Lekhak,Emmett J. Ientilucci,Dimah Dera,Susmita Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes using Monte Carlo Dropout with ResNet-50 for uncertainty quantification in surface landmine and UXO detection, making predictions more reliable under noisy and adversarial conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deterministic neural networks for landmine detection are vulnerable to noise and adversarial attacks, potentially leading to dangerous missed detections or misclassifications in humanitarian demining operations.

Method: Integrated Monte Carlo Dropout into a fine-tuned ResNet-50 architecture for surface landmine/UXO classification, tested on simulated datasets under clean, noisy, and adversarial conditions.

Result: The model successfully flagged unreliable predictions under challenging conditions, demonstrating the value of uncertainty quantification for identifying when predictions may be untrustworthy.

Conclusion: Uncertainty quantification is essential for demining applications, highlighting vulnerabilities of current neural networks to adversarial threats and emphasizing the need for more robust, reliable models for practical field use.

Abstract: Detecting surface landmines and unexploded ordnances (UXOs) using deep
learning has shown promise in humanitarian demining. However, deterministic
neural networks can be vulnerable to noisy conditions and adversarial attacks,
leading to missed detection or misclassification. This study introduces the
idea of uncertainty quantification through Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout, integrated
into a fine-tuned ResNet-50 architecture for surface landmine and UXO
classification, which was tested on a simulated dataset. Integrating the MC
Dropout approach helps quantify epistemic uncertainty, providing an additional
metric for prediction reliability, which could be helpful to make more informed
decisions in demining operations. Experimental results on clean, adversarially
perturbed, and noisy test images demonstrate the model's ability to flag
unreliable predictions under challenging conditions. This proof-of-concept
study highlights the need for uncertainty quantification in demining, raises
awareness about the vulnerability of existing neural networks in demining to
adversarial threats, and emphasizes the importance of developing more robust
and reliable models for practical applications.

### [5] [multimodars: A Rust-powered toolkit for multi-modality cardiac image fusion and registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06241)
*Anselm W. Stark,Marc Ilic,Ali Mokhtari,Pooya Mohammadi Kazaj,Christoph Graeni,Isaac Shiri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: multimodars is an open toolkit for deterministic fusion of intravascular imaging and CCTA data, enabling multi-state coronary analysis with high performance and pipeline integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current coronary imaging lacks an open, flexible toolkit for multi-state analysis that combines high-resolution intravascular imaging with 3D CCTA context while offering deterministic behavior and easy integration.

Method: Uses deterministic alignment algorithms, a compact NumPy-centered data model, and an optimized Rust backend for scalable performance. Accepts CSV/NumPy inputs including AIVUS-CAA formats.

Result: Provides a toolkit that enables reproducible fusion of complementary imaging modalities for coronary analysis with deterministic behavior and high performance.

Conclusion: multimodars fills the gap for open, flexible coronary imaging fusion with deterministic alignment, suitable for multi-state analysis and scalable experiments.

Abstract: Combining complementary imaging modalities is critical to build reliable 3D
coronary models: intravascular imaging gives sub-millimetre resolution but
limited whole-vessel context, while CCTA supplies 3D geometry but suffers from
limited spatial resolution and artefacts (e.g., blooming). Prior work
demonstrated intravascular/CCTA fusion, yet no open, flexible toolkit is
tailored for multi-state analysis (rest/stress, pre-/post-stenting) while
offering deterministic behaviour, high performance, and easy pipeline
integration. multimodars addresses this gap with deterministic alignment
algorithms, a compact NumPy-centred data model, and an optimised Rust backend
suitable for scalable, reproducible experiments. The package accepts CSV/NumPy
inputs including data formats produced by the AIVUS-CAA software

### [6] [Does Physics Knowledge Emerge in Frontier Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06251)
*Ieva Bagdonaviciute,Vibhav Vineet*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs show strong visual perception but weak physical dynamics understanding, with fragmented integration between perception and physics reasoning skills.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To benchmark VLMs' ability to understand and predict physical dynamics, as their performance in this area remains unclear despite strong results in visual perception and general reasoning.

Method: Benchmarked six frontier VLMs on three physical simulation datasets (CLEVRER, Physion, Physion++) with diagnostic subtests isolating perception from physics reasoning.

Result: Weak correlations found between diagnostic performance and evaluation accuracy - models excelling at perception or physics reasoning don't consistently perform better on predictive/counterfactual tasks.

Conclusion: Current VLMs have fragmented perceptual and physics skills that fail to combine into causal understanding, highlighting the need for architectures that better bind perception and reasoning.

Abstract: Leading Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show strong results in visual
perception and general reasoning, but their ability to understand and predict
physical dynamics remains unclear. We benchmark six frontier VLMs on three
physical simulation datasets - CLEVRER, Physion, and Physion++ - where the
evaluation tasks test whether a model can predict outcomes or hypothesize about
alternative situations. To probe deeper, we design diagnostic subtests that
isolate perception (objects, colors, occluders) from physics reasoning (motion
prediction, spatial relations). Intuitively, stronger diagnostic performance
should support higher evaluation accuracy. Yet our analysis reveals weak
correlations: models that excel at perception or physics reasoning do not
consistently perform better on predictive or counterfactual evaluation. This
counterintuitive gap exposes a central limitation of current VLMs: perceptual
and physics skills remain fragmented and fail to combine into causal
understanding, underscoring the need for architectures that bind perception and
reasoning more tightly.

### [7] [Enhanced Self-Distillation Framework for Efficient Spiking Neural Network Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06254)
*Xiaochen Zhao,Chengting Yu,Kairong Yu,Lei Liu,Aili Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Enhanced self-distillation framework for SNNs that reduces training complexity while achieving high performance by projecting firing rates to ANN branches and using reliable self-generated knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNNs are energy-efficient but conventional training methods have performance gaps with ANNs and high computational/memory costs that scale with temporal dimension. Need efficient training under limited resources.

Method: Joint optimization of enhanced self-distillation with rate-based backpropagation. Projects SNN firing rates to lightweight ANN branches, uses high-quality self-generated knowledge to optimize substructures through ANN pathways. Decouples teacher signal into reliable/unreliable components to ensure only reliable knowledge guides optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CIFAR10-DVS, and ImageNet show reduced training complexity while achieving high-performance SNN training.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables efficient and high-performance SNN training by leveraging reliable self-distillation knowledge through ANN pathways, overcoming limitations of conventional SNN training methods.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) exhibit exceptional energy efficiency on
neuromorphic hardware due to their sparse activation patterns. However,
conventional training methods based on surrogate gradients and Backpropagation
Through Time (BPTT) not only lag behind Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in
performance, but also incur significant computational and memory overheads that
grow linearly with the temporal dimension. To enable high-performance SNN
training under limited computational resources, we propose an enhanced
self-distillation framework, jointly optimized with rate-based backpropagation.
Specifically, the firing rates of intermediate SNN layers are projected onto
lightweight ANN branches, and high-quality knowledge generated by the model
itself is used to optimize substructures through the ANN pathways. Unlike
traditional self-distillation paradigms, we observe that low-quality
self-generated knowledge may hinder convergence. To address this, we decouple
the teacher signal into reliable and unreliable components, ensuring that only
reliable knowledge is used to guide the optimization of the model. Extensive
experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CIFAR10-DVS, and ImageNet demonstrate that
our method reduces training complexity while achieving high-performance SNN
training. Our code is available at

### [8] [Ensemble Deep Learning and LLM-Assisted Reporting for Automated Skin Lesion Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06260)
*Sher Khan,Raz Muhammad,Adil Hussain,Muhammad Sajjad,Muhammad Rashid*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified AI framework for dermatological diagnostics that combines heterogeneous neural networks with integrated language processing to improve diagnostic reliability and patient communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current dermatological diagnostics suffer from inter-observer variability, access disparities, dataset biases, and fragmented AI approaches that treat language processing as separate from clinical decision-making.

Method: 1) Heterogeneous ensemble of diverse CNNs with uncertainty mechanisms for discordant case flagging, 2) Direct integration of large language models into diagnostic workflow to generate structured clinical reports with lesion characterization, diagnostic reasoning, and patient education.

Result: The framework bridges the translational gap by addressing both diagnostic reliability and communication barriers, creating a cohesive system that enhances diagnostic precision while supporting continuum of care.

Conclusion: This represents a significant advancement toward deployable dermatological AI that improves early intervention rates for skin lesions through enhanced diagnostic precision and patient-centered education.

Abstract: Cutaneous malignancies demand early detection for favorable outcomes, yet
current diagnostics suffer from inter-observer variability and access
disparities. While AI shows promise, existing dermatological systems are
limited by homogeneous architectures, dataset biases across skin tones, and
fragmented approaches that treat natural language processing as separate
post-hoc explanations rather than integral to clinical decision-making. We
introduce a unified framework that fundamentally reimagines AI integration for
dermatological diagnostics through two synergistic innovations. First, a
purposefully heterogeneous ensemble of architecturally diverse convolutional
neural networks provides complementary diagnostic perspectives, with an
intrinsic uncertainty mechanism flagging discordant cases for specialist review
-- mimicking clinical best practices. Second, we embed large language model
capabilities directly into the diagnostic workflow, transforming classification
outputs into clinically meaningful assessments that simultaneously fulfill
medical documentation requirements and deliver patient-centered education. This
seamless integration generates structured reports featuring precise lesion
characterization, accessible diagnostic reasoning, and actionable monitoring
guidance -- empowering patients to recognize early warning signs between
visits. By addressing both diagnostic reliability and communication barriers
within a single cohesive system, our approach bridges the critical
translational gap that has prevented previous AI implementations from achieving
clinical impact. The framework represents a significant advancement toward
deployable dermatological AI that enhances diagnostic precision while actively
supporting the continuum of care from initial detection through patient
education, ultimately improving early intervention rates for skin lesions.

### [9] [Vision Transformer for Transient Noise Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06273)
*Divyansh Srivastava,Andrzej Niedzielski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper uses Vision Transformer (ViT) to classify transient noise (glitches) in LIGO gravitational wave data into 22 existing classes plus 2 new classes from O3a run, achieving 92.26% classification efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transient noise (glitches) in LIGO data hinders gravitational wave detection, and with the O3 run adding two new noise classes, new models are needed for effective classification.

Method: Train a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT-B/32) model on a combined dataset of Gravity Spy data with the two additional classes from LIGO O3a run.

Result: Achieved 92.26% classification efficiency for the 24 glitch classes.

Conclusion: Vision Transformer demonstrates potential to improve gravitational wave detection accuracy by effectively distinguishing transient noise.

Abstract: Transient noise (glitches) in LIGO data hinders the detection of
gravitational waves (GW). The Gravity Spy project has categorized these noise
events into various classes. With the O3 run, there is the inclusion of two
additional noise classes and thus a need to train new models for effective
classification. We aim to classify glitches in LIGO data into 22 existing
classes from the first run plus 2 additional noise classes from O3a using the
Vision Transformer (ViT) model. We train a pre-trained Vision Transformer
(ViT-B/32) model on a combined dataset consisting of the Gravity Spy dataset
with the additional two classes from the LIGO O3a run. We achieve a
classification efficiency of 92.26%, demonstrating the potential of Vision
Transformer to improve the accuracy of gravitational wave detection by
effectively distinguishing transient noise.

### [10] [General and Efficient Visual Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning using Object-Agnostic Masks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06277)
*Fahim Shahriar,Cheryl Wang,Alireza Azimi,Gautham Vasan,Hany Hamed Elanwar,A. Rupam Mahmood,Colin Bellinger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a mask-based goal representation for GCRL that enables object-agnostic learning, efficient training, and superior generalization compared to existing methods like target images, coordinates, or one-hot vectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing goal representation methods in GCRL suffer from poor generalization to unseen objects, slow convergence, and dependency on special cameras. There's a need for a more efficient and generalizable goal representation system.

Method: Uses mask-based goal representation that provides object-agnostic visual cues. Masks can be processed for dense rewards without distance calculations. Method includes learning with ground truth masks in simulation and using pretrained open vocabulary object detection models for mask generation in real-world applications.

Result: Achieved 99.9% reaching accuracy on both training and unseen test objects. Successfully performed pick-up tasks with high accuracy without positional information. Demonstrated learning from scratch and sim-to-real transfer using physical robots.

Conclusion: Mask-based goal representation is an effective approach for GCRL that enables efficient learning, superior generalization, and practical real-world applications without the limitations of existing goal representation methods.

Abstract: Goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) allows agents to learn diverse
objectives using a unified policy. The success of GCRL, however, is contingent
on the choice of goal representation. In this work, we propose a mask-based
goal representation system that provides object-agnostic visual cues to the
agent, enabling efficient learning and superior generalization. In contrast,
existing goal representation methods, such as target state images, 3D
coordinates, and one-hot vectors, face issues of poor generalization to unseen
objects, slow convergence, and the need for special cameras. Masks can be
processed to generate dense rewards without requiring error-prone distance
calculations. Learning with ground truth masks in simulation, we achieved 99.9%
reaching accuracy on training and unseen test objects. Our proposed method can
be utilized to perform pick-up tasks with high accuracy, without using any
positional information of the target. Moreover, we demonstrate learning from
scratch and sim-to-real transfer applications using two different physical
robots, utilizing pretrained open vocabulary object detection models for mask
generation.

### [11] [Improving the Spatial Resolution of GONG Solar Images to GST Quality Using Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06281)
*Chenyang Li,Qin Li,Haimin Wang,Bo Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A GAN-based super-resolution approach using Real-ESRGAN enhances low-resolution Hα solar images from GONG to match high-resolution BBSO/GST quality, recovering fine details in sunspots, filaments, and fibrils.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution solar imaging is essential for capturing fine-scale dynamic features like filaments and fibrils, but current full-disk Hα images from GONG have limited spatial resolution that cannot resolve these small-scale structures.

Method: Employed Real-ESRGAN with Residual-in-Residual Dense Blocks and a relativistic discriminator, using carefully aligned GONG-GST image pairs for training and enhancement.

Result: The model effectively recovers fine details in sunspot penumbrae and resolves fine details in filaments and fibrils, achieving MSE of 467.15, RMSE of 21.59, and cross-correlation of 0.7794.

Conclusion: The approach successfully enhances solar image resolution, though slight misalignments between image pairs limit quantitative performance, with plans to address this and expand the dataset for further improvements.

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) solar imaging is crucial for capturing fine-scale
dynamic features such as filaments and fibrils. However, the spatial resolution
of the full-disk H$\alpha$ images is limited and insufficient to resolve these
small-scale structures. To address this, we propose a GAN-based superresolution
approach to enhance low-resolution (LR) full-disk H$\alpha$ images from the
Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) to a quality comparable with HR
observations from the Big Bear Solar Observatory/Goode Solar Telescope
(BBSO/GST). We employ Real-ESRGAN with Residual-in-Residual Dense Blocks and a
relativistic discriminator. We carefully aligned GONG-GST pairs. The model
effectively recovers fine details within sunspot penumbrae and resolves fine
details in filaments and fibrils, achieving an average mean squared error (MSE)
of 467.15, root mean squared error (RMSE) of 21.59, and cross-correlation (CC)
of 0.7794. Slight misalignments between image pairs limit quantitative
performance, which we plan to address in future work alongside dataset
expansion to further improve reconstruction quality.

### [12] [ChainMPQ: Interleaved Text-Image Reasoning Chains for Mitigating Relation Hallucinations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06292)
*Yike Wu,Yiwei Wang,Yujun Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ChainMPQ is a training-free method that reduces relation hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models by using multi-perspective questions and interleaved chains of images and text to improve relational reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Relation hallucinations account for the largest proportion among three categories of hallucinations in LVLMs but have received the least attention, hindering model reliability.

Method: Extracts subject/object keywords to enhance image regions, constructs multi-perspective questions focusing on subject, object, and relation components, and uses interleaved chains of images/text with accumulated memories for progressive reasoning.

Result: Substantially reduces relation hallucinations across multiple LVLMs and benchmarks, with ablation studies validating effectiveness of the three core modules.

Conclusion: ChainMPQ effectively addresses relation hallucinations through multi-perspective questioning and interleaved memory chains, improving relational inference without requiring additional training.

Abstract: While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) achieve strong performance in
multimodal tasks, hallucinations continue to hinder their reliability. Among
the three categories of hallucinations, which include object, attribute, and
relation, relation hallucinations account for the largest proportion but have
received the least attention. To address this issue, we propose ChainMPQ
(Multi-Perspective Questions guided Interleaved Chain of Image and Text), a
training-free method that improves relational inference in LVLMs by utilizing
accumulated textual and visual memories. ChainMPQ first extracts subject and
object keywords from the question to enhance the corresponding image regions.
It then constructs multi-perspective questions that focus on the three core
components of a relationship: the subject, the object, and the relation that
links them. These questions are sequentially input to the model, with textual
and visual memories from earlier steps providing supporting context for
subsequent ones, thereby forming an interleaved chain of images and text that
guides progressive relational reasoning. Experiments on multiple LVLMs and
benchmarks show that ChainMPQ substantially reduces relation hallucinations,
while ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of its three core
modules.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MobilePicasso enables efficient 4K image editing on mobile devices using a three-stage approach with hallucination-aware loss, latent projection, and adaptive tiling, achieving significant speed-ups and quality improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models for image editing face memory and quality challenges on resource-constrained mobile devices, especially at high resolutions like 4K.

Method: Three-stage approach: (1) image editing at standard resolution with hallucination-aware loss, (2) latent projection to avoid pixel space, (3) upscaling with adaptive context-preserving tiling.

Result: 18-48% image quality improvement, 14-51% reduction in hallucinations, up to 55.8x speed-up with only 9% memory increase. On-device runtime faster than server-based A100 GPU model.

Conclusion: MobilePicasso successfully enables high-resolution image editing on mobile devices with superior performance, reduced hallucinations, and efficient resource usage.

Abstract: High-resolution (4K) image-to-image synthesis has become increasingly
important for mobile applications. Existing diffusion models for image editing
face significant challenges, in terms of memory and image quality, when
deployed on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we present
MobilePicasso, a novel system that enables efficient image editing at high
resolutions, while minimising computational cost and memory usage.
MobilePicasso comprises three stages: (i) performing image editing at a
standard resolution with hallucination-aware loss, (ii) applying latent
projection to overcome going to the pixel space, and (iii) upscaling the edited
image latent to a higher resolution with adaptive context-preserving tiling.
Our user study with 46 participants reveals that MobilePicasso not only
improves image quality by 18-48% but reduces hallucinations by 14-51% over
existing methods. MobilePicasso demonstrates significantly lower latency, e.g.,
up to 55.8$\times$ speed-up, yet with a small increase in runtime memory, e.g.,
a mere 9% increase over prior work. Surprisingly, the on-device runtime of
MobilePicasso is observed to be faster than a server-based high-resolution
image editing model running on an A100 GPU.

### [14] [RGBD Gaze Tracking Using Transformer for Feature Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06298)
*Tobias J. Bauer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Implementation of AI-based Gaze Tracking using RGBD images with Transformer feature fusion, achieving competitive results compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the unexplored combination of RGBD input images and Transformers for gaze tracking, and address the lack of suitable datasets with depth information for Gaze Angle Estimation.

Method: Uses RGBD images with Transformer architecture for feature fusion, based on Lian et al.'s GAN approach but modified to remove pre-trained GAN module. Evaluated various configurations including MLP replacements on three datasets.

Result: Transformer model achieved 55.3mm mean Euclidean error on ShanghaiTechGaze+ (vs 38.7mm baseline), but removing pre-trained GAN reduced error to 30.1mm. MLP replacement further improved to 26.9mm. On ETH-XGaze, Transformer achieved 3.59° angular error vs 3.26° without Transformer (compared to 2.04° by dataset authors).

Conclusion: The combination of RGBD and Transformers shows promise, but simpler architectures like MLP may outperform Transformers for this specific task. Removing pre-trained GAN components significantly improves performance.

Abstract: Subject of this thesis is the implementation of an AI-based Gaze Tracking
system using RGBD images that contain both color (RGB) and depth (D)
information. To fuse the features extracted from the images, a module based on
the Transformer architecture is used. The combination of RGBD input images and
Transformers was chosen because it has not yet been investigated. Furthermore,
a new dataset is created for training the AI models as existing datasets either
do not contain depth information or only contain labels for Gaze Point
Estimation that are not suitable for the task of Gaze Angle Estimation. Various
model configurations are trained, validated and evaluated on a total of three
different datasets. The trained models are then to be used in a real-time
pipeline to estimate the gaze direction and thus the gaze point of a person in
front of a computer screen. The AI model architecture used in this thesis is
based on an earlier work by Lian et al. It uses a Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) to simultaneously remove depth map artifacts and extract head
pose features. Lian et al. achieve a mean Euclidean error of 38.7mm on their
own dataset ShanghaiTechGaze+. In this thesis, a model architecture with a
Transformer module for feature fusion achieves a mean Euclidean error of 55.3mm
on the same dataset, but we show that using no pre-trained GAN module leads to
a mean Euclidean error of 30.1mm. Replacing the Transformer module with a
Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) improves the error to 26.9mm. These results are
coherent with the ones on the other two datasets. On the ETH-XGaze dataset, the
model with Transformer module achieves a mean angular error of 3.59{\deg} and
without Transformer module 3.26{\deg}, whereas the fundamentally different
model architecture used by the dataset authors Zhang et al. achieves a mean
angular error of 2.04{\deg}. On the OTH-Gaze-Estimation dataset created for...

*Tiago de Conto,John Armston,Ralph Dubayah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning framework fusing GEDI lidar with SAR data to produce global, high-resolution maps of forest structural complexity, achieving high accuracy with minimal computational requirements.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of sparse GEDI lidar sampling and enable continuous high-resolution mapping of forest structural complexity globally for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem management.

Method: Adapted EfficientNetV2 architecture trained on 130+ million GEDI footprints, fusing multimodal SAR datasets to produce 25m resolution wall-to-wall maps with calibrated uncertainty estimates.

Result: Achieved global R² = 0.82 with fewer than 400,000 parameters, produced accurate predictions across biomes and time periods (2015-2022), preserving fine-scale spatial patterns.

Conclusion: This scalable framework enables continuous monitoring of global forest structural dynamics and can be extended via transfer learning to predict additional forest variables with minimal computational cost.

Abstract: Forest structural complexity metrics integrate multiple canopy attributes
into a single value that reflects habitat quality and ecosystem function.
Spaceborne lidar from the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) has
enabled mapping of structural complexity in temperate and tropical forests, but
its sparse sampling limits continuous high-resolution mapping. We present a
scalable, deep learning framework fusing GEDI observations with multimodal
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) datasets to produce global, high-resolution (25
m) wall-to-wall maps of forest structural complexity. Our adapted
EfficientNetV2 architecture, trained on over 130 million GEDI footprints,
achieves high performance (global R2 = 0.82) with fewer than 400,000
parameters, making it an accessible tool that enables researchers to process
datasets at any scale without requiring specialized computing infrastructure.
The model produces accurate predictions with calibrated uncertainty estimates
across biomes and time periods, preserving fine-scale spatial patterns. It has
been used to generate a global, multi-temporal dataset of forest structural
complexity from 2015 to 2022. Through transfer learning, this framework can be
extended to predict additional forest structural variables with minimal
computational cost. This approach supports continuous, multi-temporal
monitoring of global forest structural dynamics and provides tools for
biodiversity conservation and ecosystem management efforts in a changing
climate.

### [17] [TransFIRA: Transfer Learning for Face Image Recognizability Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06353)
*Allen Tu,Kartik Narayan,Joshua Gleason,Jennifer Xu,Matthew Meyn,Tom Goldstein,Vishal M. Patel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TransFIRA is a lightweight, annotation-free framework for face image recognizability assessment that uses embedding space geometry to define recognizability via class-center similarity and angular separation, achieving state-of-the-art performance without external labels or backbone-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing face image quality assessment methods rely on visual heuristics, curated annotations, or intensive generative pipelines, making them detached from the encoder's decision geometry and failing to predict true recognizability in unconstrained environments.

Method: TransFIRA defines recognizability through class-center similarity (CCS) and class-center angular separation (CCAS) in embedding space, uses a recognizability-informed aggregation strategy, and extends to encoder-grounded explainability and body recognition assessment.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art verification accuracy on BRIAR and IJB-C datasets, nearly doubles correlation with true recognizability, shows strong performance on body recognition, and demonstrates robustness under cross-dataset shifts.

Conclusion: TransFIRA establishes a unified, geometry-driven framework for recognizability assessment that is encoder-specific, accurate, interpretable, and extensible across modalities, significantly advancing FIQA in accuracy, explainability, and scope.

Abstract: Face recognition in unconstrained environments such as surveillance, video,
and web imagery must contend with extreme variation in pose, blur,
illumination, and occlusion, where conventional visual quality metrics fail to
predict whether inputs are truly recognizable to the deployed encoder. Existing
FIQA methods typically rely on visual heuristics, curated annotations, or
computationally intensive generative pipelines, leaving their predictions
detached from the encoder's decision geometry. We introduce TransFIRA (Transfer
Learning for Face Image Recognizability Assessment), a lightweight and
annotation-free framework that grounds recognizability directly in embedding
space. TransFIRA delivers three advances: (i) a definition of recognizability
via class-center similarity (CCS) and class-center angular separation (CCAS),
yielding the first natural, decision-boundary--aligned criterion for filtering
and weighting; (ii) a recognizability-informed aggregation strategy that
achieves state-of-the-art verification accuracy on BRIAR and IJB-C while nearly
doubling correlation with true recognizability, all without external labels,
heuristics, or backbone-specific training; and (iii) new extensions beyond
faces, including encoder-grounded explainability that reveals how degradations
and subject-specific factors affect recognizability, and the first
recognizability-aware body recognition assessment. Experiments confirm
state-of-the-art results on faces, strong performance on body recognition, and
robustness under cross-dataset shifts. Together, these contributions establish
TransFIRA as a unified, geometry-driven framework for recognizability
assessment -- encoder-specific, accurate, interpretable, and extensible across
modalities -- significantly advancing FIQA in accuracy, explainability, and
scope.

TL;DR: NYSDOT uses ML models to automatically classify road conditions from camera images and weather data, achieving 81.5% accuracy on unseen cameras.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual road condition evaluation by NYSDOT is labor-intensive, especially during winter weather events, requiring automated support for operational decisions.

Method: Trained convolutional neural networks and random forests on ~22,000 hand-labeled camera images with six road condition classes, using both image and weather data.

Result: The model achieved 81.5% accuracy on completely unseen cameras, demonstrating good generalizability for operational use.

Conclusion: Machine learning models can effectively support NYSDOT's road condition monitoring by automatically classifying surface conditions with high accuracy across different camera locations.

Abstract: The New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) has a network of
roadside traffic cameras that are used by both the NYSDOT and the public to
observe road conditions. The NYSDOT evaluates road conditions by driving on
roads and observing live cameras, tasks which are labor-intensive but necessary
for making critical operational decisions during winter weather events.
However, machine learning models can provide additional support for the NYSDOT
by automatically classifying current road conditions across the state. In this
study, convolutional neural networks and random forests are trained on camera
images and weather data to predict road surface conditions. Models are trained
on a hand-labeled dataset of ~22,000 camera images, each classified by human
labelers into one of six road surface conditions: severe snow, snow, wet, dry,
poor visibility, or obstructed. Model generalizability is prioritized to meet
the operational needs of the NYSDOT decision makers, and the weather-related
road surface condition model in this study achieves an accuracy of 81.5% on
completely unseen cameras.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TDiff is a patch-based diffusion framework for thermal image restoration that handles low resolution, fixed pattern noise, and other localized degradations by training on small thermal patches and restoring full-resolution images through denoising overlapping patches with smooth spatial windowing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Thermal images from low-cost cameras suffer from low resolution, fixed pattern noise, and localized degradations, while available thermal imaging datasets are limited in size and diversity.

Method: A patch-based diffusion framework (TDiff) that trains on small thermal patches and restores full-resolution images by denoising overlapping patches and blending them using smooth spatial windowing.

Result: Experiments on denoising, super-resolution, and deblurring demonstrate strong results on both simulated and real thermal data.

Conclusion: TDiff establishes itself as a unified restoration pipeline for thermal imaging, being the first patch-based diffusion framework that models a learned prior for thermal image restoration across multiple tasks.

Abstract: Thermal images from low-cost cameras often suffer from low resolution, fixed
pattern noise, and other localized degradations. Available datasets for thermal
imaging are also limited in both size and diversity. To address these
challenges, we propose a patch-based diffusion framework (TDiff) that leverages
the local nature of these distortions by training on small thermal patches. In
this approach, full-resolution images are restored by denoising overlapping
patches and blending them using smooth spatial windowing. To our knowledge,
this is the first patch-based diffusion framework that models a learned prior
for thermal image restoration across multiple tasks. Experiments on denoising,
super-resolution, and deblurring demonstrate strong results on both simulated
and real thermal data, establishing our method as a unified restoration
pipeline.

Motivation: To address the limitation of prior approaches in multi-subject identity-preserved generation and provide flexible user guidance options from coarse to precise levels.

Method: Introduces SIGMA-SET27K dataset with identity, structure, and spatial information for 100k+ subjects across 27k images, and develops a framework supporting user guidance from 2D/3D boxes to pixel-level segmentations and depth.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in identity preservation, image generation quality, and speed through extensive evaluation.

Conclusion: SIGMA-GEN provides an effective solution for multi-identity preserving image generation with flexible guidance options and superior performance.

Abstract: We present SIGMA-GEN, a unified framework for multi-identity preserving image
generation. Unlike prior approaches, SIGMA-GEN is the first to enable

TL;DR: SIGRID is a new superpixel-based data structure that encodes color and shape information while reducing input dimensionality, achieving comparable or better performance than pixel-level representations in segmentation tasks with faster training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Superpixels offer computational benefits but their irregular spatial distribution has limited their use in deep learning, requiring specialized architectures that undermine their original efficiency advantages.

Method: Developed SIGRID (Superpixel-Integrated Grid) using classical shape descriptors to encode both color and shape information of superpixels, substantially reducing input dimensionality while maintaining essential features.

Result: Evaluation on four benchmark datasets with two convolutional segmentation architectures showed SIGRIDs match or surpass pixel-level performance while significantly accelerating model training.

Conclusion: SIGRIDs achieve a favorable balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, demonstrating that superpixel-based representations can be effectively integrated into deep learning segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Superpixels have long been used in image simplification to enable more
efficient data processing and storage. However, despite their computational
potential, their irregular spatial distribution has often forced deep learning
approaches to rely on specialized training algorithms and architectures,
undermining the original motivation for superpixelations. In this work, we
introduce a new superpixel-based data structure, SIGRID (Superpixel-Integrated
Grid), as an alternative to full-resolution images in segmentation tasks. By
leveraging classical shape descriptors, SIGRID encodes both color and shape
information of superpixels while substantially reducing input dimensionality.
We evaluate SIGRIDs on four benchmark datasets using two popular convolutional
segmentation architectures. Our results show that, despite compressing the
original data, SIGRIDs not only match but in some cases surpass the performance
of pixel-level representations, all while significantly accelerating model
training. This demonstrates that SIGRIDs achieve a favorable balance between
accuracy and computational efficiency.

*Qingxuan Wu,Zhiyang Dou,Chuan Guo,Yiming Huang,Qiao Feng,Bing Zhou,Jian Wang,Lingjie Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Text2Interact framework generates realistic human-human interactions from text using scalable data synthesis and spatiotemporal coordination, addressing limitations of limited training data and coarse text conditioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle with realistic human-human interactions due to limited two-person training data and insufficient fine-grained text-to-interaction modeling that collapses rich prompts into single embeddings.

Method: Proposes Text2Interact with two components: InterCompose for scalable interaction data synthesis by composing LLM-generated descriptions with single-person motions, and InterActor with word-level conditioning and adaptive interaction loss for fine-grained modeling.

Result: Extensive experiments show consistent gains in motion diversity, fidelity, and generalization, including out-of-distribution scenarios and user studies.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses data scarcity and fine-grained modeling challenges in human-human interaction generation, with code and models to be released for reproducibility.

Abstract: Modeling human-human interactions from text remains challenging because it
requires not only realistic individual dynamics but also precise,
text-consistent spatiotemporal coupling between agents. Currently, progress is
hindered by 1) limited two-person training data, inadequate to capture the
diverse intricacies of two-person interactions; and 2) insufficiently
fine-grained text-to-interaction modeling, where language conditioning
collapses rich, structured prompts into a single sentence embedding. To address
these limitations, we propose our Text2Interact framework, designed to generate
realistic, text-aligned human-human interactions through a scalable
high-fidelity interaction data synthesizer and an effective spatiotemporal
coordination pipeline. First, we present InterCompose, a scalable
synthesis-by-composition pipeline that aligns LLM-generated interaction
descriptions with strong single-person motion priors. Given a prompt and a
motion for an agent, InterCompose retrieves candidate single-person motions,
trains a conditional reaction generator for another agent, and uses a neural
motion evaluator to filter weak or misaligned samples-expanding interaction
coverage without extra capture. Second, we propose InterActor, a
text-to-interaction model with word-level conditioning that preserves
token-level cues (initiation, response, contact ordering) and an adaptive
interaction loss that emphasizes contextually relevant inter-person joint
pairs, improving coupling and physical plausibility for fine-grained
interaction modeling. Extensive experiments show consistent gains in motion
diversity, fidelity, and generalization, including out-of-distribution
scenarios and user studies. We will release code and models to facilitate
reproducibility.

TL;DR: KeyScore is a multimodal frame scoring framework that selects important frames from videos by combining semantic similarity, temporal diversity, and contextual impact, achieving up to 99% frame reduction while improving performance on video-language tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient video-language understanding requires selecting a small set of informative frames from long videos to reduce computational costs while retaining semantic and contextual information.

Method: Proposed KeyScore framework that jointly leverages captions and visual context to estimate frame importance, combined with STACFP (Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Clustering) for generating diverse frame proposals from long videos.

Result: Achieved up to 99% frame reduction compared to full-frame inference and substantially outperformed standard 8-frame encoders on MSRVTT, MSVD, and DiDeMo benchmarks for retrieval, captioning, and video-language reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Emphasizing multimodal alignment between visual and textual signals enables scalable, efficient, and caption-grounded video understanding without requiring explicit video summarization.

Abstract: Efficient video-language understanding requires selecting a small set of
frames that retain semantic and contextual information from long videos. We
propose KeyScore, a multimodal frame scoring framework that jointly leverages
captions and visual context to estimate frame-level importance. By combining
semantic similarity, temporal diversity, and contextual drop impact, KeyScore
identifies the most informative frames for downstream tasks such as retrieval,
captioning, and video-language reasoning. To complement KeyScore, we introduce
STACFP (Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Clustering for Frame Proposals), which
generates compact and diverse frame candidates for long-form videos. Together,
these modules achieve up to 99\% frame reduction compared to full-frame
inference and substantially outperform standard 8-frame encoders on MSRVTT,
MSVD, and DiDeMo. Our results demonstrate that emphasizing multimodal alignment
between visual and textual signals enables scalable, efficient, and
caption-grounded video understanding -- without explicit video summarization.

*Avishree Khare,Hideki Okamoto,Bardh Hoxha,Georgios Fainekos,Rajeev Alur*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes LogSTOP, a scoring function that efficiently computes temporal property scores over sequences using noisy local detectors, outperforming large models and temporal logic baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To lift local detection scores (e.g., objects, emotions) to temporal properties over sequences for applications like query matching and ranked retrieval.

Method: Formalizes STOPs problem and proposes LogSTOP scoring function for temporal properties represented in Linear Temporal Logic.

Result: LogSTOP with YOLO/HuBERT outperforms large vision/audio models by 16% on query matching, and with Grounding DINO/SlowR50 improves MAP/recall by 19%/16% over zero-shot baselines.

Conclusion: LogSTOP effectively computes temporal property scores from noisy local detectors, significantly improving performance on temporal query tasks.

Abstract: Neural models such as YOLO and HuBERT can be used to detect local properties
such as objects ("car") and emotions ("angry") in individual frames of videos
and audio clips respectively. The likelihood of these detections is indicated
by scores in [0, 1]. Lifting these scores to temporal properties over sequences
can be useful for several downstream applications such as query matching (e.g.,
"does the speaker eventually sound happy in this audio clip?"), and ranked
retrieval (e.g., "retrieve top 5 videos with a 10 second scene where a car is
detected until a pedestrian is detected"). In this work, we formalize this
problem of assigning Scores for TempOral Properties (STOPs) over sequences,
given potentially noisy score predictors for local properties. We then propose
a scoring function called LogSTOP that can efficiently compute these scores for
temporal properties represented in Linear Temporal Logic. Empirically, LogSTOP,
with YOLO and HuBERT, outperforms Large Vision / Audio Language Models and
other Temporal Logic-based baselines by at least 16% on query matching with
temporal properties over objects-in-videos and emotions-in-speech respectively.
Similarly, on ranked retrieval with temporal properties over objects and
actions in videos, LogSTOP with Grounding DINO and SlowR50 reports at least a
19% and 16% increase in mean average precision and recall over zero-shot
text-to-video retrieval baselines respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited-angle electron tomography suffers from missing-wedge artifacts, and existing deep learning methods require large high-quality training datasets with known 3D ground truth that are difficult to obtain in electron microscopy.

Method: Proposed TEMDiff, a 3D diffusion-based iterative reconstruction framework trained on volumetric FIB-SEM data using a simulator that maps them to TEM tilt series, enabling learning of realistic structural priors without clean TEM ground truth.

Result: TEMDiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods on simulated datasets with limited angular coverage and generalizes well to real-world TEM tilts, recovering accurate structures from tilt ranges as narrow as 8 degrees with 2-degree increments without retraining.

Conclusion: TEMDiff provides an effective solution for limited-angle electron tomography by leveraging diffusion models and simulated training, achieving high-quality reconstructions without requiring difficult-to-obtain TEM ground truth data.

Abstract: Limited-angle electron tomography aims to reconstruct 3D shapes from 2D
projections of Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) within a restricted range
and number of tilting angles, but it suffers from the missing-wedge problem
that causes severe reconstruction artifacts. Deep learning approaches have
shown promising results in alleviating these artifacts, yet they typically
require large high-quality training datasets with known 3D ground truth which
are difficult to obtain in electron microscopy. To address these challenges, we
propose TEMDiff, a novel 3D diffusion-based iterative reconstruction framework.
Our method is trained on readily available volumetric FIB-SEM data using a
simulator that maps them to TEM tilt series, enabling the model to learn
realistic structural priors without requiring clean TEM ground truth. By
operating directly on 3D volumes, TEMDiff implicitly enforces consistency
across slices without the need for additional regularization. On simulated
electron tomography datasets with limited angular coverage, TEMDiff outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction quality. We further demonstrate that
a trained TEMDiff model generalizes well to real-world TEM tilts obtained under
different conditions and can recover accurate structures from tilt ranges as
narrow as 8 degrees, with 2-degree increments, without any retraining or
fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for equipping VLMs with image generation capabilities suffer from misalignment between understanding and generation representations or architectural complexity.

Method: VUGEN transforms VLM's high-dimensional latent space into lower-dimensional distribution, trains VLM to sample in this space, and uses a dedicated pixel decoder with VAE-free pixel diffusion.

Result: VUGEN achieves superior image generation performance, improving DPG Bench from 71.17 to 74.32 and FID from 11.86 to 9.06 on COCO, while preserving original VLM understanding capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully bridges visual understanding and generation in VLMs through efficient latent space transformation and VAE-free decoding, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled unified
understanding across text and images, yet equipping these models with robust
image generation capabilities remains challenging. Existing approaches often
rely on reconstruction-oriented autoencoders or complex bridging mechanisms,
leading to misalignment between understanding and generation representations,
or architectural complexity. In this work, we propose VUGEN, a novel framework
that explicitly leverages VLM's pretrained visual understanding priors for
efficient and high-quality image generation. Our approach first transforms the
high-dimensional latent space of the VLM's native vision encoder into a
lower-dimensional, tractable distribution that maximally preserves visual
information. The VLM is then trained to sample within this reduced latent
space, ensuring alignment with its visual understanding capabilities. Finally,
a dedicated pixel decoder maps these generated latents back to the image space.
We find that a VAE-free pixel diffusion decoder to be on par or better than
commonly used complex latent diffusion decoders that internally rely on VAE
latents. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VUGEN achieves superior image
generation performance, improving DPG Bench from 71.17 to 74.32 and FID from
11.86 to 9.06 on COCO, while fully preserving the VLM's original understanding
capabilities.

TL;DR: Cluster paths is a post-hoc interpretability method that clusters activations in neural networks and represents inputs as sequences of cluster IDs, providing human-readable explanations while maintaining model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks are opaque in their decision processes, risking unwarranted trust, undetected biases, and unexpected failures, highlighting the need for interpretability methods.

Method: Cluster activations at selected layers and represent each input as its sequence of cluster IDs, with extensions to concept paths using large language models for path divergence analysis.

Result: Achieves 90% faithfulness and 96% agreement under noise in CelebA hair-color task, identifies spurious cues in CIFAR-10, scales to Vision Transformers, and serves as effective OOD detector.

Conclusion: Cluster paths provide scalable, human-readable explanations that uncover visual concepts across network depths while maintaining model accuracy and reliability.

Abstract: While modern deep neural networks achieve impressive performance in vision
tasks, they remain opaque in their decision processes, risking unwarranted
trust, undetected biases and unexpected failures. We propose cluster paths, a
post-hoc interpretability method that clusters activations at selected layers
and represents each input as its sequence of cluster IDs. To assess these
cluster paths, we introduce four metrics: path complexity (cognitive load),
weighted-path purity (class alignment), decision-alignment faithfulness
(predictive fidelity), and path agreement (stability under perturbations). In a
spurious-cue CIFAR-10 experiment, cluster paths identify color-based shortcuts
and collapse when the cue is removed. On a five-class CelebA hair-color task,
they achieve 90% faithfulness and maintain 96% agreement under Gaussian noise
without sacrificing accuracy. Scaling to a Vision Transformer pretrained on
ImageNet, we extend cluster paths to concept paths derived from prompting a
large language model on minimal path divergences. Finally, we show that cluster
paths can serve as an effective out-of-distribution (OOD) detector, reliably
flagging anomalous samples before the model generates over-confident
predictions. Cluster paths uncover visual concepts, such as color palettes,
textures, or object contexts, at multiple network depths, demonstrating that
cluster paths scale to large vision models while generating concise and
human-readable explanations.

TL;DR: HSNet is a graph-based image super-resolution framework that uses heterogeneous subgraphs to achieve better representational adaptability while maintaining computational efficiency through subgraph decomposition and node sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for image super-resolution suffer from structural inflexibility (CNNs/attention) or computational complexity (graph-based methods), creating a need for approaches that balance representational power with efficiency.

Method: Proposes Heterogeneous Subgraph Network (HSNet) with three key components: Constructive Subgraph Set Block (CSSB) generates diverse complementary subgraphs, Subgraph Aggregation Block (SAB) integrates multi-graph features, and Node Sampling Strategy (NSS) selectively retains salient features to reduce computation.

Result: Extensive experiments show HSNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively balancing reconstruction quality with computational efficiency.

Conclusion: HSNet successfully overcomes limitations of existing methods by leveraging graph modeling through manageable sub-components, achieving both high-quality reconstruction and computational feasibility.

Abstract: Existing deep learning approaches for image super-resolution, particularly
those based on CNNs and attention mechanisms, often suffer from structural
inflexibility. Although graph-based methods offer greater representational
adaptability, they are frequently impeded by excessive computational
complexity. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes the
Heterogeneous Subgraph Network (HSNet), a novel framework that efficiently
leverages graph modeling while maintaining computational feasibility. The core
idea of HSNet is to decompose the global graph into manageable sub-components.
First, we introduce the Constructive Subgraph Set Block (CSSB), which generates
a diverse set of complementary subgraphs. Rather than relying on a single
monolithic graph, CSSB captures heterogeneous characteristics of the image by
modeling different relational patterns and feature interactions, producing a
rich ensemble of both local and global graph structures. Subsequently, the
Subgraph Aggregation Block (SAB) integrates the representations embedded across
these subgraphs. Through adaptive weighting and fusion of multi-graph features,
SAB constructs a comprehensive and discriminative representation that captures
intricate interdependencies. Furthermore, a Node Sampling Strategy (NSS) is
designed to selectively retain the most salient features, thereby enhancing
accuracy while reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that HSNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively
balancing reconstruction quality with computational efficiency. The code will
be made publicly available.

Result: Performance saturates after ~12 annotated scans, geometric features contribute most, compact nine-channel feature stacks capture nearly all discriminative power with mIoU plateauing at 0.76, and method generalizes to other datasets.

Conclusion: The pipeline enables scalable, high-quality TLS point cloud segmentation with reduced annotation effort, providing empirical guidance on data efficiency and feature importance for ecological monitoring applications.

Abstract: Accurate semantic segmentation of terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) point
clouds is limited by costly manual annotation. We propose a semi-automated,
uncertainty-aware pipeline that integrates spherical projection, feature
enrichment, ensemble learning, and targeted annotation to reduce labeling
effort, while sustaining high accuracy. Our approach projects 3D points to a 2D
spherical grid, enriches pixels with multi-source features, and trains an
ensemble of segmentation networks to produce pseudo-labels and uncertainty
maps, the latter guiding annotation of ambiguous regions. The 2D outputs are
back-projected to 3D, yielding densely annotated point clouds supported by a
three-tier visualization suite (2D feature maps, 3D colorized point clouds, and
compact virtual spheres) for rapid triage and reviewer guidance. Using this
pipeline, we build Mangrove3D, a semantic segmentation TLS dataset for mangrove
forests. We further evaluate data efficiency and feature importance to address
two key questions: (1) how much annotated data are needed and (2) which
features matter most. Results show that performance saturates after ~12
annotated scans, geometric features contribute the most, and compact
nine-channel stacks capture nearly all discriminative power, with the mean
Intersection over Union (mIoU) plateauing at around 0.76. Finally, we confirm
the generalization of our feature-enrichment strategy through cross-dataset
tests on ForestSemantic and Semantic3D.
  Our contributions include: (i) a robust, uncertainty-aware TLS annotation
pipeline with visualization tools; (ii) the Mangrove3D dataset; and (iii)
empirical guidance on data efficiency and feature importance, thus enabling
scalable, high-quality segmentation of TLS point clouds for ecological
monitoring and beyond. The dataset and processing scripts are publicly

### [30] [Improving Artifact Robustness for CT Deep Learning Models Without Labeled Artifact Images via Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06584)
*Justin Cheung,Samuel Savine,Calvin Nguyen,Lin Lu,Alhassan S. Yasin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Domain adaptation using DANN effectively maintains CT image classification accuracy when faced with new ring artifacts, without requiring labeled artifact data, achieving performance comparable to models trained with labeled artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models degrade when applied to CT images with new artifacts not seen during training. Labeling new artifact distributions is costly, so domain adaptation offers a more accessible alternative to maintain performance without expensive expert labeling.

Method: Simulated ring artifacts from detector gain error in sinogram space, evaluated domain adversarial neural networks (DANN) against baseline and augmentation approaches on OrganAMNIST abdominal CT dataset.

Result: Baseline models failed on ring artifact images, traditional augmentation provided no improvement. DANN maintained high classification accuracy using only unlabeled artifact data, achieving performance comparable to models trained with labeled artifacts, with unexpected generalization to uniform noise.

Conclusion: Domain adaptation can effectively address distribution shift in medical imaging without requiring expensive expert labeling of new artifact distributions, showing promise for clinical deployment where novel artifacts may emerge.

Abstract: Deep learning models which perform well on images from their training
distribution can degrade substantially when applied to new distributions. If a
CT scanner introduces a new artifact not present in the training labels, the
model may misclassify the images. Although modern CT scanners include design
features which mitigate these artifacts, unanticipated or difficult-to-mitigate
artifacts can still appear in practice. The direct solution of labeling images
from this new distribution can be costly. As a more accessible alternative,
this study evaluates domain adaptation as an approach for training models that
maintain classification performance despite new artifacts, even without
corresponding labels. We simulate ring artifacts from detector gain error in
sinogram space and evaluate domain adversarial neural networks (DANN) against
baseline and augmentation-based approaches on the OrganAMNIST abdominal CT
dataset. Our results demonstrate that baseline models trained only on clean
images fail to generalize to images with ring artifacts, and traditional
augmentation with other distortion types provides no improvement on unseen
artifact domains. In contrast, the DANN approach successfully maintains high
classification accuracy on ring artifact images using only unlabeled artifact
data during training, demonstrating the viability of domain adaptation for
artifact robustness. The domain-adapted model achieved classification
performance on ring artifact test data comparable to models explicitly trained
with labeled artifact images, while also showing unexpected generalization to
uniform noise. These findings provide empirical evidence that domain adaptation
can effectively address distribution shift in medical imaging without requiring
expensive expert labeling of new artifact distributions, suggesting promise for
deployment in clinical settings where novel artifacts may emerge.

*Ziyuan Huang,DanDan Zheng,Cheng Zou,Rui Liu,Xiaolong Wang,Kaixiang Ji,Weilong Chai,Jianxin Sun,Libin Wang,Yongjie Lv,Taozhi Huang,Jiajia Liu,Qingpei Guo,Ming Yang,Jingdong Chen,Jun Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MingTok introduces continuous visual tokenization to unify vision understanding and generation, addressing quantization errors in discrete methods through a three-stage architecture that reconciles competing requirements between discriminative and generative tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual tokenizers use discrete latent spaces with quantization errors that limit semantic expressiveness and degrade vision-language understanding capabilities. There's a need to reconcile the competing demands of understanding tasks (which need discriminative high-dimensional features) and generation tasks (which prefer compact low-level codes).

Method: MingTok uses a three-stage sequential architecture: low-level encoding, semantic expansion, and visual reconstruction. Built on this, Ming-UniVision unifies diverse vision-language tasks under a single autoregressive prediction paradigm by formulating both understanding and generation as next-token prediction in a shared continuous space.

Result: The unified continuous visual representation reconciles competing requirements between understanding and generation tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance across both domains. It supports multi-round, in-context tasks like iterative understanding, generation and editing.

Conclusion: Continuous visual tokenization successfully unifies visual understanding and generation, eliminating the need for task-specific representations. The findings facilitate unified visual tokenization in the continuous domain, with released inference code and model weights for community benefit.

Abstract: Visual tokenization remains a core challenge in unifying visual understanding
and generation within the autoregressive paradigm. Existing methods typically
employ tokenizers in discrete latent spaces to align with the tokens from large
language models, where the quantization errors can limit semantic
expressiveness and degrade the capability of vision-language understanding. To
address this, we introduce MingTok, a new family of visual tokenizers with a
continuous latent space, for unified autoregressive generation and
understanding. While understanding tasks favor discriminative high-dimensional
features, generation tasks prefer compact low-level codes. Thus, to reconcile
these competing demands, MingTok adopts a three-stage sequential architecture
involving low-level encoding, semantic expansion, and visual reconstruction.
Built on top of it, Ming-UniVision eliminates the need for task-specific visual
representations, and unifies diverse vision-language tasks under a single
autoregrsssive prediction paradigm. By formulating both understanding and
generation as next-token prediction in a shared continuous space, it seamlessly
supports multi-round, in-context tasks such as iterative understanding,
generation and editing. Empirically, we find that using a unified continuous
visual representation reconciles the competing requirements on the tokenizers
by the understanding and generation tasks, thereby leading to state-of-the-art
level performance across both domains. We hope our findings will facilitate
unified visual tokenization in the continuous domain. Inference code and model
weights are released to benefit community.

*Tianyue Xu,Yanlin Wu,Abhai K. Tripathi,Matthew M. Ippolito,Benjamin D. Haeffele*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes BeerLaNet, a trainable color normalization model based on physics of imaging process that extracts stain-invariant structural information to address domain shift in digital pathology analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Color variability in pathology images due to different staining protocols and imaging conditions reduces deep learning model performance when deployed on data from different domains. Existing color normalization methods have drawbacks like introducing artifacts or requiring template image selection.

Method: Derived via algorithmic unrolling of nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) model based on Beer-Lambert law physics. Extracts stain-invariant structural information that serves as input for downstream tasks like object detection and classification.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art stain normalization methods on publicly available pathology datasets and malaria blood smears for cross-domain object detection and classification tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed trainable color normalization model effectively addresses domain shift in digital pathology by extracting physics-based stain-invariant features, improving performance on cross-domain tasks.

Abstract: Deep learning advances have revolutionized automated digital pathology
analysis. However, differences in staining protocols and imaging conditions can
introduce significant color variability. In deep learning, such color
inconsistency often reduces performance when deploying models on data acquired
under different conditions from the training data, a challenge known as domain
shift. Many existing methods attempt to address this problem via color
normalization but suffer from several notable drawbacks such as introducing
artifacts or requiring careful choice of a template image for stain mapping. To
address these limitations, we propose a trainable color normalization model
that can be integrated with any backbone network for downstream tasks such as
object detection and classification. Based on the physics of the imaging
process per the Beer-Lambert law, our model architecture is derived via
algorithmic unrolling of a nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) model to
extract stain-invariant structural information from the original pathology
images, which serves as input for further processing. Experimentally, we
evaluate the method on publicly available pathology datasets and an internally
curated collection of malaria blood smears for cross-domain object detection
and classification, where our method outperforms many state-of-the-art stain
normalization methods. Our code is available at

TL;DR: SDQM is a new metric for evaluating synthetic dataset quality in object detection tasks without requiring model training, showing strong correlation with mAP scores and providing actionable insights for dataset improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of large-scale annotated datasets limits machine learning model performance. Synthetic data helps but lacks effective quality evaluation metrics, especially for resource-constrained object detection tasks.

Method: The paper introduces Synthetic Dataset Quality Metric (SDQM) that assesses synthetic data quality for object detection without needing model training to converge.

Result: SDQM demonstrated strong correlation with YOLOv11's mAP scores, outperforming previous metrics that showed only moderate or weak correlations. It provides actionable insights for dataset quality improvement.

Conclusion: SDQM sets a new standard for synthetic data evaluation, offering a scalable and efficient metric that minimizes costly iterative training while enabling better generation and selection of synthetic datasets.

Abstract: The performance of machine learning models depends heavily on training data.
The scarcity of large-scale, well-annotated datasets poses significant
challenges in creating robust models. To address this, synthetic data generated
through simulations and generative models has emerged as a promising solution,
enhancing dataset diversity and improving the performance, reliability, and
resilience of models. However, evaluating the quality of this generated data
requires an effective metric. This paper introduces the Synthetic Dataset
Quality Metric (SDQM) to assess data quality for object detection tasks without
requiring model training to converge. This metric enables more efficient
generation and selection of synthetic datasets, addressing a key challenge in
resource-constrained object detection tasks. In our experiments, SDQM
demonstrated a strong correlation with the mean Average Precision (mAP) scores
of YOLOv11, a leading object detection model, while previous metrics only
exhibited moderate or weak correlations. Additionally, it provides actionable
insights for improving dataset quality, minimizing the need for costly
iterative training. This scalable and efficient metric sets a new standard for
evaluating synthetic data. The code for SDQM is available at

*Jingran Xu,Yuanyuan Liu,Yanjie Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes UnrollINR, a zero-shot self-supervised MRI reconstruction framework that uses implicit neural representation as regularization prior, achieving superior performance at high acceleration rates without external training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI scan times are prolonged, limiting clinical use. Deep learning methods help but require fully sampled data which is difficult to obtain. Need for scan-specific reconstruction without external training data.

Method: Physics-guided unrolled iterative reconstruction architecture with Implicit Neural Representation (INR) as regularization prior. Combines deep unrolled structure with INR's implicit representation capability.

Result: Achieves superior reconstruction performance compared to supervised learning method, even at high acceleration rate of 10.

Conclusion: UnrollINR validates superiority of zero-shot self-supervised approach for MRI reconstruction, enhancing interpretability and performance without external data requirements.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a vital clinical diagnostic tool, yet its
widespread application is limited by prolonged scan times. Fast MRI
reconstruction techniques effectively reduce acquisition duration by
reconstructing high-fidelity MR images from undersampled k-space data. In
recent years, deep learning-based methods have demonstrated remarkable progress
in this field, with self-supervised and unsupervised learning approaches
proving particularly valuable in scenarios where fully sampled data are
difficult to obtain. This paper proposes a novel zero-shot self-supervised
reconstruction framework named UnrollINR, which enables scan-specific MRI
reconstruction without relying on external training data. The method adopts a
physics-guided unrolled iterative reconstruction architecture and introduces
Implicit Neural Representation (INR) as a regularization prior to effectively
constrain the solution space. By combining a deep unrolled structure with the
powerful implicit representation capability of INR, the model's
interpretability and reconstruction performance are enhanced. Experimental
results demonstrate that even at a high acceleration rate of 10, UnrollINR
achieves superior reconstruction performance compared to the supervised
learning method, validating the superiority of the proposed method.

*Zibo Su,Kun Wei,Jiahua Li,Xu Yang,Cheng Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MuEx is a framework for multilingual talking face synthesis that uses phonemes and visemes as universal intermediaries to bridge audio and video modalities, achieving lifelike facial animations across multiple languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TFS models perform well in English but poorly in non-English languages due to English-dominated training datasets and lack of cross-language generalization abilities.

Method: Proposes Phoneme-Guided Mixture-of-Experts (PG-MoE) architecture using phonemes and visemes as basic units, with Phoneme-Viseme Alignment Mechanism (PV-Align) for cross-modal synchronization.

Result: Achieves superior performance across all 12 languages in the MTFB benchmark and exhibits effective zero-shot generalization to unseen languages without additional training.

Conclusion: MuEx effectively addresses multilingual TFS challenges by using universal phoneme-viseme intermediaries and demonstrates strong cross-language generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Speech-driven talking face synthesis (TFS) focuses on generating lifelike
facial animations from audio input. Current TFS models perform well in English
but unsatisfactorily in non-English languages, producing wrong mouth shapes and
rigid facial expressions. The terrible performance is caused by the
English-dominated training datasets and the lack of cross-language
generalization abilities. Thus, we propose Multilingual Experts (MuEx), a novel
framework featuring a Phoneme-Guided Mixture-of-Experts (PG-MoE) architecture
that employs phonemes and visemes as universal intermediaries to bridge audio
and video modalities, achieving lifelike multilingual TFS. To alleviate the
influence of linguistic differences and dataset bias, we extract audio and
video features as phonemes and visemes respectively, which are the basic units
of speech sounds and mouth movements. To address audiovisual synchronization
issues, we introduce the Phoneme-Viseme Alignment Mechanism (PV-Align), which
establishes robust cross-modal correspondences between phonemes and visemes. In
addition, we build a Multilingual Talking Face Benchmark (MTFB) comprising 12
diverse languages with 95.04 hours of high-quality videos for training and
evaluating multilingual TFS performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MuEx achieves superior performance across all languages in MTFB and exhibits
effective zero-shot generalization to unseen languages without additional
training.

TL;DR: MSITrack is the largest multispectral single object tracking dataset with 300 videos, 129k+ frames, 55 object categories, and 300 natural scenes, addressing limitations of RGB-only tracking through enhanced spectral data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB-based trackers struggle with real-world challenges like occlusion, similar object interference, and complex backgrounds. Limited multispectral tracking datasets hinder development of more robust trackers that leverage spectral reflectance for better target discrimination.

Method: Created MSITrack dataset with meticulous manual labeling and multi-stage verification. Features challenging attributes (similar object interference, color/texture similarity), diverse natural scenes across 55 categories, and large scale with 300 videos containing 129k+ frames of multispectral imagery.

Result: Extensive evaluations show multispectral data in MSITrack significantly improves tracking performance over RGB-only baselines. The dataset demonstrates enhanced target discriminability and robustness to real-world tracking challenges.

Conclusion: MSITrack provides a comprehensive benchmark that advances multispectral tracking research, showing clear advantages of spectral data over RGB-only approaches and enabling future developments in robust visual object tracking.

Abstract: Visual object tracking in real-world scenarios presents numerous challenges
including occlusion, interference from similar objects and complex
backgrounds-all of which limit the effectiveness of RGB-based trackers.
Multispectral imagery, which captures pixel-level spectral reflectance,
enhances target discriminability. However, the availability of multispectral
tracking datasets remains limited. To bridge this gap, we introduce MSITrack,
the largest and most diverse multispectral single object tracking dataset to
date. MSITrack offers the following key features: (i) More Challenging
Attributes-including interference from similar objects and similarity in color
and texture between targets and backgrounds in natural scenarios, along with a
wide range of real-world tracking challenges; (ii) Richer and More Natural
Scenes-spanning 55 object categories and 300 distinct natural scenes, MSITrack
far exceeds the scope of existing benchmarks. Many of these scenes and
categories are introduced to the multispectral tracking domain for the first
time; (iii) Larger Scale-300 videos comprising over 129k frames of
multispectral imagery. To ensure annotation precision, each frame has undergone
meticulous processing, manual labeling and multi-stage verification. Extensive
evaluations using representative trackers demonstrate that the multispectral
data in MSITrack significantly improves performance over RGB-only baselines,
highlighting its potential to drive future advancements in the field. The

TL;DR: StaR-KVQA improves implicit-knowledge VQA by supervising structured reasoning traces (relation paths + explanations) to make MLLM reasoning transparent and verifiable, achieving significant accuracy gains without external knowledge sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs lack explicit reasoning supervision, produce inconsistent justifications, and generalize poorly in implicit-knowledge VQA tasks, requiring a method to make reasoning transparent and verifiable.

Method: Supervises structured reasoning traces (dual symbolic relation paths + path-grounded explanations), constructs trace-enriched dataset, and fine-tunes via structured self-distillation without external retrievers or knowledge bases.

Result: Achieves up to +11.3% higher answer accuracy on OK-VQA over strongest baseline while exhibiting robust cross-domain generalization and improved interpretability.

Conclusion: StaR-KVQA effectively improves both accuracy and interpretability in implicit-knowledge VQA by making MLLM reasoning transparent through structured reasoning traces.

Abstract: Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (KVQA) requires models to ground
entities in images and reason over factual knowledge. We study its
implicit-knowledge variant, IK-KVQA, where a multimodal large language model
(MLLM) is the sole knowledge source, without external retrieval. Yet, MLLMs
lack explicit reasoning supervision and produce inconsistent justifications,
and generalize poorly after standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT). We present
StaR-KVQA (Structured Reasoning Traces for IK-KVQA), which supervises
structured traces - dual symbolic relation paths plus path-grounded
natural-language explanations - so that reasoning becomes transparent and
verifiable. With one open-source MLLM, StaR-KVQA constructs and selects
path-grounded reasoning traces to form a trace-enriched dataset, then
fine-tunes via structured self-distillation to align generation with
supervision; no external retrievers, verifiers, or curated knowledge bases
(KBs) are used, traces are built offline, and inference is a single
autoregressive pass. Across benchmarks, StaR-KVQA improves both accuracy and
interpretability, achieving up to +11.3% higher answer accuracy on OK-VQA over
the strongest baseline while exhibiting robust cross-domain generalization.

TL;DR: AutoNAD is an automated neural architecture design framework for industrial surface defect detection that searches over convolutions, transformers, and MLPs to address intraclass difference and interclass similarity challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing manual methods for surface defect detection require extensive trial and error and struggle with intraclass difference and interclass similarity challenges effectively.

Method: Proposes AutoNAD framework that jointly searches over convolutions, transformers, and MLPs, introduces cross weight sharing strategy for efficient training, integrates searchable multi-level feature aggregation module, and incorporates latency-aware prior for efficient architectures.

Result: Validated on three industrial defect datasets and applied within a defect imaging and detection platform, showing effectiveness in addressing SDD challenges.

Conclusion: AutoNAD successfully automates neural architecture design for surface defect detection, addressing key challenges while reducing manual design costs and considering runtime efficiency for industrial deployment.

Abstract: Industrial surface defect detection (SDD) is critical for ensuring product
quality and manufacturing reliability. Due to the diverse shapes and sizes of
surface defects, SDD faces two main challenges: intraclass difference and
interclass similarity. Existing methods primarily utilize manually designed
models, which require extensive trial and error and often struggle to address
both challenges effectively. To overcome this, we propose AutoNAD, an automated
neural architecture design framework for SDD that jointly searches over
convolutions, transformers, and multi-layer perceptrons. This hybrid design
enables the model to capture both fine-grained local variations and long-range
semantic context, addressing the two key challenges while reducing the cost of
manual network design. To support efficient training of such a diverse search
space, AutoNAD introduces a cross weight sharing strategy, which accelerates
supernet convergence and improves subnet performance. Additionally, a
searchable multi-level feature aggregation module (MFAM) is integrated to
enhance multi-scale feature learning. Beyond detection accuracy, runtime
efficiency is essential for industrial deployment. To this end, AutoNAD
incorporates a latency-aware prior to guide the selection of efficient
architectures. The effectiveness of AutoNAD is validated on three industrial
defect datasets and further applied within a defect imaging and detection
platform. Code will be available at https://github.com/Yuxi104/AutoNAD.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the effectiveness of principled language modeling approaches for visual signals and aims to inspire rethinking of such methods beyond current trends.

Abstract: We introduce Heptapod, an image autoregressive model that adheres to the
foundational principles of language modeling. Heptapod employs \textbf{causal
attention}, \textbf{eliminates reliance on CFG}, and \textbf{eschews the trend
of semantic tokenizers}. Our key innovation is \textit{next 2D distribution
prediction}: a causal Transformer with reconstruction-focused visual tokenizer,
learns to predict the distribution over the entire 2D spatial grid of images at
each timestep. This learning objective unifies the sequential modeling of
autoregressive framework with the holistic self-supervised learning of masked
autoencoding, enabling the model to capture comprehensive image semantics via
generative training. On the ImageNet generation benchmark, Heptapod achieves an
FID of $2.70$, significantly outperforming previous causal autoregressive
approaches. We hope our work inspires a principled rethinking of language
modeling on visual signals and beyond.

TL;DR: DreamOmni2 addresses limitations in instruction-based image editing and subject-driven generation by proposing multimodal instruction-based editing and generation tasks that support both text/image instructions and handle concrete/abstract concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current instruction-based editing relies only on language which fails to capture specific details, while subject-driven generation is limited to concrete objects and overlooks abstract concepts, making both approaches insufficient for practical user needs.

Method: Proposes a data synthesis pipeline with feature mixing for concept extraction, generates multimodal instruction-based editing data using editing/extraction models, and uses index encoding with position encoding shift to handle multi-image input and avoid pixel confusion. Also employs joint training with VLM.

Result: DreamOmni2 has achieved impressive results in multimodal instruction-based editing and generation tasks, successfully handling both concrete and abstract concepts with text and image instructions.

Conclusion: The proposed multimodal instruction-based editing and generation framework with comprehensive benchmarks effectively addresses the limitations of existing approaches and enhances practical applications in image editing and generation.

Abstract: Recent advancements in instruction-based image editing and subject-driven
generation have garnered significant attention, yet both tasks still face
limitations in meeting practical user needs. Instruction-based editing relies
solely on language instructions, which often fail to capture specific editing
details, making reference images necessary. Meanwhile, subject-driven
generation is limited to combining concrete objects or people, overlooking
broader, abstract concepts. To address these challenges, we propose two novel
tasks: multimodal instruction-based editing and generation. These tasks support
both text and image instructions and extend the scope to include both concrete
and abstract concepts, greatly enhancing their practical applications. We
introduce DreamOmni2, tackling two primary challenges: data creation and model
framework design. Our data synthesis pipeline consists of three steps: (1)
using a feature mixing method to create extraction data for both abstract and
concrete concepts, (2) generating multimodal instruction-based editing training
data using the editing and extraction models, and (3) further applying the
extraction model to create training data for multimodal instruction-based
editing. For the framework, to handle multi-image input, we propose an index
encoding and position encoding shift scheme, which helps the model distinguish
images and avoid pixel confusion. Additionally, we introduce joint training
with the VLM and our generation/editing model to better process complex
instructions. In addition, we have proposed comprehensive benchmarks for these
two new tasks to drive their development. Experiments show that DreamOmni2 has
achieved impressive results. Models and codes will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multimodal semantic segmentation method that fuses light field and LiDAR point cloud data using feature completion and depth perception modules to improve segmentation accuracy, especially for occluded objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic segmentation faces challenges under complex conditions like occlusion. Light field and LiDAR provide complementary visual and spatial cues but their integration is hindered by limited viewpoint diversity and modality discrepancies.

Method: Proposed Mlpfseg network with feature completion module (differential reconstruction of point-cloud feature maps to address density mismatch) and depth perception module (reinforcing attention scores for better occlusion awareness).

Result: Outperforms image-only segmentation by 1.71 mIoU and point cloud-only segmentation by 2.38 mIoU, demonstrating effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed multimodal fusion approach successfully integrates light field and point cloud data to achieve improved semantic segmentation performance, particularly for handling occlusions.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation serves as a cornerstone of scene understanding in
autonomous driving but continues to face significant challenges under complex
conditions such as occlusion. Light field and LiDAR modalities provide
complementary visual and spatial cues that are beneficial for robust
perception; however, their effective integration is hindered by limited
viewpoint diversity and inherent modality discrepancies. To address these
challenges, the first multimodal semantic segmentation dataset integrating
light field data and point cloud data is proposed. Based on this dataset, we
proposed a multi-modal light field point-cloud fusion segmentation
network(Mlpfseg), incorporating feature completion and depth perception to
segment both camera images and LiDAR point clouds simultaneously. The feature
completion module addresses the density mismatch between point clouds and image
pixels by performing differential reconstruction of point-cloud feature maps,
enhancing the fusion of these modalities. The depth perception module improves
the segmentation of occluded objects by reinforcing attention scores for better
occlusion awareness. Our method outperforms image-only segmentation by 1.71
Mean Intersection over Union(mIoU) and point cloud-only segmentation by 2.38
mIoU, demonstrating its effectiveness.

*Jipeng Lyu,Jiahua Dong,Yu-Xiong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCas4D is a cascaded optimization framework for dynamic scene modeling that uses hierarchical deformation patterns in 3D Gaussian Splatting to achieve efficient tracking and novel-view synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Persistent dynamic scene modeling faces challenges in capturing accurate deformations while maintaining computational efficiency, as existing methods struggle with the trade-off between deformation accuracy and training speed.

Method: The framework leverages structural patterns in 3D Gaussian Splatting, using a cascaded optimization approach that progressively refines deformations from coarse part-level to fine point-level transformations.

Result: SCas4D achieves convergence within 100 iterations per time frame, producing results comparable to existing methods with only one-twentieth of the training iterations. It also demonstrates effectiveness in self-supervised articulated object segmentation, novel view synthesis, and dense point tracking.

Conclusion: The hierarchical deformation modeling approach enables efficient and accurate dynamic scene representation, significantly reducing computational requirements while maintaining high-quality results across multiple tasks.

Abstract: Persistent dynamic scene modeling for tracking and novel-view synthesis
remains challenging due to the difficulty of capturing accurate deformations
while maintaining computational efficiency. We propose SCas4D, a cascaded
optimization framework that leverages structural patterns in 3D Gaussian
Splatting for dynamic scenes. The key idea is that real-world deformations
often exhibit hierarchical patterns, where groups of Gaussians share similar
transformations. By progressively refining deformations from coarse part-level
to fine point-level, SCas4D achieves convergence within 100 iterations per time
frame and produces results comparable to existing methods with only
one-twentieth of the training iterations. The approach also demonstrates
effectiveness in self-supervised articulated object segmentation, novel view
synthesis, and dense point tracking tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents an evaluation framework for LLM-based OCR in historical document digitization, addressing temporal biases and introducing novel metrics like HCPR and AIR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Digital humanities scholars lack appropriate evaluation frameworks for LLM-based OCR, as traditional metrics fail to capture temporal biases and period-specific errors crucial for historical corpus creation.

Method: The authors developed an evaluation methodology using 18th-century Russian Civil font texts, introducing metrics including Historical Character Preservation Rate (HCPR) and Archaic Insertion Rate (AIR), along with protocols for contamination control and stability testing. They evaluated 12 multimodal LLMs.

Result: Gemini and Qwen models outperformed traditional OCR but exhibited over-historicization by inserting archaic characters from incorrect historical periods. Post-OCR correction was found to degrade rather than improve performance.

Conclusion: The methodology provides digital humanities practitioners with guidelines for model selection and quality assessment in historical corpus digitization, addressing contamination risks and systematic biases.

Abstract: Digital humanities scholars increasingly use Large Language Models for
historical document digitization, yet lack appropriate evaluation frameworks
for LLM-based OCR. Traditional metrics fail to capture temporal biases and
period-specific errors crucial for historical corpus creation. We present an

risks and systematic biases in diplomatic transcription. Using 18th-century
Russian Civil font texts, we introduce novel metrics including Historical
Character Preservation Rate (HCPR) and Archaic Insertion Rate (AIR), alongside
protocols for contamination control and stability testing. We evaluate 12
multimodal LLMs, finding that Gemini and Qwen models outperform traditional OCR
while exhibiting over-historicization: inserting archaic characters from
incorrect historical periods. Post-OCR correction degrades rather than improves
performance. Our methodology provides digital humanities practitioners with
guidelines for model selection and quality assessment in historical corpus

*Zhiliang Zhu,Tao Zeng,Tao Yang,Guoliang Luo,Jiyong Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeRainMamba integrates frequency-aware state-space modeling and multi-directional convolution to improve image deraining by better distinguishing rain streaks from image details while preserving local structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Mamba-based models have limited ability to capture fine-grained details and lack frequency-domain awareness, restricting further improvements in image deraining performance.

Method: Proposes DeRainMamba with two key components: Frequency-Aware State-Space Module (FASSM) that uses Fourier transform to distinguish rain streaks from high-frequency details, and Multi-Directional Perception Convolution (MDPConv) that captures anisotropic gradient features and fuses multiple convolution branches.

Result: Extensive experiments on four public benchmarks show DeRainMamba consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in PSNR and SSIM metrics, while requiring fewer parameters and lower computational costs.

Conclusion: Combining frequency-domain modeling and spatial detail enhancement within a state-space framework is effective for single image deraining, achieving better performance with improved efficiency.

Abstract: Image deraining is crucial for improving visual quality and supporting
reliable downstream vision tasks. Although Mamba-based models provide efficient
sequence modeling, their limited ability to capture fine-grained details and
lack of frequency-domain awareness restrict further improvements. To address
these issues, we propose DeRainMamba, which integrates a Frequency-Aware
State-Space Module (FASSM) and Multi-Directional Perception Convolution
(MDPConv). FASSM leverages Fourier transform to distinguish rain streaks from
high-frequency image details, balancing rain removal and detail preservation.
MDPConv further restores local structures by capturing anisotropic gradient
features and efficiently fusing multiple convolution branches. Extensive
experiments on four public benchmarks demonstrate that DeRainMamba consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in PSNR and SSIM, while requiring fewer
parameters and lower computational costs. These results validate the
effectiveness of combining frequency-domain modeling and spatial detail
enhancement within a state-space framework for single image deraining.

*Junhan Zhu,Hesong Wang,Mingluo Su,Zefang Wang,Huan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OBS-Diff is a one-shot pruning framework that compresses large text-to-image diffusion models without training, using adapted Optimal Brain Surgeon with timestep-aware Hessian and group-wise pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale text-to-image diffusion models have prohibitive computational costs, and existing one-shot pruning methods cannot handle their iterative denoising nature.

Method: Revitalizes Optimal Brain Surgeon for diffusion model architectures, uses timestep-aware Hessian with logarithmic weighting for earlier timesteps, and implements group-wise sequential pruning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art one-shot pruning with inference acceleration and minimal visual quality degradation across various sparsity patterns.

Conclusion: OBS-Diff effectively bridges the gap for pruning diffusion models, providing accurate training-free compression while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Large-scale text-to-image diffusion models, while powerful, suffer from
prohibitive computational cost. Existing one-shot network pruning methods can
hardly be directly applied to them due to the iterative denoising nature of
diffusion models. To bridge the gap, this paper presents OBS-Diff, a novel
one-shot pruning framework that enables accurate and training-free compression
of large-scale text-to-image diffusion models. Specifically, (i) OBS-Diff
revitalizes the classic Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS), adapting it to the complex
architectures of modern diffusion models and supporting diverse pruning
granularity, including unstructured, N:M semi-structured, and structured (MHA
heads and FFN neurons) sparsity; (ii) To align the pruning criteria with the
iterative dynamics of the diffusion process, by examining the problem from an
error-accumulation perspective, we propose a novel timestep-aware Hessian
construction that incorporates a logarithmic-decrease weighting scheme,
assigning greater importance to earlier timesteps to mitigate potential error
accumulation; (iii) Furthermore, a computationally efficient group-wise
sequential pruning strategy is proposed to amortize the expensive calibration
process. Extensive experiments show that OBS-Diff achieves state-of-the-art
one-shot pruning for diffusion models, delivering inference acceleration with
minimal degradation in visual quality.

### [47] [Transforming Noise Distributions with Histogram Matching: Towards a Single Denoiser for All](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06757)
*Sheng Fu,Junchao Zhang,Kailun Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A histogram matching approach transforms arbitrary noise towards Gaussian distribution, enabling a single Gaussian denoiser to handle various out-of-distribution noises through a mutually reinforcing cycle between noise transformation and denoising.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised Gaussian denoisers have limited generalization to out-of-distribution noise due to diverse noise distribution characteristics.

Method: Histogram matching transforms arbitrary noise to target Gaussian distribution, establishing a mutually reinforcing cycle between noise transformation and denoising. Specific techniques include local histogram matching for signal-dependent noise, intrapatch permutation for channel-related noise, and frequency-domain histogram matching with pixel-shuffle down-sampling for spatial correlation.

Result: The method enables a single Gaussian denoiser to handle various out-of-distribution noises including Poisson, salt-and-pepper, repeating pattern noises, and complex real-world noises.

Conclusion: Extensive experiments demonstrate superior generalization and effectiveness of the proposed histogram matching approach for noise transformation and denoising.

Abstract: Supervised Gaussian denoisers exhibit limited generalization when confronted
with out-of-distribution noise, due to the diverse distributional
characteristics of different noise types. To bridge this gap, we propose a
histogram matching approach that transforms arbitrary noise towards a target
Gaussian distribution with known intensity. Moreover, a mutually reinforcing
cycle is established between noise transformation and subsequent denoising.
This cycle progressively refines the noise to be converted, making it
approximate the real noise, thereby enhancing the noise transformation effect
and further improving the denoising performance. We tackle specific noise
complexities: local histogram matching handles signal-dependent noise,
intrapatch permutation processes channel-related noise, and frequency-domain
histogram matching coupled with pixel-shuffle down-sampling breaks spatial
correlation. By applying these transformations, a single Gaussian denoiser
gains remarkable capability to handle various out-of-distribution noises,
including synthetic noises such as Poisson, salt-and-pepper and repeating
pattern noises, as well as complex real-world noises. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superior generalization and effectiveness of our method.

### [48] [A deep multiple instance learning approach based on coarse labels for high-resolution land-cover mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06769)
*Gianmarco Perantoni,Lorenzo Bruzzone*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a Deep Multiple Instance Learning method for training high-resolution land-cover classifiers using weak low-resolution reference data, addressing label quantity and quality issues in remote sensing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the central problems of training label quantity and quality in high-resolution land-cover mapping, where weak labels can be gathered in large quantities from existing low-resolution products.

Method: Uses flexible pooling layers to link high-resolution pixel semantics to low-resolution labels, reframing MIL in multi-class and multi-label settings with Positive-Unlabeled Learning for multi-label cases.

Result: Experimental results on the 2020 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework compared to standard training strategies.

Conclusion: The proposed DMIL-based framework successfully trains pixel-level classifiers using weak low-resolution data, providing an effective solution for land-cover mapping when high-resolution labels are unavailable.

Abstract: The quantity and the quality of the training labels are central problems in
high-resolution land-cover mapping with machine-learning-based solutions. In
this context, weak labels can be gathered in large quantities by leveraging on
existing low-resolution or obsolete products. In this paper, we address the
problem of training land-cover classifiers using high-resolution imagery (e.g.,
Sentinel-2) and weak low-resolution reference data (e.g., MODIS -derived
land-cover maps). Inspired by recent works in Deep Multiple Instance Learning
(DMIL), we propose a method that trains pixel-level multi-class classifiers and
predicts low-resolution labels (i.e., patch-level classification), where the
actual high-resolution labels are learned implicitly without direct
supervision. This is achieved with flexible pooling layers that are able to
link the semantics of the pixels in the high-resolution imagery to the
low-resolution reference labels. Then, the Multiple Instance Learning (MIL)
problem is re-framed in a multi-class and in a multi-label setting. In the
former, the low-resolution annotation represents the majority of the pixels in
the patch. In the latter, the annotation only provides us information on the
presence of one of the land-cover classes in the patch and thus multiple labels
can be considered valid for a patch at a time, whereas the low-resolution
labels provide us only one label. Therefore, the classifier is trained with a
Positive-Unlabeled Learning (PUL) strategy. Experimental results on the 2020
IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest dataset show the effectiveness of the proposed
framework compared to standard training strategies.

*Akshit Singh,Shyam Marjit,Wei Lin,Paul Gavrikov,Serena Yeung-Levy,Hilde Kuehne,Rogerio Feris,Sivan Doveh,James Glass,M. Jehanzeb Mirza*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TTRV is a test-time reinforcement learning method that enhances vision language models by adapting them at inference time without labeled data, using output frequency and entropy-based rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reward extraction methods in RL require labeled data and training splits, which contrasts with how humans learn directly from their environment. The goal is to enable models to adapt during inference without labeled data.

Method: Enhances Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) by designing rewards based on base model output frequency and controlling output diversity through entropy minimization. Adapts models on-the-fly during inference by running multiple inferences per test sample.

Result: Achieved consistent gains: up to 52.4% improvement in object recognition and 29.8% in VQA, with average boosts of 24.6% and 10.0% across 16 datasets. On image recognition, TTRV with InternVL 8B surpassed GPT-4o by 2.3% average over 8 benchmarks.

Conclusion: Test-time reinforcement learning can match or exceed proprietary models, and even in extremely data-constrained scenarios (single unlabeled test example), TTRV yields non-trivial improvements of up to 5.5% in recognition tasks.

Abstract: Existing methods for extracting reward signals in Reinforcement Learning
typically rely on labeled data and dedicated training splits, a setup that
contrasts with how humans learn directly from their environment. In this work,
we propose TTRV to enhance vision language understanding by adapting the model
on the fly at inference time, without the need for any labeled data.
Concretely, we enhance the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework
by designing rewards based on the frequency of the base model's output, while
inferring on each test sample multiple times. Further, we also propose to
control the diversity of the model's output by simultaneously rewarding the
model for obtaining low entropy of the output empirical distribution. Our
approach delivers consistent gains across both object recognition and visual
question answering (VQA), with improvements of up to 52.4% and 29.8%,
respectively, and average boosts of 24.6% and 10.0% across 16
datasets.Remarkably, on image recognition, TTRV applied to InternVL 8B
surpasses GPT-4o by an average of 2.3% over 8 benchmarks, while remaining
highly competitive on VQA, demonstrating that test-time reinforcement learning
can match or exceed the strongest proprietary models. Finally, we find many
interesting properties of test-time RL for VLMs: for example, even in extremely
data-constrained scenarios, where adaptation is performed on a single randomly
chosen unlabeled test example, TTRV still yields non-trivial improvements of up
to 5.5% in recognition tasks.

*Changlin Song,Yunzhong Hou,Michael Randall Barnes,Rahul Shome,Dylan Campbell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a heatmap-based extreme amodal face detector that uses contextual cues from single images to predict unseen faces outside the frame, achieving strong performance with an efficient coarse-to-fine approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing safety and privacy applications by detecting faces that are not visible in the input image but exist in an expanded field-of-view, moving beyond traditional amodal detection where objects are partially visible.

Method: A heatmap-based extreme amodal object detector with selective coarse-to-fine decoder that efficiently predicts out-of-frame regions using contextual cues from single images, avoiding reliance on image sequences or generative models.

Result: The method establishes strong results for extreme amodal detection, even outperforming less efficient generative approaches while being sample-free and more efficient.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses the challenge of predicting unseen objects from limited visible information using contextual reasoning, providing an efficient solution for extreme amodal detection tasks.

Abstract: Extreme amodal detection is the task of inferring the 2D location of objects
that are not fully visible in the input image but are visible within an
expanded field-of-view. This differs from amodal detection, where the object is
partially visible within the input image, but is occluded. In this paper, we
consider the sub-problem of face detection, since this class provides
motivating applications involving safety and privacy, but do not tailor our
method specifically to this class. Existing approaches rely on image sequences
so that missing detections may be interpolated from surrounding frames or make
use of generative models to sample possible completions. In contrast, we
consider the single-image task and propose a more efficient, sample-free
approach that makes use of the contextual cues from the image to infer the
presence of unseen faces. We design a heatmap-based extreme amodal object
detector that addresses the problem of efficiently predicting a lot (the
out-of-frame region) from a little (the image) with a selective coarse-to-fine
decoder. Our method establishes strong results for this new task, even
outperforming less efficient generative approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper adapts ultrasound foundation models for real-time probe guidance to help junior sonographers acquire high-quality cardiac ultrasound images, using a parameter-efficient Vision-Action Adapter that enables sequential reasoning with minimal fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a shortage of skilled cardiac ultrasound operators, making it difficult for patients to receive timely examinations. High-quality images are essential for accurate diagnosis, but obtaining them requires significant expertise.

Method: Proposes a Vision-Action Adapter (VA-Adapter) that enables foundation models to encode vision-action sequences, allowing pre-trained ultrasound foundation models to learn probe adjustment strategies by fine-tuning only a small subset of parameters.

Result: Extensive experiments show that the VA-Adapter outperforms strong probe guidance models, demonstrating effective real-time operational recommendations for acquiring high-quality ultrasound images.

Conclusion: The VA-Adapter successfully adapts medical knowledge from foundation models to probe guidance tasks, providing an efficient solution to address the shortage of skilled ultrasound operators while maintaining high performance.

Abstract: Echocardiography is a critical tool for detecting heart diseases. Recently,
ultrasound foundation models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
cardiac ultrasound image analysis. However, obtaining high-quality ultrasound
images is a prerequisite for accurate diagnosis. Due to the exceptionally high
operational difficulty of cardiac ultrasound, there is a shortage of highly
skilled personnel, which hinders patients from receiving timely examination
services. In this paper, we aim to adapt the medical knowledge learned by
foundation models from vast datasets to the probe guidance task, which is
designed to provide real-time operational recommendations for junior
sonographers to acquire high-quality ultrasound images. Moreover, inspired by
the practice where experts optimize action decisions based on past
explorations, we meticulously design a parameter-efficient Vision-Action
Adapter (VA-Adapter) to enable foundation model's image encoder to encode
vision-action sequences, thereby enhancing guidance performance. With built-in
sequential reasoning capabilities in a compact design, the VA-Adapter enables a
pre-trained ultrasound foundation model to learn precise probe adjustment
strategies by fine-tuning only a small subset of parameters. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the VA-Adapter can surpass strong probe guidance
models. Our code will be released after acceptance.

*Mitchell Keren Taraday,Shahaf Wagner,Chaim Baskin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EDJE is an efficient vision-language reranker that precomputes and compresses visual tokens offline, enabling fast joint encoding with minimal online computation while maintaining strong retrieval performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language joint encoders like BLIP are bottlenecked by expensive visual feature extraction, preventing practical deployment at scale for multimodal retrieval.

Method: Precomputes vision tokens offline and compresses them via lightweight attention-based adapter; online inference uses compact joint encoder over small set of visual tokens plus text.

Result: Processes 50k image-text pairs/second with 49kB storage per image, matching state-of-the-art performance on Flickr (zero-shot) and COCO (fine-tuned) retrieval.

Conclusion: EDJE enables efficient high-throughput multimodal retrieval while preserving strong performance, addressing the scalability limitations of previous joint encoders.

Abstract: Multimodal retrieval still leans on embedding-based models like CLIP for fast
vector search over pre-computed image embeddings. Yet, unlike text retrieval,
where joint-encoder rerankers are standard, comparable vision--language
rerankers are largely absent. We find that seminal joint encoders such as BLIP
are severely bottlenecked by an expensive visual feature-extraction stage,
preventing practical deployment at scale. Motivated by this bottleneck, we
introduce EDJE, an Efficient Discriminative Joint Encoder that precomputes
vision tokens offline and compresses them via a lightweight attention-based
adapter, so online inference runs only a compact joint encoder over a small set
of visual tokens plus the text. EDJE preserves strong retrieval performance
while drastically reducing storage and online compute, enabling high-throughput
inference. Specifically, EDJE processes 50k image--text pairs/second while
requiring 49kB of disk storage per image, matching prior art on Flickr
(zero-shot) and COCO (fine-tuned) retrieval. The implementation and checkpoints
will be made publicly available shortly.

*Jaeseok Jeong,Junho Kim,Gayoung Lee,Yunjey Choi,Youngjung Uh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes StyleKeeper, a method to reduce content leakage in visual prompting for text-to-image generation by extending classifier-free guidance with swapping self-attention and introducing negative visual query guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual prompting methods in text-to-image generation suffer from content leakage, where undesired elements from visual style prompts are transferred along with the intended style, limiting precise control over generated content.

Method: 1) Extend classifier-free guidance (CFG) using swapping self-attention, and 2) Propose negative visual query guidance (NVQG) that employs negative scores by simulating content leakage scenarios through query swapping in self-attention layers.

Result: The method significantly reduces content leakage and demonstrates superiority over existing approaches across various styles and text prompts, effectively reflecting reference styles while ensuring generated images match text prompts.

Conclusion: StyleKeeper provides an effective solution to content leakage in visual prompting through simple yet powerful techniques, enabling more precise style transfer in text-to-image generation while maintaining content fidelity.

Abstract: In the domain of text-to-image generation, diffusion models have emerged as
powerful tools. Recently, studies on visual prompting, where images are used as
prompts, have enabled more precise control over style and content. However,
existing methods often suffer from content leakage, where undesired elements of
the visual style prompt are transferred along with the intended style. To
address this issue, we 1) extend classifier-free guidance (CFG) to utilize
swapping self-attention and propose 2) negative visual query guidance (NVQG) to
reduce the transfer of unwanted contents. NVQG employs negative score by
intentionally simulating content leakage scenarios that swap queries instead of
key and values of self-attention layers from visual style prompts. This simple
yet effective method significantly reduces content leakage. Furthermore, we
provide careful solutions for using a real image as visual style prompts.
Through extensive evaluation across various styles and text prompts, our method
demonstrates superiority over existing approaches, reflecting the style of the
references, and ensuring that resulting images match the text prompts. Our code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Real-time line segment detection and tracking using only a high-resolution event-based camera with a lattice-allocated pipeline that achieves higher accuracy than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event-based cameras can efficiently extract geometric features from human-made environments by responding to contrast changes, but current methods either rely on additional frame cameras or struggle with high event rates.

Method: A three-step pipeline: (i) velocity-invariant event representation, (ii) line segment detection using fitting scores, and (iii) line segment tracking through endpoint perturbation.

Result: Demonstrates real-time performance and higher accuracy compared to state-of-the-art event-only and event-frame hybrid baselines on both custom and public datasets.

Conclusion: Enables fully stand-alone event camera operation in real-world settings without requiring additional frame cameras.

Abstract: Line segment extraction is effective for capturing geometric features of
human-made environments. Event-based cameras, which asynchronously respond to
contrast changes along edges, enable efficient extraction by reducing redundant
data. However, recent methods often rely on additional frame cameras or
struggle with high event rates. This research addresses real-time line segment
detection and tracking using only a modern, high-resolution (i.e., high event
rate) event-based camera. Our lattice-allocated pipeline consists of (i)
velocity-invariant event representation, (ii) line segment detection based on a
fitting score, (iii) and line segment tracking by perturbating endpoints.
Evaluation using ad-hoc recorded dataset and public datasets demonstrates
real-time performance and higher accuracy compared to state-of-the-art
event-only and event-frame hybrid baselines, enabling fully stand-alone event
camera operation in real-world settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Continual AQA (CAQA) to handle evolving quality distributions in action assessment, proposes MAGR++ method to address catastrophic forgetting through adaptive manifold-aligned graph regularization, and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on new benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Action Quality Assessment faces challenges with non-stationary quality distributions in real-world scenarios, limiting generalization. Continual Learning is needed to handle evolving distributions while preventing catastrophic forgetting.

Method: Proposes MAGR++ with full-parameter fine-tuning for representation learning, coupled with manifold projector to translate historical features and graph regularizer to align distributions. Stabilizes shallow layers while adapting deeper ones.

Result: MAGR++ achieves state-of-the-art performance with average correlation gains of 3.6% offline and 12.2% online over strongest baselines on four CAQA benchmarks constructed from three datasets.

Conclusion: MAGR++ effectively addresses catastrophic forgetting in Continual AQA through adaptive manifold-aligned graph regularization, demonstrating robust performance and confirming the necessity of full-parameter fine-tuning with controlled feature stabilization.

Abstract: Action Quality Assessment (AQA) quantifies human actions in videos,
supporting applications in sports scoring, rehabilitation, and skill
evaluation. A major challenge lies in the non-stationary nature of quality
distributions in real-world scenarios, which limits the generalization ability
of conventional methods. We introduce Continual AQA (CAQA), which equips AQA
with Continual Learning (CL) capabilities to handle evolving distributions
while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Although parameter-efficient
fine-tuning of pretrained models has shown promise in CL for image
classification, we find it insufficient for CAQA. Our empirical and theoretical
analyses reveal two insights: (i) Full-Parameter Fine-Tuning (FPFT) is
necessary for effective representation learning; yet (ii) uncontrolled FPFT
induces overfitting and feature manifold shift, thereby aggravating forgetting.
To address this, we propose Adaptive Manifold-Aligned Graph Regularization
(MAGR++), which couples backbone fine-tuning that stabilizes shallow layers
while adapting deeper ones with a two-step feature rectification pipeline: a
manifold projector to translate deviated historical features into the current
representation space, and a graph regularizer to align local and global
distributions. We construct four CAQA benchmarks from three datasets with
tailored evaluation protocols and strong baselines, enabling systematic
cross-dataset comparison. Extensive experiments show that MAGR++ achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with average correlation gains of 3.6% offline
and 12.2% online over the strongest baseline, confirming its robustness and
effectiveness. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZhouKanglei/MAGRPP.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Online Generic Event Boundary Detection (On-GEBD), a real-time alternative to offline GEBD that processes streaming videos without future frame access, and proposes the Estimator framework inspired by human event segmentation theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GEBD methods require complete video processing, unlike humans who process data online and in real-time. This gap motivates the need for online event boundary detection that can operate on streaming videos without future frame access.

Method: Proposes the Estimator framework with two components: Consistent Event Anticipator (CEA) that predicts future frames based on prior frames, and Online Boundary Discriminator (OBD) that measures prediction errors and adaptively adjusts thresholds using statistical tests on past errors.

Result: Estimator outperforms all baselines adapted from recent online video understanding models and achieves performance comparable to prior offline-GEBD methods on Kinetics-GEBD and TAPOS datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed On-GEBD task and Estimator framework successfully bridge the gap between offline processing and human-like real-time event boundary detection, demonstrating competitive performance while operating in streaming video scenarios.

Abstract: Generic Event Boundary Detection (GEBD) aims to interpret long-form videos
through the lens of human perception. However, current GEBD methods require
processing complete video frames to make predictions, unlike humans processing
data online and in real-time. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new task,
Online Generic Event Boundary Detection (On-GEBD), aiming to detect boundaries
of generic events immediately in streaming videos. This task faces unique
challenges of identifying subtle, taxonomy-free event changes in real-time,
without the access to future frames. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
novel On-GEBD framework, Estimator, inspired by Event Segmentation Theory (EST)
which explains how humans segment ongoing activity into events by leveraging
the discrepancies between predicted and actual information. Our framework
consists of two key components: the Consistent Event Anticipator (CEA), and the
Online Boundary Discriminator (OBD). Specifically, the CEA generates a
prediction of the future frame reflecting current event dynamics based solely
on prior frames. Then, the OBD measures the prediction error and adaptively
adjusts the threshold using statistical tests on past errors to capture
diverse, subtle event transitions. Experimental results demonstrate that
Estimator outperforms all baselines adapted from recent online video
understanding models and achieves performance comparable to prior offline-GEBD
methods on the Kinetics-GEBD and TAPOS datasets.

*Adrien Dorise,Marjorie Bellizzi,Adrien Girard,Benjamin Francesconi,Stéphane May*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates using raw sensor data instead of preprocessed images for onboard satellite AI, finding that while performance is similar at low-medium confidence, raw data models struggle with precise object boundaries at high confidence levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With increasing satellite processing power, deploying AI models directly onboard is feasible, but current approaches mainly use preprocessed ground-based products rather than raw sensor data, creating a research gap.

Method: Developed a simulation workflow to generate raw-like products from high-resolution L1 imagery, then trained YOLOv11s and YOLOX-S models on both raw and L1 datasets and compared performance using detection metrics and explainability tools.

Result: Both models performed similarly at low to medium confidence thresholds, but the raw data-trained model struggled with object boundary identification at high confidence levels.

Conclusion: Adapting AI architectures with improved contouring methods can enhance object detection on raw images, improving onboard AI capabilities for remote sensing applications.

Abstract: With increasing processing power, deploying AI models for remote sensing
directly onboard satellites is becoming feasible. However, new constraints
arise, mainly when using raw, unprocessed sensor data instead of preprocessed
ground-based products. While current solutions primarily rely on preprocessed
sensor images, few approaches directly leverage raw data. This study
investigates the effects of utilising raw data on deep learning models for
object detection and classification tasks. We introduce a simulation workflow
to generate raw-like products from high-resolution L1 imagery, enabling
systemic evaluation. Two object detection models (YOLOv11s and YOLOX-S) are
trained on both raw and L1 datasets, and their performance is compared using
standard detection metrics and explainability tools. Results indicate that
while both models perform similarly at low to medium confidence thresholds, the
model trained on raw data struggles with object boundary identification at high
confidence levels. It suggests that adapting AI architectures with improved
contouring methods can enhance object detection on raw images, improving
onboard AI for remote sensing.

*Samir Abou Haidar,Alexandre Chariot,Mehdi Darouich,Cyril Joly,Jean-Emmanuel Deschaud*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HARP-NeXt is a high-speed LiDAR semantic segmentation network that achieves superior speed-accuracy trade-off through novel pre-processing, efficient feature extraction, and multi-scale fusion, running 24x faster than top methods without test-time augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between accuracy and speed in LiDAR semantic segmentation, where existing methods are either accurate but slow (point-based/sparse convolution) or fast but lose geometric information (projection-based), while also reducing computational overhead from pre-processing and avoiding test-time augmentation.

Method: Proposes novel pre-processing to reduce computational overhead, Conv-SE-NeXt feature extraction blocks for efficient representation capture without deep stacking, and multi-scale range-point fusion backbone to preserve geometric details at multiple abstraction levels.

Result: Achieves superior speed-accuracy trade-off on nuScenes and SemanticKITTI benchmarks, comparable to top-ranked PTv3 while running 24x faster, without relying on ensemble models or test-time augmentation.

Conclusion: HARP-NeXt successfully addresses the speed-accuracy trade-off in LiDAR semantic segmentation through efficient architecture design and pre-processing optimization, making it suitable for resource-constrained embedded systems in autonomous vehicles and mobile robots.

Abstract: LiDAR semantic segmentation is crucial for autonomous vehicles and mobile
robots, requiring high accuracy and real-time processing, especially on
resource-constrained embedded systems. Previous state-of-the-art methods often
face a trade-off between accuracy and speed. Point-based and sparse
convolution-based methods are accurate but slow due to the complexity of
neighbor searching and 3D convolutions. Projection-based methods are faster but
lose critical geometric information during the 2D projection. Additionally,
many recent methods rely on test-time augmentation (TTA) to improve
performance, which further slows the inference. Moreover, the pre-processing
phase across all methods increases execution time and is demanding on embedded
platforms. Therefore, we introduce HARP-NeXt, a high-speed and accurate LiDAR
semantic segmentation network. We first propose a novel pre-processing
methodology that significantly reduces computational overhead. Then, we design
the Conv-SE-NeXt feature extraction block to efficiently capture
representations without deep layer stacking per network stage. We also employ a
multi-scale range-point fusion backbone that leverages information at multiple
abstraction levels to preserve essential geometric details, thereby enhancing
accuracy. Experiments on the nuScenes and SemanticKITTI benchmarks show that
HARP-NeXt achieves a superior speed-accuracy trade-off compared to all
state-of-the-art methods, and, without relying on ensemble models or TTA, is
comparable to the top-ranked PTv3, while running 24$\times$ faster. The code is

### [60] [Label-frugal satellite image change detection with generative virtual exemplar learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06926)
*Hichem Sahbi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel active learning approach for change detection in remote sensing that selects the most critical unlabeled samples for labeling using an invertible graph convnet and adversarial loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing change detection methods rely heavily on hand-labeled training data, which is expensive and subjective. The goal is to reduce labeling effort while maintaining performance.

Method: Uses active learning with a new model that measures importance of unlabeled samples. Generates virtual exemplars using an invertible graph convnet optimized with adversarial loss considering representativity, diversity and ambiguity.

Result: Extensive experiments show positive impact of the label-efficient learning model compared to other methods.

Conclusion: The proposed active learning framework effectively reduces labeling requirements while improving change detection performance through strategic sample selection.

Abstract: Change detection is a major task in remote sensing which consists in finding
all the occurrences of changes in multi-temporal satellite or aerial images.
The success of existing methods, and particularly deep learning ones, is
tributary to the availability of hand-labeled training data that capture the
acquisition conditions and the subjectivity of the user (oracle). In this
paper, we devise a novel change detection algorithm, based on active learning.
The main contribution of our work resides in a new model that measures how
important is each unlabeled sample, and provides an oracle with only the most
critical samples (also referred to as virtual exemplars) for further labeling.
These exemplars are generated, using an invertible graph convnet, as the
optimum of an adversarial loss that (i) measures representativity, diversity
and ambiguity of the data, and thereby (ii) challenges (the most) the current
change detection criteria, leading to a better re-estimate of these criteria in
the subsequent iterations of active learning. Extensive experiments show the
positive impact of our label-efficient learning model against comparative
methods.

### [61] [IAR2: Improving Autoregressive Visual Generation with Semantic-Detail Associated Token Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06928)
*Ran Yi,Teng Hu,Zihan Su,Lizhuang Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IAR2 is an improved autoregressive image generation framework that uses a dual codebook for hierarchical semantic-detail synthesis, achieving state-of-the-art performance with FID 1.50 on ImageNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous autoregressive models like IAR had limitations with rigid pre-trained codebooks and inaccurate hard clustering, failing to capture the intrinsic structural properties of visual data effectively.

Method: Proposes Semantic-Detail Associated Dual Codebook that decouples image representations into semantic and detail components, along with hierarchical prediction scheme and adaptive CFG mechanism for conditional generation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art FID of 1.50 on ImageNet, surpassing previous methods while demonstrating superior computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The structured coarse-to-fine generation strategy with dual codebook representation significantly enhances expressiveness and generation quality in autoregressive models.

Abstract: Autoregressive models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for visual content
creation, but often overlook the intrinsic structural properties of visual
data. Our prior work, IAR, initiated a direction to address this by
reorganizing the visual codebook based on embedding similarity, thereby
improving generation robustness. However, it is constrained by the rigidity of
pre-trained codebooks and the inaccuracies of hard, uniform clustering. To
overcome these limitations, we propose IAR2, an advanced autoregressive
framework that enables a hierarchical semantic-detail synthesis process. At the
core of IAR2 is a novel Semantic-Detail Associated Dual Codebook, which
decouples image representations into a semantic codebook for global semantic
information and a detail codebook for fine-grained refinements. It expands the
quantization capacity from a linear to a polynomial scale, significantly
enhancing expressiveness. To accommodate this dual representation, we propose a
Semantic-Detail Autoregressive Prediction scheme coupled with a Local-Context
Enhanced Autoregressive Head, which performs hierarchical prediction-first the
semantic token, then the detail token-while leveraging a local context window
to enhance spatial coherence. Furthermore, for conditional generation, we
introduce a Progressive Attention-Guided Adaptive CFG mechanism that
dynamically modulates the guidance scale for each token based on its relevance
to the condition and its temporal position in the generation sequence,
improving conditional alignment without sacrificing realism. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that IAR2 sets a new state-of-the-art for
autoregressive image generation, achieving a FID of 1.50 on ImageNet. Our model
not only surpasses previous methods in performance but also demonstrates
superior computational efficiency, highlighting the effectiveness of our
structured, coarse-to-fine generation strategy.

*Bing Li,Wuqi Wang,Yanan Zhang,Jingzheng Li,Haigen Min,Wei Feng,Xingyu Zhao,Jie Zhang,Qing Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A text-to-3D adversarial generation method called Phy3DAdvGen that creates physically realizable 3D objects invisible to LiDAR detectors, addressing limitations of existing perturbation-based attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D adversarial attacks rarely cause complete object disappearance and are difficult to implement physically. There's a need for effective testing methods to expose LiDAR detector vulnerabilities before real-world deployment in autonomous driving.

Method: Phy3DAdvGen systematically optimizes text prompts by refining verbs, objects, and poses to generate LiDAR-invisible pedestrians. Uses a constrained object pool of 13 real 3D models to ensure physical realizability, and conducts empirical studies on detection vulnerability factors.

Result: The approach successfully generates 3D pedestrians that evade six state-of-the-art LiDAR 3D detectors in both CARLA simulation and physical environments.

Conclusion: The method effectively exposes vulnerabilities in safety-critical LiDAR detection systems and demonstrates the feasibility of physically realizable adversarial attacks.

Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D object detectors are fundamental to autonomous driving, where
failing to detect objects poses severe safety risks. Developing effective 3D
adversarial attacks is essential for thoroughly testing these detection systems
and exposing their vulnerabilities before real-world deployment. However,
existing adversarial attacks that add optimized perturbations to 3D points have
two critical limitations: they rarely cause complete object disappearance and
prove difficult to implement in physical environments. We introduce the
text-to-3D adversarial generation method, a novel approach enabling physically
realizable attacks that can generate 3D models of objects truly invisible to
LiDAR detectors and be easily realized in the real world. Specifically, we
present the first empirical study that systematically investigates the factors
influencing detection vulnerability by manipulating the topology, connectivity,
and intensity of individual pedestrian 3D models and combining pedestrians with
multiple objects within the CARLA simulation environment. Building on the
insights, we propose the physically-informed text-to-3D adversarial generation
(Phy3DAdvGen) that systematically optimizes text prompts by iteratively
refining verbs, objects, and poses to produce LiDAR-invisible pedestrians. To
ensure physical realizability, we construct a comprehensive object pool
containing 13 3D models of real objects and constrain Phy3DAdvGen to generate
3D objects based on combinations of objects in this set. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach can generate 3D pedestrians that evade six
state-of-the-art (SOTA) LiDAR 3D detectors in both CARLA simulation and
physical environments, thereby highlighting vulnerabilities in safety-critical
applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DirectGaussian is a novel text-to-3D method that generates 3D object surfaces using surfels representation with 2D Gaussian splatting and multi-view normal/texture priors, incorporating curvature constraints for geometric consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-3D methods face challenges with complex natural object geometries - either using 2D diffusion priors or training on specific 3D representations, which limits their effectiveness for diverse 3D content creation.

Method: Uses conditional text generation models to generate 3D object surfaces represented by surfels, rendered via 2D Gaussian splatting with multi-view normal and texture priors, and incorporates curvature constraints during optimization for geometric consistency.

Result: The framework achieves diverse and high-fidelity 3D content creation as demonstrated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: DirectGaussian provides an effective approach for text-to-3D generation that handles complex geometric shapes while maintaining multi-view consistency through novel surface representation and optimization techniques.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Text-to-3D modeling have shown significant potential
for the creation of 3D content. However, due to the complex geometric shapes of
objects in the natural world, generating 3D content remains a challenging task.
Current methods either leverage 2D diffusion priors to recover 3D geometry, or
train the model directly based on specific 3D representations. In this paper,
we propose a novel method named DirectGaussian, which focuses on generating the
surfaces of 3D objects represented by surfels. In DirectGaussian, we utilize
conditional text generation models and the surface of a 3D object is rendered
by 2D Gaussian splatting with multi-view normal and texture priors. For
multi-view geometric consistency problems, DirectGaussian incorporates
curvature constraints on the generated surface during optimization process.
Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework is capable of
achieving diverse and high-fidelity 3D content creation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MapGR is a novel architecture for HD map construction that learns global representations from queries through two modules: Global Representation Learning and Global Representation Guidance, achieving improved performance on autonomous driving datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DETR-based approaches for HD map construction rely on independent object queries with local perspectives, neglecting the inherent global representation within HD maps that is crucial for autonomous driving systems.

Method: Proposes MapGR with two modules: 1) Global Representation Learning module that aligns query distribution with global map through holistic segmentation, and 2) Global Representation Guidance module that provides global-level contextual information to individual queries.

Result: Substantial improvements in mean Average Precision (mAP) compared to leading baselines on nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets.

Conclusion: Learning and utilizing global representations from queries significantly enhances HD map construction performance, demonstrating the importance of global context in autonomous driving map generation.

Abstract: The online construction of vectorized high-definition (HD) maps is a
cornerstone of modern autonomous driving systems. State-of-the-art approaches,
particularly those based on the DETR framework, formulate this as an instance
detection problem. However, their reliance on independent, learnable object
queries results in a predominantly local query perspective, neglecting the
inherent global representation within HD maps. In this work, we propose
\textbf{MapGR} (\textbf{G}lobal \textbf{R}epresentation learning for HD
\textbf{Map} construction), an architecture designed to learn and utilize a
global representations from queries. Our method introduces two synergistic
modules: a Global Representation Learning (GRL) module, which encourages the
distribution of all queries to better align with the global map through a
carefully designed holistic segmentation task, and a Global Representation
Guidance (GRG) module, which endows each individual query with explicit,
global-level contextual information to facilitate its optimization. Evaluations
on the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets validate the efficacy of our approach,
demonstrating substantial improvements in mean Average Precision (mAP) compared
to leading baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes RICE, a method that leverages Large Vision-Language Models' inherent ID-Matching capabilities to improve long video captioning by enhancing image information usage and individual description quantity, achieving significant improvements in ID-Matching precision and recall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long video captioning faces the ID-Matching problem - accurately recognizing the same individuals across different frames. Previous approaches have limited generalization and rely on point-wise matching, making this a critical challenge for text-to-video generation and multi-modal understanding.

Method: Built upon LVLMs to leverage their powerful priors. Introduces RICE (Recognizing Identities for Captioning Effectively) which improves ID-Matching through two key methods: 1) enhancing image information usage and 2) increasing individual description quantity. Also created a new benchmark for assessing ID-Matching capabilities.

Result: Significant improvements in ID-Matching performance: precision increased from 50% to 90% and recall from 15% to 80% when implemented on GPT-4o compared to baseline. Enables continuous tracking of different individuals in long video captions.

Conclusion: RICE effectively unlocks LVLMs' inherent ID-Matching capabilities, making it possible to accurately track individuals across frames in long video captions, addressing a key challenge in video understanding and generation.

Abstract: Generating captions for long and complex videos is both critical and
challenging, with significant implications for the growing fields of
text-to-video generation and multi-modal understanding. One key challenge in
long video captioning is accurately recognizing the same individuals who appear
in different frames, which we refer to as the ID-Matching problem. Few prior
works have focused on this important issue. Those that have, usually suffer
from limited generalization and depend on point-wise matching, which limits
their overall effectiveness. In this paper, unlike previous approaches, we
build upon LVLMs to leverage their powerful priors. We aim to unlock the
inherent ID-Matching capabilities within LVLMs themselves to enhance the
ID-Matching performance of captions. Specifically, we first introduce a new
benchmark for assessing the ID-Matching capabilities of video captions. Using
this benchmark, we investigate LVLMs containing GPT-4o, revealing key insights
that the performance of ID-Matching can be improved through two methods: 1)
enhancing the usage of image information and 2) increasing the quantity of
information of individual descriptions. Based on these insights, we propose a
novel video captioning method called Recognizing Identities for Captioning
Effectively (RICE). Extensive experiments including assessments of caption
quality and ID-Matching performance, demonstrate the superiority of our
approach. Notably, when implemented on GPT-4o, our RICE improves the precision
of ID-Matching from 50% to 90% and improves the recall of ID-Matching from 15%
to 80% compared to baseline. RICE makes it possible to continuously track
different individuals in the captions of long videos.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Reinforcement Learning framework that fine-tunes pretrained motion diffusion models using only textual prompts, enabling adaptation to new actions/styles without motion data or retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models for human motion generation require costly retraining and motion capture data to adapt to unseen actions or styles, limiting scalability.

Method: Uses Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization with a pretrained text-motion retrieval network as reward signal to fine-tune diffusion models, shifting generative distribution toward target domain without motion ground truth.

Result: Consistently improves quality and diversity of generated motions in cross-dataset adaptation and leave-one-out experiments on HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets, while preserving original distribution performance.

Conclusion: Provides a flexible, data-efficient, and privacy-preserving solution for motion adaptation that works with both latent- and joint-space diffusion architectures.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently advanced human motion generation, producing
realistic and diverse animations from textual prompts. However, adapting these
models to unseen actions or styles typically requires additional motion capture
data and full retraining, which is costly and difficult to scale. We propose a
post-training framework based on Reinforcement Learning that fine-tunes
pretrained motion diffusion models using only textual prompts, without
requiring any motion ground truth. Our approach employs a pretrained
text-motion retrieval network as a reward signal and optimizes the diffusion
policy with Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization, effectively shifting the
model's generative distribution toward the target domain without relying on
paired motion data. We evaluate our method on cross-dataset adaptation and
leave-one-out motion experiments using the HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets across
both latent- and joint-space diffusion architectures. Results from quantitative
metrics and user studies show that our approach consistently improves the
quality and diversity of generated motions, while preserving performance on the
original distribution. Our approach is a flexible, data-efficient, and
privacy-preserving solution for motion adaptation.

Motivation: To improve temporal consistency in yearly land-cover maps for better modeling of land cover evolution and change over time, particularly for multiyear crop type sequences.

Method: Combines deep learning with Bayesian modeling using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) integrated with Transformer Encoder (TE) based DNNs. The HMM layer is built on top of the TE to capture temporal correlations and discern consistent yearly crop-type sequences.

Result: Validation on a multiyear crop type classification dataset with 47 crop types and six years of Sentinel-2 acquisitions shows that HMMs enhance overall performance and F1 scores, demonstrating the importance of modeling temporal consistency in predicted labels.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively captures intricate temporal correlations in yearly satellite image time series and specific patterns in multiyear crop type sequences, emphasizing the effectiveness of combining deep learning with Bayesian modeling for temporal consistency.

Abstract: The temporal consistency of yearly land-cover maps is of great importance to
model the evolution and change of the land cover over the years. In this paper,
we focus the attention on a novel approach to classification of yearly
satellite image time series (SITS) that combines deep learning with Bayesian
modelling, using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) integrated with Transformer
Encoder (TE) based DNNs. The proposed approach aims to capture both i)
intricate temporal correlations in yearly SITS and ii) specific patterns in
multiyear crop type sequences. It leverages the cascade classification of an
HMM layer built on top of the TE, discerning consistent yearly crop-type
sequences. Validation on a multiyear crop type classification dataset spanning
47 crop types and six years of Sentinel-2 acquisitions demonstrates the
importance of modelling temporal consistency in the predicted labels. HMMs
enhance the overall performance and F1 scores, emphasising the effectiveness of
the proposed approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite U-Net's dominance in medical image segmentation for a decade, there has been no comprehensive benchmark to systematically evaluate performance, statistical validation, efficiency, and generalization across diverse datasets.

Method: Large-scale evaluation of 100 U-Net variants across 28 datasets and 10 imaging modalities, assessing statistical robustness, zero-shot generalization, and computational efficiency. Introduces U-Score metric and model advisor agent for selection guidance.

Result: Comprehensive benchmark established with systematic analysis of dataset characteristics and architectural paradigms. All code, models, protocols, and weights made publicly available for reproducibility.

Conclusion: U-Bench exposes gaps in previous evaluations and establishes a foundation for fair, reproducible, and practically relevant benchmarking for the next decade of U-Net-based segmentation models.

Abstract: Over the past decade, U-Net has been the dominant architecture in medical
image segmentation, leading to the development of thousands of U-shaped
variants. Despite its widespread adoption, there is still no comprehensive
benchmark to systematically evaluate their performance and utility, largely
because of insufficient statistical validation and limited consideration of
efficiency and generalization across diverse datasets. To bridge this gap, we
present U-Bench, the first large-scale, statistically rigorous benchmark that
evaluates 100 U-Net variants across 28 datasets and 10 imaging modalities. Our
contributions are threefold: (1) Comprehensive Evaluation: U-Bench evaluates
models along three key dimensions: statistical robustness, zero-shot
generalization, and computational efficiency. We introduce a novel metric,
U-Score, which jointly captures the performance-efficiency trade-off, offering
a deployment-oriented perspective on model progress. (2) Systematic Analysis
and Model Selection Guidance: We summarize key findings from the large-scale
evaluation and systematically analyze the impact of dataset characteristics and
architectural paradigms on model performance. Based on these insights, we
propose a model advisor agent to guide researchers in selecting the most
suitable models for specific datasets and tasks. (3) Public Availability: We
provide all code, models, protocols, and weights, enabling the community to
reproduce our results and extend the benchmark with future methods. In summary,
U-Bench not only exposes gaps in previous evaluations but also establishes a
foundation for fair, reproducible, and practically relevant benchmarking in the
next decade of U-Net-based segmentation models. The project can be accessed at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel approach for retrieving images that share central concepts rather than just visual or semantic similarity, using bimodal Gaussian distribution modeling of embedding neighborhoods to identify underlying narratives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To go beyond conventional image retrieval methods that focus on visual or semantic similarity, and instead capture the central concepts and underlying narrative shared between images.

Method: A novel approach based on two key observations: (1) neighbors in embedding space share at least one concept with query but not necessarily with each other, and (2) modeling the neighborhood with bimodal Gaussian distribution reveals meaningful structure for concept identification.

Result: Qualitative, quantitative, and human evaluations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach for concept-based image retrieval.

Conclusion: The method successfully retrieves images sharing central concepts and captures underlying narratives, outperforming conventional retrieval and clustering approaches that emphasize visual or semantic similarity.

Abstract: A concept may reflect either a concrete or abstract idea. Given an input
image, this paper seeks to retrieve other images that share its central
concepts, capturing aspects of the underlying narrative. This goes beyond
conventional retrieval or clustering methods, which emphasize visual or
semantic similarity. We formally define the problem, outline key requirements,
and introduce appropriate evaluation metrics. We propose a novel approach
grounded in two key observations: (1) While each neighbor in the embedding
space typically shares at least one concept with the query, not all neighbors
necessarily share the same concept with one another. (2) Modeling this
neighborhood with a bimodal Gaussian distribution uncovers meaningful structure
that facilitates concept identification. Qualitative, quantitative, and human
evaluations confirm the effectiveness of our approach. See the package on PyPI:

Motivation: Unsupervised object discovery remains a significant challenge in computer vision, as it requires identifying and localizing objects without human-annotated labels.

Method: DADO combines attention mechanisms and depth models with dynamic weighting to adaptively emphasize attention or depth features based on each image's global characteristics, addressing challenges like noisy attention maps and complex scenes with varying depth planes.

Result: DADO outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmarks in object discovery accuracy and robustness without requiring fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The proposed DADO model effectively addresses unsupervised object discovery challenges by leveraging attention-depth fusion with adaptive weighting, achieving superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Unsupervised object discovery, the task of identifying and localizing objects
in images without human-annotated labels, remains a significant challenge and a
growing focus in computer vision. In this work, we introduce a novel model,
DADO (Depth-Attention self-supervised technique for Discovering unseen
Objects), which combines an attention mechanism and a depth model to identify
potential objects in images. To address challenges such as noisy attention maps
or complex scenes with varying depth planes, DADO employs dynamic weighting to
adaptively emphasize attention or depth features based on the global
characteristics of each image. We evaluated DADO on standard benchmarks, where
it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in object discovery accuracy and
robustness without the need for fine-tuning.

*Rémi Kazmierczak,Steve Azzolin,Eloïse Berthier,Goran Frehse,Gianni Franchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper identifies concept hallucination in CLIP-based Concept Bottleneck Models and introduces CHILI to mitigate this issue by disentangling embeddings and localizing concept pixels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address explainable AI through Concept Bottleneck Models that don't require explicit concept annotations, but discover that CLIP is prone to concept hallucination which undermines explanation faithfulness.

Method: Introduce Concept Hallucination Inhibition via Localized Interpretability (CHILI) - a technique that disentangles image embeddings and localizes pixels corresponding to target concepts.

Result: CHILI mitigates concept hallucination issues and supports generation of more interpretable saliency-based explanations.

Conclusion: The proposed CHILI approach effectively addresses concept hallucination in CLIP-based CBMs, improving explanation faithfulness and interpretability.

Abstract: This paper addresses explainable AI (XAI) through the lens of Concept
Bottleneck Models (CBMs) that do not require explicit concept annotations,
relying instead on concepts extracted using CLIP in a zero-shot manner. We show
that CLIP, which is central in these techniques, is prone to concept
hallucination, incorrectly predicting the presence or absence of concepts
within an image in scenarios used in numerous CBMs, hence undermining the
faithfulness of explanations. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Concept
Hallucination Inhibition via Localized Interpretability (CHILI), a technique
that disentangles image embeddings and localizes pixels corresponding to target
concepts. Furthermore, our approach supports the generation of saliency-based
explanations that are more interpretable.

*Dongki Jung,Jaehoon Choi,Yonghan Lee,Sungmin Eum,Heesung Kwon,Dinesh Manocha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoRe is a training-free monocular geometry refinement method that improves cross-view consistency and scale alignment through graph-based optimization using feature matching and local planar approximation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular 3D foundation models have scale ambiguity and cross-view inconsistency issues that limit their broader application in 3D vision tasks.

Method: Uses feature matching between frames to establish correspondences, then applies graph-based optimization with local planar approximation using estimated 3D points and surface normals from monocular foundation models.

Result: Improves cross-view consistency, achieves scale alignment, enhances 3D reconstruction quality, and improves novel view synthesis especially in sparse view rendering scenarios.

Conclusion: MoRe effectively addresses scale ambiguity in monocular geometric priors while preserving 3D structure, making it a valuable training-free refinement method for monocular 3D foundation models.

Abstract: Monocular 3D foundation models offer an extensible solution for perception
tasks, making them attractive for broader 3D vision applications. In this
paper, we propose MoRe, a training-free Monocular Geometry Refinement method
designed to improve cross-view consistency and achieve scale alignment. To
induce inter-frame relationships, our method employs feature matching between
frames to establish correspondences. Rather than applying simple least squares
optimization on these matched points, we formulate a graph-based optimization
framework that performs local planar approximation using the estimated 3D
points and surface normals estimated by monocular foundation models. This
formulation addresses the scale ambiguity inherent in monocular geometric
priors while preserving the underlying 3D structure. We further demonstrate
that MoRe not only enhances 3D reconstruction but also improves novel view
synthesis, particularly in sparse view rendering scenarios.

### [73] [Validation of Various Normalization Methods for Brain Tumor Segmentation: Can Federated Learning Overcome This Heterogeneity?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07126)
*Jan Fiszer,Dominika Ciupek,Maciej Malawski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Federated learning shows resilience to non-IID data caused by different MRI intensity normalization methods, achieving 92% Dice score for brain tumor segmentation comparable to centralized training while preserving data privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in medical imaging DL including data privacy, storage, and transfer issues, particularly when dealing with non-IID data from different MRI intensity normalization techniques.

Method: Simulated non-IID conditions by applying different MRI intensity normalization techniques to data subsets, then trained and tested brain tumor segmentation models using federated learning.

Result: FL methods demonstrated resilience to inconsistently normalized data, achieving 92% 3D Dice score comparable to centralized models trained with all data.

Conclusion: Federated learning is an effective solution for training high-performing medical imaging models without violating data privacy, even with heterogeneous data from different normalization methods.

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has been increasingly applied in medical imaging, however,
it requires large amounts of data, which raises many challenges related to data
privacy, storage, and transfer. Federated learning (FL) is a training paradigm
that overcomes these issues, though its effectiveness may be reduced when
dealing with non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. This
study simulates non-IID conditions by applying different MRI intensity
normalization techniques to separate data subsets, reflecting a common cause of
heterogeneity. These subsets are then used for training and testing models for
brain tumor segmentation. The findings provide insights into the influence of
the MRI intensity normalization methods on segmentation models, both training
and inference. Notably, the FL methods demonstrated resilience to
inconsistently normalized data across clients, achieving the 3D Dice score of
92%, which is comparable to a centralized model (trained using all data). These
results indicate that FL is a solution to effectively train high-performing
models without violating data privacy, a crucial concern in medical
applications. The code is available at:

*Sarah Cechnicka,Matthew Baugh,Weitong Zhang,Mischa Dombrowski,Zhe Li,Johannes C. Paetzold,Candice Roufosse,Bernhard Kainz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Graph-Conditioned-Diffusion using graph-based object-level representations to enable fine-grained control in medical image generation, particularly for histopathology images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) operate in noisy latent spaces lacking semantic structure, making controlled generation challenging in sensitive medical imaging where structural consistency is critical for diagnosis.

Method: The approach generates graph nodes for each major structure in medical images, capturing individual features and relationships. These graph representations are processed by a transformer module and integrated into diffusion models via text-conditioning mechanisms.

Result: Evaluation on real-world histopathology data shows that generated data can reliably substitute for annotated patient data in downstream segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: Graph-based object-level representations enable fine-grained control over medical image generation, addressing the limitations of traditional DPMs in structured domains like medical imaging.

Abstract: Recent advances in Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have set new
standards in high-quality image synthesis. Yet, controlled generation remains
challenging, particularly in sensitive areas such as medical imaging. Medical
images feature inherent structure such as consistent spatial arrangement, shape
or texture, all of which are critical for diagnosis. However, existing DPMs
operate in noisy latent spaces that lack semantic structure and strong priors,
making it difficult to ensure meaningful control over generated content. To
address this, we propose graph-based object-level representations for
Graph-Conditioned-Diffusion. Our approach generates graph nodes corresponding
to each major structure in the image, encapsulating their individual features
and relationships. These graph representations are processed by a transformer
module and integrated into a diffusion model via the text-conditioning
mechanism, enabling fine-grained control over generation. We evaluate this
approach using a real-world histopathology use case, demonstrating that our
generated data can reliably substitute for annotated patient data in downstream
segmentation tasks. The code is available here.

### [75] [Few-Shot Adaptation Benchmark for Remote Sensing Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07135)
*Karim El Khoury,Maxime Zanella,Christophe De Vleeschouwer,Benoit Macq*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents the first structured benchmark for evaluating few-shot adaptation methods on Remote Sensing Vision-Language Models (RSVLMs), revealing that models with similar zero-shot performance can behave very differently in few-shot scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While RSVLMs show strong zero-shot performance, their generalization ability in low-data regimes like few-shot learning remains insufficiently explored, creating a need for systematic evaluation.

Method: Comprehensive experiments across ten remote sensing scene classification datasets using five few-shot adaptation strategies on three state-of-the-art RSVLMs with varying backbones.

Result: Models with similar zero-shot performance exhibit markedly different behavior under few-shot adaptation, with some RSVLMs being inherently more amenable to such adaptation than others. No clear winner among existing methods was found.

Conclusion: There is a need for developing more robust few-shot adaptation methods tailored to remote sensing, and the authors provide a reproducible benchmarking framework to facilitate future research.

Abstract: Remote Sensing Vision-Language Models (RSVLMs) have shown remarkable
potential thanks to large-scale pretraining, achieving strong zero-shot
performance on various tasks. However, their ability to generalize in low-data
regimes, such as few-shot learning, remains insufficiently explored. In this
work, we present the first structured benchmark for evaluating few-shot
adaptation methods on RSVLMs. We conduct comprehensive experiments across ten
remote sensing scene classification datasets, applying five widely used
few-shot adaptation strategies to three state-of-the-art RSVLMs with varying
backbones. Our findings reveal that models with similar zero-shot performance
can exhibit markedly different behavior under few-shot adaptation, with some
RSVLMs being inherently more amenable to such adaptation than others. The
variability of performance and the absence of a clear winner among existing
methods highlight the need for the development of more robust methods for
few-shot adaptation tailored to RS. To facilitate future research, we provide a
reproducible benchmarking framework and open-source code to systematically
evaluate RSVLMs under few-shot conditions. The source code is publicly

*Chenfei Liao,Wensong Wang,Zichen Wen,Xu Zheng,Yiyu Wang,Haocong He,Yuanhuiyi Lyu,Lutao Jiang,Xin Zou,Yuqian Fu,Bin Ren,Linfeng Zhang,Xuming Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Current benchmarks for evaluating visual token compression in MLLMs are noisy and suffer from task mismatch. Simple image downsampling outperforms advanced methods, revealing the need for better evaluation frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks designed for MLLM perception/reasoning assessment are unsuitable for evaluating visual token compression methods, creating a task mismatch that leads to inaccurate comparisons.

Method: Introduces VTC-Bench, an evaluation framework with data filtering to denoise existing benchmarks, enabling fairer assessment of visual token compression methods.

Result: Shows that simple image downsampling consistently outperforms advanced compression methods across multiple benchmarks, and that downsampling can serve as a data filter to evaluate sample difficulty.

Conclusion: Current benchmarks are noisy for visual token compression evaluation, and VTC-Bench provides a more accurate framework for assessing compression methods by incorporating data filtering mechanisms.

Abstract: Recent endeavors to accelerate inference in Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) have primarily focused on visual token compression. The effectiveness
of these methods is typically assessed by measuring the accuracy drop on
established benchmarks, comparing model performance before and after
compression. However, these benchmarks are originally designed to assess the
perception and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, rather than to evaluate
compression techniques. As a result, directly applying them to visual token
compression introduces a task mismatch. Strikingly, our investigation reveals
that simple image downsampling consistently outperforms many advanced
compression methods across multiple widely used benchmarks. Through extensive
experiments, we make the following observations: (i) Current benchmarks are
noisy for the visual token compression task. (ii) Down-sampling is able to
serve as a data filter to evaluate the difficulty of samples in the visual
token compression task. Motivated by these findings, we introduce VTC-Bench, an
evaluation framework that incorporates a data filtering mechanism to denoise
existing benchmarks, thereby enabling fairer and more accurate assessment of
visual token compression methods. All data and code are available at

*Yihao Zhi,Chenghong Li,Hongjie Liao,Xihe Yang,Zhengwentai Sun,Jiahao Chang,Xiaodong Cun,Wensen Feng,Xiaoguang Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MV-Performer is a framework for generating synchronized 360-degree novel view videos from monocular full-body human captures using camera-dependent normal maps and multi-view video diffusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video diffusion methods struggle with 360-degree viewpoint changes and primarily focus on front-view camera trajectory redirection, especially in human-centric scenarios.

Method: Uses MVHumanNet dataset with camera-dependent normal maps from oriented partial point clouds, and a multi-view human-centric video diffusion model that fuses reference video, partial rendering, and viewpoint information.

Result: Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art effectiveness and robustness for human-centric 4D novel view synthesis.

Conclusion: MV-Performer sets a strong model for generating synchronized 360-degree novel view videos from monocular human captures, effectively handling seen and unseen observations.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in video generation, powered by large-scale datasets and
diffusion techniques, have shown that video diffusion models can function as
implicit 4D novel view synthesizers. Nevertheless, current methods primarily
concentrate on redirecting camera trajectory within the front view while
struggling to generate 360-degree viewpoint changes. In this paper, we focus on
human-centric subdomain and present MV-Performer, an innovative framework for
creating synchronized novel view videos from monocular full-body captures. To
achieve a 360-degree synthesis, we extensively leverage the MVHumanNet dataset
and incorporate an informative condition signal. Specifically, we use the
camera-dependent normal maps rendered from oriented partial point clouds, which
effectively alleviate the ambiguity between seen and unseen observations. To
maintain synchronization in the generated videos, we propose a multi-view
human-centric video diffusion model that fuses information from the reference
video, partial rendering, and different viewpoints. Additionally, we provide a
robust inference procedure for in-the-wild video cases, which greatly mitigates
the artifacts induced by imperfect monocular depth estimation. Extensive
experiments on three datasets demonstrate our MV-Performer's state-of-the-art
effectiveness and robustness, setting a strong model for human-centric 4D novel
view synthesis.

### [78] [Resolution scaling governs DINOv3 transfer performance in chest radiograph classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07191)
*Soroosh Tayebi Arasteh,Mina Shaigan,Christiane Kuhl,Jakob Nikolas Kather,Sven Nebelung,Daniel Truhn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DINOv3 SSL model with 512x512 resolution and ConvNeXt-B backbone provides optimal performance for chest radiography interpretation, outperforming DINOv2 and ImageNet initialization, with greatest benefits for detecting subtle abnormalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically evaluate whether DINOv3's SSL improvements translate to better performance in chest radiography, a high-volume imaging modality with fine-grained findings that requires precise detection capabilities.

Method: Benchmarked DINOv3 against DINOv2 and ImageNet initialization across 7 datasets (n>814,000) using ViT-B/16 and ConvNeXt-B backbones at multiple resolutions (224x224, 512x512, 1024x1024), and assessed frozen features from 7B model.

Result: At 512x512 resolution, DINOv3 consistently outperformed both DINOv2 and ImageNet. ConvNeXt-B outperformed ViT-B/16 across all settings. Frozen 7B features underperformed compared to finetuned 86-89M parameter models. Scaling beyond 512x512 provided minimal gains.

Conclusion: 512x512 resolution with DINOv3-initialized ConvNeXt-B networks provides optimal performance for chest radiography, with greatest benefits for detecting boundary-dependent and small focal abnormalities, supporting clinical use in emergency and critical care settings.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has advanced visual representation learning,
but its value in chest radiography, a high-volume imaging modality with
fine-grained findings, remains unclear. Meta's DINOv3 extends earlier SSL
models through Gram-anchored self-distillation. Whether these design choices
improve transfer learning for chest radiography has not been systematically
tested. We benchmarked DINOv3 against DINOv2 and ImageNet initialization across
seven datasets (n>814,000). Two representative backbones were evaluated:
ViT-B/16 and ConvNeXt-B. Images were analyzed at 224x224, 512x512, and
1024x1024 pixels. We additionally assessed frozen features from a 7B model. The
primary outcome was mean AUROC across labels. At 224x224, DINOv3 and DINOv2
achieved comparable performance on adult datasets. Increasing resolution to
512x512 yielded consistent improvements for DINOv3 over both DINOv2 and
ImageNet. In contrast, results in pediatric cohort showed no differences across
initializations. Across all settings, ConvNeXt-B outperformed ViT-B/16. Models
using frozen DINOv3-7B features underperformed relative to fully finetuned
86-89M-parameter backbones, highlighting the importance of domain adaptation.
Scaling to 1024x1024 did not further improve accuracy. Resolution-related gains
were most evident for boundary-dependent and small focal abnormalities. In
chest radiography, higher input resolution is critical for leveraging the
benefits of modern self-supervised models. 512x512 pixels represent a practical
upper limit where DINOv3-initialized ConvNeXt-B networks provide the strongest
performance, while larger inputs offer minimal return on cost. Clinically,
these findings support use of finetuned, mid-sized backbones at 512x512 for
chest radiograph interpretation, with the greatest gains expected in detecting
subtle or boundary-centered lesions relevant to emergency and critical care
settings.

*Shirin Shoushtari,Yi Wang,Xiao Shi,M. Salman Asif,Ulugbek S. Kamilov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EigenScore is a new OOD detection method that uses the eigenvalue spectrum of posterior covariance from diffusion models to detect distribution shifts, achieving state-of-the-art performance with improved robustness in near-OOD settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Out-of-distribution detection is critical for safe deployment of ML systems in safety-sensitive domains, and diffusion models have shown potential for this task but existing methods often fail in near-OOD scenarios.

Method: Leverages eigenvalue spectrum of posterior covariance induced by diffusion models, using Jacobian-free subspace iteration to estimate leading eigenvalues with only forward evaluations of the denoiser.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with up to 5% AUROC improvement over best baselines, and remains robust in challenging near-OOD settings like CIFAR-10 vs CIFAR-100.

Conclusion: Posterior covariance provides a consistent signal for distribution shift, making EigenScore a reliable and effective OOD detection method that outperforms existing approaches, particularly in difficult near-OOD scenarios.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for the safe deployment of
machine learning systems in safety-sensitive domains. Diffusion models have
recently emerged as powerful generative models, capable of capturing complex
data distributions through iterative denoising. Building on this progress,
recent work has explored their potential for OOD detection. We propose
EigenScore, a new OOD detection method that leverages the eigenvalue spectrum
of the posterior covariance induced by a diffusion model. We argue that
posterior covariance provides a consistent signal of distribution shift,
leading to larger trace and leading eigenvalues on OOD inputs, yielding a clear
spectral signature. We further provide analysis explicitly linking posterior
covariance to distribution mismatch, establishing it as a reliable signal for
OOD detection. To ensure tractability, we adopt a Jacobian-free subspace
iteration method to estimate the leading eigenvalues using only forward
evaluations of the denoiser. Empirically, EigenScore achieves SOTA performance,
with up to 5% AUROC improvement over the best baseline. Notably, it remains
robust in near-OOD settings such as CIFAR-10 vs CIFAR-100, where existing
diffusion-based methods often fail.

TL;DR: GenPilot is a plug-and-play multi-agent system for test-time prompt optimization that improves text-to-image synthesis by analyzing errors and iteratively refining prompts to enhance semantic consistency and structural coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image models struggle with complex and lengthy prompts, leading to semantic inconsistencies and missing details. Current solutions like fine-tuning are model-specific and require training, while automatic prompt optimization approaches lack systematic error analysis and refinement strategies.

Method: Proposes GenPilot - a multi-agent system with error analysis, clustering-based adaptive exploration, fine-grained verification, and memory module for iterative optimization. It operates directly on input text and is model-agnostic.

Result: Experiments on DPG-bench and Geneval show improvements of up to 16.9% and 5.7% in text-image consistency and structural coherence. The approach effectively enhances generated image quality without model retraining.

Conclusion: GenPilot provides a flexible, efficient, and interpretable test-time prompt optimization strategy that handles complex prompts well, offering valuable error patterns and refinement strategies for further exploration in text-to-image synthesis.

Abstract: Text-to-image synthesis has made remarkable progress, yet accurately
interpreting complex and lengthy prompts remains challenging, often resulting
in semantic inconsistencies and missing details. Existing solutions, such as
fine-tuning, are model-specific and require training, while prior automatic
prompt optimization (APO) approaches typically lack systematic error analysis
and refinement strategies, resulting in limited reliability and effectiveness.
Meanwhile, test-time scaling methods operate on fixed prompts and on noise or
sample numbers, limiting their interpretability and adaptability. To solve
these, we introduce a flexible and efficient test-time prompt optimization
strategy that operates directly on the input text. We propose a plug-and-play
multi-agent system called GenPilot, integrating error analysis,
clustering-based adaptive exploration, fine-grained verification, and a memory
module for iterative optimization. Our approach is model-agnostic,
interpretable, and well-suited for handling long and complex prompts.
Simultaneously, we summarize the common patterns of errors and the refinement
strategy, offering more experience and encouraging further exploration.
Experiments on DPG-bench and Geneval with improvements of up to 16.9% and 5.7%
demonstrate the strong capability of our methods in enhancing the text and
image consistency and structural coherence of generated images, revealing the
effectiveness of our test-time prompt optimization strategy. The code is

Result: Training on TalkCuts significantly enhances cinematographic coherence and visual appeal of generated multi-shot speech videos in both pose-guided and audio-driven settings.

Conclusion: TalkCuts provides a strong foundation for future work in controllable multi-shot speech video generation and broader multimodal learning, addressing limitations of existing single-shot datasets.

Abstract: In this work, we present TalkCuts, a large-scale dataset designed to
facilitate the study of multi-shot human speech video generation. Unlike
existing datasets that focus on single-shot, static viewpoints, TalkCuts offers
164k clips totaling over 500 hours of high-quality human speech videos with
diverse camera shots, including close-up, half-body, and full-body views. The
dataset includes detailed textual descriptions, 2D keypoints and 3D SMPL-X
motion annotations, covering over 10k identities, enabling multimodal learning
and evaluation. As a first attempt to showcase the value of the dataset, we
present Orator, an LLM-guided multi-modal generation framework as a simple
baseline, where the language model functions as a multi-faceted director,
orchestrating detailed specifications for camera transitions, speaker
gesticulations, and vocal modulation. This architecture enables the synthesis
of coherent long-form videos through our integrated multi-modal video
generation module. Extensive experiments in both pose-guided and audio-driven
settings show that training on TalkCuts significantly enhances the

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Foundation Models (FM) like RETFound and FLAIR don't consistently outperform fine-tuned CNNs for Diabetic Macular Edema detection, with EfficientNet-B0 often performing better despite FM's scale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if Foundation Models can effectively detect Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) given limited annotated data, as deep learning faces challenges due to data scarcity.

Method: Systematic comparison of FM (RETFound, FLAIR) vs standard transfer learning (EfficientNet-B0) across different training regimes and evaluation settings using IDRiD, MESSIDOR-2 and OCT-and-Eye-Fundus-Images datasets.

Result: EfficientNet-B0 ranked first or second in most evaluation settings for AUC-ROC and AUC-PR. RETFound showed promise only in OEFI dataset. FLAIR demonstrated competitive zero-shot performance with appropriate prompting.

Conclusion: Foundation Models may not be suitable for fine-grained ophthalmic tasks like DME detection even after fine-tuning, suggesting lightweight CNNs remain strong baselines in data-scarce environments.

Abstract: Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) is a leading cause of vision loss among patients
with Diabetic Retinopathy (DR). While deep learning has shown promising results
for automatically detecting this condition from fundus images, its application
remains challenging due the limited availability of annotated data. Foundation
Models (FM) have emerged as an alternative solution. However, it is unclear if
they can cope with DME detection in particular. In this paper, we
systematically compare different FM and standard transfer learning approaches
for this task. Specifically, we compare the two most popular FM for retinal
images--RETFound and FLAIR--and an EfficientNet-B0 backbone, across different
training regimes and evaluation settings in IDRiD, MESSIDOR-2 and
OCT-and-Eye-Fundus-Images (OEFI). Results show that despite their scale, FM do
not consistently outperform fine-tuned CNNs in this task. In particular, an
EfficientNet-B0 ranked first or second in terms of area under the ROC and
precision/recall curves in most evaluation settings, with RETFound only showing
promising results in OEFI. FLAIR, on the other hand, demonstrated competitive
zero-shot performance, achieving notable AUC-PR scores when prompted
appropriately. These findings reveal that FM might not be a good tool for
fine-grained ophthalmic tasks such as DME detection even after fine-tuning,
suggesting that lightweight CNNs remain strong baselines in data-scarce
environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpecGuard is a robust invisible image watermarking method that embeds messages in frequency domain using spectral projection and wavelet decomposition, achieving superior performance against various attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing watermarking methods lack robustness against transformations like distortions, image regeneration, and adversarial perturbations, creating real-world challenges for authenticity verification.

Method: Embeds messages in hidden convolution layers by converting spatial domain to frequency domain using spectral projection with wavelet decomposition. Uses Fast Fourier Transform approximation and strength factor for enhanced resilience against attacks. Decoder leverages Parseval's theorem for watermark extraction.

Result: Comprehensive experiments demonstrate SpecGuard outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of watermark invisibility, capacity, and robustness against diverse attacks including adversarial, geometric, and regeneration-based distortions.

Conclusion: SpecGuard provides a robust and invisible watermarking solution that effectively preserves copyrighted information under challenging transformations, with code released for reproducibility.

Abstract: Watermarking embeds imperceptible patterns into images for authenticity
verification. However, existing methods often lack robustness against various
transformations primarily including distortions, image regeneration, and
adversarial perturbation, creating real-world challenges. In this work, we
introduce SpecGuard, a novel watermarking approach for robust and invisible
image watermarking. Unlike prior approaches, we embed the message inside hidden
convolution layers by converting from the spatial domain to the frequency
domain using spectral projection of a higher frequency band that is decomposed
by wavelet projection. Spectral projection employs Fast Fourier Transform
approximation to transform spatial data into the frequency domain efficiently.
In the encoding phase, a strength factor enhances resilience against diverse
attacks, including adversarial, geometric, and regeneration-based distortions,
ensuring the preservation of copyrighted information. Meanwhile, the decoder
leverages Parseval's theorem to effectively learn and extract the watermark
pattern, enabling accurate retrieval under challenging transformations. We
evaluate the proposed SpecGuard based on the embedded watermark's invisibility,
capacity, and robustness. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the proposed
SpecGuard outperforms the state-of-the-art models. To ensure reproducibility,
the full code is released on

TL;DR: MATRIX is a regularization method that improves video DiTs' ability to model multi-instance interactions by aligning attention with mask tracks, enhancing semantic grounding and propagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video DiTs struggle with modeling multi-instance or subject-object interactions, raising questions about how these models internally represent interactions.

Method: Created MATRIX-11K dataset with interaction-aware captions and multi-instance mask tracks. Introduced MATRIX regularization that aligns attention in specific layers with mask tracks. Proposed InterGenEval evaluation protocol.

Result: MATRIX improves interaction fidelity and semantic alignment while reducing drift and hallucination. Found that interaction effects concentrate in a small subset of layers.

Conclusion: MATRIX effectively enhances video DiTs' capability to model complex interactions through targeted attention alignment, validated by extensive experiments.

Abstract: Video DiTs have advanced video generation, yet they still struggle to model
multi-instance or subject-object interactions. This raises a key question: How
do these models internally represent interactions? To answer this, we curate
MATRIX-11K, a video dataset with interaction-aware captions and multi-instance
mask tracks. Using this dataset, we conduct a systematic analysis that
formalizes two perspectives of video DiTs: semantic grounding, via
video-to-text attention, which evaluates whether noun and verb tokens capture
instances and their relations; and semantic propagation, via video-to-video
attention, which assesses whether instance bindings persist across frames. We
find both effects concentrate in a small subset of interaction-dominant layers.
Motivated by this, we introduce MATRIX, a simple and effective regularization
that aligns attention in specific layers of video DiTs with multi-instance mask
tracks from the MATRIX-11K dataset, enhancing both grounding and propagation.
We further propose InterGenEval, an evaluation protocol for interaction-aware
video generation. In experiments, MATRIX improves both interaction fidelity and
semantic alignment while reducing drift and hallucination. Extensive ablations
validate our design choices. Codes and weights will be released.

### [85] [WristWorld: Generating Wrist-Views via 4D World Models for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07313)
*Zezhong Qian,Xiaowei Chi,Yuming Li,Shizun Wang,Zhiyuan Qin,Xiaozhu Ju,Sirui Han,Shanghang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WristWorld is a 4D world model that generates wrist-view videos from anchor views using geometric reconstruction and video generation, improving VLA manipulation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wrist-view observations are crucial for VLA models to capture fine-grained hand-object interactions, but large-scale datasets lack such recordings, creating a gap between abundant anchor views and scarce wrist views.

Method: Two-stage approach: (1) Reconstruction using extended VGGT with Spatial Projection Consistency Loss for geometrically consistent wrist-view poses and 4D point clouds; (2) Generation using video generation model to synthesize temporally coherent wrist-view videos.

Result: State-of-the-art video generation with superior spatial consistency on Droid, Calvin, and Franka Panda datasets; improved VLA performance with 3.81% increase in average task completion length on Calvin and closed 42.4% of anchor-wrist view gap.

Conclusion: WristWorld successfully bridges the anchor-wrist view gap by leveraging geometric priors and enables wrist-view video generation from anchor views alone, enhancing VLA manipulation capabilities.

Abstract: Wrist-view observations are crucial for VLA models as they capture
fine-grained hand-object interactions that directly enhance manipulation
performance. Yet large-scale datasets rarely include such recordings, resulting
in a substantial gap between abundant anchor views and scarce wrist views.
Existing world models cannot bridge this gap, as they require a wrist-view
first frame and thus fail to generate wrist-view videos from anchor views
alone. Amid this gap, recent visual geometry models such as VGGT emerge with
geometric and cross-view priors that make it possible to address extreme
viewpoint shifts. Inspired by these insights, we propose WristWorld, the first
4D world model that generates wrist-view videos solely from anchor views.
WristWorld operates in two stages: (i) Reconstruction, which extends VGGT and
incorporates our Spatial Projection Consistency (SPC) Loss to estimate
geometrically consistent wrist-view poses and 4D point clouds; (ii) Generation,
which employs our video generation model to synthesize temporally coherent
wrist-view videos from the reconstructed perspective. Experiments on Droid,
Calvin, and Franka Panda demonstrate state-of-the-art video generation with
superior spatial consistency, while also improving VLA performance, raising the
average task completion length on Calvin by 3.81% and closing 42.4% of the
anchor-wrist view gap.

### [86] [Pixel-Perfect Depth with Semantics-Prompted Diffusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07316)
*Gangwei Xu,Haotong Lin,Hongcheng Luo,Xianqi Wang,Jingfeng Yao,Lianghui Zhu,Yuechuan Pu,Cheng Chi,Haiyang Sun,Bing Wang,Guang Chen,Hangjun Ye,Sida Peng,Xin Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pixel-Perfect Depth is a monocular depth estimation model that uses pixel-space diffusion generation to create high-quality, artifact-free depth maps and point clouds, outperforming existing generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative depth estimation models using Stable Diffusion require VAE compression, which introduces flying pixels at edges and details. The authors aim to eliminate these artifacts by working directly in pixel space.

Method: The model performs diffusion generation directly in pixel space using two key designs: 1) Semantics-Prompted Diffusion Transformers (SP-DiT) that incorporate semantic representations from vision foundation models, and 2) Cascade DiT Design that progressively increases tokens for efficiency and accuracy.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art performance among all published generative models across five benchmarks and significantly outperforms other models in edge-aware point cloud evaluation.

Conclusion: Direct pixel-space diffusion generation with semantic prompting and cascade design effectively eliminates VAE-induced artifacts and produces superior depth estimation results compared to latent-space approaches.

Abstract: This paper presents Pixel-Perfect Depth, a monocular depth estimation model
based on pixel-space diffusion generation that produces high-quality,
flying-pixel-free point clouds from estimated depth maps. Current generative
depth estimation models fine-tune Stable Diffusion and achieve impressive
performance. However, they require a VAE to compress depth maps into latent
space, which inevitably introduces \textit{flying pixels} at edges and details.
Our model addresses this challenge by directly performing diffusion generation
in the pixel space, avoiding VAE-induced artifacts. To overcome the high
complexity associated with pixel-space generation, we introduce two novel
designs: 1) Semantics-Prompted Diffusion Transformers (SP-DiT), which
incorporate semantic representations from vision foundation models into DiT to
prompt the diffusion process, thereby preserving global semantic consistency
while enhancing fine-grained visual details; and 2) Cascade DiT Design that
progressively increases the number of tokens to further enhance efficiency and
accuracy. Our model achieves the best performance among all published
generative models across five benchmarks, and significantly outperforms all
other models in edge-aware point cloud evaluation.

TL;DR: This paper provides a comprehensive survey of Quantum-enhanced Computer Vision (QeCV), introducing the field, its methodologies, tools, and challenges for the computer vision community.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between computer vision and quantum computing by providing a holistic review of QeCV, targeting computer vision professionals who want to understand quantum computational paradigms and their applications in vision tasks.

Method: The authors conduct a comprehensive survey covering: introduction to QeCV specifics, methodologies for quantum-hardware-compatible formulations, gate-based quantum computing and quantum annealing paradigms, operational principles of quantum computers, and available tools for programming and simulation.

Result: A thorough reference guide that explains quantum computing concepts in the context of computer vision, reviews existing quantum tools and learning materials, and discusses publishing aspects, open challenges, and social implications of QeCV.

Conclusion: QeCV has high potential to transform visual signal processing but requires development of specialized quantum algorithms that are compatible with quantum hardware to fully leverage quantum computational advantages over classical methods.

Abstract: Quantum-enhanced Computer Vision (QeCV) is a new research field at the
intersection of computer vision, optimisation theory, machine learning and
quantum computing. It has high potential to transform how visual signals are
processed and interpreted with the help of quantum computing that leverages
quantum-mechanical effects in computations inaccessible to classical (i.e.
non-quantum) computers. In scenarios where existing non-quantum methods cannot
find a solution in a reasonable time or compute only approximate solutions,
quantum computers can provide, among others, advantages in terms of better time
scalability for multiple problem classes. Parametrised quantum circuits can
also become, in the long term, a considerable alternative to classical neural
networks in computer vision. However, specialised and fundamentally new
algorithms must be developed to enable compatibility with quantum hardware and
unveil the potential of quantum computational paradigms in computer vision.
This survey contributes to the existing literature on QeCV with a holistic
review of this research field. It is designed as a quantum computing reference
for the computer vision community, targeting computer vision students,
scientists and readers with related backgrounds who want to familiarise
themselves with QeCV. We provide a comprehensive introduction to QeCV, its
specifics, and methodologies for formulations compatible with quantum hardware
and QeCV methods, leveraging two main quantum computational paradigms, i.e.
gate-based quantum computing and quantum annealing. We elaborate on the
operational principles of quantum computers and the available tools to access,
program and simulate them in the context of QeCV. Finally, we review existing
quantum computing tools and learning materials and discuss aspects related to
publishing and reviewing QeCV papers, open challenges and potential social
implications.

TL;DR: Tenet framework decomposes RVOS into referring, video, and segmentation factors, using temporal prompts from object detectors/trackers and prompt preference learning to adapt image foundation models for video segmentation without dense mask training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RVOS methods require end-to-end training with dense mask annotations, which is computationally expensive and less scalable. The authors aim to investigate the key factors of RVOS and leverage foundation models more efficiently.

Method: Proposes Temporal Prompt Generation and Selection (Tenet) framework that decomposes RVOS into three factors. Uses object detectors and trackers to produce temporal prompts, and introduces Prompt Preference Learning to evaluate prompt quality. Adapts image-based foundation segmentation models using these prompts.

Result: Experiments on RVOS benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the Tenet framework in producing high-quality masks for referred objects.

Conclusion: The Tenet framework enables efficient adaptation of image-based foundation segmentation models to referring video object segmentation without requiring dense mask annotations for end-to-end training, making the approach more scalable and computationally efficient.

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment the object
referred to by the query sentence in the video. Most existing methods require
end-to-end training with dense mask annotations, which could be
computation-consuming and less scalable. In this work, we rethink the RVOS
problem and aim to investigate the key to this task. Based on existing
foundation segmentation models, we decompose the RVOS task into referring,
video, and segmentation factors, and propose a Temporal Prompt Generation and
Selection (Tenet) framework to address the referring and video factors while
leaving the segmentation problem to foundation models. To efficiently adapt
image-based foundation segmentation models to referring video object
segmentation, we leverage off-the-shelf object detectors and trackers to
produce temporal prompts associated with the referring sentence. While
high-quality temporal prompts could be produced, they can not be easily
identified from confidence scores. To tackle this issue, we propose Prompt
Preference Learning to evaluate the quality of the produced temporal prompts.
By taking such prompts to instruct image-based foundation segmentation models,
we would be able to produce high-quality masks for the referred object,
enabling efficient model adaptation to referring video object segmentation.
Experiments on RVOS benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the Tenet
framework.
