### [1] [LoRA-Edge: Tensor-Train-Assisted LoRA for Practical CNN Fine-Tuning on Edge Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03765)
*Hyunseok Kwak,Kyeongwon Lee,Jae-Jin Lee,Woojoo Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoRA-Edge enables efficient on-device CNN fine-tuning for edge applications using tensor-train assisted Low-Rank Adaptation, reducing trainable parameters by up to 100x while maintaining near-full fine-tuning accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Full fine-tuning of CNNs for edge applications like Human Activity Recognition is infeasible due to strict memory, compute, and energy constraints, especially when dealing with domain shifts.

Method: Applies Tensor-Train SVD to pre-trained convolutional layers, selectively updates only the output-side core with zero-initialization, and fuses updates back into dense kernels without changing inference cost.

Result: Achieves accuracy within 4.7% of full fine-tuning while updating at most 1.49% of parameters, with 1.4-3.8x faster convergence on Jetson Orin Nano compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: LoRA-Edge makes structure-aligned, parameter-efficient on-device CNN adaptation practical for edge platforms by preserving convolutional structure and significantly reducing training overhead.

Abstract: On-device fine-tuning of CNNs is essential to withstand domain shift in edge
applications such as Human Activity Recognition (HAR), yet full fine-tuning is
infeasible under strict memory, compute, and energy budgets. We present
LoRA-Edge, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method that builds on
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with tensor-train assistance. LoRA-Edge (i) applies
Tensor-Train Singular Value Decomposition (TT-SVD) to pre-trained convolutional
layers, (ii) selectively updates only the output-side core with
zero-initialization to keep the auxiliary path inactive at the start, and (iii)
fuses the update back into dense kernels, leaving inference cost unchanged.
This design preserves convolutional structure and reduces the number of
trainable parameters by up to two orders of magnitude compared to full
fine-tuning. Across diverse HAR datasets and CNN backbones, LoRA-Edge achieves
accuracy within 4.7% of full fine-tuning while updating at most 1.49% of
parameters, consistently outperforming prior parameter-efficient baselines
under similar budgets. On a Jetson Orin Nano, TT-SVD initialization and
selective-core training yield 1.4-3.8x faster convergence to target F1.
LoRA-Edge thus makes structure-aligned, parameter-efficient on-device CNN
adaptation practical for edge platforms.

### [2] [SILVI: Simple Interface for Labeling Video Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03819)
*Ozan Kanbertay,Richard Vogg,Elif Karakoc,Peter M. Kappeler,Claudia Fichtel,Alexander S. Ecker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SILVI is an open-source labeling software that enables annotation of behaviors and interactions in video data, bridging the gap between behavioral labeling and individual localization for computer vision model training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing annotation tools either support behavioral labeling without localization of individuals, or localization without capturing interactions - a crucial gap for understanding social animal behavior.

Method: Developed SILVI as an open-source labeling software that integrates both behavioral annotation and individual localization functionalities directly within video data.

Result: SILVI generates structured outputs suitable for training and validating computer vision models, facilitating automated approaches for fine-grained behavioral analyses.

Conclusion: SILVI bridges behavioral ecology with computer vision and could be broadly useful for annotating interactions in various video contexts beyond animal behavior, such as human interaction analysis.

Abstract: Computer vision methods are increasingly used for the automated analysis of
large volumes of video data collected through camera traps, drones, or direct
observations of animals in the wild. While recent advances have focused
primarily on detecting individual actions, much less work has addressed the
detection and annotation of interactions -- a crucial aspect for understanding
social and individualized animal behavior. Existing open-source annotation
tools support either behavioral labeling without localization of individuals,
or localization without the capacity to capture interactions. To bridge this
gap, we present SILVI, an open-source labeling software that integrates both
functionalities. SILVI enables researchers to annotate behaviors and
interactions directly within video data, generating structured outputs suitable
for training and validating computer vision models. By linking behavioral
ecology with computer vision, SILVI facilitates the development of automated
approaches for fine-grained behavioral analyses. Although developed primarily
in the context of animal behavior, SILVI could be useful more broadly to
annotate human interactions in other videos that require extracting dynamic
scene graphs. The software, along with documentation and download instructions,
is available at: https://gitlab.gwdg.de/kanbertay/interaction-labelling-app.

### [3] [Noise Injection: Improving Out-of-Distribution Generalization for Limited Size Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03855)
*Duong Mai,Lawrence Hall*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Noise injection during training improves generalization of COVID-19 detection models from chest X-rays by reducing performance gap between in-distribution and out-of-distribution data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for COVID-19 detection from chest X-rays fail to generalize to new clinical sources due to learning source-specific shortcuts rather than meaningful biomarkers.

Method: Applied fundamental noise injection techniques (Gaussian, Speckle, Poisson, and Salt and Pepper) during model training to improve robustness to distribution shifts.

Result: Significantly reduced performance gap between in-distribution and out-of-distribution evaluation from 0.10-0.20 to 0.01-0.06 across key metrics (AUC, F1, accuracy, recall, specificity).

Conclusion: Noise injection is an effective technique for improving model generalization in medical imaging by reducing reliance on source-specific artifacts.

Abstract: Deep learned (DL) models for image recognition have been shown to fail to
generalize to data from different devices, populations, etc. COVID-19 detection
from Chest X-rays (CXRs), in particular, has been shown to fail to generalize
to out-of-distribution (OOD) data from new clinical sources not covered in the
training set. This occurs because models learn to exploit shortcuts -
source-specific artifacts that do not translate to new distributions - rather
than reasonable biomarkers to maximize performance on in-distribution (ID)
data. Rendering the models more robust to distribution shifts, our study
investigates the use of fundamental noise injection techniques (Gaussian,
Speckle, Poisson, and Salt and Pepper) during training. Our empirical results
demonstrate that this technique can significantly reduce the performance gap
between ID and OOD evaluation from 0.10-0.20 to 0.01-0.06, based on results
averaged over ten random seeds across key metrics such as AUC, F1, accuracy,
recall and specificity. Our source code is publicly available at

### [4] [Investigating Robot Control Policy Learning for Autonomous X-ray-guided Spine Procedures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03882)
*Florence Klitzner,Blanca Inigo,Benjamin D. Killeen,Lalithkumar Seenivasan,Michelle Song,Axel Krieger,Mathias Unberath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Imitation learning policies for X-ray-guided spine cannula insertion achieve 68.5% success rate on first attempt in simulation, showing potential for CT-free robotic spinal navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether imitation learning applies to X-ray-guided procedures like spine instrumentation, given the complexity of interpreting multi-view X-rays.

Method: Developed an in silico sandbox for realistic simulation of X-ray-guided spine procedures, curated dataset of correct trajectories and bi-planar X-ray sequences, trained imitation learning policies for planning and open-loop control based on visual information.

Result: Policy succeeded on first attempt in 68.5% of cases, maintained safe trajectories across diverse vertebral levels, generalized to complex anatomy including fractures, and remained robust to varied initializations. Rollouts on real X-rays showed plausible trajectories despite simulation-only training.

Conclusion: Promising preliminary results but limitations in entry point precision. Full closed-loop control requires more frequent feedback. With robust priors and domain knowledge, such models could enable lightweight CT-free robotic spinal navigation.

Abstract: Imitation learning-based robot control policies are enjoying renewed interest
in video-based robotics. However, it remains unclear whether this approach
applies to X-ray-guided procedures, such as spine instrumentation. This is
because interpretation of multi-view X-rays is complex. We examine
opportunities and challenges for imitation policy learning in bi-plane-guided
cannula insertion. We develop an in silico sandbox for scalable, automated
simulation of X-ray-guided spine procedures with a high degree of realism. We
curate a dataset of correct trajectories and corresponding bi-planar X-ray
sequences that emulate the stepwise alignment of providers. We then train
imitation learning policies for planning and open-loop control that iteratively
align a cannula solely based on visual information. This precisely controlled
setup offers insights into limitations and capabilities of this method. Our
policy succeeded on the first attempt in 68.5% of cases, maintaining safe
intra-pedicular trajectories across diverse vertebral levels. The policy
generalized to complex anatomy, including fractures, and remained robust to
varied initializations. Rollouts on real bi-planar X-rays further suggest that
the model can produce plausible trajectories, despite training exclusively in
simulation. While these preliminary results are promising, we also identify
limitations, especially in entry point precision. Full closed-look control will
require additional considerations around how to provide sufficiently frequent
feedback. With more robust priors and domain knowledge, such models may provide
a foundation for future efforts toward lightweight and CT-free robotic
intra-operative spinal navigation.

### [5] [Desert Waste Detection and Classification Using Data-Based and Model-Based Enhanced YOLOv12 DL Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03888)
*Abdulmumin Sa'ad,Sulaimon Oyeniyi Adebayo,Abdul Jabbar Siddiqui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Enhanced YOLOv12 with Self-Adversarial Training and specialized data augmentation achieves real-time waste detection in desert environments with improved accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the global waste crisis by developing automated detection systems for remote/harsh environments like deserts, overcoming limitations of traditional methods and current research that focuses mainly on urban areas and recyclable materials.

Method: Proposed a pruned, lightweight YOLOv12 framework integrated with Self-Adversarial Training (SAT) and specialized data augmentation strategies, tested on DroneTrashNet dataset.

Result: Significant improvements in precision, recall, and mAP while achieving low latency and compact model size suitable for deployment on resource-constrained aerial drones. Outperformed state-of-the-art lightweight YOLO variants.

Conclusion: Combining data-centric and model-centric enhancements provides an effective solution for robust, real-time waste detection in challenging desert environments.

Abstract: The global waste crisis is escalating, with solid waste generation expected
to increase by 70% by 2050. Traditional waste collection methods, particularly
in remote or harsh environments like deserts, are labor-intensive, inefficient,
and often hazardous. Recent advances in computer vision and deep learning have
opened the door to automated waste detection systems, yet most research focuses
on urban environments and recyclable materials, overlooking organic and
hazardous waste and underexplored terrains such as deserts. In this work, we
propose an enhanced real-time object detection framework based on a pruned,
lightweight version of YOLOv12 integrated with Self-Adversarial Training (SAT)
and specialized data augmentation strategies. Using the DroneTrashNet dataset,
we demonstrate significant improvements in precision, recall, and mean average
precision (mAP), while achieving low latency and compact model size suitable
for deployment on resource-constrained aerial drones. Benchmarking our model
against state-of-the-art lightweight YOLO variants further highlights its
optimal balance of accuracy and efficiency. Our results validate the
effectiveness of combining data-centric and model-centric enhancements for
robust, real-time waste detection in desert environments.

### [6] [Improving Diagnostic Performance on Small and Imbalanced Datasets Using Class-Based Input Image Composition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03891)
*Hlali Azzeddine,Majid Ben Yakhlef,Soulaiman El Hazzat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Class-Based Image Composition creates composite images from multiple same-class images to enhance intra-class variance and information density, improving model performance on imbalanced datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges of small, imbalanced datasets and poor image quality that lead to high false prediction rates in deep learning models.

Method: Fusion of multiple images of the same class into Composite Input Images (CoImg) using 3x1 layout composites, creating a balanced dataset (Co-OCTDL) from the original imbalanced OCTDL dataset.

Result: Achieved near-perfect accuracy (99.6%), F1-score (0.995), and AUC (0.9996) with significantly lower false prediction rates compared to baseline model trained on raw dataset.

Conclusion: The method effectively improves diagnostic results and produces high-quality predictions even for weak datasets affected by class imbalance or small sample size.

Abstract: Small, imbalanced datasets and poor input image quality can lead to high
false predictions rates with deep learning models. This paper introduces
Class-Based Image Composition, an approach that allows us to reformulate
training inputs through a fusion of multiple images of the same class into
combined visual composites, named Composite Input Images (CoImg). That enhances
the intra-class variance and improves the valuable information density per
training sample and increases the ability of the model to distinguish between
subtle disease patterns. Our method was evaluated on the Optical Coherence
Tomography Dataset for Image-Based Deep Learning Methods (OCTDL) (Kulyabin et
al., 2024), which contains 2,064 high-resolution optical coherence tomography
(OCT) scans of the human retina, representing seven distinct diseases with a
significant class imbalance. We constructed a perfectly class-balanced version
of this dataset, named Co-OCTDL, where each scan is resented as a 3x1 layout
composite image. To assess the effectiveness of this new representation, we
conducted a comparative analysis between the original dataset and its variant
using a VGG16 model. A fair comparison was ensured by utilizing the identical
model architecture and hyperparameters for all experiments. The proposed
approach markedly improved diagnostic results.The enhanced Dataset achieved
near-perfect accuracy (99.6%) with F1-score (0.995) and AUC (0.9996), compared
to a baseline model trained on raw dataset. The false prediction rate was also
significantly lower, this demonstrates that the method can producehigh-quality
predictions even for weak datasets affected by class imbalance or small sample
size.

### [7] [I Detect What I Don't Know: Incremental Anomaly Learning with Stochastic Weight Averaging-Gaussian for Oracle-Free Medical Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03912)
*Nand Kumar Yadav,Rodrigue Rizk,William CW Chen,KC Santosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unsupervised anomaly detection framework for medical imaging that incrementally expands normal samples without labels using lightweight adapters and uncertainty-gated admission.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of unknown anomaly detection in medical imaging where labeled anomalies are scarce and expert supervision is costly.

Method: Uses frozen pretrained vision backbone with tiny convolutional adapters, k-NN anomaly scoring with compact coreset, and dual probabilistic gates (z-score threshold + SWAG-based epistemic uncertainty) for safe sample admission.

Result: Substantial performance gains: COVID-CXR ROC-AUC 0.9489→0.9982, Pneumonia CXR ROC-AUC 0.6834→0.8968, Brain MRI ND-5 ROC-AUC 0.6041→0.7269 and PR-AUC 0.7539→0.8211.

Conclusion: The framework is effective and efficient for real-world label-scarce medical imaging applications, steadily refining normality without generative reconstruction or replay buffers.

Abstract: Unknown anomaly detection in medical imaging remains a fundamental challenge
due to the scarcity of labeled anomalies and the high cost of expert
supervision. We introduce an unsupervised, oracle-free framework that
incrementally expands a trusted set of normal samples without any anomaly
labels. Starting from a small, verified seed of normal images, our method
alternates between lightweight adapter updates and uncertainty-gated sample
admission. A frozen pretrained vision backbone is augmented with tiny
convolutional adapters, ensuring rapid domain adaptation with negligible
computational overhead. Extracted embeddings are stored in a compact coreset
enabling efficient k-nearest neighbor anomaly (k-NN) scoring. Safety during
incremental expansion is enforced by dual probabilistic gates, a sample is
admitted into the normal memory only if its distance to the existing coreset
lies within a calibrated z-score threshold, and its SWAG-based epistemic
uncertainty remains below a seed-calibrated bound. This mechanism prevents
drift and false inclusions without relying on generative reconstruction or
replay buffers. Empirically, our system steadily refines the notion of
normality as unlabeled data arrive, producing substantial gains over baselines.
On COVID-CXR, ROC-AUC improves from 0.9489 to 0.9982 (F1: 0.8048 to 0.9746); on
Pneumonia CXR, ROC-AUC rises from 0.6834 to 0.8968; and on Brain MRI ND-5,
ROC-AUC increases from 0.6041 to 0.7269 and PR-AUC from 0.7539 to 0.8211. These
results highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework
for real-world, label-scarce medical imaging applications.

### [8] [Adaptive Temporal Refinement: Continuous Depth Allocation and Distance Regression for Efficient Action Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03943)
*Ibne Farabi Shihab,Sanjeda Akter,Anuj Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BDR improves temporal action localization through optimal boundary distance regression, while ATR enables adaptive computation allocation via continuous depth selection, achieving better performance with less computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current temporal action localization methods apply uniform computation despite significant variations in boundary difficulty, leading to inefficient resource usage.

Method: Two complementary approaches: Boundary Distance Regression (BDR) for optimal localization via signed-distance regression, and Adaptive Temporal Refinement (ATR) for computation allocation through continuous depth selection with end-to-end differentiable optimization.

Result: BDR achieves 43% sharper boundary peaks and 1.8-3.1% mAP@0.7 improvements across architectures. ATR achieves 56.5% mAP@0.7 at 162G FLOPs vs 53.6% at 198G for uniform processing, with 4.2% improvement on short actions. Lightweight students retain 99% performance.

Conclusion: The proposed methods provide significant improvements in temporal action localization efficiency and performance, with validated results across multiple benchmarks and statistical testing.

Abstract: Temporal action localization requires precise boundary detection; however,
current methods apply uniform computation despite significant variations in
difficulty across boundaries. We present two complementary contributions.
First, Boundary Distance Regression (BDR) provides information-theoretically
optimal localization through signed-distance regression rather than
classification, achieving 43\% sharper boundary peaks. BDR retrofits to
existing methods with approximately 50 lines of code, yielding consistent 1.8
to 3.1\% mAP@0.7 improvements across diverse architectures. Second, Adaptive
Temporal Refinement (ATR) allocates computation via continuous depth selection
$\tau \in [0,1]$, enabling end-to-end differentiable optimization without
reinforcement learning. On THUMOS14, ATR achieves 56.5\% mAP@0.7 at 162G FLOPs,
compared to 53.6\% at 198G for uniform processing, providing a 2.9\%
improvement with 18\% less compute. Gains scale with boundary heterogeneity,
showing 4.2\% improvement on short actions. Training cost is mitigated via
knowledge distillation, with lightweight students retaining 99\% performance at
baseline cost. Results are validated across four benchmarks with rigorous
statistical testing.

### [9] [Improving Multi-View Reconstruction via Texture-Guided Gaussian-Mesh Joint Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03950)
*Zhejia Cai,Puhua Jiang,Shiwei Mao,Hongkun Cao,Ruqi Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unified framework for joint optimization of mesh geometry and appearance using Gaussian-guided differentiable rendering, enabling high-quality 3D reconstruction for downstream editing tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods decouple geometry and appearance optimization, prioritizing either geometric accuracy or photorealistic rendering, which hinders downstream editing tasks.

Method: Simultaneously optimizes mesh geometry (vertex positions and faces) and vertex colors via Gaussian-guided mesh differentiable rendering, leveraging photometric consistency and geometric regularization from normal and depth maps.

Result: Obtains high-quality 3D reconstruction that can be exploited in downstream editing tasks like relighting and shape deformation.

Conclusion: Proposes a unified treatment of geometry and appearance optimization for seamless Gaussian-mesh joint optimization, enabling better 3D reconstruction for editing applications.

Abstract: Reconstructing real-world objects from multi-view images is essential for
applications in 3D editing, AR/VR, and digital content creation. Existing
methods typically prioritize either geometric accuracy (Multi-View Stereo) or
photorealistic rendering (Novel View Synthesis), often decoupling geometry and
appearance optimization, which hinders downstream editing tasks. This paper
advocates an unified treatment on geometry and appearance optimization for
seamless Gaussian-mesh joint optimization. More specifically, we propose a
novel framework that simultaneously optimizes mesh geometry (vertex positions
and faces) and vertex colors via Gaussian-guided mesh differentiable rendering,
leveraging photometric consistency from input images and geometric
regularization from normal and depth maps. The obtained high-quality 3D
reconstruction can be further exploit in down-stream editing tasks, such as
relighting and shape deformation. The code will be publicly available upon
acceptance.

*Zhong Chen,Changfeng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a linear fractional transformation parameter to decouple main lens and micro lens array for light field camera calibration, with analytical solution and nonlinear refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate calibration of internal parameters is crucial but challenging for 3D reconstruction using light field cameras.

Method: Uses linear fractional transformation parameter α to decouple main lens and micro lens array, with analytical solution based on least squares followed by nonlinear refinement, plus feature detection from raw images.

Result: Experimental results on both physical and simulated data verify the method's performance. The model enables faster simulation of raw light field images, which is important for data-driven deep learning methods.

Conclusion: The proposed calibration method effectively addresses the challenge of light field camera parameter calibration and enables faster simulation for deep learning applications.

Abstract: Accurate calibration of internal parameters is a crucial yet challenging
prerequisite for 3D reconstruction using light field cameras. In this paper, we
propose a linear fractional transformation(LFT) parameter $\alpha$ to decoupled
the main lens and micro lens array (MLA). The proposed method includes an
analytical solution based on least squares, followed by nonlinear refinement.
The method for detecting features from the raw images is also introduced.
Experimental results on both physical and simulated data have verified the
performance of proposed method. Based on proposed model, the simulation of raw
light field images becomes faster, which is crucial for data-driven deep
learning methods. The corresponding code can be obtained from the author's

### [11] [Room Envelopes: A Synthetic Dataset for Indoor Layout Reconstruction from Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03970)
*Sam Bahrami,Dylan Campbell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A synthetic dataset called Room Envelopes is introduced to help reconstruct complete scene layouts by predicting both visible surfaces and structural surfaces behind occlusions using monocular geometry estimators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current scene reconstruction methods only recover visible surfaces, leading to incomplete reconstructions that miss occluded structural elements like walls, floors, and ceilings, which should be easier to predict due to their planar, repetitive nature.

Method: Created a synthetic dataset with RGB images and two pointmaps per image: one for visible surfaces and one for structural layout surfaces after removing fixtures. This enables direct supervision for feed-forward monocular geometry estimators to predict both surface types.

Result: The dataset facilitates training models that can understand both the visible scene and the underlying structural layout, capturing the scene's full extent and object locations.

Conclusion: The Room Envelopes dataset enables more complete scene reconstruction by allowing models to predict both visible and structural surfaces, providing better understanding of scene extent and object geometry.

Abstract: Modern scene reconstruction methods are able to accurately recover 3D
surfaces that are visible in one or more images. However, this leads to
incomplete reconstructions, missing all occluded surfaces. While much progress
has been made on reconstructing entire objects given partial observations using
generative models, the structural elements of a scene, like the walls, floors
and ceilings, have received less attention. We argue that these scene elements
should be relatively easy to predict, since they are typically planar,
repetitive and simple, and so less costly approaches may be suitable. In this
work, we present a synthetic dataset -- Room Envelopes -- that facilitates
progress on this task by providing a set of RGB images and two associated
pointmaps for each image: one capturing the visible surface and one capturing
the first surface once fittings and fixtures are removed, that is, the
structural layout. As we show, this enables direct supervision for feed-forward
monocular geometry estimators that predict both the first visible surface and
the first layout surface. This confers an understanding of the scene's extent,
as well as the shape and location of its objects.

### [12] [Simple 3D Pose Features Support Human and Machine Social Scene Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03988)
*Wenshuo Qin,Leyla Isik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3D pose information outperforms AI vision models in predicting human social interaction judgments, with face position and direction being key features that improve AI performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans excel at social interaction recognition from visual input, but AI systems struggle with this task. The authors hypothesized that 3D visuospatial pose information, which is missing in most AI models, is crucial for human social judgment.

Method: Combined pose and depth estimation algorithms to extract 3D joint positions from videos, compared with AI vision models. Derived minimal 3D social pose features focusing on face position and direction.

Result: 3D joint positions outperformed most AI vision models. Minimal face position and direction features matched full joint set performance and improved AI model performance when combined. Representation of 3D social pose features in AI models predicted their ability to match human judgments.

Conclusion: Human social scene understanding relies on explicit 3D pose representations and can be supported by simple visuospatial primitives like face position and direction.

Abstract: Humans can quickly and effortlessly extract a variety of information about
others' social interactions from visual input, ranging from visuospatial cues
like whether two people are facing each other to higher-level information. Yet,
the computations supporting these abilities remain poorly understood, and
social interaction recognition continues to challenge even the most advanced AI
vision systems. Here, we hypothesized that humans rely on 3D visuospatial pose
information to make social interaction judgments, which is absent in most AI
vision models. To test this, we combined state-of-the-art pose and depth
estimation algorithms to extract 3D joint positions of people in short video
clips depicting everyday human actions and compared their ability to predict
human social interaction judgments with current AI vision models. Strikingly,
3D joint positions outperformed most current AI vision models, revealing that
key social information is available in explicit body position but not in the
learned features of most vision models, including even the layer-wise
embeddings of the pose models used to extract joint positions. To uncover the
critical pose features humans use to make social judgments, we derived a
compact set of 3D social pose features describing only the 3D position and
direction of faces in the videos. We found that these minimal descriptors
matched the predictive strength of the full set of 3D joints and significantly
improved the performance of off-the-shelf AI vision models when combined with
their embeddings. Moreover, the degree to which 3D social pose features were
represented in each off-the-shelf AI vision model predicted the model's ability
to match human social judgments. Together, our findings provide strong evidence
that human social scene understanding relies on explicit representations of 3D
pose and can be supported by simple, structured visuospatial primitives.

### [13] [CaRF: Enhancing Multi-View Consistency in Referring 3D Gaussian Splatting Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03992)
*Yuwen Tao,Kanglei Zhou,Xin Tan,Yuan Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CaRF is a camera-aware referring field framework that achieves multi-view consistent 3D segmentation by incorporating camera geometry into Gaussian text interactions and using in-training paired view supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D Gaussian segmentation methods struggle with cross-view consistency due to reliance on 2D rendered pseudo supervision and view-specific feature learning.

Method: Proposes Gaussian Field Camera Encoding (GFCE) to incorporate camera geometry into Gaussian text interactions, and In Training Paired View Supervision (ITPVS) to align per Gaussian logits across calibrated views during training.

Result: Achieves average improvements of 16.8%, 4.3%, and 2.0% in mIoU over state-of-the-art methods on Ref LERF, LERF OVS, and 3D OVS datasets respectively.

Conclusion: CaRF promotes more reliable and view-consistent 3D scene understanding with benefits for embodied AI, AR/VR interaction, and autonomous perception.

Abstract: Referring 3D Gaussian Splatting Segmentation (R3DGS) aims to interpret
free-form language expressions and localize the corresponding 3D regions in
Gaussian fields. While recent advances have introduced cross-modal alignment
between language and 3D geometry, existing pipelines still struggle with
cross-view consistency due to their reliance on 2D rendered pseudo supervision
and view specific feature learning. In this work, we present Camera Aware
Referring Field (CaRF), a fully differentiable framework that operates directly
in the 3D Gaussian space and achieves multi view consistency. Specifically,
CaRF introduces Gaussian Field Camera Encoding (GFCE), which incorporates
camera geometry into Gaussian text interactions to explicitly model view
dependent variations and enhance geometric reasoning. Building on this, In
Training Paired View Supervision (ITPVS) is proposed to align per Gaussian
logits across calibrated views during training, effectively mitigating single
view overfitting and exposing inter view discrepancies for optimization.
Extensive experiments on three representative benchmarks demonstrate that CaRF
achieves average improvements of 16.8%, 4.3%, and 2.0% in mIoU over state of
the art methods on the Ref LERF, LERF OVS, and 3D OVS datasets, respectively.
Moreover, this work promotes more reliable and view consistent 3D scene
understanding, with potential benefits for embodied AI, AR/VR interaction, and
autonomous perception.

### [14] [PhysCorr: Dual-Reward DPO for Physics-Constrained Text-to-Video Generation with Automated Preference Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03997)
*Peiyao Wang,Weining Wang,Qi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhysCorr is a framework that improves physical consistency in text-to-video generation by modeling, evaluating, and optimizing physical plausibility through PhysicsRM reward model and PhyDPO optimization pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-video generation models produce visually impressive results but often violate fundamental physical principles, limiting their practical deployment in domains like embodied AI, robotics, and simulations.

Method: Proposes PhysicsRM - a dual-dimensional reward model quantifying intra-object stability and inter-object interactions, and PhyDPO - a direct preference optimization pipeline with contrastive feedback and physics-aware reweighting.

Result: Extensive experiments show PhysCorr achieves significant improvements in physical realism while maintaining visual fidelity and semantic alignment across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: This work represents a critical advancement toward physically grounded and trustworthy video generation that can be integrated into various video diffusion and transformer-based models.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video generation have achieved impressive
perceptual quality, yet generated content often violates fundamental principles
of physical plausibility - manifesting as implausible object dynamics,
incoherent interactions, and unrealistic motion patterns. Such failures hinder
the deployment of video generation models in embodied AI, robotics, and
simulation-intensive domains. To bridge this gap, we propose PhysCorr, a
unified framework for modeling, evaluating, and optimizing physical consistency
in video generation. Specifically, we introduce PhysicsRM, the first
dual-dimensional reward model that quantifies both intra-object stability and
inter-object interactions. On this foundation, we develop PhyDPO, a novel

integration into a wide range of video diffusion and transformer-based
backbones. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
PhysCorr achieves significant improvements in physical realism while preserving

TL;DR: GNN-MoE enhances Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for domain generalization in Vision Transformers using a Mixture-of-Experts framework with graph neural network routing on inter-patch graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard fine-tuning of pretrained ViTs for domain generalization is computationally expensive and can harm generalization performance, creating a need for efficient adaptation methods.

Method: Proposes GNN-MoE framework using efficient Kronecker adapters and a novel GNN router (GCN, GAT, SAGE) that operates on inter-patch graphs to dynamically assign patches to specialized experts, enabling context-aware routing based on inter-patch relationships.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance on domain generalization benchmarks while maintaining high parameter efficiency.

Conclusion: Graph-based contextual routing is effective for robust and lightweight domain generalization in Vision Transformers.

Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) seeks robust Vision Transformer (ViT) performance
on unseen domains. Efficiently adapting pretrained ViTs for DG is challenging;
standard fine-tuning is costly and can impair generalization. We propose
GNN-MoE, enhancing Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for DG with a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework using efficient Kronecker adapters. Instead
of token-based routing, a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) router (GCN, GAT,
SAGE) operates on inter-patch graphs to dynamically assign patches to
specialized experts. This context-aware GNN routing leverages inter-patch
relationships for better adaptation to domain shifts. GNN-MoE achieves
state-of-the-art or competitive DG benchmark performance with high parameter
efficiency, highlighting the utility of graph-based contextual routing for
robust, lightweight DG.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedDChest is a Vision Transformer model pre-trained from scratch on 1.2M medical images for thoracic imaging, using novel content-aware data augmentation, achieving superior performance over ImageNet-pretrained models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the domain gap between natural images and medical imaging that hinders vision model performance in medical applications.

Method: Pre-trained from scratch on 1.2M curated multimodal thoracic images using Guided Random Resized Crops - a content-aware data augmentation that biases sampling towards anatomically relevant regions.

Result: Significantly outperforms strong, publicly available ImageNet-pretrained models across diverse downstream diagnostic tasks.

Conclusion: Large-scale in-domain pre-training combined with domain-specific data augmentation provides a powerful and robust feature extractor for thoracic diagnostic tasks.

Abstract: The performance of vision models in medical imaging is often hindered by the
prevailing paradigm of fine-tuning backbones pre-trained on out-of-domain
natural images. To address this fundamental domain gap, we propose MedDChest, a
new foundational Vision Transformer (ViT) model optimized specifically for
thoracic imaging. We pre-trained MedDChest from scratch on a massive, curated,
multimodal dataset of over 1.2 million images, encompassing different
modalities including Chest X-ray and Computed Tomography (CT) compiled from 10
public sources. A core technical contribution of our work is Guided Random
Resized Crops, a novel content-aware data augmentation strategy that biases
sampling towards anatomically relevant regions, overcoming the inefficiency of
standard cropping techniques on medical scans. We validate our model's
effectiveness by fine-tuning it on a diverse set of downstream diagnostic
tasks. Comprehensive experiments empirically demonstrate that MedDChest
significantly outperforms strong, publicly available ImageNet-pretrained
models. By establishing the superiority of large-scale, in-domain pre-training
combined with domain-specific data augmentation, MedDChest provides a powerful
and robust feature extractor that serves as a significantly better starting
point for a wide array of thoracic diagnostic tasks. The model weights will be
made publicly available to foster future research and applications.

Conclusion: Faithful Contouring surpasses existing methods in accuracy and efficiency for both representation and reconstruction, confirming superior fidelity as a representation for 3D learning tasks.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient voxelized representations of 3D meshes are the
foundation of 3D reconstruction and generation. However, existing
representations based on iso-surface heavily rely on water-tightening or
rendering optimization, which inevitably compromise geometric fidelity. We
propose Faithful Contouring, a sparse voxelized representation that supports
2048+ resolutions for arbitrary meshes, requiring neither converting meshes to
field functions nor extracting the isosurface during remeshing. It achieves
near-lossless fidelity by preserving sharpness and internal structures, even
for challenging cases with complex geometry and topology. The proposed method
also shows flexibility for texturing, manipulation, and editing. Beyond
representation, we design a dual-mode autoencoder for Faithful Contouring,
enabling scalable and detail-preserving shape reconstruction. Extensive
experiments show that Faithful Contouring surpasses existing methods in
accuracy and efficiency for both representation and reconstruction. For direct
representation, it achieves distance errors at the $10^{-5}$ level; for mesh
reconstruction, it yields a 93\% reduction in Chamfer Distance and a 35\%
improvement in F-score over strong baselines, confirming superior fidelity as a

*Arfina Rahman,Mahesh Banavar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight biometric authentication system using PPG signals from fingertip videos achieves 98% accuracy with a hybrid CVT-ConvMixer-LSTM model that combines spatial and temporal features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PPG signals offer non-invasive, liveness-detecting biometric authentication suitable for wearable devices, but face challenges from motion artifacts, illumination changes, and physiological variability.

Method: PPG signals from low-frame-rate fingertip videos are preprocessed (baseline removal, PCA, filtering, resampling, normalization), converted to time-frequency scalograms via CWT, and processed by a hybrid CVT-ConvMixer-LSTM model combining spatial and temporal features.

Result: The system achieved 98% authentication accuracy on 46 subjects, demonstrating robustness to noise and inter-subject variability.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is efficient, scalable, and suitable for real-world mobile and embedded biometric security applications due to its liveness detection capability and robustness.

Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals, which measure changes in blood volume in
the skin using light, have recently gained attention in biometric
authentication because of their non-invasive acquisition, inherent liveness
detection, and suitability for low-cost wearable devices. However, PPG signal
quality is challenged by motion artifacts, illumination changes, and
inter-subject physiological variability, making robust feature extraction and
classification crucial. This study proposes a lightweight and cost-effective
biometric authentication framework based on PPG signals extracted from
low-frame-rate fingertip videos. The CFIHSR dataset, comprising PPG recordings
from 46 subjects at a sampling rate of 14 Hz, is employed for evaluation. The
raw PPG signals undergo a standard preprocessing pipeline involving baseline
drift removal, motion artifact suppression using Principal Component Analysis
(PCA), bandpass filtering, Fourier-based resampling, and amplitude
normalization. To generate robust representations, each one-dimensional PPG
segment is converted into a two-dimensional time-frequency scalogram via the
Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), effectively capturing transient
cardiovascular dynamics. We developed a hybrid deep learning model, termed
CVT-ConvMixer-LSTM, by combining spatial features from the Convolutional Vision
Transformer (CVT) and ConvMixer branches with temporal features from a Long
Short-Term Memory network (LSTM). The experimental results on 46 subjects
demonstrate an authentication accuracy of 98%, validating the robustness of the
model to noise and variability between subjects. Due to its efficiency,
scalability, and inherent liveness detection capability, the proposed system is
well-suited for real-world mobile and embedded biometric security applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Bratrix is a multimodal framework that aligns visual and brain representations with language embeddings using hierarchical semantic decomposition and uncertainty-aware weighting, achieving state-of-the-art performance in EEG, MEG, and fMRI tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods align neural signals directly with visual embeddings but fail to capture latent semantic dimensions due to subject variability and entangled visual features, limiting interpretability and robustness.

Method: Decouples visual stimuli into hierarchical visual/linguistic components, projects them into shared latent space, uses uncertainty perception module for noisy signals, employs learnable language-anchored semantic matrices, and uses two-stage training (single-modality pretraining + multimodal fine-tuning).

Result: Improves retrieval, reconstruction, and captioning performance on EEG, MEG, and fMRI benchmarks, achieving 14.3% improvement in 200-way EEG retrieval task compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Bratrix successfully addresses limitations of visual-only representations by enabling multimodal language-anchored vision-brain alignment, demonstrating superior performance and robustness in neural signal interpretation tasks.

Abstract: Unveiling visual semantics from neural signals such as EEG, MEG, and fMRI
remains a fundamental challenge due to subject variability and the entangled
nature of visual features. Existing approaches primarily align neural activity
directly with visual embeddings, but visual-only representations often fail to
capture latent semantic dimensions, limiting interpretability and deep
robustness. To address these limitations, we propose Bratrix, the first
end-to-end framework to achieve multimodal Language-Anchored Vision-Brain
alignment. Bratrix decouples visual stimuli into hierarchical visual and
linguistic semantic components, and projects both visual and brain
representations into a shared latent space, enabling the formation of aligned
visual-language and brain-language embeddings. To emulate human-like perceptual
reliability and handle noisy neural signals, Bratrix incorporates a novel
uncertainty perception module that applies uncertainty-aware weighting during
alignment. By leveraging learnable language-anchored semantic matrices to
enhance cross-modal correlations and employing a two-stage training strategy of
single-modality pretraining followed by multimodal fine-tuning, Bratrix-M
improves alignment precision. Extensive experiments on EEG, MEG, and fMRI
benchmarks demonstrate that Bratrix improves retrieval, reconstruction, and
captioning performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, specifically
surpassing 14.3% in 200-way EEG retrieval task. Code and model are available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate effective CT image denoising methods that work in unpaired and self-supervised regimes without requiring clean-noisy image pairs.

Method: Evaluated two paradigms: CycleGAN-based residual translator and Noise2Score score-matching denoiser. Conducted configuration sweep to identify optimal CycleGAN settings (U-Net backbone, lambda_cycle=30, lambda_iden=2, ngf=ndf=64) and trained to convergence.

Result: CycleGAN improved noisy input from 34.66 dB/0.9234 SSIM to 38.913 dB/0.971 SSIM, with estimated score of 1.9441 and Kaggle leaderboard score of 1.9343. Noise2Score achieved large gains on very noisy inputs but slightly behind in absolute PSNR/SSIM.

Conclusion: CycleGAN offers strongest final image quality, while Noise2Score provides robust pair-free alternative with competitive performance when clean pairs are unavailable.

Abstract: We study CT image denoising in the unpaired and self-supervised regimes by
evaluating two strong, training-data-efficient paradigms: a CycleGAN-based
residual translator and a Noise2Score (N2S) score-matching denoiser. Under a
common evaluation protocol, a configuration sweep identifies a simple standard
U-Net backbone within CycleGAN (lambda_cycle = 30, lambda_iden = 2, ngf = ndf =
64) as the most reliable setting; we then train it to convergence with a longer
schedule. The selected CycleGAN improves the noisy input from 34.66 dB / 0.9234
SSIM to 38.913 dB / 0.971 SSIM and attains an estimated score of 1.9441 and an
unseen-set (Kaggle leaderboard) score of 1.9343. Noise2Score, while slightly
behind in absolute PSNR / SSIM, achieves large gains over very noisy inputs,
highlighting its utility when clean pairs are unavailable. Overall, CycleGAN
offers the strongest final image quality, whereas Noise2Score provides a robust
pair-free alternative with competitive performance. Source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image segmentation faces challenges with complex anatomical structures and limited annotated data. CNN methods struggle with long-range dependencies, while Transformers are data-hungry and computationally expensive.

Method: Proposes UKAST architecture that integrates rational-function based KANs into Swin Transformer encoders, using Group Rational KANs (GR-KANs) from KAT to address inefficiencies of vanilla spline-based KANs.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on four 2D and 3D medical image segmentation benchmarks, surpassing CNN- and Transformer-based baselines. Particularly effective in data-scarce settings with reduced FLOPs and minimal parameter increase.

Conclusion: KAN-enhanced Transformers show strong potential for advancing data-efficient medical image segmentation, alleviating data-hungry limitations of standard Vision Transformers.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is critical for accurate diagnostics and treatment
planning, but remains challenging due to complex anatomical structures and
limited annotated training data. CNN-based segmentation methods excel at local
feature extraction, but struggle with modeling long-range dependencies.
Transformers, on the other hand, capture global context more effectively, but
are inherently data-hungry and computationally expensive. In this work, we
introduce UKAST, a U-Net like architecture that integrates rational-function
based Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) into Swin Transformer encoders. By
leveraging rational base functions and Group Rational KANs (GR-KANs) from the
Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (KAT), our architecture addresses the
inefficiencies of vanilla spline-based KANs, yielding a more expressive and
data-efficient framework with reduced FLOPs and only a very small increase in
parameter count compared to SwinUNETR. UKAST achieves state-of-the-art
performance on four diverse 2D and 3D medical image segmentation benchmarks,
consistently surpassing both CNN- and Transformer-based baselines. Notably, it
attains superior accuracy in data-scarce settings, alleviating the data-hungry
limitations of standard Vision Transformers. These results show the potential
of KAN-enhanced Transformers to advance data-efficient medical image
segmentation. Code is available at: https://github.com/nsapkota417/UKAST

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpatialLock is a novel framework for precise object localization in text-to-image synthesis, using position-engaged injection and position-guided learning to achieve state-of-the-art IOU scores above 0.9.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image methods fail to fully utilize positional information, leading to inadequate understanding of object spatial layouts and imprecise control over object localization in generated images.

Method: SpatialLock incorporates two components: Position-Engaged Injection (PoI) that directly integrates spatial information through attention layers, and Position-Guided Learning (PoG) that employs perception-based supervision to refine object localization.

Result: Experiments show SpatialLock achieves IOU scores above 0.9 across multiple datasets, setting a new state-of-the-art for precise object positioning in text-to-image synthesis.

Conclusion: SpatialLock enables precise control over object spatial arrangements and improves visual quality of generated images by effectively leveraging perception signals and grounding information.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) synthesis has made significant advancements in recent
years, driving applications such as generating datasets automatically. However,
precise control over object localization in generated images remains a
challenge. Existing methods fail to fully utilize positional information,
leading to an inadequate understanding of object spatial layouts. To address
this issue, we propose SpatialLock, a novel framework that leverages perception
signals and grounding information to jointly control the generation of spatial
locations. SpatialLock incorporates two components: Position-Engaged Injection
(PoI) and Position-Guided Learning (PoG). PoI directly integrates spatial
information through an attention layer, encouraging the model to learn the
grounding information effectively. PoG employs perception-based supervision to
further refine object localization. Together, these components enable the model
to generate objects with precise spatial arrangements and improve the visual
quality of the generated images. Experiments show that SpatialLock sets a new
state-of-the-art for precise object positioning, achieving IOU scores above 0.9
across multiple datasets.

### [23] [Tortoise and Hare Guidance: Accelerating Diffusion Model Inference with Multirate Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04117)
*Yunghee Lee,Byeonghyun Pak,Junwha Hong,Hoseong Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: THG is a training-free diffusion sampling acceleration method that treats classifier-free guidance as a multirate ODE system, allowing different integration frequencies for noise estimation and guidance terms to reduce function evaluations by up to 30% without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional diffusion solvers treat all components equally, failing to exploit the different sensitivity to numerical error between noise estimation and guidance terms, leading to computational redundancy.

Method: Reformulates CFG ODE as multirate system, uses tortoise equation (fine grid) for noise estimate and hare equation (coarse grid) for guidance, with adaptive timestep sampling and guidance-scale scheduling.

Result: Reduces NFE by up to 30% with minimal fidelity loss (ΔImageReward ≤ 0.032), outperforms state-of-the-art CFG-based training-free accelerators under same computation budget.

Conclusion: Multirate formulations offer significant potential for diffusion solver acceleration, enabling real-time high-quality image synthesis without model retraining.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Tortoise and Hare Guidance (THG), a training-free
strategy that accelerates diffusion sampling while maintaining high-fidelity
generation. We demonstrate that the noise estimate and the additional guidance
term exhibit markedly different sensitivity to numerical error by reformulating
the classifier-free guidance (CFG) ODE as a multirate system of ODEs. Our
error-bound analysis shows that the additional guidance branch is more robust
to approximation, revealing substantial redundancy that conventional solvers
fail to exploit. Building on this insight, THG significantly reduces the
computation of the additional guidance: the noise estimate is integrated with
the tortoise equation on the original, fine-grained timestep grid, while the
additional guidance is integrated with the hare equation only on a coarse grid.
We also introduce (i) an error-bound-aware timestep sampler that adaptively
selects step sizes and (ii) a guidance-scale scheduler that stabilizes large
extrapolation spans. THG reduces the number of function evaluations (NFE) by up
to 30% with virtually no loss in generation fidelity ($\Delta$ImageReward
$\leq$ 0.032) and outperforms state-of-the-art CFG-based training-free
accelerators under identical computation budgets. Our findings highlight the
potential of multirate formulations for diffusion solvers, paving the way for
real-time high-quality image synthesis without any model retraining. The source

TL;DR: A training-free diffusion framework for sketch generation that enables precise style control using text prompts and reference sketches, with mechanisms to reduce content leakage and support multi-style generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sketch generation methods lack mechanisms for precise control over sketch styles, focusing mainly on generic synthesis without explicit style guidance.

Method: Training-free diffusion framework that incorporates reference features as auxiliary information with linear smoothing, uses style-content guidance mechanism, and supports multi-style generation via joint AdaIN module.

Result: Achieves high-quality sketch generation with accurate style alignment, reduces content leakage from reference sketches, and improves synthesis quality especially when reference and target sketches have low structural similarity.

Conclusion: The proposed M3S framework provides improved flexibility in style control for sketch generation while maintaining high quality and accurate style alignment without requiring training.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models have facilitated progress in sketch
generation. However, existing specialized methods primarily focus on generic
synthesis and lack mechanisms for precise control over sketch styles. In this
work, we propose a training-free framework based on diffusion models that
enables explicit style guidance via textual prompts and referenced style
sketches. Unlike previous style transfer methods that overwrite key and value
matrices in self-attention, we incorporate the reference features as auxiliary
information with linear smoothing and leverage a style-content guidance
mechanism. This design effectively reduces content leakage from reference
sketches and enhances synthesis quality, especially in cases with low
structural similarity between reference and target sketches. Furthermore, we
extend our framework to support controllable multi-style generation by
integrating features from multiple reference sketches, coordinated via a joint
AdaIN module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
high-quality sketch generation with accurate style alignment and improved
flexibility in style control. The official implementation of M3S is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate marine environment perception through robust MOT is essential for safe vessel navigation and maritime surveillance, but complicated maritime environments cause camera motion and visual degradation that challenge existing MOT methods.

Method: Proposes a parallel tracker with affine compensation featuring: Reversible Columnar Detection Network for robust object detection, lightweight Transformer-based appearance extractor for global context, camera motion estimation branch to decouple platform/target motion, and clustering-optimized feature fusion module combining motion and appearance cues.

Result: Extensive evaluations on Singapore Maritime Dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with fastest runtime among ReID-based MOT frameworks while maintaining high identity consistency and robustness to jitter and occlusion.

Conclusion: DMSORT effectively addresses maritime MOT challenges by compensating for camera motion and combining robust detection with appearance features, achieving superior performance and efficiency for maritime surveillance applications.

Abstract: Accurate perception of the marine environment through robust multi-object
tracking (MOT) is essential for ensuring safe vessel navigation and effective
maritime surveillance. However, the complicated maritime environment often
causes camera motion and subsequent visual degradation, posing significant
challenges to MOT. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient
Dual-branch Maritime SORT (DMSORT) method for maritime MOT. The core of the
framework is a parallel tracker with affine compensation, which incorporates an
object detection and re-identification (ReID) branch, along with a dedicated
branch for dynamic camera motion estimation. Specifically, a Reversible
Columnar Detection Network (RCDN) is integrated into the detection module to
leverage multi-level visual features for robust object detection. Furthermore,
a lightweight Transformer-based appearance extractor (Li-TAE) is designed to
capture global contextual information and generate robust appearance features.
Another branch decouples platform-induced and target-intrinsic motion by
constructing a projective transformation, applying platform-motion compensation
within the Kalman filter, and thereby stabilizing true object trajectories.
Finally, a clustering-optimized feature fusion module effectively combines
motion and appearance cues to ensure identity consistency under noise,
occlusion, and drift. Extensive evaluations on the Singapore Maritime Dataset
demonstrate that DMSORT achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, DMSORT
attains the fastest runtime among existing ReID-based MOT frameworks while
maintaining high identity consistency and robustness to jitter and occlusion.

TL;DR: A framework that enables computer-use agents to learn from online video tutorials at inference time by retrieving, filtering, and converting videos into structured demonstration trajectories with dynamic selection for in-context guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Computer-use agents lag behind humans in tasks requiring domain-specific procedural knowledge, while humans can effectively learn from video tutorials by selectively imitating relevant segments.

Method: Proposes a framework that retrieves tutorial videos, converts them into structured trajectories using VLM for UI action inference, segments videos into action subsequences with textual objectives, and uses two-stage dynamic selection to choose the most helpful guidance at each execution step.

Result: Experiments on two benchmarks show consistent outperformance over base agents and text-only variants, highlighting the importance of trajectory segmentation, selection, action filtering, and visual information.

Conclusion: Online videos can be systematically distilled into actionable guidance that improves computer-use agents at inference time, with the proposed framework demonstrating effective learning from visual demonstrations.

Abstract: Computer-use agents can operate computers and automate laborious tasks, but
despite recent rapid progress, they still lag behind human users, especially
when tasks require domain-specific procedural knowledge about particular
applications, platforms, and multi-step workflows. Humans can bridge this gap
by watching video tutorials: we search, skim, and selectively imitate short
segments that match our current subgoal. In this paper, we study how to enable
computer-use agents to learn from online videos at inference time effectively.
We propose a framework that retrieves and filters tutorial videos, converts
them into structured demonstration trajectories, and dynamically selects
trajectories as in-context guidance during execution. Particularly, using a
VLM, we infer UI actions, segment videos into short subsequences of actions,
and assign each subsequence a textual objective. At inference time, a two-stage
selection mechanism dynamically chooses a single trajectory to add in context
at each step, focusing the agent on the most helpful local guidance for its
next decision. Experiments on two widely used benchmarks show that our
framework consistently outperforms strong base agents and variants that use
only textual tutorials or transcripts. Analyses highlight the importance of
trajectory segmentation and selection, action filtering, and visual
information, suggesting that abundant online videos can be systematically
distilled into actionable guidance that improves computer-use agents at
inference time. Our code is available at

correct orientation of scanned or photographed documents remains a critical
pre-processing step in the real world settings. Accurate rotation correction is
essential for enhancing the performance of downstream tasks such as Optical
Character Recognition (OCR) where misalignment commonly arises due to user
errors, particularly incorrect base orientations of the camera during capture.
In this study, we first introduce OCR-Rotation-Bench (ORB), a new benchmark for
evaluating OCR robustness to image rotations, comprising (i) ORB-En, built from
rotation-transformed structured and free-form English OCR datasets, and (ii)
ORB-Indic, a novel multilingual set spanning 11 Indic mid to low-resource
languages. We also present a fast, robust and lightweight rotation
classification pipeline built on the vision encoder of Phi-3.5-Vision model
with dynamic image cropping, fine-tuned specifically for 4-class rotation task
in a standalone fashion. Our method achieves near-perfect 96% and 92% accuracy
on identifying the rotations respectively on both the datasets. Beyond
classification, we demonstrate the critical role of our module in boosting OCR
performance: closed-source (up to 14%) and open-weights models (up to 4x) in
the simulated real-world setting.

*Fatemehzahra Darzi,Rodrigo Escobar Diaz Guerrero,Thomas Bocklitz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Study shows that CycleGAN color transformation before registration achieves lowest errors for aligning H&E stained images with non-linear multimodal images in digital pathology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate registration of images from different modalities is essential in digital pathology for comparing and integrating information from different stains or imaging modalities.

Method: Used 20 tissue sample pairs with various preprocessing steps (CycleGAN, Macenko, Reinhard, Vahadane color transformations, inversion, contrast adjustment, normalization, denoising), registered using VALIS method with rigid then non-rigid registration, evaluated using relative Target Registration Error (rTRE).

Result: CycleGAN color transformation achieved the lowest registration errors in both scenarios (original and inverted multimodal images), while other methods showed higher errors.

Conclusion: Applying color transformation before registration improves alignment between images from different modalities and supports more reliable analysis in digital pathology.

Abstract: Image registration refers to the process of spatially aligning two or more
images by mapping them into a common coordinate system, so that corresponding
anatomical or tissue structures are matched across images. In digital
pathology, registration enables direct comparison and integration of
information from different stains or imaging modalities, sup-porting
applications such as biomarker analysis and tissue reconstruction. Accurate
registration of images from different modalities is an essential step in
digital pathology. In this study, we investigated how various color
transformation techniques affect image registration between hematoxylin and
eosin (H&E) stained images and non-linear multimodal images. We used a dataset
of 20 tissue sample pairs, with each pair undergoing several preprocessing
steps, including different color transformation (CycleGAN, Macenko, Reinhard,
Vahadane), inversion, contrast adjustment, intensity normalization, and
denoising. All images were registered using the VALIS registration method,
which first applies rigid registration and then performs non-rigid registration
in two steps on both low and high-resolution images. Registration performance
was evaluated using the relative Target Registration Error (rTRE). We reported
the median of median rTRE values (MMrTRE) and the average of median rTRE values
(AMrTRE) for each method. In addition, we performed a custom point-based
evaluation using ten manually selected key points. Registration was done
separately for two scenarios, using either the original or inverted multimodal
images. In both scenarios, CycleGAN color transformation achieved the lowest
registration errors, while the other methods showed higher errors. These
findings show that applying color transformation before registration improves
alignment between images from different modalities and supports more reliable
analysis in digital pathology.

*Josef Mayr,Anna Reithmeir,Maxime Di Folco,Julia A. Schnabel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Covariance descriptors from pre-trained vision encoders outperform handcrafted features in medical image classification, with SPDNet achieving state-of-the-art results when combined with DINOv2 features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Covariance descriptors have shown strong performance in general computer vision but remain underexplored in medical imaging. The paper investigates their effectiveness for medical image classification.

Method: Proposed constructing covariance descriptors from features extracted by pre-trained general vision encoders (DINOv2 and MedSAM) and comparing them with handcrafted descriptors. Evaluated on eleven datasets from MedMNSIT benchmark using SPDNet for classification.

Result: Covariance descriptors from GVE features consistently outperform handcrafted features. SPDNet with DINOv2 features yields superior performance to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Combining covariance descriptors with powerful pretrained vision encoders shows strong potential for medical image analysis.

Abstract: Covariance descriptors capture second-order statistics of image features.
They have shown strong performance in general computer vision tasks, but remain
underexplored in medical imaging. We investigate their effectiveness for both
conventional and learning-based medical image classification, with a particular
focus on SPDNet, a classification network specifically designed for symmetric
positive definite (SPD) matrices. We propose constructing covariance
descriptors from features extracted by pre-trained general vision encoders
(GVEs) and comparing them with handcrafted descriptors. Two GVEs - DINOv2 and
MedSAM - are evaluated across eleven binary and multi-class datasets from the
MedMNSIT benchmark. Our results show that covariance descriptors derived from
GVE features consistently outperform those derived from handcrafted features.
Moreover, SPDNet yields superior performance to state-of-the-art methods when
combined with DINOv2 features. Our findings highlight the potential of
combining covariance descriptors with powerful pretrained vision encoders for
medical image analysis.

*Hanmo Chen,Chenghao Xu,Jiexi Yan,Cheng Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Adaptive Statistics Fusor (AStF) with skewness and kurtosis for better motion style transfer, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional style transfer methods using mean and variance are insufficient for motion data due to complex dynamic patterns and spatiotemporal coherence properties.

Method: Developed AStF with Style Disentanglement Module and High-Order Multi-Statistics Attention, trained with Motion Consistency Regularization discriminator.

Result: Experimental results show AStF achieves superior performance in motion style transfers by comprehensively modeling spatiotemporal statistical patterns.

Conclusion: Incorporating skewness and kurtosis provides a more comprehensive statistical model for motion style transfer, leading to improved realism and reduced rigidity.

Abstract: Human motion style transfer allows characters to appear less rigidity and
more realism with specific style. Traditional arbitrary image style transfer
typically process mean and variance which is proved effective. Meanwhile,
similar methods have been adapted for motion style transfer. However, due to
the fundamental differences between images and motion, relying on mean and
variance is insufficient to fully capture the complex dynamic patterns and
spatiotemporal coherence properties of motion data. Building upon this, our key
insight is to bring two more coefficient, skewness and kurtosis, into the
analysis of motion style. Specifically, we propose a novel Adaptive Statistics
Fusor (AStF) which consists of Style Disentanglement Module (SDM) and
High-Order Multi-Statistics Attention (HOS-Attn). We trained our AStF in
conjunction with a Motion Consistency Regularization (MCR) discriminator.
Experimental results show that, by providing a more comprehensive model of the
spatiotemporal statistical patterns inherent in dynamic styles, our proposed
AStF shows proficiency superiority in motion style transfers over
state-of-the-arts. Our code and model are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper adapts Sapiens, a human-centric foundation model for pose estimation, to medical imaging for anatomical landmark detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets with significant improvements over both generalist and specialist models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the untapped potential of human-centric foundation models for anatomical landmark detection in medical imaging, leveraging their inherent optimization for spatial pose localization as strong priors for medical tasks.

Method: Adaptation of the Sapiens foundation model through multi-dataset pretraining to create MedSapiens, specifically designed for anatomical landmark detection in medical images.

Result: MedSapiens achieves up to 5.26% improvement over generalist models and up to 21.81% improvement over specialist models in average success detection rate (SDR), with 2.69% improvement in few-shot settings.

Conclusion: Human-centric foundation models provide strong priors for anatomical landmark detection and can be effectively adapted to medical imaging, establishing new state-of-the-art performance while demonstrating excellent adaptability to limited-data scenarios.

Abstract: This paper does not introduce a novel architecture; instead, it revisits a
fundamental yet overlooked baseline: adapting human-centric foundation models
for anatomical landmark detection in medical imaging. While landmark detection
has traditionally relied on domain-specific models, the emergence of
large-scale pre-trained vision models presents new opportunities. In this
study, we investigate the adaptation of Sapiens, a human-centric foundation
model designed for pose estimation, to medical imaging through multi-dataset
pretraining, establishing a new state of the art across multiple datasets. Our
proposed model, MedSapiens, demonstrates that human-centric foundation models,
inherently optimized for spatial pose localization, provide strong priors for
anatomical landmark detection, yet this potential has remained largely
untapped. We benchmark MedSapiens against existing state-of-the-art models,
achieving up to 5.26% improvement over generalist models and up to 21.81%
improvement over specialist models in the average success detection rate (SDR).
To further assess MedSapiens adaptability to novel downstream tasks with few
annotations, we evaluate its performance in limited-data settings, achieving
2.69% improvement over the few-shot state of the art in SDR. Code and model
weights are available at https://github.com/xmed-lab/MedSapiens .

*Claudio Giusti,Luca Guarnera,Sebastiano Battiato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proto-LeakNet is an interpretable attribution framework that detects signal leaks in diffusion model outputs for AI image and deepfake forensics, achieving 98.13% Macro AUC without retraining for unseen generators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing sophistication of synthetic image and deepfake generation models makes source attribution and authenticity verification critical challenges for computer vision systems.

Method: Uses signal-leak-aware framework with closed-set classification and density-based open-set evaluation on learned embeddings. Re-simulates partial forward diffusion to expose generator-specific cues, employs temporal attention encoder for multi-step latent features, and feature-weighted prototype head for transparent attribution.

Result: Achieves 98.13% Macro AUC, learns robust latent geometry that withstands post-processing, surpasses state-of-the-art methods, and achieves strong separability between known and unseen generators.

Conclusion: Modeling signal-leak bias in latent space enables reliable and interpretable AI-image and deepfake forensics.

Abstract: The growing sophistication of synthetic image and deepfake generation models
has turned source attribution and authenticity verification into a critical
challenge for modern computer vision systems. Recent studies suggest that
diffusion pipelines unintentionally imprint persistent statistical traces,
known as signal leaks, within their outputs, particularly in latent
representations. Building on this observation, we propose Proto-LeakNet, a
signal-leak-aware and interpretable attribution framework that integrates
closed-set classification with a density-based open-set evaluation on the
learned embeddings, enabling analysis of unseen generators without retraining.
Operating in the latent domain of diffusion models, our method re-simulates
partial forward diffusion to expose residual generator-specific cues. A
temporal attention encoder aggregates multi-step latent features, while a
feature-weighted prototype head structures the embedding space and enables
transparent attribution. Trained solely on closed data and achieving a Macro
AUC of 98.13%, Proto-LeakNet learns a latent geometry that remains robust under
post-processing, surpassing state-of-the-art methods, and achieves strong
separability between known and unseen generators. These results demonstrate
that modeling signal-leak bias in latent space enables reliable and
interpretable AI-image and deepfake forensics. The code for the whole work will
be available upon submission.

*Yujie Yang,Shuang Li,Jun Ye,Neng Dong,Fan Li,Huafeng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes DinoGRL framework using DINOv2 to learn gait features for video-based visible-infrared person re-identification, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on modality-invariant visual features but overlook gait features, which are modality-invariant and rich in temporal dynamics, limiting cross-modal video matching capabilities.

Method: Uses DINOv2-Driven Gait Representation Learning with Semantic-Aware Silhouette and Gait Learning model and Progressive Bidirectional Multi-Granularity Enhancement module to refine features through bidirectional interactions between gait and appearance streams.

Result: Extensive experiments on HITSZ-VCM and BUPT datasets demonstrate superiority, significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively leverages gait features complementary to appearance cues for robust cross-modal video person re-identification.

Abstract: Video-based Visible-Infrared person re-identification (VVI-ReID) aims to
retrieve the same pedestrian across visible and infrared modalities from video
sequences. Existing methods tend to exploit modality-invariant visual features
but largely overlook gait features, which are not only modality-invariant but
also rich in temporal dynamics, thus limiting their ability to model the
spatiotemporal consistency essential for cross-modal video matching. To address
these challenges, we propose a DINOv2-Driven Gait Representation Learning
(DinoGRL) framework that leverages the rich visual priors of DINOv2 to learn
gait features complementary to appearance cues, facilitating robust
sequence-level representations for cross-modal retrieval. Specifically, we
introduce a Semantic-Aware Silhouette and Gait Learning (SASGL) model, which
generates and enhances silhouette representations with general-purpose semantic
priors from DINOv2 and jointly optimizes them with the ReID objective to
achieve semantically enriched and task-adaptive gait feature learning.
Furthermore, we develop a Progressive Bidirectional Multi-Granularity
Enhancement (PBMGE) module, which progressively refines feature representations
by enabling bidirectional interactions between gait and appearance streams
across multiple spatial granularities, fully leveraging their complementarity
to enhance global representations with rich local details and produce highly
discriminative features. Extensive experiments on HITSZ-VCM and BUPT datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our approach, significantly outperforming
existing state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastGS is a novel acceleration framework for 3D Gaussian splatting that uses multi-view consistency to regulate Gaussian density, achieving 3.32x-15.45x training speedup while maintaining comparable rendering quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGS acceleration methods fail to properly regulate Gaussian numbers during training, causing redundant computational overhead and inefficient training.

Method: Proposes a densification and pruning strategy based on multi-view consistency, eliminating the need for budgeting mechanisms to efficiently manage Gaussian importance.

Result: Achieves 3.32x training acceleration on Mip-NeRF 360 and 15.45x acceleration on Deep Blending compared to vanilla 3DGS, with comparable rendering quality to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: FastGS demonstrates strong generality across various tasks (dynamic scenes, surface reconstruction, SLAM) with 2-7x acceleration, providing an efficient solution to the training speed vs. quality trade-off.

Abstract: The dominant 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) acceleration methods fail to
properly regulate the number of Gaussians during training, causing redundant
computational time overhead. In this paper, we propose FastGS, a novel, simple,
and general acceleration framework that fully considers the importance of each
Gaussian based on multi-view consistency, efficiently solving the trade-off
between training time and rendering quality. We innovatively design a
densification and pruning strategy based on multi-view consistency, dispensing
with the budgeting mechanism. Extensive experiments on Mip-NeRF 360, Tanks &
Temples, and Deep Blending datasets demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in training speed, achieving a
3.32$\times$ training acceleration and comparable rendering quality compared
with DashGaussian on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset and a 15.45$\times$ acceleration
compared with vanilla 3DGS on the Deep Blending dataset. We demonstrate that
FastGS exhibits strong generality, delivering 2-7$\times$ training acceleration
across various tasks, including dynamic scene reconstruction, surface
reconstruction, sparse-view reconstruction, large-scale reconstruction, and
simultaneous localization and mapping. The project page is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Domain-specific vision foundation model for herbicide trials outperforms general-purpose models in species identification and damage classification, especially under unseen conditions, while reducing annotation requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose vision models have limited performance in agriculture due to fine-grained distinctions needed for species identification and herbicide damage assessment.

Method: Adapted a general-purpose vision foundation model using self-supervised learning on a large curated agricultural dataset to learn transferable representations optimized for herbicide trial images.

Result: Significant improvements in species identification (F1 from 0.91 to 0.94) and damage classification (from 0.26 to 0.33), with even greater gains under unseen conditions and strong performance in domain-shift scenarios like drone imagery.

Conclusion: Domain-specific pretraining enhances generalization capabilities and reduces manual annotation efforts, offering a scalable automated solution for herbicide trial analysis.

Abstract: Herbicide field trials require accurate identification of plant species and
assessment of herbicide-induced damage across diverse environments. While
general-purpose vision foundation models have shown promising results in
complex visual domains, their performance can be limited in agriculture, where
fine-grained distinctions between species and damage types are critical.
  In this work, we adapt a general-purpose vision foundation model to herbicide
trial characterization. Trained using a self-supervised learning approach on a
large, curated agricultural dataset, the model learns rich and transferable
representations optimized for herbicide trials images.
  Our domain-specific model significantly outperforms the best general-purpose
foundation model in both species identification (F1 score improvement from 0.91
to 0.94) and damage classification (from 0.26 to 0.33). Under unseen conditions
(new locations and other time), it achieves even greater gains (species
identification from 0.56 to 0.66; damage classification from 0.17 to 0.27). In
domain-shift scenarios, such as drone imagery, it maintains strong performance
(species classification from 0.49 to 0.60).
  Additionally, we show that domain-specific pretraining enhances segmentation
accuracy, particularly in low-annotation regimes. An annotation-efficiency
analysis reveals that, under unseen conditions, the domain-specific model
achieves 5.4% higher F1 score than the general-purpose model, while using 80%
fewer labeled samples.
  These results demonstrate the generalization capabilities of domain-specific
foundation models and their potential to significantly reduce manual annotation
efforts, offering a scalable and automated solution for herbicide trial
analysis.

*Robin Spanier,Thorsten Hoeser,Claudia Kuenzer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Using synthetic data with YOLOv10 models improves offshore infrastructure detection, achieving F1 score of 0.90 and demonstrating geographic transferability across unseen regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for effective monitoring of expanding marine infrastructure, addressing data scarcity and class imbalance in underrepresented object classes for robust detection models.

Method: Trained YOLOv10 object detection models using synthetic and real Sentinel-1 satellite imagery from four regions, evaluated geographic transferability on three unseen regions.

Result: Detected 3,529 offshore platforms across three test regions, achieved F1 score of 0.85 (improved to 0.90 with synthetic data), demonstrating successful generalization beyond training areas.

Conclusion: Synthetic data generation effectively addresses dataset imbalance challenges, enabling globally transferable offshore infrastructure detection and scalable monitoring using deep learning.

Abstract: The recent and ongoing expansion of marine infrastructure, including offshore
wind farms, oil and gas platforms, artificial islands, and aquaculture
facilities, highlights the need for effective monitoring systems. The
development of robust models for offshore infrastructure detection relies on
comprehensive, balanced datasets, but falls short when samples are scarce,
particularly for underrepresented object classes, shapes, and sizes. By
training deep learning-based YOLOv10 object detection models with a combination
of synthetic and real Sentinel-1 satellite imagery acquired in the fourth
quarter of 2023 from four regions (Caspian Sea, South China Sea, Gulf of
Guinea, and Coast of Brazil), this study investigates the use of synthetic
training data to enhance model performance. We evaluated this approach by
applying the model to detect offshore platforms in three unseen regions (Gulf
of Mexico, North Sea, Persian Gulf) and thereby assess geographic
transferability. This region-holdout evaluation demonstrated that the model
generalises beyond the training areas. In total, 3,529 offshore platforms were
detected, including 411 in the North Sea, 1,519 in the Gulf of Mexico, and
1,593 in the Persian Gulf. The model achieved an F1 score of 0.85, which
improved to 0.90 upon incorporating synthetic data. We analysed how synthetic
data enhances the representation of unbalanced classes and overall model
performance, taking a first step toward globally transferable detection of
offshore infrastructure. This study underscores the importance of balanced
datasets and highlights synthetic data generation as an effective strategy to
address common challenges in remote sensing, demonstrating the potential of
deep learning for scalable, global offshore infrastructure monitoring.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-video models often fail with concise prompts due to limited textual semantics understanding, and existing text encoders cannot rephrase prompts online to better align with user intentions, limiting model scalability and usability.

Method: Proposes RISE-T2V framework with a Rephrasing Adapter that uses text hidden states during LLM's next token prediction as video generation condition, enabling implicit prompt rephrasing into more comprehensive representations.

Result: Extensive experiments show RISE-T2V significantly enhances T2V models' ability to generate high-quality videos aligned with user intent, applicable to various video diffusion model architectures.

Conclusion: RISE-T2V is a versatile framework that improves text-to-video generation by integrating prompt rephrasing and semantic extraction, enabling better alignment with user intentions and broader T2V task capabilities.

Abstract: Most text-to-video(T2V) diffusion models depend on pre-trained text encoders
for semantic alignment, yet they often fail to maintain video quality when
provided with concise prompts rather than well-designed ones. The primary issue
lies in their limited textual semantics understanding. Moreover, these text
encoders cannot rephrase prompts online to better align with user intentions,
which limits both the scalability and usability of the models, To address these
challenges, we introduce RISE-T2V, which uniquely integrates the processes of
prompt rephrasing and semantic feature extraction into a single and seamless
step instead of two separate steps. RISE-T2V is universal and can be applied to
various pre-trained LLMs and video diffusion models(VDMs), significantly
enhancing their capabilities for T2V tasks. We propose an innovative module
called the Rephrasing Adapter, enabling diffusion models to utilize text hidden
states during the next token prediction of the LLM as a condition for video
generation. By employing a Rephrasing Adapter, the video generation model can
implicitly rephrase basic prompts into more comprehensive representations that
better match the user's intent. Furthermore, we leverage the powerful
capabilities of LLMs to enable video generation models to accomplish a broader
range of T2V tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RISE-T2V is a
versatile framework applicable to different video diffusion model
architectures, significantly enhancing the ability of T2V models to generate
high-quality videos that align with user intent. Visual results are available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual tumor delineation in radiological images is specialized, time-consuming, and a bottleneck for clinical quantitative analysis. Current 3D segmentation methods face impracticality due to large voxel counts, requiring downsampling or patches with traditional CNNs.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) voxel sparsification to reduce computational load, 2) submanifold sparse convolutional networks enabling high-resolution 3D segmentation without downsampling.

Result: Achieved competitive results on KiTS23 renal cancer dataset: 95.8% Dice for kidneys+masses, 85.7% for tumors+cysts, 80.3% for tumors alone. Computational improvements: 60% reduction in inference time and 75% reduction in VRAM usage compared to dense architectures.

Conclusion: The proposed method enables high-resolution 3D tumor segmentation with state-of-the-art accuracy while significantly reducing computational requirements, making automated segmentation more practical for clinical applications.

Abstract: The accurate delineation of tumours in radiological images like Computed
Tomography is a very specialised and time-consuming task, and currently a
bottleneck preventing quantitative analyses to be performed routinely in the
clinical setting. For this reason, developing methods for the automated
segmentation of tumours in medical imaging is of the utmost importance and has
driven significant efforts in recent years. However, challenges regarding the
impracticality of 3D scans, given the large amount of voxels to be analysed,
usually requires the downsampling of such images or using patches thereof when
applying traditional convolutional neural networks. To overcome this problem,
in this paper we propose a new methodology that uses, divided into two stages,
voxel sparsification and submanifold sparse convolutional networks. This method
allows segmentations to be performed with high-resolution inputs and a native
3D model architecture, obtaining state-of-the-art accuracies while
significantly reducing the computational resources needed in terms of GPU
memory and time. We studied the deployment of this methodology in the context
of Computed Tomography images of renal cancer patients from the KiTS23
challenge, and our method achieved results competitive with the challenge
winners, with Dice similarity coefficients of 95.8% for kidneys + masses, 85.7%
for tumours + cysts, and 80.3% for tumours alone. Crucially, our method also
offers significant computational improvements, achieving up to a 60% reduction
in inference time and up to a 75\% reduction in VRAM usage compared to an
equivalent dense architecture, across both CPU and various GPU cards tested.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates how sensor occlusions affect 3D object detection performance in BEVFusion architecture, showing LiDAR is more critical than cameras for fusion performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of sensor occlusions (from fog, haze, obstructions) on 3D detection accuracy in BEV-based fusion systems, which is underexplored despite their strong performance.

Method: Used BEVFusion architecture evaluated on nuScenes dataset, measuring detection performance with mAP and NDS metrics under various camera and LiDAR occlusion scenarios.

Result: Camera-only detection drops 41.3% under moderate occlusion; LiDAR drops 47.3% under heavy occlusion. In fusion, camera occlusion causes minor 4.1% drop while LiDAR occlusion causes significant 26.8% drop, showing stronger reliance on LiDAR.

Conclusion: The model relies more heavily on LiDAR for 3D detection, highlighting the need for occlusion-aware evaluation methods and improved fusion techniques to handle sensor degradation in adverse conditions.

Abstract: Accurate 3D object detection is essential for automated vehicles to navigate
safely in complex real-world environments. Bird's Eye View (BEV)
representations, which project multi-sensor data into a top-down spatial
format, have emerged as a powerful approach for robust perception. Although
BEV-based fusion architectures have demonstrated strong performance through
multimodal integration, the effects of sensor occlusions, caused by
environmental conditions such as fog, haze, or physical obstructions, on 3D
detection accuracy remain underexplored. In this work, we investigate the
impact of occlusions on both camera and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)
outputs using the BEVFusion architecture, evaluated on the nuScenes dataset.
Detection performance is measured using mean Average Precision (mAP) and the
nuScenes Detection Score (NDS). Our results show that moderate camera
occlusions lead to a 41.3% drop in mAP (from 35.6% to 20.9%) when detection is
based only on the camera. On the other hand, LiDAR sharply drops in performance
only under heavy occlusion, with mAP falling by 47.3% (from 64.7% to 34.1%),
with a severe impact on long-range detection. In fused settings, the effect
depends on which sensor is occluded: occluding the camera leads to a minor 4.1%
drop (from 68.5% to 65.7%), while occluding LiDAR results in a larger 26.8%
drop (to 50.1%), revealing the model's stronger reliance on LiDAR for the task
of 3D object detection. Our results highlight the need for future research into
occlusion-aware evaluation methods and improved sensor fusion techniques that
can maintain detection accuracy in the presence of partial sensor failure or
degradation due to adverse environmental conditions.

Conclusion: Enables wider adoption of deep learning in analytical chemistry by offering practical, step-by-step guidance for extracting spatial features without requiring model training expertise.

Abstract: Background In analytical chemistry, spatial information about materials is
commonly captured through imaging techniques, such as traditional color cameras
or with advanced hyperspectral cameras and microscopes. However, efficiently
extracting and analyzing this spatial information for exploratory and
predictive purposes remains a challenge, especially when using traditional
chemometric methods. Recent advances in deep learning and artificial
intelligence have significantly enhanced image processing capabilities,
enabling the extraction of multiscale deep features that are otherwise
challenging to capture with conventional image processing techniques. Despite
the wide availability of open-source deep learning models, adoption in
analytical chemistry remains limited because of the absence of structured,
step-by-step guidance for implementing these models.
  Results This tutorial aims to bridge this gap by providing a step-by-step
guide for applying deep learning approaches to extract spatial information from
imaging data and integrating it with other data sources, such as spectral
information. Importantly, the focus of this work is not on training deep
learning models for image processing but on using existing open source models
to extract deep features from imaging data.
  Significance The tutorial provides MATLAB code tutorial demonstrations,
showcasing the processing of imaging data from various imaging modalities
commonly encountered in analytical chemistry. Readers must run the tutorial
steps on their own datasets using the codes presented in this tutorial.

Abstract: Depth estimation is one of the key technologies for realizing 3D perception
in unmanned systems. Monocular depth estimation has been widely researched
because of its low-cost advantage, but the existing methods face the challenges

depth maps on embedded systems and significantly improves boundary quality.
Firstly, we design an Enhanced Feature Adaptive Fusion Module (EFAF) which
adaptively fuses depth features to enhance boundary detail representation.
Secondly, we integrate semantic knowledge into the encoder to improve the
object recognition and boundary perception capabilities. Finally, BoRe-Depth is
deployed on NVIDIA Jetson Orin, and runs efficiently at 50.7 FPS. We
demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms previous
lightweight models on multiple challenging datasets, and we provide detailed
ablation studies for the proposed methods. The code is available at

### [46] [HideAndSeg: an AI-based tool with automated prompting for octopus segmentation in natural habitats](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04426)
*Alan de Aguiar,Michaella Pereira Andrade,Charles Morphy D. Santos,João Paulo Gois*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HideAndSeg is a minimally supervised AI tool that combines SAM2 and YOLOv11 to automatically segment octopuses in videos, using unsupervised metrics to evaluate quality without ground-truth data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Analyzing octopuses in natural habitats is difficult due to their camouflage, rapid skin changes, non-rigid deformations, occlusions, and challenging underwater conditions, compounded by the lack of large annotated datasets.

Method: Integrates SAM2 with custom-trained YOLOv11 detector. Starts with user-provided point coordinates for initial SAM2 masks, then uses these to train YOLO model. The pipeline becomes fully automated using bounding box prompts to SAM2, eliminating manual intervention.

Result: Achieves satisfactory performance, reduces segmentation noise compared to manual prompting, and can re-identify octopuses after complete occlusion where manual methods fail.

Conclusion: Provides a practical tool that reduces manual analysis needs and enables more efficient behavioral studies of wild cephalopods through automated video segmentation.

Abstract: Analyzing octopuses in their natural habitats is challenging due to their
camouflage capability, rapid changes in skin texture and color, non-rigid body
deformations, and frequent occlusions, all of which are compounded by variable
underwater lighting and turbidity. Addressing the lack of large-scale annotated
datasets, this paper introduces HideAndSeg, a novel, minimally supervised
AI-based tool for segmenting videos of octopuses. It establishes a quantitative
baseline for this task. HideAndSeg integrates SAM2 with a custom-trained
YOLOv11 object detector. First, the user provides point coordinates to generate
the initial segmentation masks with SAM2. These masks serve as training data
for the YOLO model. After that, our approach fully automates the pipeline by
providing a bounding box prompt to SAM2, eliminating the need for further
manual intervention. We introduce two unsupervised metrics - temporal
consistency $DICE_t$ and new component count $NC_t$ - to quantitatively
evaluate segmentation quality and guide mask refinement in the absence of
ground-truth data, i.e., real-world information that serves to train, validate,
and test AI models. Results show that HideAndSeg achieves satisfactory
performance, reducing segmentation noise compared to the manually prompted
approach. Our method can re-identify and segment the octopus even after periods
of complete occlusion in natural environments, a scenario in which the manually
prompted model fails. By reducing the need for manual analysis in real-world
scenarios, this work provides a practical tool that paves the way for more
efficient behavioral studies of wild cephalopods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a computational solver for convex partition jigsaw puzzles, expanding beyond traditional square puzzles by using geometric and pictorial compatibility measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing jigsaw puzzle solvers only handle square puzzles, which severely limits their practical applications. The authors aim to expand computational puzzle solving to handle convex partitions - a major subset of polygonal puzzles with convex pieces.

Method: The authors utilize both geometrical and pictorial compatibilities between puzzle pieces and introduce a greedy solver algorithm specifically designed for convex partition puzzles.

Result: The paper reports several performance measures and introduces the first benchmark dataset for convex partition puzzles, providing a foundation for future research in this expanded puzzle domain.

Conclusion: This work significantly expands the types of puzzles that can be handled computationally by focusing on convex partitions, moving beyond the limitations of traditional square jigsaw puzzle solvers and enabling broader practical applications.

Abstract: Jigsaw puzzle solving requires the rearrangement of unordered pieces into
their original pose in order to reconstruct a coherent whole, often an image,
and is known to be an intractable problem. While the possible impact of
automatic puzzle solvers can be disruptive in various application domains, most
of the literature has focused on developing solvers for square jigsaw puzzles,
severely limiting their practical use. In this work, we significantly expand
the types of puzzles handled computationally, focusing on what is known as
Convex Partitions, a major subset of polygonal puzzles whose pieces are convex.
We utilize both geometrical and pictorial compatibilities, introduce a greedy
solver, and report several performance measures next to the first benchmark
dataset of such puzzles.

TL;DR: V-Thinker is a multimodal reasoning assistant that enables interactive vision-centric thinking through reinforcement learning, featuring automated dataset evolution and progressive training curriculum.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LMMs lack deep integration of image interaction with long-horizon reasoning, constrained by limited visual tools and task-specific workflows.

Method: Two key components: Data Evolution Flywheel for automated dataset synthesis and evolution, and Visual Progressive Training Curriculum with point-level supervision and two-stage reinforcement learning.

Result: V-Thinker consistently outperforms strong LMM baselines in both general and interactive reasoning scenarios, as validated by VTBench benchmark.

Conclusion: The approach provides valuable insights for advancing image-interactive reasoning applications and represents a step toward more capable multimodal reasoning systems.

Abstract: Empowering Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to deeply integrate image
interaction with long-horizon reasoning capabilities remains a long-standing
challenge in this field. Recent advances in vision-centric reasoning explore a
promising "Thinking with Images" paradigm for LMMs, marking a shift from
image-assisted reasoning to image-interactive thinking. While this milestone
enables models to focus on fine-grained image regions, progress remains
constrained by limited visual tool spaces and task-specific workflow designs.
To bridge this gap, we present V-Thinker, a general-purpose multimodal
reasoning assistant that enables interactive, vision-centric thinking through
end-to-end reinforcement learning. V-Thinker comprises two key components: (1)
a Data Evolution Flywheel that automatically synthesizes, evolves, and verifies
interactive reasoning datasets across three dimensions-diversity, quality, and
difficulty; and (2) a Visual Progressive Training Curriculum that first aligns
perception via point-level supervision, then integrates interactive reasoning
through a two-stage reinforcement learning framework. Furthermore, we introduce
VTBench, an expert-verified benchmark targeting vision-centric interactive
reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that V-Thinker consistently
outperforms strong LMM-based baselines in both general and interactive
reasoning scenarios, providing valuable insights for advancing
image-interactive reasoning applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Landslides cause severe damage, but conventional deep learning models struggle with cross-sensor, cross-region applications and limited training data, requiring more robust solutions.

Method: Three-axis analytical framework (sensor, label, domain) for adapting geospatial foundation models, using global pretraining, self-supervision, and adaptable fine-tuning with Prithvi-EO-2.0.

Result: Consistently outperforms task-specific CNNs (U-Net, U-Net++), vision transformers (Segformer, SwinV2-B), and other GeoFMs (TerraMind, SatMAE), showing resilience to spectral variation and better generalization.

Conclusion: GeoFMs represent a step toward more robust and scalable landslide risk reduction, though challenges remain in computational cost and limited AI-ready training data availability.

Abstract: Landslides cause severe damage to lives, infrastructure, and the environment,
making accurate and timely mapping essential for disaster preparedness and
response. However, conventional deep learning models often struggle when
applied across different sensors, regions, or under conditions of limited
training data. To address these challenges, we present a three-axis analytical
framework of sensor, label, and domain for adapting geospatial foundation
models (GeoFMs), focusing on Prithvi-EO-2.0 for landslide mapping. Through a
series of experiments, we show that it consistently outperforms task-specific
CNNs (U-Net, U-Net++), vision transformers (Segformer, SwinV2-B), and other
GeoFMs (TerraMind, SatMAE). The model, built on global pretraining,
self-supervision, and adaptable fine-tuning, proved resilient to spectral
variation, maintained accuracy under label scarcity, and generalized more
reliably across diverse datasets and geographic settings. Alongside these
strengths, we also highlight remaining challenges such as computational cost
and the limited availability of reusable AI-ready training data for landslide
research. Overall, our study positions GeoFMs as a step toward more robust and
scalable approaches for landslide risk reduction and environmental monitoring.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a comprehensive 8-metric evaluation framework for talking head video generation, addressing current limitations in assessment methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation advances have outpaced evaluation metrics, with limited metrics available for talking head generation assessment.

Method: Developed an evaluation framework with 8 metrics across three dimensions: quality, naturalness, and synchronization, focusing on efficiency and human preference alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments on 85,000 videos from 17 state-of-the-art models revealed that while lip synchronization is strong, models struggle with expressiveness and artifact-free details.

Conclusion: The proposed benchmark framework enables better evaluation of generative methods, with plans for public release and regular updates to track field progress.

Abstract: Video generation has achieved remarkable progress, with generated videos
increasingly resembling real ones. However, the rapid advance in generation has
outpaced the development of adequate evaluation metrics. Currently, the
assessment of talking head generation primarily relies on limited metrics,
evaluating general video quality, lip synchronization, and on conducting user
studies. Motivated by this, we propose a new evaluation framework comprising 8
metrics related to three dimensions (i) quality, (ii) naturalness, and (iii)
synchronization. In selecting the metrics, we place emphasis on efficiency, as
well as alignment with human preferences. Based on this considerations, we
streamline to analyze fine-grained dynamics of head, mouth, and eyebrows, as
well as face quality. Our extensive experiments on 85,000 videos generated by
17 state-of-the-art models suggest that while many algorithms excel in lip
synchronization, they face challenges with generating expressiveness and
artifact-free details. These videos were generated based on a novel real
dataset, that we have curated, in order to mitigate bias of training data. Our
proposed benchmark framework is aimed at evaluating the improvement of
generative methods. Original code, dataset and leaderboards will be publicly
released and regularly updated with new methods, in order to reflect progress
in the field.

TL;DR: STC-Net is a novel framework for automated surgical complexity assessment in Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy using the Parkland Grading Scale, operating on full videos with weak temporal supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate assessment of surgical complexity is crucial in LC, where severe inflammation leads to longer operative times and increased complications. Current methods lack automation for full video analysis without manual curation.

Method: STC-Net performs joint temporal localization and grading through localization, window proposal, and grading modules. It uses a novel loss combining hard/soft localization objectives and background-aware grading supervision.

Result: On 1,859 LC videos, STC-Net achieved 62.11% accuracy and 61.42% F1-score, outperforming non-localized baselines by over 10% in both metrics.

Conclusion: STC-Net provides a scalable and effective approach for automated PGS-based surgical complexity estimation from full LC videos, promising for post-operative analysis and surgical training.

Abstract: Purpose: Accurate assessment of surgical complexity is essential in
Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy (LC), where severe inflammation is associated with
longer operative times and increased risk of postoperative complications. The
Parkland Grading Scale (PGS) provides a clinically validated framework for
stratifying inflammation severity; however, its automation in surgical videos
remains largely unexplored, particularly in realistic scenarios where complete
videos must be analyzed without prior manual curation. Methods: In this work,
we introduce STC-Net, a novel framework for SingleTimestamp-based Complexity
estimation in LC via the PGS, designed to operate under weak temporal
supervision. Unlike prior methods limited to static images or manually trimmed
clips, STC-Net operates directly on full videos. It jointly performs temporal
localization and grading through a localization, window proposal, and grading
module. We introduce a novel loss formulation combining hard and soft
localization objectives and background-aware grading supervision. Results:
Evaluated on a private dataset of 1,859 LC videos, STC-Net achieves an accuracy
of 62.11% and an F1-score of 61.42%, outperforming non-localized baselines by
over 10% in both metrics and highlighting the effectiveness of weak supervision
for surgical complexity assessment. Conclusion: STC-Net demonstrates a scalable
and effective approach for automated PGS-based surgical complexity estimation
from full LC videos, making it promising for post-operative analysis and
surgical training.

TL;DR: Introduces 'Thinking with Video' paradigm using video generation models like Sora-2 to overcome limitations of text-only and image-only reasoning, achieving strong performance on vision and text tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of 'Thinking with Text' and 'Thinking with Images' paradigms: images capture only single moments, and text-vision separation hinders unified multimodal understanding.

Method: Developed VideoThinkBench with vision-centric (Eyeballing Puzzles) and text-centric (GSM8K, MMMU) tasks, evaluated Sora-2 video generation model using self-consistency and in-context learning techniques.

Result: Sora-2 comparable to SOTA VLMs on vision tasks, surpasses them on Eyeballing Games; achieves 92% accuracy on MATH and 75.53% on MMMU for text tasks; performance improved with self-consistency and in-context learning.

Conclusion: Video generation models like Sora-2 serve as potential unified multimodal understanding and generation models, establishing 'thinking with video' as a unified multimodal reasoning paradigm.

Abstract: "Thinking with Text" and "Thinking with Images" paradigm significantly
improve the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) and Vision
Language Models (VLMs). However, these paradigms have inherent limitations. (1)
Images capture only single moments and fail to represent dynamic processes or
continuous changes, and (2) The separation of text and vision as distinct
modalities, hindering unified multimodal understanding and generation. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce "Thinking with Video", a new paradigm
that leverages video generation models, such as Sora-2, to bridge visual and
textual reasoning in a unified temporal framework. To support this exploration,
we developed the Video Thinking Benchmark (VideoThinkBench). VideoThinkBench
encompasses two task categories: (1) vision-centric tasks (e.g., Eyeballing
Puzzles), and (2) text-centric tasks (e.g., subsets of GSM8K, MMMU). Our
evaluation establishes Sora-2 as a capable reasoner. On vision-centric tasks,
Sora-2 is generally comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) VLMs, and even
surpasses VLMs on several tasks, such as Eyeballing Games. On text-centric
tasks, Sora-2 achieves 92% accuracy on MATH, and 75.53% accuracy on MMMU.
Furthermore, we systematically analyse the source of these abilities. We also
find that self-consistency and in-context learning can improve Sora-2's
performance. In summary, our findings demonstrate that the video generation
model is the potential unified multimodal understanding and generation model,
positions "thinking with video" as a unified multimodal reasoning paradigm.

TL;DR: UniSplat is a feed-forward framework for dynamic 3D scene reconstruction in autonomous driving that addresses sparse, non-overlapping camera views through unified spatio-temporal fusion using a 3D latent scaffold.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with sparse, non-overlapping camera views and complex scene dynamics in autonomous driving scenarios.

Method: Constructs a 3D latent scaffold using pretrained foundation models, implements efficient spatio-temporal fusion, and uses a dual-branch decoder combining point-anchored refinement with voxel-based generation to create dynamic-aware Gaussians.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis and provides robust, high-quality renderings even for viewpoints outside original camera coverage.

Conclusion: UniSplat enables complete and detailed dynamic scene reconstruction with persistent memory for streaming scene completion beyond current camera coverage.

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D reconstruction for autonomous driving has advanced rapidly,
yet existing methods struggle with the joint challenges of sparse,
non-overlapping camera views and complex scene dynamics. We present UniSplat, a
general feed-forward framework that learns robust dynamic scene reconstruction
through unified latent spatio-temporal fusion. UniSplat constructs a 3D latent
scaffold, a structured representation that captures geometric and semantic
scene context by leveraging pretrained foundation models. To effectively
integrate information across spatial views and temporal frames, we introduce an
efficient fusion mechanism that operates directly within the 3D scaffold,
enabling consistent spatio-temporal alignment. To ensure complete and detailed
reconstructions, we design a dual-branch decoder that generates dynamic-aware
Gaussians from the fused scaffold by combining point-anchored refinement with
voxel-based generation, and maintain a persistent memory of static Gaussians to
enable streaming scene completion beyond current camera coverage. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that UniSplat achieves
state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis, while providing robust
and high-quality renderings even for viewpoints outside the original camera
coverage.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PixCLIP enhances CLIP's fine-grained image-text alignment by incorporating visual prompts and processing long textual descriptions using LLM text encoder, achieving state-of-the-art performance in pixel-level interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CLIP models have limitations in fine-grained image-text alignment due to text encoder token length constraints, while MLLMs show that detailed textual descriptions can improve alignment. The goal is to synergistically enhance both visual and textual granularity.

Method: Proposed PixCLIP framework with: 1) Automated annotation pipeline generating pixel-level localized long-form descriptions, creating LongGRIT dataset (1.5M samples); 2) Replacing CLIP's text encoder with LLM; 3) Three-branch pixel-text alignment learning for arbitrary granularity alignment.

Result: PixCLIP demonstrates breakthroughs in pixel-level interaction and handling long-form texts, achieving state-of-the-art performance across various vision-language understanding tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed PixCLIP framework successfully addresses CLIP's limitations by enabling fine-grained alignment between image regions and long textual descriptions, representing a significant advancement in vision-language models.

Abstract: While the Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining(CLIP) model has achieved
remarkable success in a variety of downstream vison language understanding
tasks, enhancing its capability for fine-grained image-text alignment remains
an active research focus. To this end, most existing works adopt the strategy
of explicitly increasing the granularity of visual information processing,
e.g., incorporating visual prompts to guide the model focus on specific local
regions within the image. Meanwhile, researches on Multimodal Large Language
Models(MLLMs) have demonstrated that training with long and detailed textual
descriptions can effectively improve the model's fine-grained vision-language
alignment. However, the inherent token length limitation of CLIP's text encoder
fundamentally limits CLIP to process more granular textual information embedded
in long text sequences. To synergistically leverage the advantages of enhancing
both visual and textual content processing granularity, we propose PixCLIP, a
novel framework designed to concurrently accommodate visual prompt inputs and
process lengthy textual descriptions. Specifically, we first establish an
automated annotation pipeline capable of generating pixel-level localized,
long-form textual descriptions for images. Utilizing this pipeline, we
construct LongGRIT, a high-quality dataset comprising nearly 1.5 million
samples. Secondly, we replace CLIP's original text encoder with the LLM and
propose a three-branch pixel-text alignment learning framework, facilitating
fine-grained alignment between image regions and corresponding textual
descriptions at arbitrary granularity. Experiments demonstrate that PixCLIP
showcases breakthroughs in pixel-level interaction and handling long-form
texts, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: Current evaluation methods for virtual IHC models use texture- and distribution-based metrics that measure image fidelity rather than the accuracy of IHC staining, which doesn't correlate well with pathologist assessment.

Method: Uses color deconvolution to generate masks of IHC-positive pixels from virtual IHC models, then computes stain accuracy metrics (Dice, IoU, Hausdorff distance) between real and virtual IHC without needing expert annotations.

Result: Conventional metrics (FID, PSNR, SSIM) correlate poorly with stain accuracy and pathologist assessment. Paired models (PyramidPix2Pix, AdaptiveNCE) achieve highest stain accuracy, while unpaired diffusion- and GAN-based models are less reliable. Whole-slide images reveal performance declines invisible in patch-based evaluations.

Conclusion: The framework provides a reproducible approach for assessing virtual IHC model quality, which is critical for accelerating translation to routine clinical use by pathologists.

Abstract: Deep learning models can generate virtual immunohistochemistry (IHC) stains
from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) images, offering a scalable and low-cost
alternative to laboratory IHC. However, reliable evaluation of image quality
remains a challenge as current texture- and distribution-based metrics quantify
image fidelity rather than the accuracy of IHC staining. Here, we introduce an
automated and accuracy grounded framework to determine image quality across
sixteen paired or unpaired image translation models. Using color deconvolution,
we generate masks of pixels stained brown (i.e., IHC-positive) as predicted by
each virtual IHC model. We use the segmented masks of real and virtual IHC to
compute stain accuracy metrics (Dice, IoU, Hausdorff distance) that directly
quantify correct pixel - level labeling without needing expert manual
annotations. Our results demonstrate that conventional image fidelity metrics,
including Frechet Inception Distance (FID), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR),
and structural similarity (SSIM), correlate poorly with stain accuracy and
pathologist assessment. Paired models such as PyramidPix2Pix and AdaptiveNCE
achieve the highest stain accuracy, whereas unpaired diffusion- and GAN-based
models are less reliable in providing accurate IHC positive pixel labels.
Moreover, whole-slide images (WSI) reveal performance declines that are
invisible in patch-based evaluations, emphasizing the need for WSI-level
benchmarks. Together, this framework defines a reproducible approach for
assessing the quality of virtual IHC models, a critical step to accelerate
translation towards routine use by pathologists.

*Kylie Cancilla,Alexander Moore,Amar Saini,Carmen Carrano*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A scalable streaming VQA model that is both no-reference and opinion-unaware, using temporal-aware architecture trained on synthetic degradations to predict FR metrics without references at inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VQA methods have limitations: FR metrics need clean references, NR models require costly human labels, and most opinion-unaware methods are image-based and ignore temporal context crucial for video.

Method: Leverage synthetic degradations of DAVIS dataset to train a temporal-aware convolutional architecture that predicts FR metrics (LPIPS, PSNR, SSIM) directly from degraded video without references at inference.

Result: Streaming approach outperforms image-based baseline by generalizing across diverse degradations, and achieves higher correlation with FR metrics compared to BRISQUE baseline.

Conclusion: Temporal modeling is valuable for scalable VQA in real-world vision systems, and the opinion-unaware approach with temporal awareness is effective.

Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) is vital for computer vision tasks, but
existing approaches face major limitations: full-reference (FR) metrics require
clean reference videos, and most no-reference (NR) models depend on training on
costly human opinion labels. Moreover, most opinion-unaware NR methods are
image-based, ignoring temporal context critical for video object detection. In
this work, we present a scalable, streaming-based VQA model that is both
no-reference and opinion-unaware. Our model leverages synthetic degradations of
the DAVIS dataset, training a temporal-aware convolutional architecture to
predict FR metrics (LPIPS , PSNR, SSIM) directly from degraded video, without
references at inference. We show that our streaming approach outperforms our
own image-based baseline by generalizing across diverse degradations,
underscoring the value of temporal modeling for scalable VQA in real-world
vision systems. Additionally, we demonstrate that our model achieves higher
correlation with full-reference metrics compared to BRISQUE, a widely-used
opinion-aware image quality assessment baseline, validating the effectiveness
of our temporal, opinion-unaware approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Polarization-enabled eye tracking (PET) uses polarization-resolved imaging to improve gaze tracking accuracy by revealing additional features on ocular tissues, achieving 10-16% error reduction compared to intensity-only methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance eye tracking by leveraging polarization contrast mechanisms that reveal trackable features on sclera and cornea that are invisible in intensity-only images.

Method: Uses a polarization-filter-array camera with linearly polarized near-infrared illuminator to capture polarization state of light reflected from ocular tissues, combined with CNN-based machine learning models trained on data from 346 participants.

Result: PET reduced median 95th-percentile absolute gaze error by 10-16% compared to intensity baselines under various conditions including eyelid occlusions, eye-relief changes, and pupil-size variation.

Conclusion: Polarization effects provide practical gains for human-computer interaction and position PET as a simple, robust sensing modality for future wearable devices.

Abstract: Polarization-resolved near-infrared imaging adds a useful optical contrast
mechanism to eye tracking by measuring the polarization state of light
reflected by ocular tissues in addition to its intensity. In this paper we
demonstrate how this contrast can be used to enable eye tracking. Specifically,
we demonstrate that a polarization-enabled eye tracking (PET) system composed
of a polarization--filter--array camera paired with a linearly polarized
near-infrared illuminator can reveal trackable features across the sclera and
gaze-informative patterns on the cornea, largely absent in intensity-only
images. Across a cohort of 346 participants, convolutional neural network based
machine learning models trained on data from PET reduced the median
95th-percentile absolute gaze error by 10--16\% relative to capacity-matched
intensity baselines under nominal conditions and in the presence of eyelid
occlusions, eye-relief changes, and pupil-size variation. These results link
light--tissue polarization effects to practical gains in human--computer
interaction and position PET as a simple, robust sensing modality for future
wearable devices.

### [58] [Benchmark Designers Should "Train on the Test Set" to Expose Exploitable Non-Visual Shortcuts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04655)
*Ellis Brown,Jihan Yang,Shusheng Yang,Rob Fergus,Saining Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to diagnose and debias multimodal benchmarks by identifying non-visual biases that allow models to perform well without strong visual understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal benchmarks can be gamed using biases and linguistic patterns rather than genuine visual understanding, undermining their effectiveness for evaluating MLLMs.

Method: Two-component framework: 1) Test-set Stress-Test (TsT) using k-fold cross-validation on textual inputs to reveal shortcuts, 2) Iterative Bias Pruning (IBP) to filter high-bias samples.

Result: Applied to four benchmarks (VSI-Bench, CV-Bench, MMMU, VideoMME), revealing pervasive non-visual biases. Created VSI-Bench-Debiased showing reduced non-visual solvability and wider vision-blind performance gap.

Conclusion: Benchmark designers should proactively game their own benchmarks using diagnostic procedures to identify and mitigate non-visual biases before deployment.

Abstract: Robust benchmarks are crucial for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs). Yet we find that models can ace many multimodal benchmarks without
strong visual understanding, instead exploiting biases, linguistic priors, and
superficial patterns. This is especially problematic for vision-centric
benchmarks that are meant to require visual inputs. We adopt a diagnostic
principle for benchmark design: if a benchmark can be gamed, it will be.
Designers should therefore try to ``game'' their own benchmarks first, using
diagnostic and debiasing procedures to systematically identify and mitigate
non-visual biases. Effective diagnosis requires directly ``training on the test
set'' -- probing the released test set for its intrinsic, exploitable patterns.
  We operationalize this standard with two components. First, we diagnose
benchmark susceptibility using a ``Test-set Stress-Test'' (TsT) methodology.
Our primary diagnostic tool involves fine-tuning a powerful Large Language
Model via $k$-fold cross-validation on exclusively the non-visual, textual
inputs of the test set to reveal shortcut performance and assign each sample a
bias score $s(x)$. We complement this with a lightweight Random Forest-based
diagnostic operating on hand-crafted features for fast, interpretable auditing.
Second, we debias benchmarks by filtering high-bias samples using an
``Iterative Bias Pruning'' (IBP) procedure. Applying this framework to four
benchmarks -- VSI-Bench, CV-Bench, MMMU, and VideoMME -- we uncover pervasive
non-visual biases. As a case study, we apply our full framework to create
VSI-Bench-Debiased, demonstrating reduced non-visual solvability and a wider
vision-blind performance gap than the original.

*Ellis Brown,Arijit Ray,Ranjay Krishna,Ross Girshick,Rob Fergus,Saining Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SIMS-V is a framework that uses 3D simulators to generate spatially-rich video training data for multimodal language models, enabling efficient spatial reasoning training that transfers effectively to real-world tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal language models struggle with spatial reasoning across time and space, and obtaining diverse real-world video data with precise spatial annotations is challenging and expensive.

Method: Created SIMS-V framework using 3D simulators to generate training data, systematically analyzed question types, mixes, and scales to identify the most effective training strategies for spatial reasoning.

Result: Identified three key question categories (metric measurement, perspective-dependent reasoning, temporal tracking) that enable effective transfer. A 7B-parameter model trained on just 25K simulated examples outperformed larger 72B baseline and achieved competitive performance with proprietary models on real-world spatial reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: Simulated data can effectively train spatial reasoning capabilities that transfer to real-world tasks, with minimal question types proving more effective than comprehensive coverage, enabling efficient and scalable training.

Abstract: Despite impressive high-level video comprehension, multimodal language models
struggle with spatial reasoning across time and space. While current spatial
training approaches rely on real-world video data, obtaining diverse footage
with precise spatial annotations remains a bottleneck. To alleviate this
bottleneck, we present SIMS-V -- a systematic data-generation framework that
leverages the privileged information of 3D simulators to create spatially-rich
video training data for multimodal language models. Using this framework, we
investigate which properties of simulated data drive effective real-world
transfer through systematic ablations of question types, mixes, and scales. We
identify a minimal set of three question categories (metric measurement,
perspective-dependent reasoning, and temporal tracking) that prove most
effective for developing transferable spatial intelligence, outperforming
comprehensive coverage despite using fewer question types. These insights
enable highly efficient training: our 7B-parameter video LLM fine-tuned on just
25K simulated examples outperforms the larger 72B baseline and achieves
competitive performance with proprietary models on rigorous real-world spatial
reasoning benchmarks. Our approach demonstrates robust generalization,
maintaining performance on general video understanding while showing
substantial improvements on embodied and real-world spatial tasks.

*Shusheng Yang,Jihan Yang,Pinzhi Huang,Ellis Brown,Zihao Yang,Yue Yu,Shengbang Tong,Zihan Zheng,Yifan Xu,Muhan Wang,Daohan Lu,Rob Fergus,Yann LeCun,Li Fei-Fei,Saining Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a shift from reactive multimodal systems to 'supersensing' - a broader paradigm that includes semantic perception, streaming event cognition, implicit 3D spatial cognition, and predictive world modeling. They introduce VSI-SUPER benchmark and show that scale alone is insufficient, proposing predictive sensing as a solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal systems are reactive and task-driven, lacking true spatial cognition and world modeling capabilities. Progress requires moving beyond linguistic-only understanding to broader supersensing that includes spatial awareness and prediction.

Method: Created VSI-SUPER benchmark with VSR (visual spatial recall) and VSC (visual spatial counting) tasks resistant to brute-force context expansion. Trained Cambrian-S on VSI-590K dataset. Proposed predictive sensing using self-supervised next-latent-frame predictor that leverages prediction error for memory and event segmentation.

Result: Achieved +30% improvement on VSI-Bench without sacrificing general capabilities, but performance on VSI-SUPER remains limited, showing scale alone is insufficient. Predictive sensing approach substantially outperforms proprietary baselines on VSI-SUPER.

Conclusion: Spatial supersensing requires models that not only see but also anticipate, select, and organize experience. Predictive sensing using surprise-driven memory and event segmentation is a promising path forward beyond brute-force scaling.

Abstract: We argue that progress in true multimodal intelligence calls for a shift from
reactive, task-driven systems and brute-force long context towards a broader
paradigm of supersensing. We frame spatial supersensing as four stages beyond
linguistic-only understanding: semantic perception (naming what is seen),
streaming event cognition (maintaining memory across continuous experiences),
implicit 3D spatial cognition (inferring the world behind pixels), and
predictive world modeling (creating internal models that filter and organize
information). Current benchmarks largely test only the early stages, offering
narrow coverage of spatial cognition and rarely challenging models in ways that
require true world modeling. To drive progress in spatial supersensing, we
present VSI-SUPER, a two-part benchmark: VSR (long-horizon visual spatial
recall) and VSC (continual visual spatial counting). These tasks require
arbitrarily long video inputs yet are resistant to brute-force context
expansion. We then test data scaling limits by curating VSI-590K and training
Cambrian-S, achieving +30% absolute improvement on VSI-Bench without
sacrificing general capabilities. Yet performance on VSI-SUPER remains limited,
indicating that scale alone is insufficient for spatial supersensing. We
propose predictive sensing as a path forward, presenting a proof-of-concept in
which a self-supervised next-latent-frame predictor leverages surprise
(prediction error) to drive memory and event segmentation. On VSI-SUPER, this
approach substantially outperforms leading proprietary baselines, showing that
spatial supersensing requires models that not only see but also anticipate,
select, and organize experience.

*Yihong Sun,Xinyu Yang,Jennifer J. Sun,Bharath Hariharan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Track Any State, a new task for tracking objects through transformations while detecting state changes, and presents TubeletGraph, a zero-shot system that achieves state-of-the-art tracking performance under object transformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world objects frequently undergo state transformations (e.g., apple being cut, butterfly emerging), but existing tracking methods lose track after significant appearance changes. There's a need to track objects through transformations while understanding state changes.

Method: TubeletGraph is a zero-shot system that identifies overlooked tracks and integrates them based on semantic and proximity priors. It reasons about added tracks and generates a state graph describing each observed transformation.

Result: TubeletGraph achieves state-of-the-art tracking performance under transformations and demonstrates deeper understanding of object transformations with promising capabilities in temporal grounding and semantic reasoning for complex object transformations.

Conclusion: The proposed TubeletGraph system successfully addresses the challenge of tracking objects through state transformations while detecting and describing state changes, outperforming existing methods and showing strong reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Real-world objects frequently undergo state transformations. From an apple
being cut into pieces to a butterfly emerging from its cocoon, tracking through
these changes is important for understanding real-world objects and dynamics.
However, existing methods often lose track of the target object after
transformation, due to significant changes in object appearance. To address
this limitation, we introduce the task of Track Any State: tracking objects
through transformations while detecting and describing state changes,
accompanied by a new benchmark dataset, VOST-TAS. To tackle this problem, we
present TubeletGraph, a zero-shot system that recovers missing objects after
transformation and maps out how object states are evolving over time.
TubeletGraph first identifies potentially overlooked tracks, and determines
whether they should be integrated based on semantic and proximity priors. Then,
it reasons about the added tracks and generates a state graph describing each
observed transformation. TubeletGraph achieves state-of-the-art tracking
performance under transformations, while demonstrating deeper understanding of
object transformations and promising capabilities in temporal grounding and
semantic reasoning for complex object transformations. Code, additional
results, and the benchmark dataset are available at

TL;DR: This paper addresses the problem of generating multiple distinct aesthetic crops from images, motivated by social media applications, and introduces a dataset with human labels for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern social media applications require multiple distinct aesthetic crops from single images, but existing methods focus only on producing singular crops.

Method: Evaluated several single-crop models with an image partitioning algorithm as a pre-processing step to generate multiple crops.

Result: Introduced a dataset of 277 images with human labels for evaluating multiple crop generation methods.

Conclusion: The paper provides a dataset and evaluation framework for the under-explored problem of generating multiple aesthetic crops from images.

Abstract: Automatic image cropping is a method for maximizing the human-perceived
quality of cropped regions in photographs. Although several works have proposed
techniques for producing singular crops, little work has addressed the problem
of producing multiple, distinct crops with aesthetic appeal. In this paper, we
motivate the problem with a discussion on modern social media applications,
introduce a dataset of 277 relevant images and human labels, and evaluate the
efficacy of several single-crop models with an image partitioning algorithm as
a pre-processing step. The dataset is available at
