Clustering-based unsupervised methods often exhibit unstable\nperformance due to missing priors. We propose IC DefectNCD, a support set free\nframework that leverages Image Intrinsic Priors in IC SEM images for defect\ndetection and novel class discovery.

To handle saliency variations across defects,\nwe introduce an adaptive binarization strategy that produces stable subimages\nfocused on core defective areas. Finally, we design Self Defect Information\nGuided IC Defect Classification, which incorporates a soft mask guided\nattention mechanism to inject spatial defect priors into the teacher student\nmodel. This enhances sensitivity to defective regions, suppresses background\ninterference, and enables recognition and classification of unseen defects.
