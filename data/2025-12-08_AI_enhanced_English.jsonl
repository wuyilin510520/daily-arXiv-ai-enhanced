While editing in the RAW domain provides greater accuracy and flexibility, most edits are performed on the camera's display-referred output (e.g., 8-bit sRGB JPEG) since RAW images are rarely stored. Existing RAW reconstruction methods can recover RAW data from sRGB images, but these approaches are typically optimized for pixel-wise RAW reconstruction fidelity and tend to degrade under diverse rendering styles and editing operations. We introduce a plug-and-play, edit-aware loss function that can be integrated into any existing RAW reconstruction framework to make the recovered RAWs more robust to different rendering styles and edits.

We employ reinforcement learning to align the EditThinker's thinking with its editing, thereby generating more targeted instruction improvements. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the instruction-following capability of any image editing model by a large margin. We will release our data construction framework, datasets, and models to benefit the community.", "AI": {"tldr": "Proposes EditThinker, a deliberative editing framework that uses iterative Think-while-Edit cycles (Critique, Refine, Repeat) to improve instruction-following in image editing models via reinforcement learning.", "motivation": "Current instruction-based image editing models have high aesthetic quality but limited instruction-following capability due to inherent stochasticity and lack of deliberation. Single-turn success rates remain constrained despite supervised or reinforcement learning approaches.", "method": "Develops a deliberative editing framework with iterative Think-while-Edit cycles: Critiquing results and Refining instructions, then Repeating generation. Trains a single MLLM (EditThinker) as reasoning engine to produce critique scores, reasoning processes, and refined instructions. Uses reinforcement learning to align thinking with editing for targeted instruction improvements.", "result": "Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate significant improvement in instruction-following capability of any image editing model by a large margin.", "conclusion": "The deliberative editing framework with EditThinker effectively addresses instruction-following challenges in image editing by simulating human cognitive loops, achieving substantial performance gains across multiple benchmarks."}}
