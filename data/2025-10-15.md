*Yumi Iwashita,Haakon Moe,Yang Cheng,Adnan Ansar,Georgios Georgakis,Adrian Stoica,Kazuto Nakashima,Ryo Kurazume,Jim Torresen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Method to improve 3D lunar maps from Kaguya TC images by reducing compression-induced noise in disparity maps, enhancing elevation accuracy for lunar missions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality 3D lunar maps are critical for long-distance missions like NASA's Endurance, but Kaguya TC images have altitude inaccuracies from stereo matching errors and JPEG compression artifacts.

Method: Analyze compression behavior of Kaguya TC imagery, identify systematic disparity noise patterns in darker regions, and develop approach to reduce residual noise in disparity images from compressed images.

Result: Experimental results show the approach effectively reduces elevation noise, improving terrain data quality.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances the safety and reliability of terrain data for future lunar missions by mitigating compression-induced noise in 3D maps.

Abstract: As global efforts to explore the Moon intensify, the need for high-quality 3D
lunar maps becomes increasingly critical-particularly for long-distance
missions such as NASA's Endurance mission concept, in which a rover aims to
traverse 2,000 km across the South Pole-Aitken basin. Kaguya TC (Terrain
Camera) images, though globally available at 10 m/pixel, suffer from altitude
inaccuracies caused by stereo matching errors and JPEG-based compression
artifacts. This paper presents a method to improve the quality of 3D maps
generated from Kaguya TC images, focusing on mitigating the effects of
compression-induced noise in disparity maps. We analyze the compression
behavior of Kaguya TC imagery, and identify systematic disparity noise
patterns, especially in darker regions. In this paper, we propose an approach
to enhance 3D map quality by reducing residual noise in disparity images
derived from compressed images. Our experimental results show that the proposed
approach effectively reduces elevation noise, enhancing the safety and
reliability of terrain data for future lunar missions.

### [2] [Data or Language Supervision: What Makes CLIP Better than DINO?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11835)
*Yiming Liu,Yuhui Zhang,Dhruba Ghosh,Ludwig Schmidt,Serena Yeung-Levy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIP's advantage over DINO in vision-language models comes from language supervision enabling better semantic understanding, not just larger training data, with CLIP excelling at text-intensive tasks while DINO performs slightly better on vision-centric ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether CLIP's superior performance as vision encoders in vision-language models stems from language supervision or larger training data, by conducting controlled comparisons.

Method: Pre-trained CLIP and DINO under controlled settings with same architecture, dataset, and training configuration, then analyzed embeddings and evaluated on 20 VQA benchmarks.

Result: CLIP captures high-level semantics (object categories, text) while DINO focuses on low-level features (colors, styles). CLIP excels at text-intensive VQA tasks, DINO slightly better on vision-centric ones. Language supervision variants provided limited gains.

Conclusion: Language supervision in CLIP enables better semantic understanding crucial for vision-language models, providing scientific insights for vision encoder design.

Abstract: CLIP outperforms self-supervised models like DINO as vision encoders for
vision-language models (VLMs), but it remains unclear whether this advantage
stems from CLIP's language supervision or its much larger training data. To
disentangle these factors, we pre-train CLIP and DINO under controlled settings
-- using the same architecture, dataset, and training configuration --
achieving similar ImageNet accuracy. Embedding analysis shows that CLIP
captures high-level semantics (e.g., object categories, text), while DINO is
more responsive to low-level features like colors and styles. When integrated
into VLMs and evaluated on 20 VQA benchmarks, CLIP excels at text-intensive
tasks, while DINO slightly outperforms on vision-centric ones. Variants of
language supervision (e.g., sigmoid loss, pre-trained language encoders) yield
limited gains. Our findings provide scientific insights into vision encoder
design and its impact on VLM performance.

general domains but remains underutilized in medical imaging due to limited
data and domain specific biases. We present MammoDINO, a novel SSL framework
for mammography, pretrained on 1.4 million mammographic images. To capture
clinically meaningful features, we introduce a breast tissue aware data
augmentation sampler for both image-level and patch-level supervision and a
cross-slice contrastive learning objective that leverages 3D digital breast
tomosynthesis (DBT) structure into 2D pretraining. MammoDINO achieves
state-of-the-art performance on multiple breast cancer screening tasks and
generalizes well across five benchmark datasets. It offers a scalable,
annotation-free foundation for multipurpose computer-aided diagnosis (CAD)
tools for mammogram, helping reduce radiologists' workload and improve
diagnostic efficiency in breast cancer screening.

accident prevention. In this work, we present a unique dual-model framework
that strategically utilizes the complementary strengths of VideoLLaMA and
Qwen2.5-VL through task-specific optimization to address this issue. The core

### [5] [PanoTPS-Net: Panoramic Room Layout Estimation via Thin Plate Spline Transformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11992)
*Hatem Ibrahem,Ahmed Salem,Qinmin Vivian Hu,Guanghui Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PanoTPS-Net is a novel model for estimating 3D room layouts from single panorama images using CNN and Thin Plate Spline transformation, achieving high accuracy on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate 3D room layout estimation is crucial for applications in robotics, augmented reality, and interior design, requiring methods that can handle both cuboid and non-cuboid layouts.

Method: Two-stage architecture: CNN extracts high-level features to learn TPS transformation parameters, then TPS spatial transformation warps a reference layout to the target layout.

Result: Achieved 3DIoU values of 85.49, 86.16, 81.76, and 91.98 on PanoContext, Stanford-2D3D, Matterport3DLayout, and ZInD datasets respectively, demonstrating high accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: The proposed PanoTPS-Net effectively estimates room layouts from panoramas, showing strong compatibility between TPS transformation and panorama images, with generalization to both cuboid and non-cuboid layouts.

Abstract: Accurately estimating the 3D layout of rooms is a crucial task in computer
vision, with potential applications in robotics, augmented reality, and
interior design. This paper proposes a novel model, PanoTPS-Net, to estimate
room layout from a single panorama image. Leveraging a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) and incorporating a Thin Plate Spline (TPS) spatial
transformation, the architecture of PanoTPS-Net is divided into two stages:
First, a convolutional neural network extracts the high-level features from the
input images, allowing the network to learn the spatial parameters of the TPS
transformation. Second, the TPS spatial transformation layer is generated to
warp a reference layout to the required layout based on the predicted
parameters. This unique combination empowers the model to properly predict room
layouts while also generalizing effectively to both cuboid and non-cuboid
layouts. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets and comparisons
with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
method. The results underscore the model's accuracy in room layout estimation
and emphasize the compatibility between the TPS transformation and panorama
images. The robustness of the model in handling both cuboid and non-cuboid room
layout estimation is evident with a 3DIoU value of 85.49, 86.16, 81.76, and
91.98 on PanoContext, Stanford-2D3D, Matterport3DLayout, and ZInD datasets,
respectively. The source code is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A spatial reasoning framework for warehouse environments that embeds bounding box coordinates in prompts to improve spatial understanding, achieving 4th place in the AI City Challenge with a score of 73.0606.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language systems struggle with spatial reasoning in large-scale 3D environments due to scene clutter, occlusions, and lack of explicit spatial grounding, limiting their generalization capabilities.

Method: Embed mask dimensions as bounding box coordinates directly into input prompts, fine-tune across four question categories (Distance Estimation, Object Counting, Multi-choice Grounding, Spatial Relation Inference), and append normalized answers to GPT responses for evaluation consistency.

Result: Achieved a final score of 73.0606, placing 4th overall on the public leaderboard of the Track 3 2025 AI City Challenge.

Conclusion: Structured prompt enrichment and targeted optimization effectively advance spatial reasoning capabilities for real-world industrial environments.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning in large-scale 3D environments such as warehouses remains a
significant challenge for vision-language systems due to scene clutter,
occlusions, and the need for precise spatial understanding. Existing models
often struggle with generalization in such settings, as they rely heavily on
local appearance and lack explicit spatial grounding. In this work, we
introduce a dedicated spatial reasoning framework for the Physical AI Spatial
Intelligence Warehouse dataset introduced in the Track 3 2025 AI City
Challenge. Our approach enhances spatial comprehension by embedding mask
dimensions in the form of bounding box coordinates directly into the input
prompts, enabling the model to reason over object geometry and layout. We
fine-tune the framework across four question categories namely: Distance
Estimation, Object Counting, Multi-choice Grounding, and Spatial Relation
Inference using task-specific supervision. To further improve consistency with
the evaluation system, normalized answers are appended to the GPT response
within the training set. Our comprehensive pipeline achieves a final score of
73.0606, placing 4th overall on the public leaderboard. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of structured prompt enrichment and targeted
optimization in advancing spatial reasoning for real-world industrial
environments.

### [7] [Evaluating the Explainability of Vision Transformers in Medical Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12021)
*Leili Barekatain,Ben Glocker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study evaluates Vision Transformer explainability methods (Grad-CAM and Gradient Attention Rollout) on medical imaging tasks, finding DINO with Grad-CAM provides the most faithful and localized explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers achieve state-of-the-art performance in medical imaging but their complex attention mechanisms pose interpretability challenges, which is crucial for clinical trust and adoption.

Method: Evaluated ViT, DeiT, DINO, and Swin Transformer architectures with different pre-training strategies using Gradient Attention Rollout and Grad-CAM on peripheral blood cell classification and breast ultrasound classification tasks.

Result: DINO combined with Grad-CAM offers the most faithful and localized explanations across datasets, producing class-discriminative and spatially precise heatmaps. Even in misclassifications, it highlights clinically relevant morphological features that misled the model.

Conclusion: The research supports reliable integration of Vision Transformers into medical diagnostic workflows by improving model transparency through effective explainability methods.

Abstract: Understanding model decisions is crucial in medical imaging, where
interpretability directly impacts clinical trust and adoption. Vision
Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in
diagnostic imaging; however, their complex attention mechanisms pose challenges
to explainability. This study evaluates the explainability of different Vision
Transformer architectures and pre-training strategies - ViT, DeiT, DINO, and
Swin Transformer - using Gradient Attention Rollout and Grad-CAM. We conduct
both quantitative and qualitative analyses on two medical imaging tasks:
peripheral blood cell classification and breast ultrasound image
classification. Our findings indicate that DINO combined with Grad-CAM offers
the most faithful and localized explanations across datasets. Grad-CAM
consistently produces class-discriminative and spatially precise heatmaps,
while Gradient Attention Rollout yields more scattered activations. Even in
misclassification cases, DINO with Grad-CAM highlights clinically relevant
morphological features that appear to have misled the model. By improving model
transparency, this research supports the reliable and explainable integration
of ViTs into critical medical diagnostic workflows.

### [8] [APGNet: Adaptive Prior-Guided for Underwater Camouflaged Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12056)
*Xinxin Huang,Han Sun,Junmin Cai,Ningzhong Liu,Huiyu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: APGNet is an Adaptive Prior-Guided Network for detecting camouflaged objects in underwater environments, addressing image degradation and marine organism camouflage through illumination-invariant data augmentation and hierarchical prior fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater camouflaged object detection faces challenges from image degradation (low contrast, color distortion) and natural camouflage of marine organisms. Traditional enhancement techniques and terrestrial COD methods fail to adapt to underwater optical characteristics.

Method: Proposes APGNet with Siamese architecture and prior-guided mechanism: 1) Uses MSRCR algorithm for illumination-invariant data augmentation, 2) Designs Extended Receptive Field module with Multi-Scale Progressive Decoder for multi-scale context, 3) Implements adaptive prior-guided mechanism fusing position and boundary priors using spatial attention and deformable convolution.

Result: Extensive experiments on two public MAS datasets show APGNet outperforms 15 state-of-the-art methods across widely used evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: APGNet effectively addresses underwater camouflaged object detection challenges through adaptive prior guidance and illumination-invariant processing, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Detecting camouflaged objects in underwater environments is crucial for
marine ecological research and resource exploration. However, existing methods
face two key challenges: underwater image degradation, including low contrast
and color distortion, and the natural camouflage of marine organisms.
Traditional image enhancement techniques struggle to restore critical features
in degraded images, while camouflaged object detection (COD) methods developed
for terrestrial scenes often fail to adapt to underwater environments due to
the lack of consideration for underwater optical characteristics.
  To address these issues, we propose APGNet, an Adaptive Prior-Guided Network,
which integrates a Siamese architecture with a novel prior-guided mechanism to
enhance robustness and detection accuracy. First, we employ the Multi-Scale
Retinex with Color Restoration (MSRCR) algorithm for data augmentation,
generating illumination-invariant images to mitigate degradation effects.
Second, we design an Extended Receptive Field (ERF) module combined with a
Multi-Scale Progressive Decoder (MPD) to capture multi-scale contextual
information and refine feature representations. Furthermore, we propose an
adaptive prior-guided mechanism that hierarchically fuses position and boundary
priors by embedding spatial attention in high-level features for coarse
localization and using deformable convolution to refine contours in low-level
features.
  Extensive experimental results on two public MAS datasets demonstrate that
our proposed method APGNet outperforms 15 state-of-art methods under widely
used evaluation metrics.

Motivation: Existing diffusion-based video editing methods struggle with structure-variable editing, suffering from temporal inconsistency, subject identity drift, and requiring human intervention. Motion-preserved video editing with structural flexibility remains underexplored.

Method: Leverages pose and position priors to learn a generalized motion representation from source videos, enabling generation of new videos that maintain original motion while allowing structural and semantic flexibility.

Result: Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate superiority over existing methods in maintaining temporal consistency and avoiding identity drift during structure-variable editing.

Conclusion: VidMP3 effectively addresses challenges in motion-preserved video editing with structural flexibility, outperforming current approaches and providing a practical solution for creators.

Abstract: Motion-preserved video editing is crucial for creators, particularly in
scenarios that demand flexibility in both the structure and semantics of
swapped objects. Despite its potential, this area remains underexplored.
Existing diffusion-based editing methods excel in structure-preserving tasks,
using dense guidance signals to ensure content integrity. While some recent
methods attempt to address structure-variable editing, they often suffer from
issues such as temporal inconsistency, subject identity drift, and the need for
human intervention. To address these challenges, we introduce VidMP3, a novel
approach that leverages pose and position priors to learn a generalized motion
representation from source videos. Our method enables the generation of new
videos that maintain the original motion while allowing for structural and
semantic flexibility. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate
the superiority of our approach over existing methods. The code will be made
publicly available at https://github.com/sandeep-sm/VidMP3.

TL;DR: The paper discusses Domain Adaptation methods to address the challenge of limited labeled data in computer vision, enabling models trained on one domain to predict on different domains of the same type.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of good quality labeled data due to high human labor costs and difficulty in obtaining labeled data motivates the need for methods that can overcome data limitations while maintaining benchmark performance.

Method: The paper explores various Domain Adaptation techniques that allow models trained on a particular dataset to predict on data from different domains of the same kind, such as using a model trained on paintings to predict real images.

Result: The paper presents Domain Adaptation as a solution to produce results comparable to previous benchmarks despite limited labeled data availability.

Conclusion: Domain Adaptation provides reliable methods to address data scarcity challenges in computer vision by enabling cross-domain prediction capabilities.

Abstract: The major challenge in today's computer vision scenario is the availability
of good quality labeled data. In a field of study like image classification,
where data is of utmost importance, we need to find more reliable methods which
can overcome the scarcity of data to produce results comparable to previous
benchmark results. In most cases, obtaining labeled data is very difficult
because of the high cost of human labor and in some cases impossible. The
purpose of this paper is to discuss Domain Adaptation and various methods to
implement it. The main idea is to use a model trained on a particular dataset
to predict on data from a different domain of the same kind, for example - a
model trained on paintings of airplanes predicting on real images of airplanes

Conclusion: Proposed method provides simple, efficient, and cost-effective solution for high-quality audio-driven video generation with improved lip-sync and multi-character support.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved audio-driven
human video generation, surpassing traditional methods in both quality and
controllability. However, existing approaches still face challenges in lip-sync
accuracy, temporal coherence for long video generation, and multi-character
animation. In this work, we propose a diffusion transformer (DiT)-based
framework for generating lifelike talking videos of arbitrary length, and
introduce a training-free method for multi-character audio-driven animation.
First, we employ a LoRA-based training strategy combined with a position shift
inference approach, which enables efficient long video generation while
preserving the capabilities of the foundation model. Moreover, we combine
partial parameter updates with reward feedback to enhance both lip
synchronization and natural body motion. Finally, we propose a training-free
approach, Mask Classifier-Free Guidance (Mask-CFG), for multi-character
animation, which requires no specialized datasets or model modifications and
supports audio-driven animation for three or more characters. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving high-quality, temporally coherent, and multi-character
audio-driven video generation in a simple, efficient, and cost-effective
manner.

### [13] [An Adaptive Edge-Guided Dual-Network Framework for Fast QR Code Motion Deblurring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12098)
*Jianping Li,Dongyang Guo,Wenjie Li,Wei Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an adaptive dual-network approach for QR code deblurring that uses edge-guided attention blocks and dynamically selects between two specialized networks based on blur severity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for QR code deblurring don't explicitly exploit the structured edge priors inherent in QR codes, which are crucial for successful decoding rather than just perceptual quality.

Method: Proposed Edge-Guided Attention Block (EGAB) to embed explicit edge priors into Transformers, developed EG-Restormer for severe blur, lightweight LENet for mild blur, and integrated them into Adaptive Dual-network (ADNet) that dynamically selects the appropriate network.

Result: EG-Restormer and ADNet achieve state-of-the-art performance with competitive speed, significantly boosting decoding rates for severely blurred QR codes.

Conclusion: The proposed edge-guided approach and adaptive dual-network architecture provide an effective solution for QR code deblurring that is suitable for resource-constrained mobile devices.

Abstract: Unlike general image deblurring that prioritizes perceptual quality, QR code
deblurring focuses on ensuring successful decoding. QR codes are characterized
by highly structured patterns with sharp edges, a robust prior for restoration.
Yet existing deep learning methods rarely exploit these priors explicitly. To
address this gap, we propose the Edge-Guided Attention Block (EGAB), which
embeds explicit edge priors into a Transformer architecture. Based on EGAB, we
develop Edge-Guided Restormer (EG-Restormer), an effective network that
significantly boosts the decoding rate of severely blurred QR codes. For mildly
blurred inputs, we design the Lightweight and Efficient Network (LENet) for
fast deblurring. We further integrate these two networks into an Adaptive
Dual-network (ADNet), which dynamically selects the suitable network based on
input blur severity, making it ideal for resource-constrained mobile devices.
Extensive experiments show that our EG-Restormer and ADNet achieve
state-of-the-art performance with a competitive speed. Project page:

*Junfeng Ni,Yixin Chen,Zhifei Yang,Yu Liu,Ruijie Lu,Song-Chun Zhu,Siyuan Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method that leverages planar structures to derive accurate depth maps and incorporates geometry guidance throughout the generative pipeline to improve 3D scene reconstruction, particularly in unobserved regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with high-quality reconstructions due to lack of reliable geometric supervision and multi-view inconsistencies, leading to shape-appearance ambiguities and degraded scene geometry.

Method: Uses planar structures to derive metric-scale depth maps, incorporates geometry guidance for visibility mask estimation, novel view selection, and enhances multi-view consistency with video diffusion models for scene completion.

Result: Outperforms existing baselines on Replica, ScanNet++, and DeepBlending datasets in both geometry and appearance reconstruction, especially for unobserved regions. Supports single-view inputs and unposed videos with strong generalizability.

Conclusion: Accurate geometry is fundamental for effectively exploiting generative models in 3D scene reconstruction, and the proposed method achieves superior performance across various scenarios with practical real-world applicability.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in leveraging generative prior from pre-trained
diffusion models for 3D scene reconstruction, existing methods still face two
critical limitations. First, due to the lack of reliable geometric supervision,
they struggle to produce high-quality reconstructions even in observed regions,
let alone in unobserved areas. Second, they lack effective mechanisms to
mitigate multi-view inconsistencies in the generated images, leading to severe
shape-appearance ambiguities and degraded scene geometry. In this paper, we
identify accurate geometry as the fundamental prerequisite for effectively
exploiting generative models to enhance 3D scene reconstruction. We first
propose to leverage the prevalence of planar structures to derive accurate
metric-scale depth maps, providing reliable supervision in both observed and
unobserved regions. Furthermore, we incorporate this geometry guidance
throughout the generative pipeline to improve visibility mask estimation, guide
novel view selection, and enhance multi-view consistency when inpainting with
video diffusion models, resulting in accurate and consistent scene completion.
Extensive experiments on Replica, ScanNet++, and DeepBlending show that our
method consistently outperforms existing baselines in both geometry and
appearance reconstruction, particularly for unobserved regions. Moreover, our
method naturally supports single-view inputs and unposed videos, with strong
generalizability in both indoor and outdoor scenarios with practical real-world
applicability. The project page is available at

Motivation: To overcome three main challenges in non-rehearsal Class-Incremental Learning: large model complexity, non-smooth representation shift during incremental learning, and inconsistency between stage-wise optimization and global inference.

Method: DRL framework with IPA network that learns lightweight adapters in each incremental stage connected in parallel via transfer gates, and DAS that decouples positive/negative sample constraints using virtual anchors to align feature spaces across stages.

Result: Extensive experiments on six benchmarks show DRL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods throughout the entire CIL period while maintaining high training and inference efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed DRL framework effectively addresses key challenges in non-rehearsal CIL through efficient adapter-based architecture and discriminative representation learning, achieving superior performance with maintained efficiency.

Abstract: With the excellent representation capabilities of Pre-Trained Models (PTMs),
remarkable progress has been made in non-rehearsal Class-Incremental Learning
(CIL) research. However, it remains an extremely challenging task due to three
conundrums: increasingly large model complexity, non-smooth representation
shift during incremental learning and inconsistency between stage-wise
sub-problem optimization and global inference. In this work, we propose the
Discriminative Representation Learning (DRL) framework to specifically address
these challenges. To conduct incremental learning effectively and yet
efficiently, the DRL's network, called Incremental Parallel Adapter (IPA)
network, is built upon a PTM and increasingly augments the model by learning a
lightweight adapter with a small amount of parameter learning overhead in each
incremental stage. The adapter is responsible for adapting the model to new
classes, it can inherit and propagate the representation capability from the
current model through parallel connection between them by a transfer gate. As a
result, this design guarantees a smooth representation shift between different
incremental stages. Furthermore, to alleviate inconsistency and enable
comparable feature representations across incremental stages, we design the
Decoupled Anchor Supervision (DAS). It decouples constraints of positive and
negative samples by respectively comparing them with the virtual anchor. This
decoupling promotes discriminative representation learning and aligns the
feature spaces learned at different stages, thereby narrowing the gap between
stage-wise local optimization over a subset of data and global inference across
all classes. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks reveal that our DRL
consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods throughout the entire
CIL period while maintaining high efficiency in both training and inference
phases.

### [16] [Self-Supervised Selective-Guided Diffusion Model for Old-Photo Face Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12114)
*Wenjie Li,Xiangyi Wang,Heng Guo,Guangwei Gao,Zhanyu Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSDiff is a self-supervised selective-guided diffusion method for old-photo face restoration that uses pseudo-reference faces for region-specific restoration with structural guidance and color refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with localized artifacts and face color in old-photo restoration due to compounded degradations like breakage, fading, and severe blur.

Method: Leverages pseudo-reference faces from pre-trained diffusion model under weak guidance, uses face parsing maps and scratch masks for selective restoration, applies staged supervision with structural guidance throughout denoising and color refinement in later steps.

Result: Outperforms existing GAN-based and diffusion-based methods in perceptual quality, fidelity, and regional controllability on the VintageFace benchmark of 300 real old face photos.

Conclusion: SSDiff effectively addresses old-photo face restoration challenges through selective guidance and staged supervision, achieving superior restoration quality and controllability.

Abstract: Old-photo face restoration poses significant challenges due to compounded
degradations such as breakage, fading, and severe blur. Existing pre-trained
diffusion-guided methods either rely on explicit degradation priors or global
statistical guidance, which struggle with localized artifacts or face color. We
propose Self-Supervised Selective-Guided Diffusion (SSDiff), which leverages
pseudo-reference faces generated by a pre-trained diffusion model under weak
guidance. These pseudo-labels exhibit structurally aligned contours and natural
colors, enabling region-specific restoration via staged supervision: structural
guidance applied throughout the denoising process and color refinement in later
steps, aligned with the coarse-to-fine nature of diffusion. By incorporating
face parsing maps and scratch masks, our method selectively restores breakage
regions while avoiding identity mismatch. We further construct VintageFace, a
300-image benchmark of real old face photos with varying degradation levels.
SSDiff outperforms existing GAN-based and diffusion-based methods in perceptual
quality, fidelity, and regional controllability. Code link:

TL;DR: ImageSentinel is a framework that protects visual datasets from unauthorized use in Retrieval-Augmented Image Generation (RAIG) systems by generating sentinel images with embedded character sequences as retrieval keys.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Protecting private image datasets from unauthorized use in RAIG systems, as traditional watermarking fails due to complex feature extraction and recombination processes.

Method: Leverages vision-language models to synthesize sentinel images that maintain visual consistency with original datasets, embedding randomly generated character sequences as retrieval keys for protection verification.

Result: Experimental results show ImageSentinel effectively detects unauthorized dataset usage while preserving generation quality for authorized applications.

Conclusion: ImageSentinel provides an effective solution for dataset protection in RAIG systems, addressing limitations of traditional watermarking approaches.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Retrieval-Augmented Image Generation (RAIG) has
raised significant concerns about the unauthorized use of private image
datasets. While these systems have shown remarkable capabilities in enhancing
generation quality through reference images, protecting visual datasets from
unauthorized use in such systems remains a challenging problem. Traditional
digital watermarking approaches face limitations in RAIG systems, as the
complex feature extraction and recombination processes fail to preserve
watermark signals during generation. To address these challenges, we propose
ImageSentinel, a novel framework for protecting visual datasets in RAIG. Our
framework synthesizes sentinel images that maintain visual consistency with the
original dataset. These sentinels enable protection verification through
randomly generated character sequences that serve as retrieval keys. To ensure
seamless integration, we leverage vision-language models to generate the
sentinel images. Experimental results demonstrate that ImageSentinel
effectively detects unauthorized dataset usage while preserving generation
quality for authorized applications. Code is available at

*David Parra,Felipe Gutierrez-Barragan,Trevor Seets,Andreas Velten*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Constrained optimization approach for designing practical coding functions in compressive single-photon 3D imaging that outperforms traditional methods under hardware limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-photon cameras face performance limitations due to hardware constraints like bandwidth, laser power, sensor data rates, and memory resources. Compressive histograms help with data rates but underperform under real-world illumination constraints.

Method: Joint optimization of illumination and coding matrix using gradient descent while adhering to hardware constraints, including bandwidth and peak power limitations.

Result: The optimized coding functions consistently outperform traditional designs, especially in peak power-constrained systems, and adapt well to non-ideal impulse responses in real-world systems.

Conclusion: The constrained optimization approach enables practical coding function design that effectively addresses hardware limitations in compressive single-photon 3D imaging systems.

Abstract: Single-photon cameras are becoming increasingly popular in time-of-flight 3D
imaging because they can time-tag individual photons with extreme resolution.
However, their performance is susceptible to hardware limitations, such as
system bandwidth, maximum laser power, sensor data rates, and in-sensor memory
and compute resources. Compressive histograms were recently introduced as a
solution to the challenge of data rates through an online in-sensor compression
of photon timestamp data. Although compressive histograms work within limited
in-sensor memory and computational resources, they underperform when subjected
to real-world illumination hardware constraints. To address this, we present a
constrained optimization approach for designing practical coding functions for
compressive single-photon 3D imaging. Using gradient descent, we jointly
optimize an illumination and coding matrix (i.e., the coding functions) that
adheres to hardware constraints. We show through extensive simulations that our
coding functions consistently outperform traditional coding designs under both
bandwidth and peak power constraints. This advantage is particularly pronounced
in systems constrained by peak power. Finally, we show that our approach adapts
to arbitrary parameterized impulse responses by evaluating it on a real-world
system with a non-ideal impulse response function.

Motivation: To bridge the performance gap between open-source and commercial visual captioning models, enabling cost-effective applications like data synthesis without relying on expensive commercial APIs.

Method: Proposes CapFlow, a novel multi-agent collaboration workflow that leverages open-source models to generate high-quality captions, then uses this as data synthesizer to train MetaCaptioner via fine-tuning.

Result: CapFlow achieves caption quality comparable to GPT-4 across various domains with 89.5% cost reduction. MetaCaptioner achieves commercial-level captioning capabilities and top-tier multimodal performance in open-source community.

Conclusion: CapFlow and MetaCaptioner provide a strong, cost-effective visual captioning solution that can benefit future multimodal research by making high-quality captioning accessible without expensive commercial dependencies.

Abstract: Generalist visual captioning goes beyond a simple appearance description
task, but requires integrating a series of visual cues into a caption and
handling various visual domains. In this task, current open-source models
present a large performance gap with commercial ones, which limits various
applications such as data synthesis. To bridge the gap, this paper proposes
CapFlow, a novel multi-agent collaboration workflow. CapFlow demonstrates for
the first time that, by capitalizing on open-source models, it is possible to
achieve caption quality on par with GPT-4.1 in various domains with an 89.5%
reduction in costs. By leveraging CapFlow as the data synthesizer, we produce
high-quality visual captions from image and video domains at scale, and obtain
a generalist visual captioner via fine-tuning, namely MetaCaptioner. Through
extensive experiments, we show that MetaCaptioner not only achieves comparable
captioning capabilities with commercial models but also reaches top-tier
multimodal performance in the open-source community. We hope CapFlow and
MetaCaptioner can benefit future multimodal research by providing a strong and
cost-effective visual captioning solution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Remote physiological measurement requires privacy-sensitive data collection, and existing contactless methods rely on labeled client data, creating challenges for updating deployed models with unlabeled user data.

Method: FedHUG framework with: (1) Minimal Bias Aggregation module that dynamically adjusts weights based on bias evaluation for heterogeneous non-IID features; (2) Global Distribution-aware Learning Controller that parameterizes label distribution and manipulates client training strategies.

Result: Superior performance across state-of-the-art techniques in estimation with either RGB video or mmWave radar.

Conclusion: FedHUG effectively addresses privacy and label scarcity challenges in remote physiological measurement through federated unsupervised domain generalization.

Abstract: Remote physiological measurement gained wide attention, while it requires
collecting users' privacy-sensitive information, and existing contactless
measurements still rely on labeled client data. This presents challenges when
we want to further update real-world deployed models with numerous user data
lacking labels. To resolve these challenges, we instantiate a new protocol
called Federated Unsupervised Domain Generalization (FUDG) in this work.
Subsequently, the \textbf{Fed}erated \textbf{H}eterogeneous
\textbf{U}nsupervised \textbf{G}eneralization (\textbf{FedHUG}) framework is
proposed and consists of: (1) Minimal Bias Aggregation module dynamically
adjusts aggregation weights based on prior-driven bias evaluation to cope with
heterogeneous non-IID features from multiple domains. (2) The Global
Distribution-aware Learning Controller parameterizes the label distribution and
dynamically manipulates client-specific training strategies, thereby mitigating
the server-client label distribution skew and long-tail issue. The proposal
shows superior performance across state-of-the-art techniques in estimation
with either RGB video or mmWave radar. The code will be released.

### [21] [Class-aware Domain Knowledge Fusion and Fission for Continual Test-Time Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12150)
*Jiahuan Zhou,Chao Zhu,Zhenyu Cui,Zichen Liu,Xu Zou,Gang Hua*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KFF method for Continual Test-Time Adaptation uses class-aware domain knowledge fusion and fission to dynamically accumulate discriminative historical knowledge while avoiding negative knowledge interference from old domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CTTA methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting of historical knowledge and insufficient learning of new knowledge due to irregular switching of downstream domain data, leading to performance degradation.

Method: Proposes KFF with two modules: KFI separates new domain knowledge from class-aware domain prompt pool to alleviate negative knowledge impact, and KFU merges fissioned knowledge into existing pool with greedy dynamic merging strategy for efficiency.

Result: Extensive experiments on ImageNet-C dataset verify the effectiveness of the proposed method against other methods.

Conclusion: KFF successfully addresses the challenges of catastrophic forgetting and insufficient learning in CTTA through adaptive knowledge fusion and fission mechanisms.

Abstract: Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) aims to quickly fine-tune the model
during the test phase so that it can adapt to multiple unknown downstream
domain distributions without pre-acquiring downstream domain data. To this end,
existing advanced CTTA methods mainly reduce the catastrophic forgetting of
historical knowledge caused by irregular switching of downstream domain data by
restoring the initial model or reusing historical models. However, these
methods are usually accompanied by serious insufficient learning of new
knowledge and interference from potentially harmful historical knowledge,
resulting in severe performance degradation. To this end, we propose a
class-aware domain Knowledge Fusion and Fission method for continual test-time
adaptation, called KFF, which adaptively expands and merges class-aware domain
knowledge in old and new domains according to the test-time data from different
domains, where discriminative historical knowledge can be dynamically
accumulated. Specifically, considering the huge domain gap within streaming
data, a domain Knowledge FIssion (KFI) module is designed to adaptively
separate new domain knowledge from a paired class-aware domain prompt pool,
alleviating the impact of negative knowledge brought by old domains that are
distinct from the current domain. Besides, to avoid the cumulative computation
and storage overheads from continuously fissioning new knowledge, a domain
Knowledge FUsion (KFU) module is further designed to merge the fissioned new
knowledge into the existing knowledge pool with minimal cost, where a greedy
knowledge dynamic merging strategy is designed to improve the compatibility of
new and old knowledge while keeping the computational efficiency. Extensive
experiments on the ImageNet-C dataset verify the effectiveness of our proposed
method against other methods.

### [22] [DPL: Spatial-Conditioned Diffusion Prototype Enhancement for One-Shot Medical Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12159)
*Ziyuan Gao,Philippe Morel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DPL introduces diffusion-based prototype learning for one-shot medical image segmentation, modeling prototypes as probability distributions to generate diverse variants from limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional prototype methods use deterministic averaging which creates brittle representations that fail to capture intra-class diversity needed for robust generalization in medical imaging.

Method: Uses diffusion-based feature space exploration with three innovations: diffusion-based prototype enhancement, spatial-aware conditioning, and conservative fusion strategy. Models prototypes as learnable distributions and generates diverse variants via forward-reverse diffusion processes.

Result: Extensive experiments on abdominal MRI and CT datasets demonstrate significant improvements, establishing new state-of-the-art performance in one-shot medical image segmentation.

Conclusion: DPL effectively addresses the challenges of limited annotated data and anatomical variability in medical imaging by reformulating prototype construction through diffusion-based feature exploration.

Abstract: One-shot medical image segmentation faces fundamental challenges in prototype
representation due to limited annotated data and significant anatomical
variability across patients. Traditional prototype-based methods rely on
deterministic averaging of support features, creating brittle representations
that fail to capture intra-class diversity essential for robust generalization.
This work introduces Diffusion Prototype Learning (DPL), a novel framework that
reformulates prototype construction through diffusion-based feature space
exploration. DPL models one-shot prototypes as learnable probability
distributions, enabling controlled generation of diverse yet semantically
coherent prototype variants from minimal labeled data. The framework operates
through three core innovations: (1) a diffusion-based prototype enhancement
module that transforms single support prototypes into diverse variant sets via
forward-reverse diffusion processes, (2) a spatial-aware conditioning mechanism
that leverages geometric properties derived from prototype feature statistics,
and (3) a conservative fusion strategy that preserves prototype fidelity while
maximizing representational diversity. DPL ensures training-inference
consistency by using the same diffusion enhancement and fusion pipeline in both
phases. This process generates enhanced prototypes that serve as the final
representations for similarity calculations, while the diffusion process itself
acts as a regularizer. Extensive experiments on abdominal MRI and CT datasets
demonstrate significant improvements respectively, establishing new
state-of-the-art performance in one-shot medical image segmentation.

### [23] [State Space Prompting via Gathering and Spreading Spatio-Temporal Information for Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12160)
*Jiahuan Zhou,Kai Zhu,Zhenyu Cui,Zichen Liu,Xu Zou,Gang Hua*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes State Space Prompting (SSP) for video understanding, which uses intra-frame and inter-frame prompts to better capture spatiotemporal information in videos, improving performance while reducing fine-tuning parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pre-trained state space models for video classification fail to effectively capture spatial and temporal contextual information when using prompt learning, limiting their ability to extract discriminative information from videos.

Method: Proposed SSP method with two modules: Intra-Frame Gathering (IFG) to aggregate spatial key information within frames, and Inter-Frame Spreading (IFS) to spread discriminative spatiotemporal information across frames, adaptively balancing and compressing key information.

Result: Extensive experiments on four video benchmark datasets show SSP significantly outperforms existing SOTA methods by 2.76% on average while reducing fine-tuning parameter overhead.

Conclusion: SSP effectively propagates discriminative information in videos through complementary intra-frame and inter-frame prompting, achieving superior performance with efficient parameter usage.

Abstract: Recently, pre-trained state space models have shown great potential for video
classification, which sequentially compresses visual tokens in videos with
linear complexity, thereby improving the processing efficiency of video data
while maintaining high performance. To apply powerful pre-trained models to
downstream tasks, prompt learning is proposed to achieve efficient downstream
task adaptation with only a small number of fine-tuned parameters. However, the
sequentially compressed visual prompt tokens fail to capture the spatial and
temporal contextual information in the video, thus limiting the effective
propagation of spatial information within a video frame and temporal
information between frames in the state compression model and the extraction of
discriminative information. To tackle the above issue, we proposed a State
Space Prompting (SSP) method for video understanding, which combines
intra-frame and inter-frame prompts to aggregate and propagate key
spatiotemporal information in the video. Specifically, an Intra-Frame Gathering
(IFG) module is designed to aggregate spatial key information within each
frame. Besides, an Inter-Frame Spreading (IFS) module is designed to spread
discriminative spatio-temporal information across different frames. By
adaptively balancing and compressing key spatio-temporal information within and
between frames, our SSP effectively propagates discriminative information in
videos in a complementary manner. Extensive experiments on four video benchmark
datasets verify that our SSP significantly outperforms existing SOTA methods by
2.76% on average while reducing the overhead of fine-tuning parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified framework for multimodal 3D reconstruction that achieves geometric consistency across different modalities (RGB, depth, normals, semantics) while maintaining computational efficiency.

Method: Uses 3D Gaussian Splatting with redesigned rasterization for depth via differentiable ray-ellipsoid intersection, analytic gradient formulation for surface normal rendering, and introduces learnable attributes for differentiable pruning of Gaussians.

Result: State-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy across all modalities (RGB, depth, normals, semantics) with improved geometric consistency and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed geometry-aware paradigm effectively enables high-fidelity multimodal 3D reconstruction with superior accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose UniGS, a unified map representation and
differentiable framework for high-fidelity multimodal 3D reconstruction based
on 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our framework integrates a CUDA-accelerated
rasterization pipeline capable of rendering photo-realistic RGB images,
geometrically accurate depth maps, consistent surface normals, and semantic
logits simultaneously. We redesign the rasterization to render depth via
differentiable ray-ellipsoid intersection rather than using Gaussian centers,
enabling effective optimization of rotation and scale attribute through
analytic depth gradients. Furthermore, we derive the analytic gradient
formulation for surface normal rendering, ensuring geometric consistency among
reconstructed 3D scenes. To improve computational and storage efficiency, we
introduce a learnable attribute that enables differentiable pruning of
Gaussians with minimal contribution during training. Quantitative and
qualitative experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy
across all modalities, validating the efficacy of our geometry-aware paradigm.

*Youngju Yoo,Seho Kim,Changick Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BEEP3D is an end-to-end framework for 3D instance segmentation using only box-level supervision, avoiding the need for expensive point-level annotations through a student-teacher approach with pseudo-mask generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fully supervised 3D instance segmentation requires dense point-level annotations which are costly and labor-intensive. Box-level supervision is more scalable but introduces ambiguity in overlapping regions. Existing two-stage pseudo-mask generation methods increase training complexity and hinder end-to-end optimization.

Method: BEEP3D uses a student-teacher framework where the teacher model generates pseudo-masks and is updated via Exponential Moving Average from the student. It includes instance center-based query refinement for better localization and two novel losses: query consistency loss and masked feature consistency loss to align semantic and geometric signals.

Result: Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and S3DIS datasets show BEEP3D achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods while remaining computationally efficient.

Conclusion: BEEP3D provides an effective end-to-end solution for box-supervised 3D instance segmentation that eliminates the need for expensive point-level annotations while maintaining high performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: 3D instance segmentation is crucial for understanding complex 3D
environments, yet fully supervised methods require dense point-level
annotations, resulting in substantial annotation costs and labor overhead. To
mitigate this, box-level annotations have been explored as a weaker but more
scalable form of supervision. However, box annotations inherently introduce
ambiguity in overlapping regions, making accurate point-to-instance assignment
challenging. Recent methods address this ambiguity by generating pseudo-masks
through training a dedicated pseudo-labeler in an additional training stage.
However, such two-stage pipelines often increase overall training time and
complexity, hinder end-to-end optimization. To overcome these challenges, we
propose BEEP3D-Box-supervised End-to-End Pseudo-mask generation for 3D instance
segmentation. BEEP3D adopts a student-teacher framework, where the teacher
model serves as a pseudo-labeler and is updated by the student model via an
Exponential Moving Average. To better guide the teacher model to generate
precise pseudo-masks, we introduce an instance center-based query refinement
that enhances position query localization and leverages features near instance
centers. Additionally, we design two novel losses-query consistency loss and
masked feature consistency loss-to align semantic and geometric signals between
predictions and pseudo-masks. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and S3DIS
datasets demonstrate that BEEP3D achieves competitive or superior performance
compared to state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods while remaining
computationally efficient.

TL;DR: CompoDistill is a knowledge distillation framework that addresses visual attention misalignment between teacher and student MLLMs to improve visual perception in smaller models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KD methods struggle to effectively transfer rich visual perception abilities from larger MLLMs to smaller ones, with visual attention misalignment identified as the main cause.

Method: Proposes CompoDistill framework that explicitly aligns student's visual attention with teacher's visual attention to enhance visual perception capabilities.

Result: Significantly improves performance on compositional reasoning tasks requiring visual perception while maintaining strong VQA performance, and shows effectiveness with advanced backbones.

Conclusion: CompoDistill effectively addresses visual attention misalignment in MLLM knowledge distillation, demonstrating improved visual perception transfer and generalizability across different model architectures.

Abstract: Recently, efficient Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained
significant attention as a solution to their high computational complexity,
making them more practical for real-world applications. In this regard, the
knowledge distillation (KD) approach has emerged as a promising alternative,
which transfers the rich visual and linguistic knowledge from a larger model
(teacher) to a smaller model (student). However, we observe that existing KD
methods struggle to effectively distill the teacher MLLM's rich visual
perception abilities to the student, a challenge that has been largely
overlooked in previous studies. Through a systematic analysis, we identify
visual attention misalignment between student and teacher as the main cause of
this issue. Based on this insight, we propose CompoDistill, a novel KD
framework that explicitly aligns the student's visual attention with that of
the teacher to enhance the student's visual perception abilities. Our extensive
experiments show that CompoDistill significantly improves performance on
compositional reasoning tasks that require visual perception abilities while
maintaining strong performance on visual question answering tasks, as done in
existing studies. Furthermore, CompoDistill demonstrates effectiveness with a
more advanced backbone, highlighting its generalizability.

Result: Ranked 2nd among 29 teams on the official 2COOOL open leaderboard and achieved the best CIDEr-D score, producing accurate and coherent incident narratives.

Conclusion: Hierarchical reasoning with VLMs is a promising direction for accident analysis and broader understanding of safety-critical traffic events.

Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving have been enabled by
training on diverse large-scale driving datasets, yet autonomous driving models
still struggle in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. The COOOL benchmark
targets this gap by encouraging hazard understanding beyond closed taxonomies,
and the 2COOOL challenge extends it to generating human-interpretable incident
reports. We present a hierarchical reasoning framework for incident report
generation from dashcam videos that integrates frame-level captioning, incident

(VLMs). We further improve factual accuracy and readability through model
ensembling and a Blind A/B Scoring selection protocol. On the official 2COOOL
open leaderboard, our method ranks 2nd among 29 teams and achieves the best

Motivation: Many AI applications face limitations due to lack of expertise and resources, forcing reliance on general-purpose models that require costly domain-specific data for fine-tuning. Synthetic data offers a cost-effective alternative to gathering real-world data.

Method: Examined the impact of synthetic data generated using NVIDIA Omniverse Replicator on object detection models, specifically for pallet detection in warehouse settings. Conducted experiments using both real and various synthetic dataset generation strategies.

Result: The study found that synthetic data can significantly impact object detection model performance in real-world scenarios, with balanced integration of synthetic and real data leading to robust models.

Conclusion: A balanced integration of synthetic and real data can lead to robust and efficient object detection models, providing valuable insights for practical applications of synthetic image data in computer vision for warehouse logistics.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI, particularly in computer vision (CV), offer
new opportunities to optimize workflows across industries, including logistics
and manufacturing. However, many AI applications are limited by a lack of
expertise and resources, which forces a reliance on general-purpose models.
Success with these models often requires domain-specific data for fine-tuning,

work investigates the impact of synthetic data on the performance of object
detection models, compared to models trained on real-world data only,
specifically within the domain of warehouse logistics. To this end, we examined

tool on the effectiveness of object detection models in real-world scenarios.
It comprises experiments focused on pallet detection in a warehouse setting,

Method: Proposed DIANet with two streams: one for onset-to-apex phase and another for apex-to-offset phase, processed by dedicated CNNs and fused using cross-attention module.

Result: Outperforms conventional single-phase DI-based approaches on CASME-II, SAMM, and MMEW datasets, demonstrating superior recognition performance.

Conclusion: Explicit modeling of temporal phase information is crucial for micro-expression recognition, providing a promising direction for advancing MER systems.

Abstract: Micro-expressions are brief, involuntary facial movements that typically last
less than half a second and often reveal genuine emotions. Accurately
recognizing these subtle expressions is critical for applications in
psychology, security, and behavioral analysis. However, micro-expression
recognition (MER) remains a challenging task due to the subtle and transient
nature of facial cues and the limited availability of annotated data. While
dynamic image (DI) representations have been introduced to summarize temporal
motion into a single frame, conventional DI-based methods often overlook the
distinct characteristics of different temporal phases within a
micro-expression. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel
dual-stream framework, DIANet, which leverages phase-aware dynamic images - one
encoding the onset-to-apex phase and the other capturing the apex-to-offset
phase. Each stream is processed by a dedicated convolutional neural network,
and a cross-attention fusion module is employed to adaptively integrate
features from both streams based on their contextual relevance. Extensive
experiments conducted on three benchmark MER datasets (CASME-II, SAMM, and
MMEW) demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms
conventional single-phase DI-based approaches. The results highlight the
importance of modeling temporal phase information explicitly and suggest a
promising direction for advancing MER.

TL;DR: This paper introduces data curation strategies for vision-language reasoning datasets and presents HoneyBee, a large-scale chain-of-thought dataset that significantly improves VLM performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The principles behind constructing effective vision-language reasoning training datasets are not well understood, despite VLMs showing strong reasoning capabilities.

Method: Analyzed data curation approaches including context source strategies, targeted interventions (auxiliary signals, text-only reasoning), and scaling data dimensions. Created HoneyBee dataset with 2.5M examples and proposed test-time scaling strategy.

Result: HoneyBee-trained VLMs outperform state-of-the-art models across sizes (3B model beats SOTA by 7.8% on MathVerse). Test-time scaling reduces decoding cost by 73% without accuracy loss.

Conclusion: The work provides improved strategies for vision-language reasoning dataset curation, demonstrating the importance of data quality and scaling across multiple dimensions.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have made them highly
effective at reasoning tasks. However, the principles underlying the
construction of performant VL reasoning training datasets remain poorly
understood. In this work, we introduce several data curation approaches and
study their impacts on VL reasoning capabilities by carefully controlling
training and evaluation setups. We analyze the effects of context (image and
question pair) sources, implement targeted data interventions, and explore
scaling up images, questions, and chain-of-thought (CoT) solutions. Our
findings reveal that (a) context source strategies significantly affect VLM
performance, (b) interventions such as auxiliary signals from image captions
and the inclusion of text-only reasoning yield substantial gains, and (c)
scaling all data dimensions (e.g., unique questions per image and unique CoTs
per image-question pair) consistently improves reasoning capability. Motivated
by these insights, we introduce HoneyBee, a large-scale, high-quality CoT
reasoning dataset with 2.5M examples consisting 350K image-question pairs. VLMs
trained with HoneyBee outperform state-of-the-art models across model sizes.
For instance, a HoneyBee-trained VLM with 3B parameters outperforms the SOTA
model and the base model by 7.8% and 24.8%, respectively, on MathVerse.
Furthermore, we propose a test-time scaling strategy that reduces decoding cost
by 73% without sacrificing accuracy. Overall, this work presents improved
strategies for VL reasoning dataset curation research.

*Victor Besnier,David Hurych,Andrei Bursuc,Eduardo Valle*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method for self-correcting image and video generation that combines parallel token prediction with iterative refinement to improve efficiency while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving inference efficiency in generative models is crucial for commercial viability, but parallel token prediction can cause structural inconsistencies due to token incompatibilities that cannot be backtracked.

Method: Proposes iterative token refinement with a novel training scheme that injects random tokens in context to improve robustness and enable token fixing during sampling.

Result: Achieves substantial improvements in generation quality while preserving efficiency benefits, demonstrated on ImageNet-256, CIFAR-10 for images and UCF-101, NuScenes for videos.

Conclusion: The self-correcting approach successfully balances efficiency and quality in image and video generation across multiple datasets and modalities.

Abstract: Recent advances in image and video generation have raised significant
interest from both academia and industry. A key challenge in this field is
improving inference efficiency, as model size and the number of inference steps
directly impact the commercial viability of generative models while also posing
fundamental scientific challenges. A promising direction involves combining
auto-regressive sequential token modeling with multi-token prediction per step,
reducing inference time by up to an order of magnitude. However, predicting
multiple tokens in parallel can introduce structural inconsistencies due to
token incompatibilities, as capturing complex joint dependencies during
training remains challenging. Traditionally, once tokens are sampled, there is
no mechanism to backtrack and refine erroneous predictions. We propose a method
for self-correcting image generation by iteratively refining sampled tokens. We
achieve this with a novel training scheme that injects random tokens in the
context, improving robustness and enabling token fixing during sampling. Our
method preserves the efficiency benefits of parallel token prediction while
significantly enhancing generation quality. We evaluate our approach on image
generation using the ImageNet-256 and CIFAR-10 datasets, as well as on video
generation with UCF-101 and NuScenes, demonstrating substantial improvements
across both modalities.

TL;DR: Ivan-ISTD is a wavelet-guided framework for infrared small target detection that addresses cross-domain shift and heteroscedastic noise through domain synthesis and noise invariance learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome cross-domain shift and heteroscedastic noise perturbations in infrared small target detection, which are critical challenges in drone-based multi-modality sensing applications.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Wavelet-guided Cross-domain Synthesis for domain alignment using multi-frequency wavelet filtering, 2) Real-domain Noise Invariance Learning with dynamic noise library and self-supervised loss.

Result: Outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in quantitative metrics and demonstrates excellent robustness in cross-domain scenarios, validated on Dynamic-ISTD Benchmark and other real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed Ivan-ISTD framework effectively addresses domain shift and noise challenges in infrared small target detection, showing superior performance and robustness compared to existing methods.

Abstract: In the multimedia domain, Infrared Small Target Detection (ISTD) plays a
important role in drone-based multi-modality sensing. To address the dual
challenges of cross-domain shift and heteroscedastic noise perturbations in
ISTD, we propose a doubly wavelet-guided Invariance learning
framework(Ivan-ISTD). In the first stage, we generate training samples aligned
with the target domain using Wavelet-guided Cross-domain Synthesis. This
wavelet-guided alignment machine accurately separates the target background
through multi-frequency wavelet filtering. In the second stage, we introduce
Real-domain Noise Invariance Learning, which extracts real noise
characteristics from the target domain to build a dynamic noise library. The
model learns noise invariance through self-supervised loss, thereby overcoming
the limitations of distribution bias in traditional artificial noise modeling.
Finally, we create the Dynamic-ISTD Benchmark, a cross-domain dynamic
degradation dataset that simulates the distribution shifts encountered in
real-world applications. Additionally, we validate the versatility of our
method using other real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of many
quantitative metrics. In particular, Ivan-ISTD demonstrates excellent
robustness in cross-domain scenarios. The code for this work can be found at:

### [33] [Vectorized Video Representation with Easy Editing via Hierarchical Spatio-Temporally Consistent Proxy Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12256)
*Ye Chen,Liming Tan,Yupeng Zhu,Yuanbin Wang,Bingbing Ni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes spatio-temporally consistent proxy nodes to represent dynamic objects/scenes in videos, overcoming limitations of pixel-level tracking by using hierarchical multi-scale structures that are robust to tracking errors, occlusions, and large motions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video representations rely on unstable pixel-level matching and tracking, which are vulnerable to tracking errors, occlusions, and large motions that can collapse object representations.

Method: Uses hierarchical proxy nodes with dynamic representation update mechanism to stably express multi-scale object structures, leveraging spatio-temporal priors to handle inaccurate trackers and scene changes, with decoupled shape and texture encoding.

Result: Achieves high video reconstruction accuracy with fewer parameters and supports complex video processing tasks including video in-painting and keyframe-based temporally consistent video editing.

Conclusion: The proxy node representation provides robust video representation that overcomes tracking vulnerabilities while enabling fine-grained appearance editing and supporting advanced video processing applications.

Abstract: Current video representations heavily rely on unstable and over-grained
priors for motion and appearance modelling, \emph{i.e.}, pixel-level matching
and tracking. A tracking error of just a few pixels would lead to the collapse
of the visual object representation, not to mention occlusions and large motion
frequently occurring in videos. To overcome the above mentioned vulnerability,
this work proposes spatio-temporally consistent proxy nodes to represent
dynamically changing objects/scenes in the video. On the one hand, the
hierarchical proxy nodes have the ability to stably express the multi-scale
structure of visual objects, so they are not affected by accumulated tracking
error, long-term motion, occlusion, and viewpoint variation. On the other hand,
the dynamic representation update mechanism of the proxy nodes adequately
leverages spatio-temporal priors of the video to mitigate the impact of
inaccurate trackers, thereby effectively handling drastic changes in scenes and
objects. Additionally, the decoupled encoding manner of the shape and texture
representations across different visual objects in the video facilitates
controllable and fine-grained appearance editing capability. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed representation achieves high video
reconstruction accuracy with fewer parameters and supports complex video
processing tasks, including video in-painting and keyframe-based temporally
consistent video editing.

*Yuto Yokoi,Kazuhiro Hotta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes two novel multiplicative loss functions for medical image segmentation that combine Cross Entropy and Dice losses multiplicatively, outperforming traditional additive combinations especially under data scarcity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical images suffer from data scarcity due to privacy, ethics, and costly annotations, requiring robust training objectives. Traditional additive combinations of Cross Entropy and Dice Loss are sensitive to hyperparameters and perform suboptimally with limited data.

Method: Multiplicative Loss combines Cross Entropy and Dice losses multiplicatively to dynamically modulate gradients based on prediction confidence. Confidence-Adaptive Multiplicative Loss adds confidence-driven exponential scaling inspired by Focal Loss, integrating predicted probabilities and Dice coefficients to emphasize difficult samples.

Result: Experiments on cellular and medical segmentation benchmarks show the framework consistently outperforms tuned additive and existing loss functions, offering robust performance under challenging data limitations.

Conclusion: The proposed multiplicative loss functions provide a simple, effective, and hyperparameter-free mechanism for robust semantic segmentation in medical and cellular images, particularly valuable under extreme data scarcity conditions.

Abstract: We propose two novel loss functions, Multiplicative Loss and
Confidence-Adaptive Multiplicative Loss, for semantic segmentation in medical
and cellular images. Although Cross Entropy and Dice Loss are widely used,
their additive combination is sensitive to hyperparameters and often performs
suboptimally, especially with limited data. Medical images suffer from data
scarcity due to privacy, ethics, and costly annotations, requiring robust and
efficient training objectives. Our Multiplicative Loss combines Cross Entropy
and Dice losses multiplicatively, dynamically modulating gradients based on
prediction confidence. This reduces penalties for confident correct predictions
and amplifies gradients for incorrect overconfident ones, stabilizing
optimization. Building on this, Confidence-Adaptive Multiplicative Loss applies
a confidence-driven exponential scaling inspired by Focal Loss, integrating
predicted probabilities and Dice coefficients to emphasize difficult samples.
This enhances learning under extreme data scarcity by strengthening gradients
when confidence is low. Experiments on cellular and medical segmentation
benchmarks show our framework consistently outperforms tuned additive and
existing loss functions, offering a simple, effective, and hyperparameter-free
mechanism for robust segmentation under challenging data limitations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a novel OOD detection method that uses local background features from ID images as fake OOD features during training to reduce model overconfidence on OOD data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of neural networks producing overconfident predictions on OOD data, while avoiding the high costs of collecting auxiliary OOD datasets or generating fake OOD images.

Method: Extract background features from in-distribution (ID) images as simulated OOD representations based on local convolution invariance, then optimize networks to reduce L2-norm of these background features.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art performance on multiple standard OOD detection benchmarks and shows wide combinatorial compatibility with existing post-hoc methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively alleviates overconfidence on OOD data by leveraging local background features as fake OOD features, providing a cost-effective and high-performing OOD detection solution.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial when deploying deep neural
networks in the real world to ensure the reliability and safety of their
applications. One main challenge in OOD detection is that neural network models
often produce overconfident predictions on OOD data. While some methods using
auxiliary OOD datasets or generating fake OOD images have shown promising OOD
detection performance, they are limited by the high costs of data collection
and training. In this study, we propose a novel and effective OOD detection
method that utilizes local background features as fake OOD features for model
training. Inspired by the observation that OOD images generally share similar
background regions with ID images, the background features are extracted from
ID images as simulated OOD visual representations during training based on the
local invariance of convolution. Through being optimized to reduce the
$L_2$-norm of these background features, the neural networks are able to
alleviate the overconfidence issue on OOD data. Extensive experiments on
multiple standard OOD detection benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of our
method and its wide combinatorial compatibility with existing post-hoc methods,
with new state-of-the-art performance achieved from our method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AngularFuse is a novel visible-infrared image fusion framework that uses cross-modal complementary masks, fine-grained reference image synthesis, and angle-aware loss to produce enhanced fused images with better detail preservation and balanced brightness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unsupervised fusion methods rely on manually designed loss functions that have limitations - constructed reference images lack details and have uneven brightness, while gradient losses only focus on magnitude, not direction.

Method: Three key components: 1) Cross-modal complementary mask module to learn complementary information between modalities, 2) Fine-grained reference image synthesis combining Laplacian edge enhancement with adaptive histogram equalization, 3) Angle-aware loss that constrains both gradient magnitude and direction simultaneously.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on MSRS, RoadScene, and M3FD datasets show AngularFuse outperforms existing mainstream methods with clear margin. Visual comparisons confirm sharper and more detailed results in challenging scenes.

Conclusion: AngularFuse demonstrates superior fusion capability by preserving both texture intensity and correct edge orientation, producing enhanced fused images better suited for downstream tasks like autonomous driving and nighttime surveillance.

Abstract: Visible-infrared image fusion is crucial in key applications such as
autonomous driving and nighttime surveillance. Its main goal is to integrate
multimodal information to produce enhanced images that are better suited for
downstream tasks. Although deep learning based fusion methods have made
significant progress, mainstream unsupervised approaches still face serious
challenges in practical applications. Existing methods mostly rely on manually
designed loss functions to guide the fusion process. However, these loss
functions have obvious limitations. On one hand, the reference images
constructed by existing methods often lack details and have uneven brightness.
On the other hand, the widely used gradient losses focus only on gradient
magnitude. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an angle-based
perception framework for spatial-sensitive image fusion (AngularFuse). At
first, we design a cross-modal complementary mask module to force the network
to learn complementary information between modalities. Then, a fine-grained
reference image synthesis strategy is introduced. By combining Laplacian edge
enhancement with adaptive histogram equalization, reference images with richer
details and more balanced brightness are generated. Last but not least, we
introduce an angle-aware loss, which for the first time constrains both
gradient magnitude and direction simultaneously in the gradient domain.
AngularFuse ensures that the fused images preserve both texture intensity and
correct edge orientation. Comprehensive experiments on the MSRS, RoadScene, and
M3FD public datasets show that AngularFuse outperforms existing mainstream
methods with clear margin. Visual comparisons further confirm that our method
produces sharper and more detailed results in challenging scenes, demonstrating
superior fusion capability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks inadequately assess MLLM performance in nuanced medical domains like spine that heavily rely on visual input, creating a gap in specialized medical evaluation.

Method: Created SpineBench by integrating and standardizing open-source spinal disease datasets, generating challenging hard negative options based on visual similarity to simulate real-world scenarios.

Result: Evaluation of 12 leading MLLMs revealed poor performance in spinal tasks, highlighting current limitations in the spine domain.

Conclusion: SpineBench identifies limitations of current MLLMs in spinal medicine and provides guidance for future improvements in specialized medical applications.

Abstract: With the increasing integration of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
into the medical field, comprehensive evaluation of their performance in
various medical domains becomes critical. However, existing benchmarks
primarily assess general medical tasks, inadequately capturing performance in
nuanced areas like the spine, which relies heavily on visual input. To address
this, we introduce SpineBench, a comprehensive Visual Question Answering (VQA)
benchmark designed for fine-grained analysis and evaluation of MLLMs in the
spinal domain. SpineBench comprises 64,878 QA pairs from 40,263 spine images,
covering 11 spinal diseases through two critical clinical tasks: spinal disease
diagnosis and spinal lesion localization, both in multiple-choice format.
SpineBench is built by integrating and standardizing image-label pairs from
open-source spinal disease datasets, and samples challenging hard negative
options for each VQA pair based on visual similarity (similar but not the same
disease), simulating real-world challenging scenarios. We evaluate 12 leading
MLLMs on SpineBench. The results reveal that these models exhibit poor
performance in spinal tasks, highlighting limitations of current MLLM in the
spine domain and guiding future improvements in spinal medicine applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PAGS introduces a priority-adaptive 3D reconstruction framework that uses semantic priorities to optimize resource allocation, achieving high-quality reconstruction of safety-critical objects while significantly improving computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current dynamic 3D urban scene reconstruction methods face a trade-off between fidelity and computational cost due to semantically agnostic designs that treat all scene elements equally, without prioritizing safety-critical objects.

Method: PAGS introduces two core techniques: (1) Semantically-Guided Pruning and Regularization using hybrid importance metrics to simplify non-critical elements while preserving safety-critical details, and (2) Priority-Driven Rendering pipeline with priority-based depth pre-pass to cull occluded primitives and accelerate shading.

Result: Extensive experiments on Waymo and KITTI datasets show PAGS achieves exceptional reconstruction quality on safety-critical objects while reducing training time and achieving rendering speeds over 350 FPS.

Conclusion: PAGS successfully addresses the fidelity-efficiency trade-off in dynamic 3D urban scene reconstruction by incorporating task-aware semantic priorities, making it particularly suitable for autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D urban scenes is crucial for autonomous driving, yet
current methods face a stark trade-off between fidelity and computational cost.
This inefficiency stems from their semantically agnostic design, which
allocates resources uniformly, treating static backgrounds and safety-critical
objects with equal importance. To address this, we introduce Priority-Adaptive
Gaussian Splatting (PAGS), a framework that injects task-aware semantic
priorities directly into the 3D reconstruction and rendering pipeline. PAGS
introduces two core contributions: (1) Semantically-Guided Pruning and
Regularization strategy, which employs a hybrid importance metric to
aggressively simplify non-critical scene elements while preserving fine-grained
details on objects vital for navigation. (2) Priority-Driven Rendering
pipeline, which employs a priority-based depth pre-pass to aggressively cull
occluded primitives and accelerate the final shading computations. Extensive
experiments on the Waymo and KITTI datasets demonstrate that PAGS achieves
exceptional reconstruction quality, particularly on safety-critical objects,
while significantly reducing training time and boosting rendering speeds to
over 350 FPS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes DL-DKD++, a dual learning framework with dynamic knowledge distillation for partially relevant video retrieval (PRVR), where a teacher model transfers knowledge to a compact student network with inheritance and exploration branches to handle untrimmed videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-video retrieval methods assume pre-trimmed videos with short durations, but real-world videos are untrimmed with complex background content, requiring more practical PRVR approaches.

Method: Uses a large teacher model to supervise a dual-branch student network: inheritance branch absorbs transferable knowledge, exploration branch learns task-specific information. Incorporates dynamic soft-target construction to replace rigid hard-target supervision.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on TVR, ActivityNet, and Charades-STA datasets for PRVR.

Conclusion: The proposed DL-DKD++ framework effectively handles partially relevant video retrieval by distilling knowledge from large pre-trained models and adapting to domain-specific requirements through dual learning and dynamic supervision.

Abstract: Almost all previous text-to-video retrieval works ideally assume that videos
are pre-trimmed with short durations containing solely text-related content.
However, in practice, videos are typically untrimmed in long durations with
much more complicated background content. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on
the more practical yet challenging task of Partially Relevant Video Retrieval
(PRVR), which aims to retrieve partially relevant untrimmed videos with the
given query. To tackle this task, we propose a novel framework that distills
generalization knowledge from a powerful large-scale vision-language
pre-trained model and transfers it to a lightweight, task-specific PRVR
network. Specifically, we introduce a Dual Learning framework with Dynamic
Knowledge Distillation (DL-DKD++), where a large teacher model provides
supervision to a compact dual-branch student network. The student model
comprises two branches: an inheritance branch that absorbs transferable
knowledge from the teacher, and an exploration branch that learns task-specific
information from the PRVR dataset to address domain gaps. To further enhance
learning, we incorporate a dynamic soft-target construction mechanism. By
replacing rigid hard-target supervision with adaptive soft targets that evolve
during training, our method enables the model to better capture the
fine-grained, partial relevance between videos and queries. Experiment results
demonstrate that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on
TVR, ActivityNet, and Charades-STA datasets for PRVR. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs hallucinate brand names from logos without visible text, with circular logos being particularly problematic. Hallucinations persist under distortions and are tied to specific projector dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Language Models show impressive multimodal reasoning but suffer from hallucinations where outputs aren't grounded in visual evidence, particularly with logos that contain no visible text.

Method: Used curated logo datasets (pure symbols, hybrids, text-bearing), Hard-60 subset, and nine structured perturbations. Conducted embedding-level analysis with LLaVA and targeted ablation of projector dimensions.

Result: Hallucinations persist even under strong distortions, with occlusion being most problematic. Analysis shows hallucinations are tied to a small subset of projector dimensions, and targeted ablation reduces errors while preserving OCR accuracy.

Conclusion: VLMs rely on symbolic priors rather than genuine glyph perception, especially for circular logos. Projector subspaces play a key role in this failure mode, suggesting projector disentanglement and OCR-guided decoding as promising mitigation approaches.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive progress in multimodal
reasoning; yet, they remain vulnerable to hallucinations, where outputs are not
grounded in visual evidence. In this paper, we investigate a previously
overlooked setting: logo hallucination, where models generate brand names or
textual content despite logos containing no visible words. Using curated splits
of pure symbols, hybrids, and text-bearing logos, as well as the challenging
Hard-60 subset, we systematically measure hallucination across leading VLMs. We
further probe robustness through nine structured perturbations and show that
hallucinations persist even under strong distortions, with occlusion exposing
the sharpest weaknesses. Embedding-level analysis with open-weight LLaVA
demonstrates that hallucination is tied to a small subset of projector
dimensions, and targeted ablation substantially reduces errors while preserving
OCR accuracy. Together, these findings reveal that VLMs often rely on symbolic
priors rather than genuine glyph perception, particularly for iconic circular
logos, and that projector subspaces play a decisive role in this failure mode.
Our work contributes both a novel diagnostic lens and actionable mitigation
insights, highlighting projector disentanglement and OCR-guided decoding as
promising directions for building more trustworthy multimodal systems.

TL;DR: A hybrid approach combining Gaussian splatting and diffusion models for novel view synthesis in street scenes, achieving second place in the RealADSim-NVS challenge at ICCV 2025.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of generating realistic novel views of urban environments from different traversals (e.g., different street lanes or directions) for autonomous driving simulation.

Method: Two-stage approach: first fit 3D scene reconstruction using Gaussian splatting and render novel views, then enhance frames with a single-step diffusion model. Includes specific techniques for Gaussian primitive initialization and enhancer model fine-tuning.

Result: Achieved aggregated score of 0.432 on the public leaderboard, placing second overall. Performance measured by PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach combining 3D reconstruction with generative enhancement proves effective for novel view synthesis in street scenes, demonstrating competitive performance in the challenge.

Abstract: This paper describes the Qualcomm AI Research solution to the RealADSim-NVS
challenge, hosted at the RealADSim Workshop at ICCV 2025. The challenge
concerns novel view synthesis in street scenes, and participants are required
to generate, starting from car-centric frames captured during some training
traversals, renders of the same urban environment as viewed from a different
traversal (e.g. different street lane or car direction). Our solution is
inspired by hybrid methods in scene generation and generative simulators
merging gaussian splatting and diffusion models, and it is composed of two
stages: First, we fit a 3D reconstruction of the scene and render novel views
as seen from the target cameras. Then, we enhance the resulting frames with a
dedicated single-step diffusion model. We discuss specific choices made in the
initialization of gaussian primitives as well as the finetuning of the enhancer
model and its training data curation. We report the performance of our model
design and we ablate its components in terms of novel view quality as measured
by PSNR, SSIM and LPIPS. On the public leaderboard reporting test results, our
proposal reaches an aggregated score of 0.432, achieving the second place
overall.

TL;DR: CurriFlow is a semantic scene completion framework that integrates optical flow-based temporal alignment with curriculum-guided depth fusion to improve 3D geometry and semantic prediction from monocular images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SSC methods lack explicit motion reasoning and struggle with occlusions and noisy depth supervision, limiting their effectiveness for camera-based perception in autonomous driving.

Method: Uses multi-level fusion with pre-trained optical flow for temporal alignment, curriculum learning from LiDAR to stereo depth, and semantic priors from SAM for category-agnostic supervision.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on SemanticKITTI benchmark with mean IoU of 16.9, demonstrating improved temporal consistency and dynamic object understanding.

Conclusion: The motion-guided and curriculum-aware design effectively addresses challenges in camera-based 3D semantic scene completion, validating the proposed approach.

Abstract: Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) aims to infer complete 3D geometry and
semantics from monocular images, serving as a crucial capability for
camera-based perception in autonomous driving. However, existing SSC methods
relying on temporal stacking or depth projection often lack explicit motion
reasoning and struggle with occlusions and noisy depth supervision. We propose
CurriFlow, a novel semantic occupancy prediction framework that integrates
optical flow-based temporal alignment with curriculum-guided depth fusion.
CurriFlow employs a multi-level fusion strategy to align segmentation, visual,
and depth features across frames using pre-trained optical flow, thereby
improving temporal consistency and dynamic object understanding. To enhance
geometric robustness, a curriculum learning mechanism progressively transitions
from sparse yet accurate LiDAR depth to dense but noisy stereo depth during
training, ensuring stable optimization and seamless adaptation to real-world
deployment. Furthermore, semantic priors from the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
provide category-agnostic supervision, strengthening voxel-level semantic

*Sharath M Shankaranarayana,Soumava Kumar Roy,Prasad Sudhakar,Chandan Aladahalli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an attention-guided learnable subsampling framework that dynamically adapts to different inputs during inference, reducing computational complexity while maintaining performance in 3D medical imaging and video classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks often achieve performance gains at the cost of increased computational complexity and expense. Many tasks like 3D volume or video classification have inherent redundancies where not all slices/frames are necessary, but existing subsampling methods are static and not input-adaptive.

Method: Developed an attention-guided sampling module that can be integrated into any neural network architecture. Unlike previous approaches using Gumbel-max trick that are only task-adaptive, this method dynamically adapts to different inputs even during inference.

Result: The method demonstrates effectiveness on 3D medical imaging datasets from MedMNIST3D and two ultrasound video datasets for classification tasks, including a challenging in-house dataset collected under real-world clinical conditions. It achieves performance gains while reducing complexity.

Conclusion: The proposed input-adaptive subsampling framework successfully addresses the limitations of static sampling methods, providing dynamic adaptation to different inputs during inference, resulting in improved performance and reduced computational complexity in deep neural network models.

Abstract: Although deep neural networks have provided impressive gains in performance,
these improvements often come at the cost of increased computational complexity
and expense. In many cases, such as 3D volume or video classification tasks,
not all slices or frames are necessary due to inherent redundancies. To address
this issue, we propose a novel learnable subsampling framework that can be
integrated into any neural network architecture. Subsampling, being a
nondifferentiable operation, poses significant challenges for direct adaptation
into deep learning models. While some works, have proposed solutions using the
Gumbel-max trick to overcome the problem of non-differentiability, they fall
short in a crucial aspect: they are only task-adaptive and not inputadaptive.
Once the sampling mechanism is learned, it remains static and does not adjust
to different inputs, making it unsuitable for real-world applications. To this
end, we propose an attention-guided sampling module that adapts to inputs even
during inference. This dynamic adaptation results in performance gains and
reduces complexity in deep neural network models. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on 3D medical imaging datasets from MedMNIST3D as
well as two ultrasound video datasets for classification tasks, one of them
being a challenging in-house dataset collected under real-world clinical
conditions.

TL;DR: STORM-PSR is a dual-stream framework for procedure step recognition that combines spatial and temporal features to improve robustness against object occlusion, reducing prediction delays by 11.2-26.1% compared to prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PSR models rely solely on detecting assembly object states in individual frames, neglecting temporal features. This limits robustness and accuracy, especially when objects are partially occluded.

Method: Proposed STORM-PSR dual-stream framework: assembly state detection stream for unobstructed views, and spatio-temporal stream with spatial encoder (pre-trained using novel weakly supervised approach) and transformer-based temporal encoder to capture spatial-temporal relationships under occlusion.

Result: Evaluated on MECCANO and IndustReal datasets, reduced average delay between actual and predicted assembly step completions by 11.2% and 26.1% respectively compared to prior methods. Spatio-temporal stream enables step recognition without requiring unobstructed object views.

Conclusion: STORM-PSR effectively addresses occlusion challenges in procedure step recognition by leveraging both spatial and temporal features, demonstrating significant improvements in prediction accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Procedure step recognition (PSR) aims to identify all correctly completed
steps and their sequential order in videos of procedural tasks. The existing
state-of-the-art models rely solely on detecting assembly object states in
individual video frames. By neglecting temporal features, model robustness and
accuracy are limited, especially when objects are partially occluded. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Spatio-Temporal Occlusion-Resilient
Modeling for Procedure Step Recognition (STORM-PSR), a dual-stream framework
for PSR that leverages both spatial and temporal features. The assembly state
detection stream operates effectively with unobstructed views of the object,
while the spatio-temporal stream captures both spatial and temporal features to
recognize step completions even under partial occlusion. This stream includes a
spatial encoder, pre-trained using a novel weakly supervised approach to
capture meaningful spatial representations, and a transformer-based temporal
encoder that learns how these spatial features relate over time. STORM-PSR is
evaluated on the MECCANO and IndustReal datasets, reducing the average delay
between actual and predicted assembly step completions by 11.2% and 26.1%,
respectively, compared to prior methods. We demonstrate that this reduction in
delay is driven by the spatio-temporal stream, which does not rely on
unobstructed views of the object to infer completed steps. The code for
STORM-PSR, along with the newly annotated MECCANO labels, is made publicly
available at https://timschoonbeek.github.io/stormpsr .

*Wenjing Bian,Axel Barroso-Laguna,Tommaso Cavallari,Victor Adrian Prisacariu,Eric Brachmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a probabilistic approach to training scene coordinate regression models that incorporates reconstruction priors to prevent degeneration when training images lack sufficient multi-view constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scene coordinate regression models can degenerate when trained on images with insufficient multi-view constraints, limiting their effectiveness for 3D vision tasks.

Method: Proposes probabilistic reinterpretation of SCR training that infuses high-level reconstruction priors, including depth distribution priors and learned priors using a 3D point cloud diffusion model trained on indoor scans.

Result: The priors help learn better scene representations, producing more coherent scene point clouds, higher registration rates, better camera poses, and improved performance on downstream tasks like novel view synthesis and relocalization.

Conclusion: Incorporating reconstruction priors during SCR training effectively prevents model degeneration and enhances performance across multiple 3D vision applications.

Abstract: Scene coordinate regression (SCR) models have proven to be powerful implicit
scene representations for 3D vision, enabling visual relocalization and
structure-from-motion. SCR models are trained specifically for one scene. If
training images imply insufficient multi-view constraints SCR models
degenerate. We present a probabilistic reinterpretation of training SCR models,
which allows us to infuse high-level reconstruction priors. We investigate
multiple such priors, ranging from simple priors over the distribution of
reconstructed depth values to learned priors over plausible scene coordinate
configurations. For the latter, we train a 3D point cloud diffusion model on a
large corpus of indoor scans. Our priors push predicted 3D scene points towards
plausible geometry at each training step to increase their likelihood. On three
indoor datasets our priors help learning better scene representations,
resulting in more coherent scene point clouds, higher registration rates and
better camera poses, with a positive effect on down-stream tasks such as novel
view synthesis and camera relocalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This systematic review examines Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for urban infrastructure monitoring, analyzing 32 studies from 2021-2025 to understand their applications, architectures, datasets, and performance in zero-shot settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional urban monitoring using IoT sensors and manual inspections is costly, difficult to scale, and misaligned with citizens' visual perception. VLMs offer potential to enable machines to "see" and reason about urban infrastructure like humans do.

Method: Conducted systematic review following PRISMA methodology, analyzing 32 peer-reviewed studies to address four research questions about urban monitoring tasks, VLM architectures, datasets, and evaluation methods.

Result: The review identified effective urban monitoring tasks addressed by VLMs, commonly used VLM architectures with superior performance, supporting datasets and resources, and reported performance levels across various applications.

Conclusion: VLMs show promise as a technology for urban infrastructure monitoring, particularly in zero-shot applications, offering potential to overcome limitations of traditional monitoring approaches and better align with citizen perception.

Abstract: Urban monitoring of public infrastructure (such as waste bins, road signs,
vegetation, sidewalks, and construction sites) poses significant challenges due
to the diversity of objects, environments, and contextual conditions involved.
Current state-of-the-art approaches typically rely on a combination of IoT
sensors and manual inspections, which are costly, difficult to scale, and often
misaligned with citizens' perception formed through direct visual observation.
This raises a critical question: Can machines now "see" like citizens and infer
informed opinions about the condition of urban infrastructure? Vision-Language
Models (VLMs), which integrate visual understanding with natural language
reasoning, have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in processing
complex visual information, turning them into a promising technology to address
this challenge. This systematic review investigates the role of VLMs in urban
monitoring, with particular emphasis on zero-shot applications. Following the
PRISMA methodology, we analyzed 32 peer-reviewed studies published between 2021
and 2025 to address four core research questions: (1) What urban monitoring
tasks have been effectively addressed using VLMs? (2) Which VLM architectures
and frameworks are most commonly used and demonstrate superior performance? (3)
What datasets and resources support this emerging field? (4) How are VLM-based
applications evaluated, and what performance levels have been reported?

*Huu Tien Nguyen,Ahmed Karam Eldaly*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel conditional flow matching framework for image quality transfer that reconstructs high-field-like MR images from low-field inputs using direct velocity field regression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-field MRI is affordable and portable but suffers from low signal-to-noise ratio and reduced diagnostic quality, creating a need to bridge the quality gap without expensive infrastructure.

Method: Uses conditional flow matching (CFM) to learn a continuous flow between noise and target data distributions through direct regression of an optimal velocity field, avoiding iterative sampling or adversarial objectives.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with robust generalization to both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data, while utilizing significantly fewer parameters than competing deep learning methods.

Conclusion: CFM shows strong potential as a powerful and scalable tool for MRI reconstruction, especially in resource-limited clinical environments.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for image quality transfer based on
conditional flow matching (CFM). Unlike conventional generative models that
rely on iterative sampling or adversarial objectives, CFM learns a continuous
flow between a noise distribution and target data distributions through the
direct regression of an optimal velocity field. We evaluate this approach in
the context of low-field magnetic resonance imaging (LF-MRI), a rapidly
emerging modality that offers affordable and portable scanning but suffers from
inherently low signal-to-noise ratio and reduced diagnostic quality. Our
framework is designed to reconstruct high-field-like MR images from their
corresponding low-field inputs, thereby bridging the quality gap without
requiring expensive infrastructure. Experiments demonstrate that CFM not only
achieves state-of-the-art performance, but also generalizes robustly to both
in-distribution and out-of-distribution data. Importantly, it does so while
utilizing significantly fewer parameters than competing deep learning methods.
These results underline the potential of CFM as a powerful and scalable tool
for MRI reconstruction, particularly in resource-limited clinical environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoLucy is a deep memory backtracking framework that uses hierarchical memory structures and agent-based iterative backtracking to overcome limitations in long video understanding, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agent-based systems for long video understanding struggle with capturing temporal context in consecutive frames and risk losing crucial information due to sparse frame sampling.

Method: Proposes VideoLucy with hierarchical memory structure with progressive granularity and agent-based iterative backtracking mechanism to systematically mine video-wide, question-relevant deep memories.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmarks, achieving performance surpassing proprietary models like GPT-4o.

Conclusion: VideoLucy effectively addresses temporal understanding challenges while preserving critical details in long video understanding tasks.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that agent-based systems leveraging large language
models (LLMs) for key information retrieval and integration have emerged as a
promising approach for long video understanding. However, these systems face
two major challenges. First, they typically perform modeling and reasoning on
individual frames, struggling to capture the temporal context of consecutive
frames. Second, to reduce the cost of dense frame-level captioning, they adopt
sparse frame sampling, which risks discarding crucial information. To overcome
these limitations, we propose VideoLucy, a deep memory backtracking framework
for long video understanding. Inspired by the human recollection process from
coarse to fine, VideoLucy employs a hierarchical memory structure with
progressive granularity. This structure explicitly defines the detail level and
temporal scope of memory at different hierarchical depths. Through an
agent-based iterative backtracking mechanism, VideoLucy systematically mines
video-wide, question-relevant deep memories until sufficient information is
gathered to provide a confident answer. This design enables effective temporal
understanding of consecutive frames while preserving critical details. In
addition, we introduce EgoMem, a new benchmark for long video understanding.
EgoMem is designed to comprehensively evaluate a model's ability to understand
complex events that unfold over time and capture fine-grained details in
extremely long videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
VideoLucy. Built on open-source models, VideoLucy significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on multiple long video understanding benchmarks,
achieving performance even surpassing the latest proprietary models such as
GPT-4o. Our code and dataset will be made publicly at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This survey provides the first comprehensive review of longitudinal radiology report generation (LRRG), focusing on incorporating historical CXR data to improve clinical accuracy in radiology report generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional single-image approaches fail to capture longitudinal context needed for clinically faithful comparison statements. Existing surveys don't adequately address longitudinal settings, leaving researchers without systematic guidance for model design.

Method: The survey examines dataset construction strategies, report generation architectures with longitudinally tailored designs, and evaluation protocols including longitudinal-specific measures and standard benchmarks.

Result: Analysis shows that longitudinal information and architectural design choices play critical roles in improving model performance. The survey summarizes LRRG methods' performance and ablation studies.

Conclusion: The paper identifies five major limitations in current research and outlines promising future directions to advance longitudinal radiology report generation as an emerging field.

Abstract: Chest Xray imaging is a widely used diagnostic tool in modern medicine, and
its high utilization creates substantial workloads for radiologists. To
alleviate this burden, vision language models are increasingly applied to
automate Chest Xray radiology report generation (CXRRRG), aiming for clinically
accurate descriptions while reducing manual effort. Conventional approaches,
however, typically rely on single images, failing to capture the longitudinal
context necessary for producing clinically faithful comparison statements.
Recently, growing attention has been directed toward incorporating longitudinal
data into CXR RRG, enabling models to leverage historical studies in ways that
mirror radiologists diagnostic workflows. Nevertheless, existing surveys
primarily address single image CXRRRG and offer limited guidance for
longitudinal settings, leaving researchers without a systematic framework for
model design. To address this gap, this survey provides the first comprehensive
review of longitudinal radiology report generation (LRRG). Specifically, we
examine dataset construction strategies, report generation architectures
alongside longitudinally tailored designs, and evaluation protocols
encompassing both longitudinal specific measures and widely used benchmarks. We
further summarize LRRG methods performance, alongside analyses of different
ablation studies, which collectively highlight the critical role of
longitudinal information and architectural design choices in improving model
performance. Finally, we summarize five major limitations of current research
and outline promising directions for future development, aiming to lay a
foundation for advancing this emerging field.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MS-GAGA is a two-stage framework for creating transferable and imperceptible adversarial examples against deepfake detectors in black-box settings, achieving up to 27% higher attack success rates than state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop effective adversarial attacks against deepfake detectors that work across different models (transferable) while remaining visually imperceptible, particularly in black-box scenarios where the target model is unknown.

Method: Two-stage framework: Stage 1 uses dual-stream attack (MNTD-PGD for enhanced gradient calculations with small perturbations, and SG-PGD for focusing on salient regions). Stage 2 employs metric-aware selection to evaluate candidates based on attack success and structural similarity (SSIM).

Result: MS-GAGA achieves up to 27% higher misclassification rates on unseen deepfake detectors compared to state-of-the-art adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: The proposed MS-GAGA framework effectively balances transferability and imperceptibility in adversarial attacks against deepfake detectors, demonstrating superior performance in black-box settings through its dual-stream generation and metric-aware selection approach.

Abstract: We present MS-GAGA (Metric-Selective Guided Adversarial Generation Attack), a
two-stage framework for crafting transferable and visually imperceptible
adversarial examples against deepfake detectors in black-box settings. In Stage
1, a dual-stream attack module generates adversarial candidates: MNTD-PGD
applies enhanced gradient calculations optimized for small perturbation
budgets, while SG-PGD focuses perturbations on visually salient regions. This
complementary design expands the adversarial search space and improves
transferability across unseen models. In Stage 2, a metric-aware selection
module evaluates candidates based on both their success against black-box
models and their structural similarity (SSIM) to the original image. By jointly
optimizing transferability and imperceptibility, MS-GAGA achieves up to 27%
higher misclassification rates on unseen detectors compared to state-of-the-art
attacks.

Motivation: Common data augmentations disrupt spatial alignment between images and text in multimodal learning for medical image segmentation, weakening performance.

Method: Proposes early fusion framework combining text and visual features before augmentation, with lightweight generator projecting text embeddings into visual space to bridge semantic gaps.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art results on three medical imaging tasks and four segmentation frameworks, with visualization showing accurate region localization.

Conclusion: Early fusion approach effectively preserves spatial consistency in text-guided medical image segmentation and outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: Deep learning relies heavily on data augmentation to mitigate limited data,
especially in medical imaging. Recent multimodal learning integrates text and
images for segmentation, known as referring or text-guided image segmentation.
However, common augmentations like rotation and flipping disrupt spatial
alignment between image and text, weakening performance. To address this, we
propose an early fusion framework that combines text and visual features before
augmentation, preserving spatial consistency. We also design a lightweight
generator that projects text embeddings into visual space, bridging semantic
gaps. Visualization of generated pseudo-images shows accurate region
localization. Our method is evaluated on three medical imaging tasks and four
segmentation frameworks, achieving state-of-the-art results. Code is publicly

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Bi-Stage 3D Gaussian Splatting (BSGS) is a novel framework that reconstructs high-quality 3D scenes from motion-blurred images through a two-stage optimization process with subframe gradient aggregation and space-time bi-stage optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGS-based deblurring methods have limitations including extreme dependence on camera pose accuracy and inability to control erroneous Gaussian primitive densification caused by motion blur.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Camera Pose Refinement to reduce motion-induced distortions, 2) Global Rigid Transformation to correct blur distortions. Uses subframe gradient aggregation to alleviate gradient conflicts and space-time bi-stage optimization to adjust primitive densification thresholds.

Result: Comprehensive experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed deblurring method and show superiority over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: BSGS successfully addresses the challenges of 3D scene reconstruction from motion-blurred images through its bi-stage optimization approach and specialized strategies for handling motion blur distortions.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has exhibited remarkable capabilities in 3D scene
reconstruction.However, reconstructing high-quality 3D scenes from
motion-blurred images caused by camera motion poses a significant challenge.The
performance of existing 3DGS-based deblurring methods are limited due to their
inherent mechanisms, such as extreme dependence on the accuracy of camera poses
and inability to effectively control erroneous Gaussian primitives
densification caused by motion blur.To solve these problems, we introduce a
novel framework, Bi-Stage 3D Gaussian Splatting, to accurately reconstruct 3D
scenes from motion-blurred images.BSGS contains two stages. First, Camera Pose
Refinement roughly optimizes camera poses to reduce motion-induced distortions.
Second, with fixed rough camera poses, Global RigidTransformation further
corrects motion-induced blur distortions.To alleviate multi-subframe gradient
conflicts, we propose a subframe gradient aggregation strategy to optimize both
stages.Furthermore, a space-time bi-stage optimization strategy is introduced
to dynamically adjust primitive densification thresholds and prevent premature
noisy Gaussian generation in blurred regions. Comprehensive experiments verify
the effectiveness of our proposed deblurring method and show its superiority
over the state of the arts.

TL;DR: VAD is a lightweight, network-free method that computes Unsigned Distance Fields from unoriented point clouds using Voronoi-based geometric criteria and diffusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural approaches for learning UDFs suffer from numerical instability, high computational cost, and limited controllability.

Method: Assigns bi-directional normals using Voronoi-based geometric criteria, diffuses aligned normals to form approximate UDF gradient field, then integrates to recover final UDF.

Result: VAD robustly handles watertight and open surfaces, complex non-manifold and non-orientable geometries while remaining computationally efficient and stable.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a stable and efficient alternative to neural approaches for UDF computation from point clouds.

Abstract: Unsigned Distance Fields (UDFs) provide a flexible representation for 3D
shapes with arbitrary topology, including open and closed surfaces, orientable
and non-orientable geometries, and non-manifold structures. While recent neural
approaches have shown promise in learning UDFs, they often suffer from
numerical instability, high computational cost, and limited controllability. We
present a lightweight, network-free method, Voronoi-Assisted Diffusion (VAD),
for computing UDFs directly from unoriented point clouds. Our approach begins
by assigning bi-directional normals to input points, guided by two
Voronoi-based geometric criteria encoded in an energy function for optimal
alignment. The aligned normals are then diffused to form an approximate UDF
gradient field, which is subsequently integrated to recover the final UDF.
Experiments demonstrate that VAD robustly handles watertight and open surfaces,
as well as complex non-manifold and non-orientable geometries, while remaining
computationally efficient and stable.

TL;DR: A score-based diffusion model achieves state-of-the-art human motion generation using only careful feature normalization and analytically derived loss weightings, avoiding complex input features and auxiliary losses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on over-parameterized features and auxiliary losses, which should not be necessary for diffusion models to match human motion distribution effectively.

Method: Score-based diffusion model with feature-space normalization and analytically derived weightings for standard L2 score-matching loss, generating both motion and shape directly.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results in unconditional human motion generation without complex preprocessing or post hoc shape recovery.

Conclusion: Careful normalization and theoretical loss weightings are sufficient for diffusion models to match human motion distribution effectively, eliminating need for complex auxiliary components.

Abstract: Recent work has explored a range of model families for human motion
generation, including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs), and diffusion-based models. Despite their differences, many
methods rely on over-parameterized input features and auxiliary losses to
improve empirical results. These strategies should not be strictly necessary
for diffusion models to match the human motion distribution. We show that on
par with state-of-the-art results in unconditional human motion generation are
achievable with a score-based diffusion model using only careful feature-space
normalization and analytically derived weightings for the standard L2
score-matching loss, while generating both motion and shape directly, thereby
avoiding slow post hoc shape recovery from joints. We build the method step by
step, with a clear theoretical motivation for each component, and provide
targeted ablations demonstrating the effectiveness of each proposed addition in
isolation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End-to-end autonomous driving models trained with imitation learning suffer from poor generalization, while reinforcement learning faces sample inefficiency and unstable convergence. Combining both approaches can leverage their strengths.

Method: Proposes CoIRL-AD, a competitive dual-policy framework where IL and RL agents interact during training through a competition-based mechanism that facilitates knowledge exchange while preventing gradient conflicts.

Result: Experiments on nuScenes dataset show 18% reduction in collision rate compared to baselines, along with stronger generalization and improved performance on long-tail scenarios.

Conclusion: CoIRL-AD effectively combines IL and RL through competitive interaction, outperforming conventional two-stage approaches and demonstrating superior performance in autonomous driving tasks.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving models trained solely with imitation learning
(IL) often suffer from poor generalization. In contrast, reinforcement learning
(RL) promotes exploration through reward maximization but faces challenges such
as sample inefficiency and unstable convergence. A natural solution is to
combine IL and RL. Moving beyond the conventional two-stage paradigm (IL
pretraining followed by RL fine-tuning), we propose CoIRL-AD, a competitive
dual-policy framework that enables IL and RL agents to interact during
training. CoIRL-AD introduces a competition-based mechanism that facilitates
knowledge exchange while preventing gradient conflicts. Experiments on the
nuScenes dataset show an 18% reduction in collision rate compared to baselines,

TL;DR: MMOT is the first comprehensive benchmark for drone-based multispectral multi-object tracking, featuring 125 video sequences with 488.8K annotations across 8 categories, addressing challenges like small targets and occlusions through spectral features and oriented annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RGB-based tracking algorithms struggle with aerial views due to degraded spatial appearance cues like color and texture. Multispectral imagery provides crucial spectral reflectance cues that enhance object discriminability, but the lack of dedicated multispectral UAV datasets has hindered progress in this domain.

Method: Proposed a multispectral and orientation-aware MOT scheme with: (1) lightweight Spectral 3D-Stem for spectral feature integration while maintaining RGB pretraining compatibility, (2) orientation-aware Kalman filter for precise state estimation, and (3) end-to-end orientation-adaptive transformer.

Result: Extensive experiments show multispectral input significantly improves tracking performance over RGB baselines, especially for small and densely packed objects, demonstrating the effectiveness of spectral features in challenging aerial scenarios.

Conclusion: The MMOT benchmark and proposed methods advance drone-based multispectral multi-object tracking research by leveraging spectral features and oriented annotations to overcome limitations of RGB-only approaches in aerial views.

Abstract: Drone-based multi-object tracking is essential yet highly challenging due to
small targets, severe occlusions, and cluttered backgrounds. Existing RGB-based
tracking algorithms heavily depend on spatial appearance cues such as color and
texture, which often degrade in aerial views, compromising reliability.
Multispectral imagery, capturing pixel-level spectral reflectance, provides
crucial cues that enhance object discriminability under degraded spatial
conditions. However, the lack of dedicated multispectral UAV datasets has
hindered progress in this domain. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMOT, the
first challenging benchmark for drone-based multispectral multi-object
tracking. It features three key characteristics: (i) Large Scale - 125 video
sequences with over 488.8K annotations across eight categories; (ii)
Comprehensive Challenges - covering diverse conditions such as extreme small
targets, high-density scenarios, severe occlusions, and complex motion; and
(iii) Precise Oriented Annotations - enabling accurate localization and reduced
ambiguity under aerial perspectives. To better extract spectral features and
leverage oriented annotations, we further present a multispectral and
orientation-aware MOT scheme adapting existing methods, featuring: (i) a
lightweight Spectral 3D-Stem integrating spectral features while preserving
compatibility with RGB pretraining; (ii) an orientation-aware Kalman filter for
precise state estimation; and (iii) an end-to-end orientation-adaptive
transformer. Extensive experiments across representative trackers consistently
show that multispectral input markedly improves tracking performance over RGB
baselines, particularly for small and densely packed objects. We believe our
work will advance drone-based multispectral multi-object tracking research. Our
MMOT, code, and benchmarks are publicly available at

TL;DR: Temporally Conditional Mamba (TCM) is a new mamba-based model that improves temporal alignment in human motion generation by integrating conditional information into recurrent dynamics, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods using cross-attention struggle with step-by-step temporal alignment when generating human motion based on time-dependent input signals, limiting their effectiveness in maintaining consistent temporal patterns.

Method: Introduces Temporally Conditional Mamba, which integrates conditional information directly into the recurrent dynamics of Mamba blocks, enabling better temporal alignment compared to cross-attention mechanisms.

Result: Extensive experiments show significant improvements in temporal alignment, motion realism, and condition consistency over state-of-the-art approaches across various human motion tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed TCM model effectively addresses temporal alignment limitations in human motion generation by leveraging mamba-based recurrent dynamics, demonstrating superior performance over existing cross-attention based methods.

Abstract: Learning human motion based on a time-dependent input signal presents a
challenging yet impactful task with various applications. The goal of this task
is to generate or estimate human movement that consistently reflects the
temporal patterns of conditioning inputs. Existing methods typically rely on
cross-attention mechanisms to fuse the condition with motion. However, this
approach primarily captures global interactions and struggles to maintain
step-by-step temporal alignment. To address this limitation, we introduce
Temporally Conditional Mamba, a new mamba-based model for human motion
generation. Our approach integrates conditional information into the recurrent
dynamics of the Mamba block, enabling better temporally aligned motion. To
validate the effectiveness of our method, we evaluate it on a variety of human
motion tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model significantly
improves temporal alignment, motion realism, and condition consistency over
state-of-the-art approaches. Our project page is available at

TL;DR: Zero-shot agricultural segmentation using Plantnet and SAM without new annotations, achieving better IoU with Plantnet-fine-tuned DinoV2 than base DinoV2.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the annotation bottleneck and limitations of supervised methods in agricultural imagery segmentation, especially with limited training data and complex field conditions.

Method: Leverages Plantnet's plant representations to identify plant regions and generate coarse masks, then refines them using Segment Anything Model (SAM) for detailed segmentation.

Result: Consistent performance gains across four datasets with various complexity, showing higher Jaccard Index (IoU) when using Plantnet-fine-tuned DinoV2 compared to base DinoV2.

Conclusion: Combining foundation models with specialized plant-centric models effectively alleviates annotation requirements and enables robust segmentation in diverse agricultural scenarios.

Abstract: We present a zero-shot segmentation approach for agricultural imagery that
leverages Plantnet, a large-scale plant classification model, in conjunction
with its DinoV2 backbone and the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Rather than
collecting and annotating new datasets, our method exploits Plantnet's
specialized plant representations to identify plant regions and produce coarse
segmentation masks. These masks are then refined by SAM to yield detailed
segmentations. We evaluate on four publicly available datasets of various
complexity in terms of contrast including some where the limited size of the
training data and complex field conditions often hinder purely supervised
methods. Our results show consistent performance gains when using
Plantnet-fine-tuned DinoV2 over the base DinoV2 model, as measured by the
Jaccard Index (IoU). These findings highlight the potential of combining
foundation models with specialized plant-centric models to alleviate the
annotation bottleneck and enable effective segmentation in diverse agricultural
scenarios.

*Yasaman Haghighi,Bastien van Delft,Mariam Hassan,Alexandre Alahi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LayerSync is a domain-agnostic approach that improves diffusion model training efficiency and generation quality by using the model's own intermediate representations as intrinsic guidance, eliminating the need for external supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior research showed that external guidance on intermediate representations accelerates diffusion model training, but this requires additional resources. The authors aim to create a self-sufficient method that leverages the model's own representations without external dependencies.

Method: LayerSync regularizes diffusion models by using their own semantically rich intermediate representations to guide weaker ones. It's a plug-and-play regularizer that works across different layers and requires no pretrained models or additional data.

Result: LayerSync significantly improves training efficiency and generation quality across multiple domains. It achieved 8.75x faster training for flow-based transformers on ImageNet and improved generation quality by 23.6%. The method also showed effectiveness in audio, video, and motion generation.

Conclusion: LayerSync provides an effective, domain-agnostic approach for improving diffusion models that is self-sufficient, requires no external resources, and generalizes well across different modalities while consistently enhancing both training efficiency and output quality.

Abstract: We propose LayerSync, a domain-agnostic approach for improving the generation
quality and the training efficiency of diffusion models. Prior studies have
highlighted the connection between the quality of generation and the
representations learned by diffusion models, showing that external guidance on
model intermediate representations accelerates training. We reconceptualize
this paradigm by regularizing diffusion models with their own intermediate
representations. Building on the observation that representation quality varies
across diffusion model layers, we show that the most semantically rich
representations can act as an intrinsic guidance for weaker ones, reducing the
need for external supervision. Our approach, LayerSync, is a self-sufficient,
plug-and-play regularizer term with no overhead on diffusion model training and
generalizes beyond the visual domain to other modalities. LayerSync requires no
pretrained models nor additional data. We extensively evaluate the method on
image generation and demonstrate its applicability to other domains such as
audio, video, and motion generation. We show that it consistently improves the
generation quality and the training efficiency. For example, we speed up the
training of flow-based transformer by over 8.75x on ImageNet dataset and
improved the generation quality by 23.6%. The code is available at

*Jiachen Lei,Keli Liu,Julius Berner,Haiming Yu,Hongkai Zheng,Jiahong Wu,Xiangxiang Chu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel two-stage training framework that closes the performance gap between pixel-space and latent-space generative models for diffusion and consistency models, achieving state-of-the-art results on ImageNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pixel-space generative models are more difficult to train and underperform compared to latent-space models, creating a persistent performance and efficiency gap that needs to be addressed.

Method: Two-stage training: 1) Pre-train encoders to capture semantics from clean images while aligning with deterministic sampling trajectories; 2) Integrate encoder with randomly initialized decoder and fine-tune end-to-end for both diffusion and consistency models.

Result: Diffusion model achieves FID of 2.04 on ImageNet-256 and 2.35 on ImageNet-512 with 75 NFE, surpassing prior pixel-space methods. Consistency model achieves FID of 8.82 on ImageNet-256 in single step, outperforming latent-space counterparts.

Conclusion: The framework successfully closes the performance gap for pixel-space models, enabling high-quality generation without relying on pre-trained VAEs or diffusion models, marking the first successful training of consistency models directly on high-resolution images.

Abstract: Pixel-space generative models are often more difficult to train and generally
underperform compared to their latent-space counterparts, leaving a persistent
performance and efficiency gap. In this paper, we introduce a novel two-stage
training framework that closes this gap for pixel-space diffusion and
consistency models. In the first stage, we pre-train encoders to capture
meaningful semantics from clean images while aligning them with points along
the same deterministic sampling trajectory, which evolves points from the prior
to the data distribution. In the second stage, we integrate the encoder with a
randomly initialized decoder and fine-tune the complete model end-to-end for
both diffusion and consistency models. Our training framework demonstrates
strong empirical performance on ImageNet dataset. Specifically, our diffusion
model reaches an FID of 2.04 on ImageNet-256 and 2.35 on ImageNet-512 with 75
number of function evaluations (NFE), surpassing prior pixel-space methods by a
large margin in both generation quality and efficiency while rivaling leading
VAE-based models at comparable training cost. Furthermore, on ImageNet-256, our
consistency model achieves an impressive FID of 8.82 in a single sampling step,
significantly surpassing its latent-space counterpart. To the best of our
knowledge, this marks the first successful training of a consistency model
directly on high-resolution images without relying on pre-trained VAEs or
diffusion models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IVT-LR introduces multimodal latent reasoning that combines visual and textual information in latent space to improve MLLM reasoning efficiency and performance without explicit vision-text annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal reasoning methods require labor-intensive vision-text annotations and introduce significant inference latency, limiting their practical application.

Method: Proposes Interleaved Vision-Text Latent Reasoning (IVT-LR) that represents reasoning steps using latent text (hidden states) and latent vision (selected image embeddings), with progressive multi-stage training.

Result: Achieves 5.45% average accuracy improvement on M3CoT and ScienceQA benchmarks while achieving over 5x speed increase compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: IVT-LR provides an efficient and effective multimodal reasoning approach that reduces annotation requirements and inference latency while improving performance.

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning aims to enhance the capabilities of MLLMs by
incorporating intermediate reasoning steps before reaching the final answer. It
has evolved from text-only reasoning to the integration of visual information,
enabling the thought process to be conveyed through both images and text.
Despite its effectiveness, current multimodal reasoning methods depend on
explicit reasoning steps that require labor-intensive vision-text annotations
and inherently introduce significant inference latency. To address these
issues, we introduce multimodal latent reasoning with the advantages of
multimodal representation, reduced annotation, and inference efficiency. To
facilicate it, we propose Interleaved Vision-Text Latent Reasoning (IVT-LR),
which injects both visual and textual information in the reasoning process
within the latent space. Specifically, IVT-LR represents each reasoning step by
combining two implicit parts: latent text (the hidden states from the previous
step) and latent vision (a set of selected image embeddings). We further
introduce a progressive multi-stage training strategy to enable MLLMs to
perform the above multimodal latent reasoning steps. Experiments on M3CoT and
ScienceQA demonstrate that our IVT-LR method achieves an average performance
increase of 5.45% in accuracy, while simultaneously achieving a speed increase
of over 5 times compared to existing approaches. Code available at

TL;DR: WaterFlow is a rectified flow-based framework for underwater salient object detection that incorporates underwater physical imaging priors and temporal modeling, achieving state-of-the-art performance on USOD10K dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing USOD methods ignore underwater imaging physics or treat degradation as interference, failing to exploit valuable information in underwater images.

Method: Proposes WaterFlow framework using rectified flow that explicitly incorporates underwater physical imaging priors into network training and introduces temporal dimension modeling.

Result: Achieves 0.072 gain in S_m metric on USOD10K dataset, demonstrating superior performance.

Conclusion: WaterFlow effectively leverages underwater physical priors and temporal modeling to significantly enhance salient object detection in challenging underwater environments.

Abstract: Underwater Salient Object Detection (USOD) faces significant challenges,
including underwater image quality degradation and domain gaps. Existing
methods tend to ignore the physical principles of underwater imaging or simply
treat degradation phenomena in underwater images as interference factors that
must be eliminated, failing to fully exploit the valuable information they
contain. We propose WaterFlow, a rectified flow-based framework for underwater
salient object detection that innovatively incorporates underwater physical
imaging information as explicit priors directly into the network training
process and introduces temporal dimension modeling, significantly enhancing the
model's capability for salient object identification. On the USOD10K dataset,
WaterFlow achieves a 0.072 gain in S_m, demonstrating the effectiveness and
superiority of our method. The code will be published after the acceptance.

*Yanlin Jiang,Yuchen Liu,Mingren Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes ZSCFC, an efficient zero-shot denoiser that uses cross-frequency consistency to denoise single images without noise distribution assumptions, outperforming existing methods in speed and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot denoisers have long training times and rely on unrealistic noise assumptions (independence and zero-mean), limiting their effectiveness for real-world denoising where noise is more complex.

Method: Uses cross-frequency consistency loss based on the observation that image textures show position similarity and content consistency across frequency bands while noise does not. Implements an ultralight network for efficient training and denoising with single noisy images.

Result: Experiments on various real-world datasets show ZSCFC outperforms state-of-the-art zero-shot methods in both computational efficiency and denoising performance.

Conclusion: ZSCFC provides an effective and efficient solution for real-world denoising that works with single noisy images and doesn't require assumptions about noise distribution.

Abstract: Zero-shot denoisers address the dataset dependency of deep-learning-based
denoisers, enabling the denoising of unseen single images. Nonetheless,
existing zero-shot methods suffer from long training times and rely on the
assumption of noise independence and a zero-mean property, limiting their
effectiveness in real-world denoising scenarios where noise characteristics are
more complicated. This paper proposes an efficient and effective method for
real-world denoising, the Zero-Shot denoiser based on Cross-Frequency
Consistency (ZSCFC), which enables training and denoising with a single noisy
image and does not rely on assumptions about noise distribution. Specifically,
image textures exhibit position similarity and content consistency across
different frequency bands, while noise does not. Based on this property, we
developed cross-frequency consistency loss and an ultralight network to realize
image denoising. Experiments on various real-world image datasets demonstrate
that our ZSCFC outperforms other state-of-the-art zero-shot methods in terms of
computational efficiency and denoising performance.

*Shuhei Tarashima,Yushan Wang,Norio Tagawa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper develops efficient human mesh recovery and pose estimation models by using early stages of hierarchical vision foundation models as encoders, achieving comparable performance to full models with better computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create simple and efficient models for human mesh recovery and pose estimation, addressing the computational inefficiency of current state-of-the-art methods that use large non-hierarchical vision transformers.

Method: Proposes using only the first two or three stages of hierarchical vision foundation models (Swin Transformer, GroupMixFormer, VMamba) as encoders, motivated by the observation that intermediate stages produce feature maps with comparable resolutions to non-hierarchical counterparts.

Result: Comprehensive evaluation of 27 hierarchical-VFM-based models shows that truncated models achieve performance on par with full-stage models while exhibiting better accuracy-computation trade-offs than existing lightweight alternatives.

Conclusion: Using early stages of hierarchical vision foundation models provides an effective approach for building efficient human mesh recovery and pose estimation models with superior computational efficiency without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: In this work, we aim to develop simple and efficient models for human mesh
recovery (HMR) and its predecessor task, human pose estimation (HPE).
State-of-the-art HMR methods, such as HMR2.0 and its successors, rely on large,
non-hierarchical vision transformers as encoders, which are inherited from the
corresponding HPE models like ViTPose. To establish baselines across varying
computational budgets, we first construct three lightweight HMR2.0 variants by
adapting the corresponding ViTPose models. In addition, we propose leveraging
the early stages of hierarchical vision foundation models (VFMs), including
Swin Transformer, GroupMixFormer, and VMamba, as encoders. This design is
motivated by the observation that intermediate stages of hierarchical VFMs
produce feature maps with resolutions comparable to or higher than those of
non-hierarchical counterparts. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 27
hierarchical-VFM-based HMR and HPE models, demonstrating that using only the
first two or three stages achieves performance on par with full-stage models.
Moreover, we show that the resulting truncated models exhibit better trade-offs
between accuracy and computational efficiency compared to existing lightweight
alternatives.

TL;DR: TerraCodec (TEC) is a family of learned compression algorithms for Earth observation data that outperforms classical codecs by 3-10x, with temporal models enabling zero-shot cloud inpainting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Earth observation satellites generate massive multispectral image time series that pose storage and transmission challenges. Current compression methods are fragmented, lack public models, and fail to effectively capture temporal redundancy in largely static scenes.

Method: TEC includes image-based variants for multispectral inputs and TEC-TT (Temporal Transformer) that leverages temporal dependencies. Introduces Latent Repacking for training flexible-rate transformer models that handle varying rate-distortion settings.

Result: Trained on Sentinel-2 data, TerraCodec achieves 3-10x stronger compression than classical codecs at equivalent quality. TEC-TT enables zero-shot cloud inpainting, surpassing state-of-the-art methods on the AllClear benchmark.

Conclusion: Bespoke learned compression algorithms are a promising direction for Earth observation, with TEC establishing new capabilities beyond compression including cloud inpainting.

Abstract: Earth observation (EO) satellites produce massive streams of multispectral
image time series, posing pressing challenges for storage and transmission.
Yet, learned EO compression remains fragmented, lacking publicly available
pretrained models and misaligned with advances in compression for natural
imagery. Image codecs overlook temporal redundancy, while video codecs rely on
motion priors that fail to capture the radiometric evolution of largely static
scenes. We introduce TerraCodec (TEC), a family of learned codecs tailored to
EO. TEC includes efficient image-based variants adapted to multispectral
inputs, as well as a Temporal Transformer model (TEC-TT) that leverages
dependencies across time. To overcome the fixed-rate setting of today's neural
codecs, we present Latent Repacking, a novel method for training flexible-rate
transformer models that operate on varying rate-distortion settings. Trained on
Sentinel-2 data, TerraCodec outperforms classical codecs, achieving 3-10x
stronger compression at equivalent image quality. Beyond compression, TEC-TT
enables zero-shot cloud inpainting, surpassing state-of-the-art methods on the
AllClear benchmark. Our results establish bespoke, learned compression
algorithms as a promising direction for Earth observation. Code and model
weights will be released under a permissive license.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a multi-UAV collaborative occupancy prediction framework that preserves 3D spatial structures and semantics, addressing limitations of BEV-based approaches while reducing communication overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current BEV-based approaches for UAV swarm systems have limitations: bounding-box representations fail to capture complete semantic/geometric information, and performance degrades with undefined/occluded objects.

Method: Uses Spatial-Aware Feature Encoder and Cross-Agent Feature Integration to preserve 3D structures. Includes Altitude-Aware Feature Reduction for efficiency and Dual-Mask Perceptual Guidance to reduce communication overhead.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, significantly outperforms existing collaborative methods, and reduces communication overhead to only a fraction of previous approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses BEV limitations for UAV collaborative perception while maintaining high accuracy and low communication costs.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarm systems necessitate efficient
collaborative perception mechanisms for diverse operational scenarios. Current
Bird's Eye View (BEV)-based approaches exhibit two main limitations:
bounding-box representations fail to capture complete semantic and geometric
information of the scene, and their performance significantly degrades when
encountering undefined or occluded objects. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel multi-UAV collaborative occupancy prediction framework. Our
framework effectively preserves 3D spatial structures and semantics through
integrating a Spatial-Aware Feature Encoder and Cross-Agent Feature
Integration. To enhance efficiency, we further introduce Altitude-Aware Feature
Reduction to compactly represent scene information, along with a Dual-Mask
Perceptual Guidance mechanism to adaptively select features and reduce
communication overhead. Due to the absence of suitable benchmark datasets, we
extend three datasets for evaluation: two virtual datasets (Air-to-Pred-Occ and
UAV3D-Occ) and one real-world dataset (GauUScene-Occ). Experiments results
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, significantly
outperforming existing collaborative methods while reducing communication
overhead to only a fraction of previous approaches.

TL;DR: EReLiFM is a meta-learning method for Open-Set Domain Generalization with Noisy Labels that uses evidential reliability-aware clustering and residual flow matching to handle domain gaps and label noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Label noise corrupts source-domain knowledge in Open-Set Domain Generalization, making it harder to recognize known classes and reject unseen ones. Existing methods struggle with domain gaps when clean labeled data is limited.

Method: Proposes Evidential Reliability-Aware Residual Flow Meta-Learning (EReLiFM) with: 1) unsupervised two-stage evidential loss clustering for label reliability awareness, 2) residual flow matching that models domain- and category-conditioned residuals for diverse transfer paths, and 3) meta-learning optimization where clean set updates maximize loss decrease on noisy set using pseudo labels.

Result: EReLiFM outperforms existing methods on Open-Set Domain Generalization with Noisy Labels (OSDG-NL), achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses the challenges of domain gaps and label noise in open-set domain generalization through evidential reliability awareness and residual flow matching.

Abstract: Open-Set Domain Generalization (OSDG) aims to enable deep learning models to
recognize unseen categories in new domains, which is crucial for real-world
applications. Label noise hinders open-set domain generalization by corrupting
source-domain knowledge, making it harder to recognize known classes and reject
unseen ones. While existing methods address OSDG under Noisy Labels (OSDG-NL)
using hyperbolic prototype-guided meta-learning, they struggle to bridge domain
gaps, especially with limited clean labeled data. In this paper, we propose
Evidential Reliability-Aware Residual Flow Meta-Learning (EReLiFM). We first
introduce an unsupervised two-stage evidential loss clustering method to
promote label reliability awareness. Then, we propose a residual flow matching
mechanism that models structured domain- and category-conditioned residuals,
enabling diverse and uncertainty-aware transfer paths beyond
interpolation-based augmentation. During this meta-learning process, the model
is optimized such that the update direction on the clean set maximizes the loss
decrease on the noisy set, using pseudo labels derived from the most confident
predicted class for supervision. Experimental results show that EReLiFM
outperforms existing methods on OSDG-NL, achieving state-of-the-art
performance. The source code is available at

TL;DR: Proposes H-EGL framework combining self-supervised and human-guided constraints to improve attention alignment and generalization in medical imaging transformers, outperforming existing EGL methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer models in medical imaging suffer from spurious correlations and biases, while human-AI attention alignment requires costly manual supervision.

Method: Hybrid Explanation-Guided Learning (H-EGL) framework with self-supervised component using class-distinctive attention without restrictive priors.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art EGL methods on chest X-ray classification with ViT, achieving superior accuracy, generalization, and better human-aligned attention maps.

Conclusion: H-EGL effectively enhances attention alignment and generalization in medical imaging transformers without relying on costly manual supervision.

Abstract: Transformer-based deep learning models have demonstrated exceptional
performance in medical imaging by leveraging attention mechanisms for feature
representation and interpretability. However, these models are prone to
learning spurious correlations, leading to biases and limited generalization.
While human-AI attention alignment can mitigate these issues, it often depends
on costly manual supervision. In this work, we propose a Hybrid
Explanation-Guided Learning (H-EGL) framework that combines self-supervised and
human-guided constraints to enhance attention alignment and improve
generalization. The self-supervised component of H-EGL leverages
class-distinctive attention without relying on restrictive priors, promoting
robustness and flexibility. We validate our approach on chest X-ray
classification using the Vision Transformer (ViT), where H-EGL outperforms two
state-of-the-art Explanation-Guided Learning (EGL) methods, demonstrating
superior classification accuracy and generalization capability. Additionally,
it produces attention maps that are better aligned with human expertise.

TL;DR: IRIS is a benchmark for evaluating MLLMs' ability to actively manipulate and reason with images, moving beyond static visual perception to dynamic cognitive processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs treat images as passive inputs rather than manipulable cognitive workspaces, limiting their ability to solve complex visual-textual tasks requiring active image transformations.

Method: Created IRIS benchmark with 1,204 challenging vision tasks (603 single-turn, 601 multi-turn) across five domains, with detailed rubrics for systematic evaluation of MLLMs' image manipulation and reasoning capabilities.

Result: Current MLLMs struggle significantly, with even the strongest model (GPT-5-think) achieving only 18.68% pass rate. Models show divergent tool-use behaviors - OpenAI models benefit from diverse image manipulations while Gemini-2.5-pro shows no improvement.

Conclusion: IRIS provides the first benchmark for 'think with images' paradigm, revealing critical limitations in current MLLMs and offering insights for advancing visual intelligence through active image manipulation and tool integration.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly applied in
real-world scenarios where user-provided images are often imperfect, requiring
active image manipulations such as cropping, editing, or enhancement to uncover
salient visual cues. Beyond static visual perception, MLLMs must also think
with images: dynamically transforming visual content and integrating it with
other tools to solve complex tasks. However, this shift from treating vision as
passive context to a manipulable cognitive workspace remains underexplored.
Most existing benchmarks still follow a think about images paradigm, where
images are regarded as static inputs. To address this gap, we introduce IRIS,
an Interactive Reasoning with Images and Systems that evaluates MLLMs' ability
to perceive, transform, and reason across complex visual-textual tasks under
the think with images paradigm. IRIS comprises 1,204 challenging, open-ended
vision tasks (603 single-turn, 601 multi-turn) spanning across five diverse
domains, each paired with detailed rubrics to enable systematic evaluation. Our
evaluation shows that current MLLMs struggle with tasks requiring effective
integration of vision and general-purpose tools. Even the strongest model
(GPT-5-think) reaches only 18.68% pass rate. We further observe divergent
tool-use behaviors, with OpenAI models benefiting from diverse image
manipulations while Gemini-2.5-pro shows no improvement. By introducing the
first benchmark centered on think with images, IRIS offers critical insights
for advancing visual intelligence in MLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A personalized federated learning method using orthogonal LoRA adapters to separate general and client-specific knowledge for medical foundation model fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models need fine-tuning for healthcare tasks but face data scarcity due to privacy restrictions. Federated learning can help but requires methods that effectively leverage both local and global knowledge.

Method: Proposes personalized federated fine-tuning using orthogonal LoRA adapters to disentangle general knowledge (shared across clients) and client-specific knowledge, allowing each client to benefit from both their own data and others' data.

Result: Preliminary results on real-world federated medical imaging tasks show the approach is competitive against current federated fine-tuning methods.

Conclusion: The method enables effective fine-tuning of foundation models in federated healthcare settings while addressing data privacy and scarcity challenges.

Abstract: Foundation models open up new possibilities for the use of AI in healthcare.
However, even when pre-trained on health data, they still need to be fine-tuned
for specific downstream tasks. Furthermore, although foundation models reduce
the amount of training data required to achieve good performance, obtaining
sufficient data is still a challenge. This is due, in part, to restrictions on
sharing and aggregating data from different sources to protect patients'
privacy. One possible solution to this is to fine-tune foundation models via
federated learning across multiple participating clients (i.e., hospitals,
clinics, etc.). In this work, we propose a new personalized federated
fine-tuning method that learns orthogonal LoRA adapters to disentangle general
and client-specific knowledge, enabling each client to fully exploit both their
own data and the data of others. Our preliminary results on real-world
federated medical imaging tasks demonstrate that our approach is competitive
against current federated fine-tuning methods.

Method: Three complementary innovations: (1) train-friendly three-stage distillation pipeline for streaming super-resolution, (2) locality-constrained sparse attention to reduce redundant computation and bridge train-test resolution gap, (3) tiny conditional decoder for accelerated reconstruction without quality loss. Also created VSR-120K dataset with 120k videos and 180k images.

Conclusion: FlashVSR makes diffusion-based video super-resolution practical by achieving efficiency, scalability, and real-time performance, enabling real-time VSR applications.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently advanced video restoration, but applying them
to real-world video super-resolution (VSR) remains challenging due to high
latency, prohibitive computation, and poor generalization to ultra-high
resolutions. Our goal in this work is to make diffusion-based VSR practical by
achieving efficiency, scalability, and real-time performance. To this end, we
propose FlashVSR, the first diffusion-based one-step streaming framework
towards real-time VSR. FlashVSR runs at approximately 17 FPS for 768x1408
videos on a single A100 GPU by combining three complementary innovations: (i) a
train-friendly three-stage distillation pipeline that enables streaming
super-resolution, (ii) locality-constrained sparse attention that cuts
redundant computation while bridging the train-test resolution gap, and (iii) a
tiny conditional decoder that accelerates reconstruction without sacrificing
quality. To support large-scale training, we also construct VSR-120K, a new
dataset with 120k videos and 180k images. Extensive experiments show that
FlashVSR scales reliably to ultra-high resolutions and achieves
state-of-the-art performance with up to 12x speedup over prior one-step
diffusion VSR models. We will release the code, pretrained models, and dataset
to foster future research in efficient diffusion-based VSR.

### [72] [SPORTS: Simultaneous Panoptic Odometry, Rendering, Tracking and Segmentation for Urban Scenes Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12749)
*Zhiliu Yang,Jinyu Dai,Jianyuan Zhang,Zhu Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPORTS integrates Video Panoptic Segmentation, Visual Odometry, and Scene Rendering into a unified framework for holistic scene understanding, addressing segmentation deficiencies, dynamic object interference, and view limitations through attention-based feature fusion and iterative optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing scene perception solutions suffer from segmentation deficiencies, dynamic object interference, sensor data sparsity, and view limitations, which hinder embodied-AI agents' ability to understand and simulate environments effectively.

Method: The framework integrates three tasks: VPS uses adaptive attention-based geometric fusion with pose, depth, and optical flow alignment; VO combines panoptic segmentation with optical flow for better dynamic object confidence; SR transforms sparse point clouds into neural fields for high-fidelity rendering.

Result: Extensive experiments on three public datasets show superior performance on odometry, tracking, segmentation, and novel view synthesis tasks compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SPORTS demonstrates that tightly integrating VPS, VO, and SR through attention-based feature fusion and iterative optimization enables comprehensive scene understanding and high-fidelity simulation capabilities.

Abstract: The scene perception, understanding, and simulation are fundamental
techniques for embodied-AI agents, while existing solutions are still prone to
segmentation deficiency, dynamic objects' interference, sensor data sparsity,
and view-limitation problems. This paper proposes a novel framework, named
SPORTS, for holistic scene understanding via tightly integrating Video Panoptic
Segmentation (VPS), Visual Odometry (VO), and Scene Rendering (SR) tasks into
an iterative and unified perspective. Firstly, VPS designs an adaptive
attention-based geometric fusion mechanism to align cross-frame features via
enrolling the pose, depth, and optical flow modality, which automatically
adjust feature maps for different decoding stages. And a post-matching strategy
is integrated to improve identities tracking. In VO, panoptic segmentation
results from VPS are combined with the optical flow map to improve the
confidence estimation of dynamic objects, which enhances the accuracy of the
camera pose estimation and completeness of the depth map generation via the
learning-based paradigm. Furthermore, the point-based rendering of SR is
beneficial from VO, transforming sparse point clouds into neural fields to
synthesize high-fidelity RGB views and twin panoptic views. Extensive
experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our attention-based
feature fusion outperforms most existing state-of-the-art methods on the
odometry, tracking, segmentation, and novel view synthesis tasks.

*A. Alfarano,L. Venturoli,D. Negueruela del Castillo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VQArt-Bench is a new VQA benchmark for cultural heritage that addresses limitations in existing benchmarks by testing deep semantic understanding of visual art through multi-agent generated questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VQA benchmarks fail to evaluate deep semantic understanding in complex domains like visual art analysis, as they use simple syntactic structures and surface-level attributes that allow models to exploit statistical shortcuts rather than engage in visual reasoning.

Method: Used a novel multi-agent pipeline where specialized agents collaborate to generate nuanced, validated, and linguistically diverse questions, structured along relevant visual understanding dimensions to probe symbolic meaning, narratives, and complex visual relationships.

Result: Evaluation of 14 state-of-the-art MLLMs revealed significant limitations, including surprising weakness in simple counting tasks and a clear performance gap between proprietary and open-source models.

Conclusion: The benchmark successfully exposes limitations in current MLLMs' visual reasoning capabilities and highlights the need for more sophisticated evaluation methods in complex visual domains.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
capabilities in joint visual and linguistic tasks. However, existing Visual
Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks often fail to evaluate deep semantic
understanding, particularly in complex domains like visual art analysis.
Confined to simple syntactic structures and surface-level attributes, these
questions fail to capture the diversity and depth of human visual inquiry. This
limitation incentivizes models to exploit statistical shortcuts rather than
engage in visual reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce VQArt-Bench, a
new, large-scale VQA benchmark for the cultural heritage domain. This benchmark
is constructed using a novel multi-agent pipeline where specialized agents
collaborate to generate nuanced, validated, and linguistically diverse
questions. The resulting benchmark is structured along relevant visual
understanding dimensions that probe a model's ability to interpret symbolic
meaning, narratives, and complex visual relationships. Our evaluation of 14
state-of-the-art MLLMs on this benchmark reveals significant limitations in
current models, including a surprising weakness in simple counting tasks and a
clear performance gap between proprietary and open-source models.

*Wenpu Li,Bangyan Liao,Yi Zhou,Qi Xu,Pian Wan,Peidong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: E-MoFlow: An unsupervised framework that jointly optimizes 6-DoF ego-motion and optical flow using implicit spatial-temporal and geometric regularization, achieving state-of-the-art performance without ground truth supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional independent estimation of optical flow and ego-motion is ill-posed for neuromorphic vision due to lack of robust data association. Existing methods either introduce bias through explicit regularization or converge to suboptimal solutions with explicit parametrization.

Method: Models camera ego-motion as continuous spline and optical flow as implicit neural representation, incorporating spatial-temporal coherence through inductive biases and geometric constraints via differential geometry without explicit depth estimation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised methods and competitive results even with supervised approaches, demonstrating versatility across general 6-DoF motion scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework successfully unifies ego-motion and optical flow estimation through implicit regularization under unsupervised paradigm, providing rigorous geometric consistency while avoiding limitations of explicit regularization and parametrization.

Abstract: The estimation of optical flow and 6-DoF ego-motion, two fundamental tasks in
3D vision, has typically been addressed independently. For neuromorphic vision
(e.g., event cameras), however, the lack of robust data association makes
solving the two problems separately an ill-posed challenge, especially in the
absence of supervision via ground truth. Existing works mitigate this
ill-posedness by either enforcing the smoothness of the flow field via an
explicit variational regularizer or leveraging explicit structure-and-motion
priors in the parametrization to improve event alignment. The former notably
introduces bias in results and computational overhead, while the latter, which
parametrizes the optical flow in terms of the scene depth and the camera
motion, often converges to suboptimal local minima. To address these issues, we
propose an unsupervised framework that jointly optimizes egomotion and optical
flow via implicit spatial-temporal and geometric regularization. First, by
modeling camera's egomotion as a continuous spline and optical flow as an
implicit neural representation, our method inherently embeds spatial-temporal
coherence through inductive biases. Second, we incorporate structure-and-motion
priors through differential geometric constraints, bypassing explicit depth
estimation while maintaining rigorous geometric consistency. As a result, our
framework (called E-MoFlow) unifies egomotion and optical flow estimation via
implicit regularization under a fully unsupervised paradigm. Experiments
demonstrate its versatility to general 6-DoF motion scenarios, achieving
state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised methods and competitive even
with supervised approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DL-HMC++ is a deep learning approach for head motion correction in PET imaging that predicts rigid head motion from 1-second 3D PET raw data, outperforming existing methods and achieving results comparable to gold-standard hardware motion tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Head movement in brain PET imaging causes artifacts and quantification inaccuracies, while hardware-based motion tracking has limited clinical applicability. A data-driven solution is needed to make motion correction accessible in real-world clinical practice.

Method: A deep-learning approach with cross-attention (DL-HMC++) trained in supervised manner using dynamic PET scans with gold-standard motion measurements from external hardware motion tracking. Evaluated on two PET scanners and four radiotracers.

Result: DL-HMC++ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art data-driven methods, producing motion-free images with clear brain structure delineation and reduced artifacts indistinguishable from gold-standard HMT. Average difference ratios with HMT were 1.2±0.5% for HRRT and 0.5±0.2% for mCT.

Conclusion: DL-HMC++ demonstrates the potential for data-driven PET head motion correction to eliminate the need for hardware motion tracking, making motion correction accessible to broader clinical populations beyond research settings.

Abstract: Head movement poses a significant challenge in brain positron emission
tomography (PET) imaging, resulting in image artifacts and tracer uptake
quantification inaccuracies. Effective head motion estimation and correction
are crucial for precise quantitative image analysis and accurate diagnosis of
neurological disorders. Hardware-based motion tracking (HMT) has limited
applicability in real-world clinical practice. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a deep-learning head motion correction approach with cross-attention
(DL-HMC++) to predict rigid head motion from one-second 3D PET raw data.
DL-HMC++ is trained in a supervised manner by leveraging existing dynamic PET
scans with gold-standard motion measurements from external HMT. We evaluate
DL-HMC++ on two PET scanners (HRRT and mCT) and four radiotracers (18F-FDG,
18F-FPEB, 11C-UCB-J, and 11C-LSN3172176) to demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalization of the approach in large cohort PET studies. Quantitative and
qualitative results demonstrate that DL-HMC++ consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art data-driven motion estimation methods, producing motion-free
images with clear delineation of brain structures and reduced motion artifacts
that are indistinguishable from gold-standard HMT. Brain region of interest
standard uptake value analysis exhibits average difference ratios between
DL-HMC++ and gold-standard HMT to be 1.2 plus-minus 0.5% for HRRT and 0.5
plus-minus 0.2% for mCT. DL-HMC++ demonstrates the potential for data-driven
PET head motion correction to remove the burden of HMT, making motion
correction accessible to clinical populations beyond research settings. The

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AnyUp is a feature-agnostic upsampling method that works with any vision feature at any resolution without encoder-specific training, outperforming existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning-based upsamplers require retraining for each feature extractor and don't generalize across different feature types at inference time.

Method: Proposes an inference-time feature-agnostic upsampling architecture that doesn't need encoder-specific training.

Result: Sets new state-of-the-art for upsampled features, generalizes to different feature types, preserves feature semantics, and is efficient for downstream tasks.

Conclusion: AnyUp provides a versatile and high-quality upsampling solution that works across various vision features without retraining requirements.

Abstract: We introduce AnyUp, a method for feature upsampling that can be applied to
any vision feature at any resolution, without encoder-specific training.
Existing learning-based upsamplers for features like DINO or CLIP need to be
re-trained for every feature extractor and thus do not generalize to different
feature types at inference time. In this work, we propose an inference-time
feature-agnostic upsampling architecture to alleviate this limitation and
improve upsampling quality. In our experiments, AnyUp sets a new state of the
art for upsampled features, generalizes to different feature types, and
preserves feature semantics while being efficient and easy to apply to a wide
range of downstream tasks.

*Fengzhi Guo,Chih-Chuan Hsu,Sihao Ding,Cheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: USplat4D introduces uncertainty-aware dynamic Gaussian Splatting that models per-Gaussian uncertainty to improve 4D scene reconstruction under occlusion and extreme viewpoints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard dynamic Gaussian Splatting optimizes all primitives uniformly, ignoring observation reliability, leading to motion drifts under occlusion and poor synthesis at unseen views.

Method: Estimates time-varying per-Gaussian uncertainty and constructs spatio-temporal graph for uncertainty-aware optimization, propagating reliable motion cues from well-observed Gaussians.

Result: Consistently improves dynamic Gaussian Splatting models across diverse datasets, achieving more stable geometry under occlusion and high-quality synthesis at extreme viewpoints.

Conclusion: Explicit uncertainty modeling is crucial for dynamic 3D reconstruction, enabling reliable motion guidance and enhanced performance in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular input is fundamentally
under-constrained, with ambiguities arising from occlusion and extreme novel
views. While dynamic Gaussian Splatting offers an efficient representation,
vanilla models optimize all Gaussian primitives uniformly, ignoring whether
they are well or poorly observed. This limitation leads to motion drifts under
occlusion and degraded synthesis when extrapolating to unseen views. We argue
that uncertainty matters: Gaussians with recurring observations across views
and time act as reliable anchors to guide motion, whereas those with limited
visibility are treated as less reliable. To this end, we introduce USplat4D, a
novel Uncertainty-aware dynamic Gaussian Splatting framework that propagates
reliable motion cues to enhance 4D reconstruction. Our key insight is to
estimate time-varying per-Gaussian uncertainty and leverages it to construct a
spatio-temporal graph for uncertainty-aware optimization. Experiments on
diverse real and synthetic datasets show that explicitly modeling uncertainty
consistently improves dynamic Gaussian Splatting models, yielding more stable
geometry under occlusion and high-quality synthesis at extreme viewpoints.

*Stefan Andreas Baumann,Nick Stracke,Timy Phan,Björn Ommer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Flow Poke Transformer (FPT) is a novel framework that predicts multi-modal local motion distributions conditioned on sparse interactions called "pokes", providing interpretable representations of scene dynamics and uncertainties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods only enable dense sampling of single realizations of scene dynamics, lacking the ability to represent multi-modal motion distributions and their dependencies on physical interactions.

Method: FPT uses a transformer-based framework to directly predict distributions of local motion conditioned on sparse "poke" interactions, providing interpretable representations of scene dynamics and uncertainties.

Result: FPT outperforms specialized baselines on dense face motion generation, achieves significant improvements on out-of-distribution articulated object motion estimation, and shows competitive performance on moving part segmentation from pokes.

Conclusion: FPT provides a flexible and versatile approach for predicting multi-modal scene motion distributions, demonstrating strong performance across various downstream tasks and enabling interpretable representations of scene dynamics.

Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of a physical scene involves reasoning about the
diverse ways it can potentially change, especially as a result of local
interactions. We present the Flow Poke Transformer (FPT), a novel framework for
directly predicting the distribution of local motion, conditioned on sparse
interactions termed "pokes". Unlike traditional methods that typically only
enable dense sampling of a single realization of scene dynamics, FPT provides
an interpretable directly accessible representation of multi-modal scene
motion, its dependency on physical interactions and the inherent uncertainties
of scene dynamics. We also evaluate our model on several downstream tasks to
enable comparisons with prior methods and highlight the flexibility of our
approach. On dense face motion generation, our generic pre-trained model
surpasses specialized baselines. FPT can be fine-tuned in strongly
out-of-distribution tasks such as synthetic datasets to enable significant
improvements over in-domain methods in articulated object motion estimation.
Additionally, predicting explicit motion distributions directly enables our
method to achieve competitive performance on tasks like moving part
segmentation from pokes which further demonstrates the versatility of our FPT.

*Weiyang Jin,Yuwei Niu,Jiaqi Liao,Chengqi Duan,Aoxue Li,Shenghua Gao,Xihui Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SRUM is a self-rewarding post-training framework that enables unified multimodal models to use their own understanding module to improve their generation module through a global-local dual reward system, achieving significant performance gains without additional human-labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a significant gap where unified multimodal models' strong visual understanding capabilities fail to transfer to their visual generation capabilities. The paper aims to bridge this gap by enabling models to achieve self-improvement through internal feedback loops.

Method: SRUM creates a feedback loop where the model's understanding module acts as an internal evaluator, providing corrective signals to improve the generation module. It uses a global-local dual reward system: global reward ensures overall visual semantics and layout correctness, while local reward refines fine-grained object-level fidelity.

Result: SRUM significantly boosts performance on benchmarks: T2I-CompBench improved from 82.18 to 88.37, and T2I-ReasonBench improved from 43.82 to 46.75. The framework shows strong generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: The work establishes a new paradigm for enabling unified multimodal models' understanding modules to guide and enhance their own generation capabilities through self-rewarding, achieving effective self-improvement without external supervision.

Abstract: Recently, remarkable progress has been made in Unified Multimodal Models
(UMMs), which integrate vision-language generation and understanding
capabilities within a single framework. However, a significant gap exists where
a model's strong visual understanding often fails to transfer to its visual
generation. A model might correctly understand an image based on user
instructions, yet be unable to generate a faithful image from text prompts.
This phenomenon directly raises a compelling question: Can a model achieve
self-improvement by using its understanding module to reward its generation
module? To bridge this gap and achieve self-improvement, we introduce SRUM, a
self-rewarding post-training framework that can be directly applied to existing
UMMs of various designs. SRUM creates a feedback loop where the model's own
understanding module acts as an internal ``evaluator'', providing corrective
signals to improve its generation module, without requiring additional
human-labeled data. To ensure this feedback is comprehensive, we designed a
global-local dual reward system. To tackle the inherent structural complexity
of images, this system offers multi-scale guidance: a \textbf{global reward}
ensures the correctness of the overall visual semantics and layout, while a
\textbf{local reward} refines fine-grained, object-level fidelity. SRUM leads
to powerful capabilities and shows strong generalization, boosting performance
on T2I-CompBench from 82.18 to \textbf{88.37} and on T2I-ReasonBench from 43.82
to \textbf{46.75}. Overall, our work establishes a powerful new paradigm for
enabling a UMMs' understanding module to guide and enhance its own generation
via self-rewarding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MVP4D is a video diffusion model that generates animatable multi-view 360-degree videos from a single reference image and target expressions, then distills them into real-time renderable 4D avatars, improving realism and 3D consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current single-image avatar generation methods lack multi-view constraints, causing quality degradation when viewpoints deviate from the reference image. The goal is to create more realistic and 3D-consistent avatars without expensive capture rigs.

Method: Based on a pre-trained video diffusion model, MVP4D generates hundreds of frames simultaneously from viewpoints varying up to 360 degrees around the subject, then distills outputs into 4D avatars for real-time rendering.

Result: The approach significantly improves realism, temporal consistency, and 3D consistency compared to previous single-image avatar generation methods.

Conclusion: MVP4D enables creation of high-quality, animatable 4D avatars from single casual images, overcoming limitations of previous methods while maintaining real-time rendering capabilities.

Abstract: Digital human avatars aim to simulate the dynamic appearance of humans in
virtual environments, enabling immersive experiences across gaming, film,
virtual reality, and more. However, the conventional process for creating and
animating photorealistic human avatars is expensive and time-consuming,
requiring large camera capture rigs and significant manual effort from
professional 3D artists. With the advent of capable image and video generation
models, recent methods enable automatic rendering of realistic animated avatars
from a single casually captured reference image of a target subject. While
these techniques significantly lower barriers to avatar creation and offer
compelling realism, they lack constraints provided by multi-view information or
an explicit 3D representation. So, image quality and realism degrade when
rendered from viewpoints that deviate strongly from the reference image. Here,
we build a video model that generates animatable multi-view videos of digital
humans based on a single reference image and target expressions. Our model,
MVP4D, is based on a state-of-the-art pre-trained video diffusion model and
generates hundreds of frames simultaneously from viewpoints varying by up to
360 degrees around a target subject. We show how to distill the outputs of this
model into a 4D avatar that can be rendered in real-time. Our approach
significantly improves the realism, temporal consistency, and 3D consistency of
generated avatars compared to previous methods.

*Kevin Li,Manuel Brack,Sudeep Katakol,Hareesh Ravi,Ajinkya Kale*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniFusion is a diffusion-based generative model that uses a frozen VLM as a unified multimodal encoder, featuring Layerwise Attention Pooling for better text-image alignment and VERIFI mechanism for flexible inference with in-model prompt rewriting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing architectures use separate encoders for images and text, limiting cross-modal reasoning and knowledge transfer. Previous unified approaches require substantial computational resources and large-scale data, making them inaccessible.

Method: Uses Layerwise Attention Pooling (LAP) to extract both high-level semantics and low-level details from VLM tokens. Proposes VERIFI mechanism that conditions diffusion transformer only on VLM-generated text tokens during in-model prompt rewriting.

Result: LAP outperforms other fusion architectures on text-image alignment. Finetuning on editing improves generation alignment and shows cross-modality knowledge transfer. Model zero-shot generalizes from single to multiple image references.

Conclusion: UniFusion demonstrates that using a frozen VLM as unified encoder enables effective cross-modal reasoning, knowledge transfer, and generalization capabilities while being computationally efficient.

Abstract: Although recent advances in visual generation have been remarkable, most
existing architectures still depend on distinct encoders for images and text.
This separation constrains diffusion models' ability to perform cross-modal
reasoning and knowledge transfer. Prior attempts to bridge this gap often use
the last layer information from VLM, employ multiple visual encoders, or train
large unified models jointly for text and image generation, which demands
substantial computational resources and large-scale data, limiting its
accessibility.We present UniFusion, a diffusion-based generative model
conditioned on a frozen large vision-language model (VLM) that serves as a
unified multimodal encoder. At the core of UniFusion is the Layerwise Attention
Pooling (LAP) mechanism that extracts both high level semantics and low level
details from text and visual tokens of a frozen VLM to condition a diffusion
generative model. We demonstrate that LAP outperforms other shallow fusion
architectures on text-image alignment for generation and faithful transfer of
visual information from VLM to the diffusion model which is key for editing. We
propose VLM-Enabled Rewriting Injection with Flexibile Inference (VERIFI),
which conditions a diffusion transformer (DiT) only on the text tokens
generated by the VLM during in-model prompt rewriting. VERIFI combines the
alignment of the conditioning distribution with the VLM's reasoning
capabilities for increased capabilities and flexibility at inference. In
addition, finetuning on editing task not only improves text-image alignment for
generation, indicative of cross-modality knowledge transfer, but also exhibits
tremendous generalization capabilities. Our model when trained on single image
editing, zero-shot generalizes to multiple image references further motivating
the unified encoder design of UniFusion.

*Long Cui,Weiyun Wang,Jie Shao,Zichen Wen,Gen Luo,Linfeng Zhang,Yanting Zhang,Yu Qiao,Wenhai Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViCO is a training method that reduces vision tokens in MLLMs by using multiple MLP connectors with different compression ratios and a Visual Resolution Router to dynamically adjust tokens based on semantic complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs suffer from high inference costs due to excessive vision tokens from image inputs, creating a need for more efficient token usage.

Method: Uses multiple MLP connectors with different compression ratios to downsample vision tokens based on semantic complexity, with KL divergence minimization during training and a Visual Resolution Router for automatic compression rate selection at inference.

Result: Reduces vision tokens by up to 50% while maintaining perception, reasoning, and OCR capabilities of the model.

Conclusion: ViCO contributes to developing more efficient MLLMs by dynamically adapting vision tokens based on semantic complexity rather than image resolution.

Abstract: Existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from increased
inference costs due to the additional vision tokens introduced by image inputs.
In this work, we propose Visual Consistency Learning (ViCO), a novel training
algorithm that enables the model to represent images of varying semantic
complexities using different numbers of vision tokens. The key idea behind our
method is to employ multiple MLP connectors, each with a different image
compression ratio, to downsample the vision tokens based on the semantic
complexity of the image. During training, we minimize the KL divergence between
the responses conditioned on different MLP connectors. At inference time, we
introduce an image router, termed Visual Resolution Router (ViR), that
automatically selects the appropriate compression rate for each image patch.
Compared with existing dynamic high-resolution strategies, which adjust the
number of visual tokens based on image resolutions, our method dynamically
adapts the number of visual tokens according to semantic complexity.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method can reduce the number of
vision tokens by up to 50% while maintaining the model's perception, reasoning,
and OCR capabilities. We hope this work will contribute to the development of
more efficient MLLMs. The code and models will be released to facilitate future
research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CuMPerLay is a differentiable vectorization layer that integrates Cubical Multiparameter Persistence into deep learning, enabling robust topological feature extraction for image analysis tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cubical Multiparameter Persistence (CMP) is powerful for topological image analysis but hindered by complexity of multifiltration structures and vectorization challenges.

Method: Introduces a novel algorithm to vectorize MP homologies of cubical complexes by decomposing CMP into learnable single-parameter persistence with jointly learned bifiltration functions.

Result: Experiments on medical imaging and computer vision datasets show improved classification and segmentation performance, especially in limited-data scenarios.

Conclusion: CuMPerLay provides a promising approach for integrating global structural information into deep networks for structured image analysis.

Abstract: We present CuMPerLay, a novel differentiable vectorization layer that enables
the integration of Cubical Multiparameter Persistence (CMP) into deep learning
pipelines. While CMP presents a natural and powerful way to topologically work
with images, its use is hindered by the complexity of multifiltration
structures as well as the vectorization of CMP. In face of these challenges, we
introduce a new algorithm for vectorizing MP homologies of cubical complexes.
Our CuMPerLay decomposes the CMP into a combination of individual, learnable
single-parameter persistence, where the bifiltration functions are jointly
learned. Thanks to the differentiability, its robust topological feature
vectors can be seamlessly used within state-of-the-art architectures such as
Swin Transformers. We establish theoretical guarantees for the stability of our
vectorization under generalized Wasserstein metrics. Our experiments on
benchmark medical imaging and computer vision datasets show the benefit
CuMPerLay on classification and segmentation performance, particularly in
limited-data scenarios. Overall, CuMPerLay offers a promising direction for
integrating global structural information into deep networks for structured
image analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DriveVLA-W0 uses world modeling to predict future images as dense self-supervised signal, addressing supervision deficit in Vision-Language-Action models and improving driving intelligence with better data scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA models suffer from supervision deficit - their large capacity is underutilized by sparse, low-dimensional action supervision, leaving representational power untapped.

Method: Proposes DriveVLA-W0 training paradigm with world modeling to predict future images. Uses autoregressive world model for discrete visual tokens and diffusion world model for continuous features, plus lightweight action expert for real-time inference.

Result: Significantly outperforms BEV and VLA baselines on NAVSIM v1/v2 benchmark and large in-house dataset. Amplifies data scaling law with accelerating performance gains as training data increases.

Conclusion: World modeling provides effective dense supervision that better utilizes VLA model capacity and improves driving intelligence with strong scaling properties.

Abstract: Scaling Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models on large-scale data offers a
promising path to achieving a more generalized driving intelligence. However,
VLA models are limited by a ``supervision deficit'': the vast model capacity is
supervised by sparse, low-dimensional actions, leaving much of their
representational power underutilized. To remedy this, we propose
\textbf{DriveVLA-W0}, a training paradigm that employs world modeling to
predict future images. This task generates a dense, self-supervised signal that
compels the model to learn the underlying dynamics of the driving environment.
We showcase the paradigm's versatility by instantiating it for two dominant VLA
archetypes: an autoregressive world model for VLAs that use discrete visual
tokens, and a diffusion world model for those operating on continuous visual
features. Building on the rich representations learned from world modeling, we
introduce a lightweight action expert to address the inference latency for
real-time deployment. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM v1/v2 benchmark and a
680x larger in-house dataset demonstrate that DriveVLA-W0 significantly
outperforms BEV and VLA baselines. Crucially, it amplifies the data scaling
law, showing that performance gains accelerate as the training dataset size
increases.

*Qing Jiang,Junan Huo,Xingyu Chen,Yuda Xiong,Zhaoyang Zeng,Yihao Chen,Tianhe Ren,Junzhi Yu,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Rex-Omni is a 3B-scale MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art object detection performance comparable to regression-based models like DINO and Grounding DINO in zero-shot settings, enabled by quantized coordinate tokens, multi-data engines, and two-stage training with RL post-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between traditional coordinate regression-based object detection models and MLLM approaches, which face challenges like low recall rate, duplicate predictions, and coordinate misalignment.

Method: Three key designs: 1) Task formulation using special tokens for quantized coordinates (0-999), 2) Multiple data engines for generating high-quality grounding, referring, and pointing data, 3) Two-stage training with supervised fine-tuning on 22M data followed by GRPO-based RL post-training with geometry-aware rewards.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like COCO and LVIS, comparable to or exceeding regression-based models in zero-shot settings. Enables versatile capabilities including object referring, pointing, visual prompting, GUI grounding, spatial referring, OCR and key-pointing.

Conclusion: Rex-Omni paves the way for more versatile and language-aware visual perception systems by effectively bridging the discrete-to-continuous coordinate prediction gap and demonstrating superior object perception performance.

Abstract: Object detection has long been dominated by traditional coordinate
regression-based models, such as YOLO, DETR, and Grounding DINO. Although
recent efforts have attempted to leverage MLLMs to tackle this task, they face
challenges like low recall rate, duplicate predictions, coordinate
misalignment, etc. In this work, we bridge this gap and propose Rex-Omni, a
3B-scale MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art object perception performance. On
benchmarks like COCO and LVIS, Rex-Omni attains performance comparable to or
exceeding regression-based models (e.g., DINO, Grounding DINO) in a zero-shot
setting. This is enabled by three key designs: 1) Task Formulation: we use
special tokens to represent quantized coordinates from 0 to 999, reducing the
model's learning difficulty and improving token efficiency for coordinate
prediction; 2) Data Engines: we construct multiple data engines to generate
high-quality grounding, referring, and pointing data, providing semantically
rich supervision for training; \3) Training Pipelines: we employ a two-stage
training process, combining supervised fine-tuning on 22 million data with
GRPO-based reinforcement post-training. This RL post-training leverages
geometry-aware rewards to effectively bridge the discrete-to-continuous
coordinate prediction gap, improve box accuracy, and mitigate undesirable
behaviors like duplicate predictions that stem from the teacher-guided nature
of the initial SFT stage. Beyond conventional detection, Rex-Omni's inherent
language understanding enables versatile capabilities such as object referring,
pointing, visual prompting, GUI grounding, spatial referring, OCR and
key-pointing, all systematically evaluated on dedicated benchmarks. We believe
that Rex-Omni paves the way for more versatile and language-aware visual
perception systems.

### [88] [DeepMMSearch-R1: Empowering Multimodal LLMs in Multimodal Web Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12801)
*Kartik Narayan,Yang Xu,Tian Cao,Kavya Nerella,Vishal M. Patel,Navid Shiee,Peter Grasch,Chao Jia,Yinfei Yang,Zhe Gan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepMMSearch-R1 is a multimodal LLM that performs on-demand web searches using both image crops and text queries, with iterative query refinement through a two-stage training pipeline using a novel multimodal VQA dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLM approaches suffer from rigid pipelines, excessive search calls, and poorly constructed queries, leading to inefficiencies in handling information-seeking and knowledge-intensive queries in dynamic real-world environments.

Method: Two-stage training: supervised finetuning followed by online reinforcement learning, using DeepMMSearchVQA dataset with multi-hop queries that teach when/what/how to search and reason over retrieved information.

Result: Extensive experiments show superiority across knowledge-intensive benchmarks, with capabilities for effective image search using relevant crops and iterative text query adaptation.

Conclusion: The approach provides valuable insights for advancing multimodal web-search, enabling self-reflection and self-correction through dynamic query crafting and multi-turn search capabilities.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in real-world applications require
access to external knowledge sources and must remain responsive to the dynamic
and ever-changing real-world information in order to address
information-seeking and knowledge-intensive user queries. Existing approaches,
such as retrieval augmented generation (RAG) methods, search agents, and search
equipped MLLMs, often suffer from rigid pipelines, excessive search calls, and
poorly constructed search queries, which result in inefficiencies and
suboptimal outcomes. To address these limitations, we present DeepMMSearch-R1,
the first multimodal LLM capable of performing on-demand, multi-turn web
searches and dynamically crafting queries for both image and text search tools.
Specifically, DeepMMSearch-R1 can initiate web searches based on relevant crops
of the input image making the image search more effective, and can iteratively
adapt text search queries based on retrieved information, thereby enabling
self-reflection and self-correction. Our approach relies on a two-stage
training pipeline: a cold start supervised finetuning phase followed by an
online reinforcement learning optimization. For training, we introduce
DeepMMSearchVQA, a novel multimodal VQA dataset created through an automated
pipeline intermixed with real-world information from web search tools. This
dataset contains diverse, multi-hop queries that integrate textual and visual
information, teaching the model when to search, what to search for, which
search tool to use and how to reason over the retrieved information. We conduct
extensive experiments across a range of knowledge-intensive benchmarks to
demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Finally, we analyze the results
and provide insights that are valuable for advancing multimodal web-search.
