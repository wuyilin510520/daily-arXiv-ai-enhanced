To\naddress these challenges, we propose Multimodal Reasoning Edit (MURE), a novel\nframework that shifts the visual editing process from purely text-based\nreasoning to a series of interleaved textual and visual rationales. Our\nframework performs image editing using a natively multimodal, interleaved\ntext-image CoT. This approach generates a step-by-step chain of reasoning where\na textual description is followed by a corresponding visual cue, such as a\npositional mask that defined intended edited regions or a representation of new\ncontent. Furthermore, to mitigate the hallucination phenomenon of large\nlanguage models, we introduce Multimodal Deep Confidence (MMDC) reasoning\nparadigm. This paradigm explores a tree of visual reasoning paths at each step.\nBy pruning low-quality branches using a deep confidence score from a reward\nmodel, it ensures the model consistently follows a high-quality trajectory\ntowards the final edited result. The proposed method decomposes complex editing\ntasks into interdependent sub-tasks, achieving greater precision at each stage\nand yielding high-fidelity edited results. We define the formulation for\ninterleaved text-image chains and release the first CoT-Edit-14K dataset,\ncomprising 14K high-quality editing examples.

While most\nexisting works have focused on identifying attention sinks, low-semantic tokens\nreceiving disproportionately high attention, within the LLM, we shift the focus\nto the vision encoder by identifying a class of high-norm visual tokens from\nViT, referred to as ViT attention sinks -- a problem that has been rarely\nstudied but is indeed very important for LVLMs. Our findings show that these\nViT sinks encapsulate high-level semantic concepts from images, allowing the\nLLM to perform more effective understanding and reasoning.
