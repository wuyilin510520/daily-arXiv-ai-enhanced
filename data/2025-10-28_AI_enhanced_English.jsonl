Current vision-language models (VLMs) still struggle on basic data\nvisualization understanding tasks, but the causes of failure remain unclear.\nAre VLM failures attributable to limitations in how visual information in the\ndata visualization is encoded, how information is transferred between the\nvision and language modules, or how information is processed within the\nlanguage module? We developed FUGU, a suite of data visualization understanding\ntasks, to precisely characterize potential sources of difficulty (e.g.,\nextracting the position of data points, distances between them, and other\nsummary statistics). We used FUGU to investigate three widely used VLMs. To\ndiagnose the sources of errors produced by these models, we used activation\npatching and linear probes to trace information flow through models across a\nvariety of prompting strategies. We found that some models fail to generate the\ncoordinates of individual data points correctly, and these initial errors often\nlead to erroneous final responses. When these models are provided with the\ncorrect coordinates, performance improves substantially. Moreover, even when\nthe model generates an incorrect response, the correct coordinates can be\nsuccessfully read out from the latent representations in the vision encoder,\nsuggesting that the source of these errors lies in the vision-language handoff.\nWe further found that while providing correct coordinates helps with tasks\ninvolving one or a small number of data points, it generally worsens\nperformance for tasks that require extracting statistical relationships across\nmany data points.

To address this problem, we introduce AVEP\n(Action-centric Video Event Prediction), a task that distinguishes itself from\nexisting video prediction tasks through its incorporation of more complex logic\nand richer semantic information. We present a large structured dataset, which\nconsists of about $35K$ annotated videos and more than $178K$ video clips of\nevent, built upon existing video event datasets to support this task. The\ndataset offers more fine-grained annotations, where the atomic unit is\nrepresented as a multimodal event argument node, providing better structured\nrepresentations of video events. Due to the complexity of event structures,\ntraditional visual models that take patches or frames as input are not\nwell-suited for AVEP. We propose EventFormer, a node-graph hierarchical\nattention based video event prediction model, which can capture both the\nrelationships between events and their arguments and the coreferencial\nrelationships between arguments. We conducted experiments using several SOTA\nvideo prediction models as well as LVLMs on AVEP, demonstrating both the\ncomplexity of the task and the value of the dataset.

Recent studies have\nextended this paradigm to Multi-Source Domain Adaptation (MSDA), which exploits\nmultiple source domains carrying richer and more diverse transferable\ninformation. However, a substantial performance gap still remains between\nadaptation-based methods and fully supervised learning. In this paper, we\nexplore a more practical and challenging setting, named Multi-Source Active\nDomain Adaptation (MS-ADA), to further enhance target-domain performance by\nselectively acquiring annotations from the target domain. The key difficulty of\nMS-ADA lies in designing selection criteria that can jointly handle inter-class\ndiversity and multi-source domain variation. To address these challenges, we\npropose a simple yet effective GALA strategy (GALA), which combines a global\nk-means clustering step for target-domain samples with a cluster-wise local\nselection criterion, effectively tackling the above two issues in a\ncomplementary manner. Our proposed GALA is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly\nintegrated into existing DA frameworks without introducing any additional\ntrainable parameters.
