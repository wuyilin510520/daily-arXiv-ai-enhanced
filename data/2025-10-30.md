### [1] [DrivingScene: A Multi-Task Online Feed-Forward 3D Gaussian Splatting Method for Dynamic Driving Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24734)
*Qirui Hou,Wenzhang Sun,Chang Zeng,Chunfeng Wang,Hao Li,Jianxun Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DrivingScene is an online feed-forward framework that reconstructs 4D dynamic scenes from two consecutive surround-view images using a residual flow network and coarse-to-fine training, achieving state-of-the-art performance in dynamic reconstruction and novel view synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time, high-fidelity reconstruction of dynamic driving scenes is challenging due to complex dynamics and sparse views, with existing methods struggling to balance quality and efficiency.

Method: Uses a lightweight residual flow network that predicts non-rigid motion of dynamic objects per camera on top of a learned static scene prior, explicitly modeling dynamics via scene flow. Employs a coarse-to-fine training paradigm to avoid instabilities of end-to-end approaches.

Result: Experiments on nuScenes dataset show the method simultaneously generates high-quality depth, scene flow, and 3D Gaussian point clouds online, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed DrivingScene framework effectively reconstructs 4D dynamic scenes from sparse views with superior performance in both dynamic reconstruction and novel view synthesis tasks.

Abstract: Real-time, high-fidelity reconstruction of dynamic driving scenes is
challenged by complex dynamics and sparse views, with prior methods struggling
to balance quality and efficiency. We propose DrivingScene, an online,
feed-forward framework that reconstructs 4D dynamic scenes from only two
consecutive surround-view images. Our key innovation is a lightweight residual
flow network that predicts the non-rigid motion of dynamic objects per camera
on top of a learned static scene prior, explicitly modeling dynamics via scene
flow. We also introduce a coarse-to-fine training paradigm that circumvents the
instabilities common to end-to-end approaches. Experiments on nuScenes dataset
show our image-only method simultaneously generates high-quality depth, scene
flow, and 3D Gaussian point clouds online, significantly outperforming
state-of-the-art methods in both dynamic reconstruction and novel view
synthesis.

### [2] [Towards Fine-Grained Human Motion Video Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24767)
*Guorui Song,Guocun Wang,Zhe Huang,Jing Lin,Xuefei Zhe,Jian Li,Haoqian Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M-ACM is a motion-augmented caption model that uses human mesh recovery to improve video captioning by capturing fine-grained motion details, reducing hallucinations, and enhancing semantic fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video captioning models struggle with capturing fine-grained motion details, leading to vague or semantically inconsistent captions that fail to accurately describe human actions.

Method: M-ACM leverages motion representations from human mesh recovery to explicitly highlight human body dynamics through motion-aware decoding, and introduces the HMI Dataset with 115K video-description pairs and HMI-Bench benchmark.

Result: Experimental results show M-ACM significantly outperforms previous methods in accurately describing complex human motions and subtle temporal variations.

Conclusion: M-ACM sets a new standard for motion-centric video captioning by effectively incorporating motion awareness to generate more accurate and semantically faithful descriptions.

Abstract: Generating accurate descriptions of human actions in videos remains a
challenging task for video captioning models. Existing approaches often
struggle to capture fine-grained motion details, resulting in vague or
semantically inconsistent captions. In this work, we introduce the
Motion-Augmented Caption Model (M-ACM), a novel generative framework that
enhances caption quality by incorporating motion-aware decoding. At its core,
M-ACM leverages motion representations derived from human mesh recovery to
explicitly highlight human body dynamics, thereby reducing hallucinations and
improving both semantic fidelity and spatial alignment in the generated
captions. To support research in this area, we present the Human Motion Insight
(HMI) Dataset, comprising 115K video-description pairs focused on human
movement, along with HMI-Bench, a dedicated benchmark for evaluating
motion-focused video captioning. Experimental results demonstrate that M-ACM
significantly outperforms previous methods in accurately describing complex
human motions and subtle temporal variations, setting a new standard for
motion-centric video captioning.

### [3] [Combining SAR Simulators to Train ATR Models with Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24768)
*Benjamin Camus,Julien Houssay,Corentin Le Barbu,Eric Monteux,CÃ©dric Saleun,Christian Cochin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper trains Deep Learning models for Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images using synthetic data from simulators to overcome the lack of real labeled measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of real labeled SAR measurements for training ATR models, so synthetic data from simulators is used. However, synthetic datasets are not as representative as real measurements due to simplifying assumptions in physical models, leading to poor generalization on real data.

Method: The approach combines two SAR simulators with different paradigms: MOCEM (based on scattering centers model) and Salsa (using ray tracing strategy). ATR models are trained on synthetic datasets from both simulators using the ADASCA Deep Learning approach.

Result: The method achieves an accuracy of almost 88% on MSTAR real measurements, demonstrating improved generalization performance compared to using single simulator approaches.

Conclusion: Combining complementary SAR simulators with different physical modeling paradigms can effectively address the domain gap between synthetic and real SAR data, enabling successful ATR model training with synthetic data that generalizes well to real measurements.

Abstract: This work aims to train Deep Learning models to perform Automatic Target
Recognition (ATR) on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. To circumvent the
lack of real labelled measurements, we resort to synthetic data produced by SAR
simulators. Simulation offers full control over the virtual environment, which
enables us to generate large and diversified datasets at will. However,
simulations are intrinsically grounded on simplifying assumptions of the real
world (i.e. physical models). Thus, synthetic datasets are not as
representative as real measurements. Consequently, ATR models trained on
synthetic images cannot generalize well on real measurements. Our contributions
to this problem are twofold: on one hand, we demonstrate and quantify the
impact of the simulation paradigm on the ATR. On the other hand, we propose a
new approach to tackle the ATR problem: combine two SAR simulators that are
grounded on different (but complementary) paradigms to produce synthetic
datasets. To this end, we use two simulators: MOCEM, which is based on a
scattering centers model approach, and Salsa, which resorts on a ray tracing
strategy. We train ATR models using synthetic dataset generated both by MOCEM
and Salsa and our Deep Learning approach called ADASCA. We reach an accuracy of
almost 88 % on the MSTAR measurements.

### [4] [Point-level Uncertainty Evaluation of Mobile Laser Scanning Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24773)
*Ziyang Xu,Olaf Wysocki,Christoph Holst*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A machine learning framework using Random Forest and XGBoost models to predict point-level uncertainty in Mobile Laser Scanning point clouds based on local geometric features, achieving ROC-AUC > 0.87 without requiring high-precision reference data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional uncertainty modeling for MLS point clouds requires expensive high-precision reference data that is often impractical at large scales, creating a need for alternative approaches.

Method: Implemented ensemble learning models (RF and XGBoost) trained on spatially partitioned real-world datasets to learn relationships between local geometric features and point-level errors, preventing data leakage.

Result: Both models effectively captured nonlinear relationships between geometric characteristics and uncertainty, achieving mean ROC-AUC values above 0.87, with elevation variation, point density, and local structural complexity being key predictive features.

Conclusion: The framework provides a scalable, data-driven approach for uncertainty evaluation in large-scale point clouds, offering a foundation for future quality control and error analysis without requiring costly reference data.

Abstract: Reliable quantification of uncertainty in Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) point
clouds is essential for ensuring the accuracy and credibility of downstream
applications such as 3D mapping, modeling, and change analysis. Traditional
backward uncertainty modeling heavily rely on high-precision reference data,
which are often costly or infeasible to obtain at large scales. To address this
issue, this study proposes a machine learning-based framework for point-level
uncertainty evaluation that learns the relationship between local geometric
features and point-level errors. The framework is implemented using two
ensemble learning models, Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost, which are trained and
validated on a spatially partitioned real-world dataset to avoid data leakage.
Experimental results demonstrate that both models can effectively capture the
nonlinear relationships between geometric characteristics and uncertainty,
achieving mean ROC-AUC values above 0.87. The analysis further reveals that
geometric features describing elevation variation, point density, and local
structural complexity play a dominant role in predicting uncertainty. The
proposed framework offers a data-driven perspective of uncertainty evaluation,
providing a scalable and adaptable foundation for future quality control and
error analysis of large-scale point clouds.

### [5] [Cross-Enhanced Multimodal Fusion of Eye-Tracking and Facial Features for Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24777)
*Yujie Nie,Jianzhang Ni,Yonglong Ye,Yuan-Ting Zhang,Yun Kwok Wing,Xiangqing Xu,Xin Ma,Lizhou Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multimodal framework using eye-tracking and facial features for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis achieves 95.11% accuracy through cross-attention fusion and directional convolution modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate AD diagnosis is crucial for timely intervention. Eye-tracking and facial features provide complementary cognitive indicators, but few studies have explored their joint integration for auxiliary diagnosis.

Method: Proposed a multimodal cross-enhanced fusion framework with: (1) Cross-Enhanced Fusion Attention Module (CEFAM) for inter-modal interactions via cross-attention and global enhancement, and (2) Direction-Aware Convolution Module (DACM) for fine-grained directional facial features using horizontal-vertical receptive fields.

Result: Achieved 95.11% classification accuracy in distinguishing AD from healthy controls, outperforming traditional late fusion and feature concatenation methods. Framework demonstrated superior robustness and diagnostic performance.

Conclusion: The proposed multimodal framework effectively models inter-modal dependencies and modality-specific contributions, providing a robust approach for AD diagnosis by synergistically leveraging eye-tracking and facial features.

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is essential for enabling
timely intervention and slowing disease progression. Multimodal diagnostic
approaches offer considerable promise by integrating complementary information
across behavioral and perceptual domains. Eye-tracking and facial features, in
particular, are important indicators of cognitive function, reflecting
attentional distribution and neurocognitive state. However, few studies have
explored their joint integration for auxiliary AD diagnosis. In this study, we
propose a multimodal cross-enhanced fusion framework that synergistically
leverages eye-tracking and facial features for AD detection. The framework
incorporates two key modules: (a) a Cross-Enhanced Fusion Attention Module
(CEFAM), which models inter-modal interactions through cross-attention and
global enhancement, and (b) a Direction-Aware Convolution Module (DACM), which
captures fine-grained directional facial features via horizontal-vertical
receptive fields. Together, these modules enable adaptive and discriminative
multimodal representation learning. To support this work, we constructed a
synchronized multimodal dataset, including 25 patients with AD and 25 healthy
controls (HC), by recording aligned facial video and eye-tracking sequences
during a visual memory-search paradigm, providing an ecologically valid
resource for evaluating integration strategies. Extensive experiments on this
dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms traditional late fusion and
feature concatenation methods, achieving a classification accuracy of 95.11% in
distinguishing AD from HC, highlighting superior robustness and diagnostic
performance by explicitly modeling inter-modal dependencies and
modality-specific contributions.

Motivation: Intelligent vehicles require efficient lane detection for automation applications in urban roads and robot tracks.

Method: Proposes an FPGA-based Lane Detector Vehicle (LDV) architecture using Sobel algorithm for edge detection on 416x416 images at 150 MHz frequency.

Result: System generates valid output every 1.17 ms containing lane count, current lane index, and lane boundaries, with automated light and temperature control for environmental adaptation.

Conclusion: The proposed FPGA-based lane detection system provides fast and reliable lane detection with environmental adaptability, suitable for intelligent vehicle applications.

Abstract: Intelligent vehicles are one of the most important outcomes gained from the
world tendency toward automation. Applications of IVs, whether in urban roads
or robot tracks, do prioritize lane path detection. This paper proposes an
FPGA-based Lane Detector Vehicle LDV architecture that relies on the Sobel
algorithm for edge detection. Operating on 416 x 416 images and 150 MHz, the
system can generate a valid output every 1.17 ms. The valid output consists of
the number of present lanes, the current lane index, as well as its right and
left boundaries. Additionally, the automated light and temperature control
units in the proposed system enhance its adaptability to the surrounding
environmental conditions.

*Mingzhi Zhu,Ding Shang,Sai Qian Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ESCA is a full-stack optimization framework that enables real-time photorealistic codec avatar inference on resource-constrained VR devices through efficient quantization and custom hardware acceleration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Photorealistic Codec Avatars (PCA) enable immersive VR communication but impose significant computational demands that challenge real-time inference on resource-constrained VR devices like head-mounted displays, where latency and power efficiency are critical.

Method: Proposes an efficient post-training quantization (PTQ) method for Codec Avatar models to enable low-precision execution without quality loss, and designs a custom hardware accelerator for VR SoC integration, combined into the ESCA full-stack optimization framework.

Result: ESCA boosts FovVideoVDP quality scores by up to +0.39 over best 4-bit baseline, delivers up to 3.36Ã latency reduction, and sustains 100 FPS rendering rate in end-to-end tests, satisfying real-time VR requirements.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate the feasibility of deploying high-fidelity codec avatars on resource-constrained devices, enabling more immersive and portable VR experiences.

Abstract: Photorealistic Codec Avatars (PCA), which generate high-fidelity human face
renderings, are increasingly being used in Virtual Reality (VR) environments to
enable immersive communication and interaction through deep learning-based
generative models. However, these models impose significant computational
demands, making real-time inference challenging on resource-constrained VR
devices such as head-mounted displays, where latency and power efficiency are
critical. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient post-training
quantization (PTQ) method tailored for Codec Avatar models, enabling
low-precision execution without compromising output quality. In addition, we
design a custom hardware accelerator that can be integrated into the
system-on-chip of VR devices to further enhance processing efficiency. Building
on these components, we introduce ESCA, a full-stack optimization framework
that accelerates PCA inference on edge VR platforms. Experimental results
demonstrate that ESCA boosts FovVideoVDP quality scores by up to $+0.39$ over
the best 4-bit baseline, delivers up to $3.36\times$ latency reduction, and
sustains a rendering rate of 100 frames per second in end-to-end tests,
satisfying real-time VR requirements. These results demonstrate the feasibility
of deploying high-fidelity codec avatars on resource-constrained devices,
opening the door to more immersive and portable VR experiences.

### [8] [The Underappreciated Power of Vision Models for Graph Structural Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24788)
*Xinjian Zhao,Wei Pang,Zhongkai Xue,Xiangru Jian,Lei Zhang,Yaoyao Xu,Xiaozhuang Song,Shu Wu,Tianshu Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision models show comparable performance to GNNs on graph tasks but with different learning patterns, excelling at global structural understanding while GNNs struggle with pattern abstraction and scale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the underappreciated potential of vision models for graph understanding, as they capture global structures intuitively like human perception, unlike GNNs' bottom-up message-passing approach.

Method: Introduced GraphAbstract benchmark to evaluate models' ability to perceive global graph properties (organizational archetypes, symmetry, connectivity strength, critical elements) and tested vision models vs GNNs.

Result: Vision models significantly outperform GNNs on holistic structural understanding tasks, maintain generalizability across graph scales, while GNNs struggle with global pattern abstraction and degrade with increasing graph size.

Conclusion: Vision models possess remarkable capabilities for graph structural understanding, particularly for global topological awareness and scale-invariant reasoning, opening new avenues for developing graph foundation models.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks operate through bottom-up message-passing,
fundamentally differing from human visual perception, which intuitively
captures global structures first. We investigate the underappreciated potential
of vision models for graph understanding, finding they achieve performance
comparable to GNNs on established benchmarks while exhibiting distinctly
different learning patterns. These divergent behaviors, combined with
limitations of existing benchmarks that conflate domain features with
topological understanding, motivate our introduction of GraphAbstract. This
benchmark evaluates models' ability to perceive global graph properties as
humans do: recognizing organizational archetypes, detecting symmetry, sensing
connectivity strength, and identifying critical elements. Our results reveal
that vision models significantly outperform GNNs on tasks requiring holistic
structural understanding and maintain generalizability across varying graph
scales, while GNNs struggle with global pattern abstraction and degrade with
increasing graph size. This work demonstrates that vision models possess
remarkable yet underutilized capabilities for graph structural understanding,
particularly for problems requiring global topological awareness and
scale-invariant reasoning. These findings open new avenues to leverage this
underappreciated potential for developing more effective graph foundation
models for tasks dominated by holistic pattern recognition.

### [9] [A Re-node Self-training Approach for Deep Graph-based Semi-supervised Classification on Multi-view Image Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24791)
*Jingjun Bi,Fadi Dornaika*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RSGSLM is a graph-based semi-supervised learning method for multi-view data that combines feature transformation, graph fusion, pseudo-labeling, and topological corrections to improve classification performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional graph-based methods struggle with multi-view image data due to unclear graph structures and the complexity of integrating multiple views, limiting their efficiency in semi-supervised learning scenarios.

Method: Combines linear feature transformation and multi-view graph fusion in GCN framework, dynamically incorporates pseudo-labels into loss function, corrects topological imbalances by adjusting weights of boundary samples, and adds unsupervised smoothing loss.

Result: Experimental results on multi-view benchmark image datasets show RSGSLM outperforms existing semi-supervised learning approaches in multi-view contexts.

Conclusion: The proposed RSGSLM method effectively addresses challenges in multi-view graph-based semi-supervised learning and demonstrates superior performance compared to existing techniques.

Abstract: Recently, graph-based semi-supervised learning and pseudo-labeling have
gained attention due to their effectiveness in reducing the need for extensive
data annotations. Pseudo-labeling uses predictions from unlabeled data to
improve model training, while graph-based methods are characterized by
processing data represented as graphs. However, the lack of clear graph
structures in images combined with the complexity of multi-view data limits the
efficiency of traditional and existing techniques. Moreover, the integration of
graph structures in multi-view data is still a challenge. In this paper, we
propose Re-node Self-taught Graph-based Semi-supervised Learning for Multi-view
Data (RSGSLM). Our method addresses these challenges by (i) combining linear
feature transformation and multi-view graph fusion within a Graph Convolutional
Network (GCN) framework, (ii) dynamically incorporating pseudo-labels into the
GCN loss function to improve classification in multi-view data, and (iii)
correcting topological imbalances by adjusting the weights of labeled samples
near class boundaries. Additionally, (iv) we introduce an unsupervised
smoothing loss applicable to all samples. This combination optimizes
performance while maintaining computational efficiency. Experimental results on
multi-view benchmark image datasets demonstrate that RSGSLM surpasses existing
semi-supervised learning approaches in multi-view contexts.

### [10] [PISA-Bench: The PISA Index as a Multilingual and Multimodal Metric for the Evaluation of Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24792)
*Patrick Haller,Fabio Barth,Jonas Golde,Georg Rehm,Alan Akbik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PISA-Bench is a multilingual vision-language benchmark derived from expert-created PISA tests, covering six languages with human-verified examples to address limitations in existing synthetic datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing vision-language benchmarks that rely on synthetic LLM-generated content and are predominantly English-only, by creating a high-quality, multilingual benchmark with human-verified examples.

Method: Derived examples from English PISA tests (expert-created student competency assessments), extracted human-created instructions, questions, answer options, and images, then translated into five additional languages (Spanish, German, Chinese, French, Italian) to create a fully parallel multilingual corpus.

Result: Evaluation of state-of-the-art VLMs shows small models (<20B parameters) fail to achieve high scores, substantial performance degradation on non-English splits, and high error rates on spatial and geometric reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: PISA-Bench provides a valuable resource for advancing multilingual multimodal reasoning research, highlighting current model limitations in non-English contexts and spatial reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in
multimodal reasoning. However, existing benchmarks remain limited in terms of
high-quality, human-verified examples. Many current datasets rely on
synthetically generated content by large language models (LLMs). Furthermore,
most datasets are limited to English, as manual quality assurance of translated
samples is time-consuming and costly. To fill this gap, we introduce
PISA-Bench, a multilingual benchmark derived from English examples of the
expert-created PISA tests, a unified framework for the assessment of student
competencies in over eighty countries. Each example consists of human-extracted
instructions, questions, answer options, and images, enriched with question
type categories, and has been translated from English into five additional
languages (Spanish, German, Chinese, French, and Italian), resulting in a fully
parallel corpus covering six languages. We evaluate state-of-the-art
vision-language models on PISA-Bench and find that especially small models
(<20B parameters) fail to achieve high test scores. We further find substantial
performance degradation on non-English splits as well as high error-rates when
models are tasked with spatial and geometric reasoning. By releasing the
dataset and evaluation framework, we provide a resource for advancing research
on multilingual multimodal reasoning.

*Zhaoshu Yu,Bo Wang,Pengpeng Zeng,Haonan Zhang,Ji Zhang,Lianli Gao,Jingkuan Song,Nicu Sebe,Heng Tao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This survey provides the first comprehensive review of Efficient Vision-Language-Action models (Efficient VLAs), addressing the computational and data challenges in deploying these embodied AI systems through a unified taxonomy across model design, training, and data collection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language-Action models have shown remarkable capabilities but face severe deployment challenges due to substantial computational and data requirements from their large-scale foundation models.

Method: The survey introduces a unified taxonomy categorizing techniques into three pillars: Efficient Model Design (architectures and compression), Efficient Training (reducing computational burdens), and Efficient Data Collection (addressing robotic data bottlenecks).

Result: The survey establishes a foundational reference framework, summarizes representative applications, delineates key challenges, and provides a roadmap for future research in Efficient VLAs.

Conclusion: This work serves as the first comprehensive review of Efficient VLAs, creating a systematic framework to address deployment challenges and guide future research directions in embodied intelligence.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) represent a significant frontier in
embodied intelligence, aiming to bridge digital knowledge with physical-world
interaction. While these models have demonstrated remarkable generalist
capabilities, their deployment is severely hampered by the substantial
computational and data requirements inherent to their underlying large-scale
foundation models. Motivated by the urgent need to address these challenges,
this survey presents the first comprehensive review of Efficient
Vision-Language-Action models (Efficient VLAs) across the entire
data-model-training process. Specifically, we introduce a unified taxonomy to
systematically organize the disparate efforts in this domain, categorizing
current techniques into three core pillars: (1) Efficient Model Design,
focusing on efficient architectures and model compression; (2) Efficient
Training, which reduces computational burdens during model learning; and (3)
Efficient Data Collection, which addresses the bottlenecks in acquiring and
utilizing robotic data. Through a critical review of state-of-the-art methods
within this framework, this survey not only establishes a foundational
reference for the community but also summarizes representative applications,
delineates key challenges, and charts a roadmap for future research. We

### [12] [Conflict Adaptation in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24804)
*Xiaoyang Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision-language models exhibit human-like conflict adaptation behavior in Stroop tasks, and sparse autoencoders identify specialized neural representations that mirror human cognitive processing asymmetries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether AI models demonstrate human-like cognitive control mechanisms, specifically conflict adaptation, and to understand the neural representations underlying this behavior.

Method: Used sequential Stroop task testing on 13 vision-language models, then employed sparse autoencoders to analyze task-relevant representations in InternVL 3.5 4B model.

Result: 12 of 13 VLMs showed conflict adaptation behavior; identified overlapping text/color supernodes in early/late layers mirroring human automaticity asymmetry; isolated conflict-modulated supernode in layers 24-25 whose ablation increased Stroop errors.

Conclusion: VLMs exhibit human-like cognitive control mechanisms, and their internal representations reflect human cognitive processing patterns, suggesting AI models can serve as useful models for studying cognitive phenomena.

Abstract: A signature of human cognitive control is conflict adaptation: improved
performance on a high-conflict trial following another high-conflict trial.
This phenomenon offers an account for how cognitive control, a scarce resource,
is recruited. Using a sequential Stroop task, we find that 12 of 13
vision-language models (VLMs) tested exhibit behavior consistent with conflict
adaptation, with the lone exception likely reflecting a ceiling effect. To
understand the representational basis of this behavior, we use sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to identify task-relevant supernodes in InternVL 3.5 4B.
Partially overlapping supernodes emerge for text and color in both early and
late layers, and their relative sizes mirror the automaticity asymmetry between
reading and color naming in humans. We further isolate a conflict-modulated
supernode in layers 24-25 whose ablation significantly increases Stroop errors
while minimally affecting congruent trials.

### [13] [DualCap: Enhancing Lightweight Image Captioning via Dual Retrieval with Similar Scenes Visual Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24813)
*Binbin Li,Guimiao Yang,Zisen Qi,Haiping Wang,Yu Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DualCap is a lightweight retrieval-augmented image captioning model that uses dual retrieval (image-to-text and image-to-image) to generate both text and visual prompts, enhancing visual representation without requiring many trainable parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing lightweight retrieval-augmented caption models only use retrieved data as text prompts, creating a semantic gap by leaving original visual features unenhanced, especially for object details and complex scenes.

Method: Uses dual retrieval mechanism: standard image-to-text retrieval for text prompts and novel image-to-image retrieval for visually similar scenes. Extracts salient keywords from similar image captions, encodes them, and integrates with original image features through a lightweight trainable feature fusion network.

Result: Achieves competitive performance while requiring fewer trainable parameters compared to previous visual-prompting captioning approaches.

Conclusion: DualCap effectively bridges the semantic gap in lightweight retrieval-augmented captioning by enriching visual representation through dual retrieval and feature fusion, offering improved performance with reduced parameter requirements.

Abstract: Recent lightweight retrieval-augmented image caption models often utilize
retrieved data solely as text prompts, thereby creating a semantic gap by
leaving the original visual features unenhanced, particularly for object
details or complex scenes. To address this limitation, we propose $DualCap$, a
novel approach that enriches the visual representation by generating a visual
prompt from retrieved similar images. Our model employs a dual retrieval
mechanism, using standard image-to-text retrieval for text prompts and a novel
image-to-image retrieval to source visually analogous scenes. Specifically,
salient keywords and phrases are derived from the captions of visually similar
scenes to capture key objects and similar details. These textual features are
then encoded and integrated with the original image features through a
lightweight, trainable feature fusion network. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance while requiring
fewer trainable parameters compared to previous visual-prompting captioning
approaches.

*Phi-Hung Hoang,Nam-Thuan Trinh,Van-Manh Tran,Thi-Thu-Hong Phan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A three-stage deep learning framework combining vision backbones, classical ML classifiers, and feature selection achieves 85.99% accuracy for fish freshness assessment, outperforming previous methods by 8.69-22.78%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional sensory evaluation of fish freshness is subjective, time-consuming, and inconsistent. While deep learning has automated visual freshness prediction, challenges remain in accuracy and feature transparency.

Method: Three-stage framework: 1) Fine-tune five vision architectures (ResNet-50, DenseNet-121, EfficientNet-B0, ConvNeXt-Base, Swin-Tiny), 2) Use multi-level deep features to train seven classical ML classifiers, 3) Apply feature selection methods (LGBM, Random Forest, Lasso) to identify compact feature subsets.

Result: Best configuration (Swin-Tiny features + Extra Trees classifier + LGBM feature selection) achieves 85.99% accuracy on FFE dataset, outperforming recent studies by 8.69-22.78%.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is effective and generalizable for visual quality evaluation tasks, demonstrating superior performance in fish freshness assessment.

Abstract: Assessing fish freshness is vital for ensuring food safety and minimizing
economic losses in the seafood industry. However, traditional sensory
evaluation remains subjective, time-consuming, and inconsistent. Although
recent advances in deep learning have automated visual freshness prediction,
challenges related to accuracy and feature transparency persist. This study
introduces a unified three-stage framework that refines and leverages deep
visual representations for reliable fish freshness assessment. First, five
state-of-the-art vision architectures - ResNet-50, DenseNet-121,
EfficientNet-B0, ConvNeXt-Base, and Swin-Tiny - are fine-tuned to establish a
strong baseline. Next, multi-level deep features extracted from these backbones
are used to train seven classical machine learning classifiers, integrating
deep and traditional decision mechanisms. Finally, feature selection methods
based on Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), Random Forest, and Lasso
identify a compact and informative subset of features. Experiments on the
Freshness of the Fish Eyes (FFE) dataset demonstrate that the best
configuration combining Swin-Tiny features, an Extra Trees classifier, and
LGBM-based feature selection achieves an accuracy of 85.99%, outperforming
recent studies on the same dataset by 8.69-22.78%. These findings confirm the
effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed framework for visual quality
evaluation tasks.

Motivation: Traditional video fake news detection benchmarks focus only on final accuracy, lacking fine-grained assessment of the detection process, making it a black box.

Method: Created MVFNDB benchmark with 10 tasks based on empirical analysis, and designed MVFND-CoT framework that incorporates both creator-added content and original shooting footage reasoning.

Result: The benchmark provides foundation for evaluating MLLMs' perception, understanding, and reasoning capacities in video fake news detection, with analysis of video processing strategies and feature-model alignment.

Conclusion: The MVFNDB benchmark lays solid foundation for future evaluations and advancements of MLLMs in video fake news detection domain.

Abstract: The advent of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) has greatly advanced
research into applications for Video fake news detection (VFND) tasks.
Traditional video-based FND benchmarks typically focus on the accuracy of the
final decision, often failing to provide fine-grained assessments for the
entire detection process, making the detection process a black box. Therefore,
we introduce the MVFNDB (Multi-modal Video Fake News Detection Benchmark) based
on the empirical analysis, which provides foundation for tasks definition. The
benchmark comprises 10 tasks and is meticulously crafted to probe MLLMs'
perception, understanding, and reasoning capacities during detection, featuring
9730 human-annotated video-related questions based on a carefully constructed
taxonomy ability of VFND. To validate the impact of combining multiple features
on the final results, we design a novel framework named MVFND-CoT, which
incorporates both creator-added content and original shooting footage
reasoning. Building upon the benchmark, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the
deeper factors influencing accuracy, including video processing strategies and
the alignment between video features and model capabilities. We believe this
benchmark will lay a solid foundation for future evaluations and advancements
of MLLMs in the domain of video fake news detection.

TL;DR: A multi-round safety editing framework for text-to-image models that addresses over-refusal and safety-utility imbalance through post-hoc editing using a specialized dataset and unified MLLM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety approaches for text-to-image models suffer from limitations like over-refusal and poor balance between safety and utility, especially inference-time methods that are widely used due to cost-effectiveness.

Method: Proposed MR-SafeEdit framework with multi-round image-text interleaved dataset, post-hoc safety editing paradigm mimicking human cognitive process, and SafeEditor - a unified MLLM for multi-round safety editing on generated images.

Result: Experimental results show SafeEditor surpasses prior safety approaches by reducing over-refusal while achieving better safety-utility balance.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-round safety editing framework provides an effective model-agnostic solution for text-to-image model safety alignment, addressing key limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) models, ensuring their
safety has become increasingly critical. Existing safety approaches can be
categorized into training-time and inference-time methods. While inference-time
methods are widely adopted due to their cost-effectiveness, they often suffer
from limitations such as over-refusal and imbalance between safety and utility.
To address these challenges, we propose a multi-round safety editing framework
that functions as a model-agnostic, plug-and-play module, enabling efficient
safety alignment for any text-to-image model. Central to this framework is
MR-SafeEdit, a multi-round image-text interleaved dataset specifically
constructed for safety editing in text-to-image generation. We introduce a
post-hoc safety editing paradigm that mirrors the human cognitive process of
identifying and refining unsafe content. To instantiate this paradigm, we
develop SafeEditor, a unified MLLM capable of multi-round safety editing on
generated images. Experimental results show that SafeEditor surpasses prior
safety approaches by reducing over-refusal while achieving a more favorable
safety-utility balance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal emotion recognition faces challenges due to differences between modalities and difficulty in characterizing unimodal emotional information, which hinders accurate emotion recognition for human-computer interaction.

Method: Uses adversarial autoencoders (AAE) for each modality to learn discriminative emotion features, then employs Cross-modal Gate Mechanism (CGMM) to reduce modality discrepancies and establish emotional relationships, followed by Feature Fusion module (FFM) for multimodal fusion.

Result: Experiments on SIMS and MOSI datasets demonstrate that MCIHN achieves superior performance in multimodal emotion recognition.

Conclusion: The proposed MCIHN model effectively addresses modality differences and improves emotion recognition accuracy through cross-modal interaction and feature fusion techniques.

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition is crucial for future human-computer
interaction. However, accurate emotion recognition still faces significant
challenges due to differences between different modalities and the difficulty
of characterizing unimodal emotional information. To solve these problems, a
hybrid network model based on multipath cross-modal interaction (MCIHN) is
proposed. First, adversarial autoencoders (AAE) are constructed separately for
each modality. The AAE learns discriminative emotion features and reconstructs
the features through a decoder to obtain more discriminative information about
the emotion classes. Then, the latent codes from the AAE of different
modalities are fed into a predefined Cross-modal Gate Mechanism model (CGMM) to
reduce the discrepancy between modalities, establish the emotional relationship
between interacting modalities, and generate the interaction features between
different modalities. Multimodal fusion using the Feature Fusion module (FFM)
for better emotion recognition. Experiments were conducted on publicly
available SIMS and MOSI datasets, demonstrating that MCIHN achieves superior
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow matching has achieved remarkable success but the factors influencing its generation quality remain poorly understood, motivating a systematic analysis of the generation process.

Method: Adopts a denoising perspective and designs a framework to empirically probe generation process, establishing formal connections between flow matching and denoisers, and using principled perturbations (noise and drift) to influence sample generation.

Result: Reveals distinct dynamical phases of the generative process and enables precise characterization of when denoisers succeed or fail during generation, providing new insights into the generation mechanism.

Conclusion: The denoising perspective provides a common ground to compare flow matching and denoisers, leading to better understanding of the generation process dynamics and failure modes.

Abstract: Flow matching has achieved remarkable success, yet the factors influencing
the quality of its generation process remain poorly understood. In this work,
we adopt a denoising perspective and design a framework to empirically probe
the generation process. Laying down the formal connections between flow
matching models and denoisers, we provide a common ground to compare their
performances on generation and denoising. This enables the design of principled
and controlled perturbations to influence sample generation: noise and drift.
This leads to new insights on the distinct dynamical phases of the generative
process, enabling us to precisely characterize at which stage of the generative
process denoisers succeed or fail and why this matters.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes reframing fruit maturity estimation from discrete classification to continuous probabilistic learning, introducing a probabilistic head to RT-DETRv2 for predicting continuous maturity distributions with uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning approaches treat maturity as discrete classification, which conflicts with the continuous nature of biological ripening, causing information loss and ambiguous class boundaries.

Method: Proposed architectural modification to RT-DETRv2 by adding a dedicated probabilistic head that predicts continuous distribution over maturity spectrum, learning mean maturity state and associated uncertainty.

Result: Achieved 85.6% mAP on challenging fruit dataset while providing richer maturity representation and maintaining exceptional detection performance.

Conclusion: Probabilistic approach offers more granular and accurate maturity assessments than classification-based methods, enabling uncertainty-aware automated systems in agriculture.

Abstract: Maturity estimation of fruits and vegetables is a critical task for
agricultural automation, directly impacting yield prediction and robotic
harvesting. Current deep learning approaches predominantly treat maturity as a
discrete classification problem (e.g., unripe, ripe, overripe). This rigid
formulation, however, fundamentally conflicts with the continuous nature of the
biological ripening process, leading to information loss and ambiguous class
boundaries. In this paper, we challenge this paradigm by reframing maturity
estimation as a continuous, probabilistic learning task. We propose a novel
architectural modification to the state-of-the-art, real-time object detector,
RT-DETRv2, by introducing a dedicated probabilistic head. This head enables the
model to predict a continuous distribution over the maturity spectrum for each
detected object, simultaneously learning the mean maturity state and its
associated uncertainty. This uncertainty measure is crucial for downstream
decision-making in robotics, providing a confidence score for tasks like
selective harvesting. Our model not only provides a far richer and more
biologically plausible representation of plant maturity but also maintains
exceptional detection performance, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP) of
85.6\% on a challenging, large-scale fruit dataset. We demonstrate through
extensive experiments that our probabilistic approach offers more granular and
accurate maturity assessments than its classification-based counterparts,
paving the way for more intelligent, uncertainty-aware automated systems in
modern agriculture

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper shows that careful selection of body landmarks combined with spline-based imputation enables efficient and accurate isolated sign recognition in Brazilian Sign Language (LIBRAS), achieving comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods while reducing processing time by over 5X.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous skeleton-based approaches using OpenPose for landmark extraction achieved good recognition performance but suffered from poor time performance. Simply replacing OpenPose with lightweight MediaPipe improved speed but significantly reduced accuracy, creating a need for optimization strategies.

Method: The authors explored landmark subset selection strategies to optimize recognition performance and used spline-based imputation to handle missing landmarks. This combined approach aimed to balance processing speed and accuracy.

Result: Experimental results showed that proper landmark subset selection achieves comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art methods while reducing processing time by more than 5X compared to previous work. Spline-based imputation also substantially improved accuracy by mitigating missing landmark issues.

Conclusion: Careful landmark selection combined with simple imputation techniques enables efficient and accurate isolated sign recognition, paving the way for scalable Sign Language Recognition systems.

Abstract: This paper investigates the feasibility of using lightweight body landmark
detection for the recognition of isolated signs in Brazilian Sign Language
(LIBRAS). Although the skeleton-based approach by Alves et al. (2024) enabled
substantial improvements in recognition performance, the use of OpenPose for
landmark extraction hindered time performance. In a preliminary investigation,
we observed that simply replacing OpenPose with the lightweight MediaPipe,
while improving processing speed, significantly reduced accuracy. To overcome
this limitation, we explored landmark subset selection strategies aimed at
optimizing recognition performance. Experimental results showed that a proper
landmark subset achieves comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art
methods while reducing processing time by more than 5X compared to Alves et al.
(2024). As an additional contribution, we demonstrated that spline-based
imputation effectively mitigates missing landmark issues, leading to
substantial accuracy gains. These findings highlight that careful landmark
selection, combined with simple imputation techniques, enables efficient and
accurate isolated sign recognition, paving the way for scalable Sign Language
Recognition systems.

Motivation: Traffic congestion is increasing in urban cities, causing delays and inefficiencies in transportation systems that need to be addressed.

Method: Analyze sequential camera frames to compute background by averaging pixel values, then extract foreground and apply DBSCAN algorithm for vehicle detection.

Result: The methodology offers computational efficiency and requires minimal infrastructure modifications.

Conclusion: The proposed vehicle detection approach provides a practical and scalable solution for real-world traffic optimization deployment.

Abstract: Traffic congestion is becoming a challenge in the rapidly growing urban
cities, resulting in increasing delays and inefficiencies within urban
transportation systems. To address this issue a comprehensive methodology is
designed to optimize traffic flow and minimize delays. The framework is
structured with three primary components: (a) vehicle detection, (b) traffic
prediction, and (c) traffic signal optimization. This paper presents the first
component, vehicle detection. The methodology involves analyzing multiple
sequential frames from a camera feed to compute the background, i.e. the
underlying roadway, by averaging pixel values over time. The computed
background is then utilized to extract the foreground, where the Density-Based
Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm is applied to
detect vehicles. With its computational efficiency and minimal infrastructure
modification requirements, the proposed methodology offers a practical and
scalable solution for real-world deployment.

TL;DR: VividCam enables diffusion models to learn complex camera motions from synthetic videos, overcoming the limitation of scarce training data for unconventional camera movements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-video models struggle with unconventional camera motions due to insufficient training data with rare camera movements in real videos.

Method: Uses synthetic videos from basic 3D geometries rendered in engines like Unity, with disentanglement strategies to isolate camera motion learning from synthetic appearance artifacts.

Result: Successfully synthesizes wide range of precisely controlled complex camera motions using simple synthetic data, demonstrating robust motion representation.

Conclusion: VividCam provides effective training paradigm that releases reliance on realistic training videos while enabling learning of complex camera motions from synthetic data.

Abstract: Although recent text-to-video generative models are getting more capable of
following external camera controls, imposed by either text descriptions or
camera trajectories, they still struggle to generalize to unconventional camera
motions, which is crucial in creating truly original and artistic videos. The
challenge lies in the difficulty of finding sufficient training videos with the
intended uncommon camera motions. To address this challenge, we propose
VividCam, a training paradigm that enables diffusion models to learn complex
camera motions from synthetic videos, releasing the reliance on collecting
realistic training videos. VividCam incorporates multiple disentanglement
strategies that isolates camera motion learning from synthetic appearance
artifacts, ensuring more robust motion representation and mitigating domain
shift. We demonstrate that our design synthesizes a wide range of precisely
controlled and complex camera motions using surprisingly simple synthetic data.
Notably, this synthetic data often consists of basic geometries within a
low-poly 3D scene and can be efficiently rendered by engines like Unity. Our
video results can be found in https://wuqiuche.github.io/VividCamDemoPage/ .

Motivation: Multi-view transformers have become black-box systems where the inner mechanisms are unclear, making improvements challenging and limiting their use in safety-critical applications. Understanding how these models work internally is crucial for further development.

Method: The authors probe and visualize 3D representations from the residual connections of multi-view transformers' layers, specifically analyzing a DUSt3R variant to study latent state development across blocks and layer roles.

Result: The analysis reveals how DUSt3R's latent state develops across transformer blocks, shows the role of individual layers, and demonstrates that the model estimates correspondences that are refined with reconstructed geometry rather than relying on explicit global pose estimation.

Conclusion: The proposed probing approach provides insights into multi-view transformers' inner workings, revealing how they differ from methods with stronger inductive biases and enabling better understanding of their 3D representation development process.

Abstract: Multi-view transformers such as DUSt3R are revolutionizing 3D vision by
solving 3D tasks in a feed-forward manner. However, contrary to previous
optimization-based pipelines, the inner mechanisms of multi-view transformers
are unclear. Their black-box nature makes further improvements beyond data
scaling challenging and complicates usage in safety- and reliability-critical
applications. Here, we present an approach for probing and visualizing 3D
representations from the residual connections of the multi-view transformers'
layers. In this manner, we investigate a variant of the DUSt3R model, shedding
light on the development of its latent state across blocks, the role of the
individual layers, and suggest how it differs from methods with stronger
inductive biases of explicit global pose. Finally, we show that the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In multimodal learning, dominant modalities often overshadow others, limiting generalization and overall performance.

Method: M-SAM operates in three steps: 1) Identifies dominant modality using Shapley values based on accuracy contributions, 2) Decomposes loss landscape by modulating loss to prioritize robustness for dominant modality, 3) Updates weights through backpropagation of modulated gradients.

Result: Extensive experiments on four diverse datasets show M-SAM outperforms state-of-the-art optimization and gradient manipulation methods, significantly balancing and improving multimodal learning.

Conclusion: M-SAM ensures robust learning for dominant modalities while enhancing contributions from others, allowing models to explore and exploit complementary features that strengthen overall performance.

Abstract: In multimodal learning, dominant modalities often overshadow others, limiting
generalization. We propose Modality-Aware Sharpness-Aware Minimization (M-SAM),
a model-agnostic framework that applies to many modalities and supports early
and late fusion scenarios. In every iteration, M-SAM in three steps optimizes
learning. \textbf{First, it identifies the dominant modality} based on
modalities' contribution in the accuracy using Shapley. \textbf{Second, it
decomposes the loss landscape}, or in another language, it modulates the loss
to prioritize the robustness of the model in favor of the dominant modality,
and \textbf{third, M-SAM updates the weights} by backpropagation of modulated
gradients. This ensures robust learning for the dominant modality while
enhancing contributions from others, allowing the model to explore and exploit
complementary features that strengthen overall performance. Extensive
experiments on four diverse datasets show that M-SAM outperforms the latest

Abstract: Pressure ulcers (PUs) are a serious and prevalent healthcare concern.
Accurate classification of PU severity (Stages I-IV) is essential for proper
treatment but remains challenging due to subtle visual distinctions and
subjective interpretation, leading to variability among clinicians. Prior

model), a fine-tuned multimodal large language model (MLLM) with an agentic
self-reflection mechanism for pressure ulcer severity classification. Inspired
by clinician-style diagnostic reassessment, FT-ARM iteratively refines its
predictions by reasoning over visual features and encoded clinical knowledge
from text, enhancing both accuracy and consistency. On the publicly available
Pressure Injury Image Dataset (PIID), FT-ARM, fine-tuned from LLaMA 3.2 90B,
achieved 85% accuracy in classifying PU stages I-IV, surpassing prior CNN-based
models by +4%. Unlike earlier CNN/ViT studies that relied solely on offline
evaluations, FT-ARM is designed and tested for live inference, reflecting
real-time deployment conditions. Furthermore, it produces clinically grounded
natural-language explanations, improving interpretability and trust. By
integrating fine-tuning and reflective reasoning across multimodal inputs,
FT-ARM advances the reliability, transparency, and clinical applicability of
automated wound assessment systems, addressing the critical need for consistent

Motivation: ALPR systems face challenges from environmental factors (lighting, rain, dust), high vehicle speeds, varying camera angles, and low-quality images. ALPR is crucial for traffic control, parking, vehicle tracking, toll collection, and law enforcement applications.

Method: Uses YOLOv8 for license plate detection and recognition in a semi-supervised learning framework. Combines small manually labeled datasets with pseudo-labels generated by Grounding DINO (vision-language model) to automatically annotate images with bounding boxes, reducing manual labeling effort.

Conclusion: The proposed deep learning strategy with YOLOv8 and semi-supervised learning using Grounding DINO effectively addresses ALPR challenges, achieving high performance while reducing manual annotation requirements through automated pseudo-label generation.

Abstract: Developing a highly accurate automatic license plate recognition system
(ALPR) is challenging due to environmental factors such as lighting, rain, and
dust. Additional difficulties include high vehicle speeds, varying camera
angles, and low-quality or low-resolution images. ALPR is vital in traffic
control, parking, vehicle tracking, toll collection, and law enforcement
applications. This paper proposes a deep learning strategy using YOLOv8 for
license plate detection and recognition tasks. This method seeks to enhance the
performance of the model using datasets from Ontario, Quebec, California, and
New York State. It achieved an impressive recall rate of 94% on the dataset
from the Center for Pattern Recognition and Machine Intelligence (CENPARMI) and
91% on the UFPR-ALPR dataset. In addition, our method follows a semi-supervised

Grounding DINO, a powerful vision-language model, automatically annotates many

Method: Synergistic combination of visual features from 2D mammograms with structured textual descriptors using innovative tokenization modules, integrating convolutional neural networks with language representations.

Result: Superior performance in cancer detection and calcification identification compared to unimodal baselines, with particular improvements across multi-national cohort screening mammograms.

Conclusion: Establishes a new paradigm for clinically viable VLM-based CAD systems that effectively leverage imaging data and contextual patient information through effective fusion mechanisms.

Abstract: Breast cancer remains the most commonly diagnosed malignancy among women in
the developed world. Early detection through mammography screening plays a
pivotal role in reducing mortality rates. While computer-aided diagnosis (CAD)
systems have shown promise in assisting radiologists, existing approaches face
critical limitations in clinical deployment - particularly in handling the
nuanced interpretation of multi-modal data and feasibility due to the
requirement of prior clinical history. This study introduces a novel framework
that synergistically combines visual features from 2D mammograms with
structured textual descriptors derived from easily accessible clinical metadata
and synthesized radiological reports through innovative tokenization modules.
Our proposed methods in this study demonstrate that strategic integration of
convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) with language representations achieves
superior performance to vision transformer-based models while handling
high-resolution images and enabling practical deployment across diverse
populations. By evaluating it on multi-national cohort screening mammograms,
our multi-modal approach achieves superior performance in cancer detection and
calcification identification compared to unimodal baselines, with particular
improvements. The proposed method establishes a new paradigm for developing
clinically viable VLM-based CAD systems that effectively leverage imaging data
and contextual patient information through effective fusion mechanisms.

TL;DR: DRIP reduces computation in vision-language models by dynamically merging tokens in deeper layers of visual encoders, maintaining performance while cutting GFLOPs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models require expensive large-scale pretraining, creating efficiency concerns that discourage researchers from training from scratch.

Method: Dynamic patch Reduction via Interpretable Pooling (DRIP) adapts to input images and dynamically merges tokens in deeper layers of visual encoders.

Result: Significant GFLOP reduction while maintaining comparable classification/zero-shot performance on ImageNet and CLIP pretraining; validated on large biology dataset.

Conclusion: DRIP provides an effective approach to reduce computational costs in vision-language model training without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Recently, the advances in vision-language models, including contrastive
pretraining and instruction tuning, have greatly pushed the frontier of
multimodal AI. However, owing to the large-scale and hence expensive
pretraining, the efficiency concern has discouraged researchers from attempting
to pretrain a vision language model from scratch. In this work, we propose
Dynamic patch Reduction via Interpretable Pooling (DRIP), which adapts to the
input images and dynamically merges tokens in the deeper layers of a visual
encoder. Our results on both ImageNet training from scratch and CLIP
contrastive pretraining demonstrate a significant GFLOP reduction while
maintaining comparable classification/zero-shot performance. To further
validate our proposed method, we conduct continual pretraining on a large
biology dataset, extending its impact into scientific domains.

Abstract: Zero-shot scene understanding in real-world settings presents major
challenges due to the complexity and variability of natural scenes, where
models must recognize new objects, actions, and contexts without prior labeled
examples. This work proposes a vision-language integration framework that
unifies pre-trained visual encoders (e.g., CLIP, ViT) and large language models

*Xiang liu,Zhaoxiang Liu,Huan Hu,Zipeng Wang,Ping Chen,Zezhou Chen,Kai Wang,Shiguo Lian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel per-subject-tuning-free (PSTF) method for personalized image generation that enables precise control over facial attributes while preserving facial identity, using face recognition features mapped to StyleGAN2's latent space and enhanced with a Triplet-Decoupled Cross-Attention module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with precise facial attribute control in PSTF approaches - tuning-based methods require technical expertise and additional data, while PSTF methods lack precise attribute control despite being user-friendly.

Method: Uses face recognition model to extract identity features, maps them to StyleGAN2's W+ latent space via e4e encoder, and integrates Triplet-Decoupled Cross-Attention module to separate identity and attribute information in UNet architecture.

Result: Achieves both precise facial attribute control and high-fidelity identity preservation without requiring fine-tuning or additional training data for individual identities, trained on FFHQ dataset.

Conclusion: Provides an efficient and user-friendly solution for high-quality facial image synthesis that successfully balances personalization with precise attribute control.

Abstract: Recent advancements in personalized image generation have significantly
improved facial identity preservation, particularly in fields such as
entertainment and social media. However, existing methods still struggle to
achieve precise control over facial attributes in a per-subject-tuning-free
(PSTF) way. Tuning-based techniques like PreciseControl have shown promise by
providing fine-grained control over facial features, but they often require
extensive technical expertise and additional training data, limiting their
accessibility. In contrast, PSTF approaches simplify the process by enabling
image generation from a single facial input, but they lack precise control over
facial attributes. In this paper, we introduce a novel, PSTF method that
enables both precise control over facial attributes and high-fidelity
preservation of facial identity. Our approach utilizes a face recognition model
to extract facial identity features, which are then mapped into the $W^+$
latent space of StyleGAN2 using the e4e encoder. We further enhance the model
with a Triplet-Decoupled Cross-Attention module, which integrates facial
identity, attribute features, and text embeddings into the UNet architecture,
ensuring clean separation of identity and attribute information. Trained on the
FFHQ dataset, our method allows for the generation of personalized images with
fine-grained control over facial attributes, while without requiring additional
fine-tuning or training data for individual identities. We demonstrate that our
approach successfully balances personalization with precise facial attribute
control, offering a more efficient and user-friendly solution for high-quality,
adaptable facial image synthesis. The code is publicly available at

### [35] [Visual Diversity and Region-aware Prompt Learning for Zero-shot HOI Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25094)
*Chanhyeong Yang,Taehoon Song,Jihwan Park,Hyunwoo J. Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VDRP is a framework for zero-shot human-object interaction detection that addresses visual complexity through visual diversity-aware prompt learning and region-aware concepts to handle intra-class diversity and inter-class visual entanglement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches using CLIP-based prompt learning fail to handle the visual complexity of interactions, including intra-class visual diversity (same verb appearing in diverse poses/contexts) and inter-class visual entanglement (different verbs having visually similar patterns).

Method: Proposes VDRP with two key components: (1) Visual diversity-aware prompt learning that injects group-wise visual variance into context embeddings and applies Gaussian perturbation to capture diverse visual variations, (2) Region-aware prompts that retrieve concepts from human, object, and union regions to augment diversity-aware embeddings for better verb discrimination.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on HICO-DET benchmark under four zero-shot evaluation settings, effectively addressing both intra-class diversity and inter-class visual entanglement.

Conclusion: VDRP successfully handles the visual complexity challenges in zero-shot human-object interaction detection through its novel visual diversity and region-aware prompt learning approach.

Abstract: Zero-shot Human-Object Interaction detection aims to localize humans and
objects in an image and recognize their interaction, even when specific
verb-object pairs are unseen during training. Recent works have shown promising
results using prompt learning with pretrained vision-language models such as
CLIP, which align natural language prompts with visual features in a shared
embedding space. However, existing approaches still fail to handle the visual
complexity of interaction, including (1) intra-class visual diversity, where
instances of the same verb appear in diverse poses and contexts, and (2)
inter-class visual entanglement, where distinct verbs yield visually similar
patterns. To address these challenges, we propose VDRP, a framework for Visual
Diversity and Region-aware Prompt learning. First, we introduce a visual
diversity-aware prompt learning strategy that injects group-wise visual
variance into the context embedding. We further apply Gaussian perturbation to
encourage the prompts to capture diverse visual variations of a verb. Second,
we retrieve region-specific concepts from the human, object, and union regions.
These are used to augment the diversity-aware prompt embeddings, yielding
region-aware prompts that enhance verb-level discrimination. Experiments on the
HICO-DET benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance under four zero-shot evaluation settings, effectively addressing
both intra-class diversity and inter-class visual entanglement. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Atlanta-world guided implicit-structured Gaussian Splatting for smooth indoor/urban 3D reconstruction that preserves details and efficiency while handling low-texture regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing geometric priors lack global consistency for low-texture regions, and Gaussian Splatting/SDF methods suffer from discontinuities or inefficiencies, causing detail loss.

Method: Combines Atlanta-world model for accurate surface reconstruction in low-texture areas with novel implicit-structured Gaussian Splatting representations, including semantic GS representation and structure plane regularization with learnable plane indicators.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both indoor and urban scenes, delivering superior surface reconstruction quality.

Conclusion: The proposed method achieves smooth reconstruction while preserving high-frequency details and rendering efficiency, addressing key limitations in existing 3D reconstruction approaches.

Abstract: 3D reconstruction of indoor and urban environments is a prominent research
topic with various downstream applications. However, existing geometric priors
for addressing low-texture regions in indoor and urban settings often lack
global consistency. Moreover, Gaussian Splatting and implicit SDF fields often
suffer from discontinuities or exhibit computational inefficiencies, resulting
in a loss of detail. To address these issues, we propose an Atlanta-world
guided implicit-structured Gaussian Splatting that achieves smooth indoor and
urban scene reconstruction while preserving high-frequency details and
rendering efficiency. By leveraging the Atlanta-world model, we ensure the
accurate surface reconstruction for low-texture regions, while the proposed
novel implicit-structured GS representations provide smoothness without
sacrificing efficiency and high-frequency details. Specifically, we propose a
semantic GS representation to predict the probability of all semantic regions
and deploy a structure plane regularization with learnable plane indicators for
global accurate surface reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both indoor and urban
scenes, delivering superior surface reconstruction quality.

*Qingdong Cai,Charith Abhayaratne*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Region-CAM is a novel activation method that improves upon conventional CAM by generating more complete object coverage and better boundary alignment through semantic information maps and propagation using gradients and features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional CAM methods only highlight the most discriminative regions, failing to cover entire objects and misaligning with object boundaries, which limits performance in weakly supervised learning tasks like semantic segmentation.

Method: Region-CAM extracts semantic information maps (SIMs) and performs semantic information propagation (SIP) using both gradients and features from all stages of the baseline classification model, rather than just network feature weighting.

Result: Achieves 60.12% mIoU on PASCAL VOC training (13.61% improvement over CAM) and 58.43% on validation (13.13% improvement). On MS COCO: 36.38% mIoU (16.23% improvement). On ILSVRC2012: 51.7% Top-1 Localization accuracy, 4.5% better than LayerCAM.

Conclusion: Region-CAM significantly outperforms conventional CAM methods by providing more complete object coverage and precise boundary alignment, making it highly effective for weakly supervised learning tasks.

Abstract: Class Activation Mapping (CAM) methods are widely applied in weakly
supervised learning tasks due to their ability to highlight object regions.
However, conventional CAM methods highlight only the most discriminative
regions of the target. These highlighted regions often fail to cover the entire
object and are frequently misaligned with object boundaries, thereby limiting
the performance of downstream weakly supervised learning tasks, particularly
Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS), which demands pixel-wise
accurate activation maps to get the best results. To alleviate the above
problems, we propose a novel activation method, Region-CAM. Distinct from
network feature weighting approaches, Region-CAM generates activation maps by
extracting semantic information maps (SIMs) and performing semantic information
propagation (SIP) by considering both gradients and features in each of the
stages of the baseline classification model. Our approach highlights a greater
proportion of object regions while ensuring activation maps to have precise
boundaries that align closely with object edges. Region-CAM achieves 60.12% and
58.43% mean intersection over union (mIoU) using the baseline model on the
PASCAL VOC training and validation datasets, respectively, which are
improvements of 13.61% and 13.13% over the original CAM (46.51% and 45.30%). On
the MS COCO validation set, Region-CAM achieves 36.38%, a 16.23% improvement
over the original CAM (20.15%). We also demonstrate the superiority of
Region-CAM in object localization tasks, using the ILSVRC2012 validation set.
Region-CAM achieves 51.7% in Top-1 Localization accuracy Loc1. Compared with
LayerCAM, an activation method designed for weakly supervised object
localization, Region-CAM achieves 4.5% better performance in Loc1.

Result: Substantial improvements across datasets: Tunnel Segment Crack detection (+12.4%), Construction PPE (+13.7%), KITTI (+88.6%), with real-time inference (30-47 FPS) and 2-4x inference overhead.

Conclusion: DINO-YOLO establishes state-of-the-art performance for civil engineering datasets with limited data while preserving computational efficiency for practical field deployment.

Abstract: Object detection in civil engineering applications is constrained by limited
annotated data in specialized domains. We introduce DINO-YOLO, a hybrid
architecture combining YOLOv12 with DINOv3 self-supervised vision transformers
for data-efficient detection. DINOv3 features are strategically integrated at
two locations: input preprocessing (P0) and mid-backbone enhancement (P3).
Experimental validation demonstrates substantial improvements: Tunnel Segment
Crack detection (648 images) achieves 12.4% improvement, Construction PPE (1K
images) gains 13.7%, and KITTI (7K images) shows 88.6% improvement, while
maintaining real-time inference (30-47 FPS). Systematic ablation across five
YOLO scales and nine DINOv3 variants reveals that Medium-scale architectures
achieve optimal performance with DualP0P3 integration (55.77% mAP@0.5), while
Small-scale requires Triple Integration (53.63%). The 2-4x inference overhead
(21-33ms versus 8-16ms baseline) remains acceptable for field deployment on
NVIDIA RTX 5090. DINO-YOLO establishes state-of-the-art performance for civil

TL;DR: The paper introduces ReGap, a training-free method for detecting AI-generated images by computing dynamic reconstruction error through controlled editing operations, outperforming existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reconstruction-based methods for detecting AI-generated images lack theoretical foundations and rely on empirical heuristics, limiting interpretability and reliability. They often fail when real images show lower error than generated ones, requiring data-specific threshold tuning.

Method: Proposes ReGap which computes dynamic reconstruction error by leveraging structured editing operations to introduce controlled perturbations, measuring error changes before and after editing to enhance detection accuracy.

Result: Experimental results show ReGap outperforms existing baselines, exhibits robustness to common post-processing operations, and generalizes effectively across diverse conditions.

Conclusion: The method provides a more reliable and interpretable approach for AI-generated image detection by addressing limitations of static reconstruction error methods through dynamic error measurement.

Abstract: The rise of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made detecting
AI-generated images a critical challenge for ensuring authenticity. Existing
reconstruction-based methods lack theoretical foundations and on empirical
heuristics, limiting interpretability and reliability. In this paper, we
introduce the Jacobian-Spectral Lower Bound for reconstruction error from a
geometric perspective, showing that real images off the reconstruction manifold
exhibit a non-trivial error lower bound, while generated images on the manifold
have near-zero error. Furthermore, we reveal the limitations of existing
methods that rely on static reconstruction error from a single pass. These
methods often fail when some real images exhibit lower error than generated
ones. This counterintuitive behavior reduces detection accuracy and requires
data-specific threshold tuning, limiting their applicability in real-world
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose ReGap, a training-free
method that computes dynamic reconstruction error by leveraging structured
editing operations to introduce controlled perturbations. This enables
measuring error changes before and after editing, improving detection accuracy
by enhancing error separation. Experimental results show that our method
outperforms existing baselines, exhibits robustness to common post-processing
operations and generalizes effectively across diverse conditions.

Abstract: Current 3D scene understanding methods are limited by offline-collected
multi-view data or pre-constructed 3D geometry. In this paper, we present
ExtractAnything3D (EA3D), a unified online framework for open-world 3D object
extraction that enables simultaneous geometric reconstruction and holistic
scene understanding. Given a streaming video, EA3D dynamically interprets each

object-level knowledge. This knowledge is integrated and embedded into a
Gaussian feature map via a feed-forward online update strategy. We then
iteratively estimate visual odometry from historical frames and incrementally
update online Gaussian features with new observations. A recurrent joint
optimization module directs the model's attention to regions of interest,
simultaneously enhancing both geometric reconstruction and semantic
understanding. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and tasks,
including photo-realistic rendering, semantic and instance segmentation, 3D

TL;DR: A vision transformer-based approach for real-time inference of thin liquid film thickness profiles from interferograms, enabling automated thickness reconstruction for clinical applications like dry eye disease diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical translation of thin film interferometry is hindered by challenges in reconstructing thickness profiles from interference patterns - an ill-posed inverse problem complicated by phase periodicity, imaging noise, and ambient artifacts. Traditional methods are computationally intensive, noise-sensitive, or require manual expert analysis.

Method: Vision transformer-based approach trained on hybrid dataset combining physiologically-relevant synthetic and experimental tear film data. Leverages long-range spatial correlations to resolve phase ambiguities and reconstruct temporally coherent thickness profiles in a single forward pass from dynamic interferograms.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on noisy, rapidly-evolving films with motion artifacts, overcoming limitations of conventional phase-unwrapping and iterative fitting methods. Enables automated, consistent thickness reconstruction at real-time speeds on consumer hardware.

Conclusion: The data-driven approach opens new possibilities for continuous monitoring of pre-lens ocular tear films and non-invasive diagnosis of conditions such as dry eye disease, providing a practical solution for clinical translation of thin film interferometry.

Abstract: Thin film interferometry is a powerful technique for non-invasively measuring
liquid film thickness with applications in ophthalmology, but its clinical
translation is hindered by the challenges in reconstructing thickness profiles
from interference patterns - an ill-posed inverse problem complicated by phase
periodicity, imaging noise and ambient artifacts. Traditional reconstruction
methods are either computationally intensive, sensitive to noise, or require
manual expert analysis, which is impractical for real-time diagnostics. To
address this challenge, here we present a vision transformer-based approach for
real-time inference of thin liquid film thickness profiles directly from
isolated interferograms. Trained on a hybrid dataset combining
physiologically-relevant synthetic and experimental tear film data, our model
leverages long-range spatial correlations to resolve phase ambiguities and
reconstruct temporally coherent thickness profiles in a single forward pass
from dynamic interferograms acquired in vivo and ex vivo. The network
demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on noisy, rapidly-evolving films with
motion artifacts, overcoming limitations of conventional phase-unwrapping and
iterative fitting methods. Our data-driven approach enables automated,
consistent thickness reconstruction at real-time speeds on consumer hardware,
opening new possibilities for continuous monitoring of pre-lens ocular tear
films and non-invasive diagnosis of conditions such as the dry eye disease.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TGBFN is a novel framework for quantitatively constrained CAD generation that handles multi-modal CAD sequences in a unified continuous parameter space using guided Bayesian flow networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative models lag in generating multi-modal data like parametric CAD sequences due to challenges with long-range constraints and parameter sensitivity.

Method: TGBFN handles discrete commands and continuous parameters in a unified continuous space, introduces guided Bayesian flow to control CAD properties, and constructs a new dataset for evaluation.

Result: TGBFN achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating high-fidelity, condition-aware CAD sequences across single-condition and multi-condition constrained generation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed TGBFN framework successfully addresses the challenges of multi-modal CAD generation and demonstrates superior performance in constrained generation tasks.

Abstract: Deep generative models, such as diffusion models, have shown promising
progress in image generation and audio generation via simplified continuity
assumptions. However, the development of generative modeling techniques for
generating multi-modal data, such as parametric CAD sequences, still lags
behind due to the challenges in addressing long-range constraints and parameter
sensitivity. In this work, we propose a novel framework for quantitatively
constrained CAD generation, termed Target-Guided Bayesian Flow Network (TGBFN).
For the first time, TGBFN handles the multi-modality of CAD sequences (i.e.,
discrete commands and continuous parameters) in a unified continuous and
differentiable parameter space rather than in the discrete data space. In
addition, TGBFN penetrates the parameter update kernel and introduces a guided
Bayesian flow to control the CAD properties. To evaluate TGBFN, we construct a
new dataset for quantitatively constrained CAD generation. Extensive
comparisons across single-condition and multi-condition constrained generation
tasks demonstrate that TGBFN achieves state-of-the-art performance in
generating high-fidelity, condition-aware CAD sequences. The code is available

### [44] [$D^2GS$: Dense Depth Regularization for LiDAR-free Urban Scene Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25173)
*Kejing Xia,Jidong Jia,Ke Jin,Yucai Bai,Li Sun,Dacheng Tao,Youjian Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DÂ²GS is a LiDAR-free urban scene reconstruction framework that uses multi-view depth predictions and diffusion priors to achieve geometry comparable to LiDAR-based methods, eliminating the need for precise sensor calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current urban scene reconstruction methods rely on multimodal sensors (LiDAR + images), which face challenges with precise spatiotemporal calibration and spatial misalignment. Acquiring accurate LiDAR data is difficult in practice.

Method: 1) Initialize dense point cloud from multi-view metric depth predictions with Progressive Pruning for global consistency. 2) Jointly refine Gaussian geometry and depth via Depth Enhancer using diffusion priors. 3) Improve ground geometry by constraining Gaussian shape/normal attributes in road regions.

Result: Extensive experiments on Waymo dataset show the method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, producing more accurate geometry even compared to methods using ground-truth LiDAR data.

Conclusion: DÂ²GS successfully achieves LiDAR-free urban scene reconstruction with geometry quality comparable to LiDAR-based approaches, overcoming practical limitations of multimodal sensor systems.

Abstract: Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has shown great potential for urban scene
reconstruction in the field of autonomous driving. However, current urban scene
reconstruction methods often depend on multimodal sensors as inputs,
\textit{i.e.} LiDAR and images. Though the geometry prior provided by LiDAR
point clouds can largely mitigate ill-posedness in reconstruction, acquiring
such accurate LiDAR data is still challenging in practice: i) precise
spatiotemporal calibration between LiDAR and other sensors is required, as they
may not capture data simultaneously; ii) reprojection errors arise from spatial
misalignment when LiDAR and cameras are mounted at different locations. To
avoid the difficulty of acquiring accurate LiDAR depth, we propose $D^2GS$, a
LiDAR-free urban scene reconstruction framework. In this work, we obtain
geometry priors that are as effective as LiDAR while being denser and more
accurate. $\textbf{First}$, we initialize a dense point cloud by
back-projecting multi-view metric depth predictions. This point cloud is then
optimized by a Progressive Pruning strategy to improve the global consistency.
$\textbf{Second}$, we jointly refine Gaussian geometry and predicted dense
metric depth via a Depth Enhancer. Specifically, we leverage diffusion priors
from a depth foundation model to enhance the depth maps rendered by Gaussians.
In turn, the enhanced depths provide stronger geometric constraints during
Gaussian training. $\textbf{Finally}$, we improve the accuracy of ground
geometry by constraining the shape and normal attributes of Gaussians within
road regions. Extensive experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, producing more
accurate geometry even when compared with those using ground-truth LiDAR data.

### [45] [Classifier Enhancement Using Extended Context and Domain Experts for Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25174)
*Huadong Tang,Youpeng Zhao,Min Xu,Jun Wang,Qiang Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an Extended Context-Aware Classifier (ECAC) that dynamically adjusts semantic segmentation classifiers using both global dataset-level and local image-level contextual information to address class imbalance and improve pixel-level labeling accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional semantic segmentation methods use fixed-parameter classifiers that cannot adapt to individual image characteristics and suffer from class imbalance bias, limiting effectiveness for minority classes.

Method: ECAC uses a memory bank to learn dataset-level contextual information and incorporates image-specific context. It employs a teacher-student network where the teacher dynamically adjusts contextual information using ground truth and transfers knowledge to the student.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on ADE20K, COCO-Stuff10K, and Pascal-Context datasets.

Conclusion: Dynamic context-aware classifiers that combine global and local contextual information significantly improve semantic segmentation performance, especially for handling class imbalance and adapting to individual image characteristics.

Abstract: Prevalent semantic segmentation methods generally adopt a vanilla classifier
to categorize each pixel into specific classes.
  Although such a classifier learns global information from the training data,
this information is represented by a set of fixed parameters (weights and
biases).
  However, each image has a different class distribution, which prevents the
classifier from addressing the unique characteristics of individual images.
  At the dataset level, class imbalance leads to segmentation results being
biased towards majority classes, limiting the model's effectiveness in
identifying and segmenting minority class regions.
  In this paper, we propose an Extended Context-Aware Classifier (ECAC) that
dynamically adjusts the classifier using global (dataset-level) and local
(image-level) contextual information.
  Specifically, we leverage a memory bank to learn dataset-level contextual
information of each class, incorporating the class-specific contextual
information from the current image to improve the classifier for precise pixel
labeling.
  Additionally, a teacher-student network paradigm is adopted, where the domain
expert (teacher network) dynamically adjusts contextual information with ground
truth and transfers knowledge to the student network.
  Comprehensive experiments illustrate that the proposed ECAC can achieve
state-of-the-art performance across several datasets, including ADE20K,
COCO-Stuff10K, and Pascal-Context.

*Yingjie Gao,Yanan Zhang,Zhi Cai,Di Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A foundation model-powered test-time adaptive object detection method that eliminates source data dependency and overcomes closed-set limitations through multi-modal prompt tuning and instance dynamic memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time adaptive object detection methods heavily rely on source data and assume identical category spaces between source and target domains, which limits real-world applicability.

Method: Multi-modal Prompt-based Mean-Teacher framework with text and visual prompt tuning, Test-time Warm-start strategy for visual prompts, and Instance Dynamic Memory module with Memory Enhancement and Memory Hallucination strategies.

Result: Extensive experiments show consistent outperformance over state-of-the-art methods on cross-corruption and cross-dataset benchmarks, with ability to adapt to arbitrary cross-domain and cross-category target data.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully eliminates source data dependency while maintaining strong adaptation performance across diverse domain shifts and category spaces.

Abstract: In recent years, test-time adaptive object detection has attracted increasing
attention due to its unique advantages in online domain adaptation, which
aligns more closely with real-world application scenarios. However, existing
approaches heavily rely on source-derived statistical characteristics while
making the strong assumption that the source and target domains share an
identical category space. In this paper, we propose the first foundation
model-powered test-time adaptive object detection method that eliminates the
need for source data entirely and overcomes traditional closed-set limitations.
Specifically, we design a Multi-modal Prompt-based Mean-Teacher framework for
vision-language detector-driven test-time adaptation, which incorporates text
and visual prompt tuning to adapt both language and vision representation
spaces on the test data in a parameter-efficient manner. Correspondingly, we
propose a Test-time Warm-start strategy tailored for the visual prompts to
effectively preserve the representation capability of the vision branch.
Furthermore, to guarantee high-quality pseudo-labels in every test batch, we
maintain an Instance Dynamic Memory (IDM) module that stores high-quality
pseudo-labels from previous test samples, and propose two novel
strategies-Memory Enhancement and Memory Hallucination-to leverage IDM's
high-quality instances for enhancing original predictions and hallucinating
images without available pseudo-labels, respectively. Extensive experiments on
cross-corruption and cross-dataset benchmarks demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, and can adapt to
arbitrary cross-domain and cross-category target data. Code is available at

against students' face databases is performed, effectively ascertaining the
identity of each student.

### [49] [U-CAN: Unsupervised Point Cloud Denoising with Consistency-Aware Noise2Noise Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25210)
*Junsheng Zhou,Xingyu Shi,Haichuan Song,Yi Fang,Yu-Shen Liu,Zhizhong Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: U-CAN is an unsupervised framework for point cloud denoising using consistency-aware Noise2Noise matching, achieving comparable results to supervised methods without requiring clean-noisy training pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point clouds from scanning sensors often contain noise that negatively impacts downstream tasks. Previous supervised methods require extensive manual effort to create noisy-clean pairs for training.

Method: U-CAN uses a neural network to infer multi-step denoising paths with Noise2Noise matching, employing a novel loss for statistical reasoning on multiple noisy observations and a consistency constraint on denoised geometry.

Result: U-CAN shows significant improvement over state-of-the-art unsupervised methods and produces comparable results with supervised methods in point cloud denoising, upsampling, and image denoising benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed unsupervised framework effectively denoises point clouds without requiring clean training data, and the consistency constraint is generalizable beyond 3D to 2D image denoising.

Abstract: Point clouds captured by scanning sensors are often perturbed by noise, which
have a highly negative impact on downstream tasks (e.g. surface reconstruction
and shape understanding). Previous works mostly focus on training neural
networks with noisy-clean point cloud pairs for learning denoising priors,
which requires extensively manual efforts. In this work, we introduce U-CAN, an
Unsupervised framework for point cloud denoising with Consistency-Aware
Noise2Noise matching. Specifically, we leverage a neural network to infer a
multi-step denoising path for each point of a shape or scene with a noise to
noise matching scheme. We achieve this by a novel loss which enables
statistical reasoning on multiple noisy point cloud observations. We further
introduce a novel constraint on the denoised geometry consistency for learning
consistency-aware denoising patterns. We justify that the proposed constraint
is a general term which is not limited to 3D domain and can also contribute to
the area of 2D image denoising. Our evaluations under the widely used
benchmarks in point cloud denoising, upsampling and image denoising show
significant improvement over the state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, where
U-CAN also produces comparable results with the supervised methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSF-Net is a novel photometric stereo framework that extracts multi-stage features with selective update strategy and feature fusion to improve surface normal estimation accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on DiLiGenT benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning-based photometric stereo methods fail to capture features at multiple stages and lack adequate interaction between features, leading to redundant feature extraction especially in detailed areas like wrinkles and edges.

Method: Proposed MSF-Net with multi-stage feature extraction, selective update strategy to extract high-quality features, and feature fusion module to improve interaction between different features for accurate normal construction.

Result: Experimental results on DiLiGenT benchmark show MSF-Net significantly surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods in surface normal estimation accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed MSF-Net framework effectively addresses limitations in existing photometric stereo methods by enabling better multi-stage feature extraction and interaction, leading to improved performance in surface normal estimation.

Abstract: Photometric stereo is a technique aimed at determining surface normals
through the utilization of shading cues derived from images taken under
different lighting conditions. However, existing learning-based approaches
often fail to accurately capture features at multiple stages and do not
adequately promote interaction between these features. Consequently, these
models tend to extract redundant features, especially in areas with intricate
details such as wrinkles and edges. To tackle these issues, we propose MSF-Net,
a novel framework for extracting information at multiple stages, paired with
selective update strategy, aiming to extract high-quality feature information,
which is critical for accurate normal construction. Additionally, we have
developed a feature fusion module to improve the interplay among different
features. Experimental results on the DiLiGenT benchmark show that our proposed
MSF-Net significantly surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods in the
accuracy of surface normal estimation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new Source-Free Domain Adaptation framework for medical image segmentation that uses hard sample selection and denoised patch mixing to progressively align target distributions under privacy constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SFDA approaches often ignore sample difficulty and struggle with noisy supervision under domain shift, which is particularly problematic for medical image segmentation where accuracy is critical.

Method: Partitions unlabeled images into reliable/unreliable subsets via entropy-similarity analysis, refines pseudo-labels using Monte Carlo-based denoising masks, and employs intra- and inter-domain patch mixing objectives to transfer reliable semantics while mitigating noise.

Result: Consistent gains over prior SFDA and UDA methods on benchmark datasets, with more accurate boundary delineation and state-of-the-art Dice and ASSD scores.

Conclusion: Progressive adaptation and denoised supervision are crucial for robust medical image segmentation under domain shift in privacy-constrained settings.

Abstract: Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) is emerging as a compelling solution for
medical image segmentation under privacy constraints, yet current approaches
often ignore sample difficulty and struggle with noisy supervision under domain
shift. We present a new SFDA framework that leverages Hard Sample Selection and
Denoised Patch Mixing to progressively align target distributions. First,
unlabeled images are partitioned into reliable and unreliable subsets through
entropy-similarity analysis, allowing adaptation to start from easy samples and
gradually incorporate harder ones. Next, pseudo-labels are refined via Monte
Carlo-based denoising masks, which suppress unreliable pixels and stabilize
training. Finally, intra- and inter-domain objectives mix patches between
subsets, transferring reliable semantics while mitigating noise. Experiments on
benchmark datasets show consistent gains over prior SFDA and UDA methods,
delivering more accurate boundary delineation and achieving state-of-the-art
Dice and ASSD scores. Our study highlights the importance of progressive
adaptation and denoised supervision for robust segmentation under domain shift.

### [52] [Balanced conic rectified flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25229)
*Kim Shin Seong,Mingi Kwon,Jaeseok Jeong,Youngjung Uh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an improved rectified flow method that incorporates real images into training to reduce computational costs and bias issues in the original rectified flow approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rectified flow faces challenges: 1) reflow requires many generative pairs (high computational cost), 2) performance depends heavily on 1-rectified flow model, causing bias toward generated data.

Method: Incorporates real images into training process, preserves ODE paths for real images, uses smaller set of generated and real images for efficient reflow.

Result: Achieved significantly better FID scores on CIFAR-10 in both one-step and full-step generation, using only fraction of generative pairs compared to original method. Induces straighter paths and avoids saturation on generated images.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enables more robust ODE learning while preserving real image distribution, effectively reducing reliance on large generated datasets.

Abstract: Rectified flow is a generative model that learns smooth transport mappings
between two distributions through an ordinary differential equation (ODE).
Unlike diffusion-based generative models, which require costly numerical
integration of a generative ODE to sample images with state-of-the-art quality,
rectified flow uses an iterative process called reflow to learn smooth and
straight ODE paths. This allows for relatively simple and efficient generation
of high-quality images. However, rectified flow still faces several challenges.
1) The reflow process requires a large number of generative pairs to preserve
the target distribution, leading to significant computational costs. 2) Since
the model is typically trained using only generated image pairs, its
performance heavily depends on the 1-rectified flow model, causing it to become
biased towards the generated data.
  In this work, we experimentally expose the limitations of the original
rectified flow and propose a novel approach that incorporates real images into
the training process. By preserving the ODE paths for real images, our method
effectively reduces reliance on large amounts of generated data. Instead, we
demonstrate that the reflow process can be conducted efficiently using a much
smaller set of generated and real images. In CIFAR-10, we achieved
significantly better FID scores, not only in one-step generation but also in
full-step simulations, while using only of the generative pairs compared to the
original method. Furthermore, our approach induces straighter paths and avoids
saturation on generated images during reflow, leading to more robust ODE
learning while preserving the distribution of real images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for generating emotionally expressive 3D talking faces by modeling facial animation as a linear additive problem using speech and emotion blendshapes, achieving superior emotional expressivity while maintaining accurate lip synchronization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Realistic and expressive 3D facial animation is crucial for AIGC, but generating emotionally expressive talking faces remains challenging due to the scarcity of real emotional 3D talking-face datasets and high data capture costs.

Method: Model facial animation as a linear additive problem using speech and emotion blendshapes. Use VOCAset (neutral expressions) and Florence4D (3D expression sequences) to jointly learn blendshapes with sparsity constraint loss for disentanglement. Map learned blendshapes to FLAME model parameters for 3D Gaussian avatar animation.

Result: Qualitative and quantitative experiments show natural generation of talking faces with specified expressions while maintaining accurate lip synchronization. Perceptual studies demonstrate superior emotional expressivity compared to existing methods without compromising lip-sync quality.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully generates emotionally expressive 3D talking faces by disentangling speech and emotion blendshapes, achieving both high emotional expressivity and accurate lip synchronization.

Abstract: Expressions are fundamental to conveying human emotions. With the rapid
advancement of AI-generated content (AIGC), realistic and expressive 3D facial
animation has become increasingly crucial. Despite recent progress in
speech-driven lip-sync for talking-face animation, generating emotionally
expressive talking faces remains underexplored. A major obstacle is the
scarcity of real emotional 3D talking-face datasets due to the high cost of
data capture. To address this, we model facial animation driven by both speech
and emotion as a linear additive problem. Leveraging a 3D talking-face dataset
with neutral expressions (VOCAset) and a dataset of 3D expression sequences
(Florence4D), we jointly learn a set of blendshapes driven by speech and
emotion. We introduce a sparsity constraint loss to encourage disentanglement
between the two types of blendshapes while allowing the model to capture
inherent secondary cross-domain deformations present in the training data. The
learned blendshapes can be further mapped to the expression and jaw pose
parameters of the FLAME model, enabling the animation of 3D Gaussian avatars.
Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method naturally
generates talking faces with specified expressions while maintaining accurate
lip synchronization. Perceptual studies further show that our approach achieves
superior emotional expressivity compared to existing methods, without
compromising lip-sync quality.

Motivation: Existing deepfake detectors perform well in in-domain scenarios but fail to generalize across diverse manipulation techniques due to reliance on forgery-specific artifacts, raising concerns about misuse for fraud and misinformation.

Method: Enhances CLIP-ViT encoder with two components: Local Patch Guidance (spatiotemporal artifact modeling with patch-wise supervision) and Global Forgery Diversification (domain feature augmentation using domain-bridging and boundary-expanding feature generation).

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross-dataset and cross-manipulation evaluations, achieving superior robustness against unseen deepfake attacks.

Conclusion: DeepShield demonstrates that integrating novel local and global analysis approaches significantly improves deepfake detection robustness across diverse manipulation techniques.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep generative models have made it easier to manipulate

fraud and misinformation. Existing detectors often perform well in in-domain
scenarios but fail to generalize across diverse manipulation techniques due to
their reliance on forgery-specific artifacts. In this work, we introduce
DeepShield, a novel deepfake detection framework that balances local
sensitivity and global generalization to improve robustness across unseen
forgeries. DeepShield enhances the CLIP-ViT encoder through two key components:
Local Patch Guidance (LPG) and Global Forgery Diversification (GFD). LPG
applies spatiotemporal artifact modeling and patch-wise supervision to capture
fine-grained inconsistencies often overlooked by global models. GFD introduces
domain feature augmentation, leveraging domain-bridging and boundary-expanding
feature generation to synthesize diverse forgeries, mitigating overfitting and
enhancing cross-domain adaptability. Through the integration of novel local and
global analysis for deepfake detection, DeepShield outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in cross-dataset and cross-manipulation evaluations, achieving superior
robustness against unseen deepfake attacks.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates deep learning models for classifying Trees Outside Forests (TOF) using high-resolution aerial imagery from German agricultural landscapes, comparing six semantic segmentation architectures to map four woody vegetation categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most studies treat TOF as a single class or use rigid rule-based thresholds, limiting ecological interpretation and adaptability across regions. The research aims to improve TOF classification using deep learning approaches.

Method: Used deep learning with high-resolution aerial imagery from four agricultural landscapes in Germany. Compared convolutional neural networks (CNNs), vision transformers, and hybrid CNN-transformer models across six semantic segmentation architectures (ABCNet, LSKNet, FT-UNetFormer, DC-Swin, BANet, and U-Net) to classify four woody vegetation categories: Forest, Patch, Linear, and Tree.

Result: Models achieved good classification accuracy overall, with FT-UNetFormer performing best (mean IoU 0.74; mean F1 score 0.84). Good results for Forest and Linear classes, but challenges in classifying complex structures with high edge density (Patch and Tree classes). Generalization experiments showed need for regionally diverse training data.

Conclusion: Deep learning models, particularly FT-UNetFormer, effectively map TOF categories, emphasizing the importance of spatial context understanding. Regional data diversity is crucial for reliable large-scale mapping.

Abstract: Trees Outside Forests (TOF) play an important role in agricultural landscapes
by supporting biodiversity, sequestering carbon, and regulating microclimates.
Yet, most studies have treated TOF as a single class or relied on rigid
rule-based thresholds, limiting ecological interpretation and adaptability
across regions. To address this, we evaluate deep learning for TOF
classification using a newly generated dataset and high-resolution aerial
imagery from four agricultural landscapes in Germany. Specifically, we compare
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), vision transformers, and hybrid
CNN-transformer models across six semantic segmentation architectures (ABCNet,
LSKNet, FT-UNetFormer, DC-Swin, BANet, and U-Net) to map four categories of
woody vegetation: Forest, Patch, Linear, and Tree, derived from previous
studies and governmental products. Overall, the models achieved good
classification accuracy across the four landscapes, with the FT-UNetFormer
performing best (mean Intersection-over-Union 0.74; mean F1 score 0.84),
underscoring the importance of spatial context understanding in TOF mapping and
classification. Our results show good results for Forest and Linear class and
reveal challenges particularly in classifying complex structures with high edge
density, notably the Patch and Tree class. Our generalization experiments
highlight the need for regionally diverse training data to ensure reliable

TL;DR: A distillation framework using Vision Foundation Models to enhance lightweight object detectors without increasing deployment overhead, achieving state-of-the-art performance on COCO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lightweight network designs for high-speed inference often degrade feature representation, limiting performance improvements and practical on-device deployment.

Method: Proposes Deep Semantic Injector (DSI) module to integrate VFM representations into detector layers, and Gradient-guided Adaptive Modulation (GAM) strategy to dynamically adjust semantic transfer intensity based on gradient norm ratios.

Result: RT-DETRv4 achieves state-of-the-art results on COCO with AP scores of 49.7/53.5/55.4/57.0 at speeds of 273/169/124/78 FPS respectively.

Conclusion: The approach delivers consistent performance gains across DETR-based models without increasing deployment and inference overhead, demonstrating practical utility for real-time detection.

Abstract: Real-time object detection has achieved substantial progress through
meticulously designed architectures and optimization strategies. However, the
pursuit of high-speed inference via lightweight network designs often leads to
degraded feature representation, which hinders further performance improvements
and practical on-device deployment. In this paper, we propose a cost-effective
and highly adaptable distillation framework that harnesses the rapidly evolving
capabilities of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to enhance lightweight object
detectors. Given the significant architectural and learning objective
disparities between VFMs and resource-constrained detectors, achieving stable
and task-aligned semantic transfer is challenging. To address this, on one
hand, we introduce a Deep Semantic Injector (DSI) module that facilitates the
integration of high-level representations from VFMs into the deep layers of the
detector. On the other hand, we devise a Gradient-guided Adaptive Modulation
(GAM) strategy, which dynamically adjusts the intensity of semantic transfer
based on gradient norm ratios. Without increasing deployment and inference
overhead, our approach painlessly delivers striking and consistent performance
gains across diverse DETR-based models, underscoring its practical utility for
real-time detection. Our new model family, RT-DETRv4, achieves state-of-the-art
results on COCO, attaining AP scores of 49.7/53.5/55.4/57.0 at corresponding
speeds of 273/169/124/78 FPS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LangHOPS is the first MLLM-based framework for open-vocabulary object-part instance segmentation that grounds object-part hierarchies in language space rather than visual grouping, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of prior approaches that rely on heuristic or learnable visual grouping for object-part segmentation, and to leverage MLLMs' rich knowledge and reasoning capabilities for hierarchical object-part parsing.

Method: Integrates MLLM into object-part parsing pipeline to ground object-part hierarchies in language space, using MLLM's knowledge to link multi-granularity concepts and employing part query refinement strategy.

Result: Achieves SOTA results: +5.5% AP (in-domain) and +4.8% AP (cross-dataset) on PartImageNet, and +2.5% mIOU on unseen object parts in ADE20K zero-shot segmentation.

Conclusion: LangHOPS demonstrates the effectiveness of language-grounded hierarchy and MLLM-driven part query refinement for open-vocabulary object-part instance segmentation, outperforming previous methods across multiple challenging scenarios.

Abstract: We propose LangHOPS, the first Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) based
framework for open-vocabulary object-part instance segmentation. Given an
image, LangHOPS can jointly detect and segment hierarchical object and part
instances from open-vocabulary candidate categories. Unlike prior approaches
that rely on heuristic or learnable visual grouping, our approach grounds
object-part hierarchies in language space. It integrates the MLLM into the
object-part parsing pipeline to leverage its rich knowledge and reasoning
capabilities, and link multi-granularity concepts within the hierarchies. We
evaluate LangHOPS across multiple challenging scenarios, including in-domain
and cross-dataset object-part instance segmentation, and zero-shot semantic
segmentation. LangHOPS achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing previous
methods by 5.5% Average Precision (AP) (in-domain) and 4.8% (cross-dataset) on
the PartImageNet dataset and by 2.5% mIOU on unseen object parts in ADE20K
(zero-shot). Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the
language-grounded hierarchy and MLLM driven part query refinement strategy. The
code will be released here.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DPTM is a novel generation-based SFDA framework that uses target data as references to generate and progressively refine a pseudo-target domain, addressing source-target domain discrepancy limitations in SFDA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SFDA methods are restricted by source-target domain discrepancy - non-generation methods suffer from unreliable pseudo-labels in large domain gaps, while generation-based methods degrade due to enlarged discrepancies when creating pseudo-source data.

Method: Divides target samples into trust/non-trust sets based on pseudo-label reliability. For non-trust samples, uses a manipulation strategy to semantically transform them into new categories while maintaining target distribution via latent diffusion model. Includes progressive refinement mechanism to iteratively reduce domain discrepancy.

Result: Outperforms existing methods by large margin, achieves state-of-the-art performance on four SFDA benchmark datasets. Significantly enhances performance by up to 18.6% in scenarios with large source-target gaps.

Conclusion: DPTM effectively addresses SFDA limitations by leveraging target data to generate and progressively refine pseudo-target domain, demonstrating superior performance especially in challenging scenarios with large domain discrepancies.

Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) is a challenging task that tackles
domain shifts using only a pre-trained source model and unlabeled target data.
Existing SFDA methods are restricted by the fundamental limitation of
source-target domain discrepancy. Non-generation SFDA methods suffer from
unreliable pseudo-labels in challenging scenarios with large domain
discrepancies, while generation-based SFDA methods are evidently degraded due
to enlarged domain discrepancies in creating pseudo-source data. To address
this limitation, we propose a novel generation-based framework named
Diffusion-Driven Progressive Target Manipulation (DPTM) that leverages
unlabeled target data as references to reliably generate and progressively
refine a pseudo-target domain for SFDA. Specifically, we divide the target
samples into a trust set and a non-trust set based on the reliability of
pseudo-labels to sufficiently and reliably exploit their information. For
samples from the non-trust set, we develop a manipulation strategy to
semantically transform them into the newly assigned categories, while
simultaneously maintaining them in the target distribution via a latent
diffusion model. Furthermore, we design a progressive refinement mechanism that
progressively reduces the domain discrepancy between the pseudo-target domain
and the real target domain via iterative refinement. Experimental results
demonstrate that DPTM outperforms existing methods by a large margin and
achieves state-of-the-art performance on four prevailing SFDA benchmark
datasets with different scales. Remarkably, DPTM can significantly enhance the
performance by up to 18.6% in scenarios with large source-target gaps.

### [60] [GaTector+: A Unified Head-free Framework for Gaze Object and Gaze Following Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25301)
*Yang Jin,Guangyu Guo,Binglu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GaTector+ is a unified framework that jointly solves gaze object detection and gaze following without requiring head-related priors during inference, using shared backbone with task-specific blocks and novel attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods solve gaze object detection and gaze following separately and depend on head-related prior knowledge, requiring auxiliary networks and preventing joint optimization, limiting practical applicability.

Method: Uses expanded specific-general-specific feature extractor with shared backbone, embeds head detection branch, proposes head-based attention mechanism to fuse features, attention supervision for gaze heatmap learning, and introduces mSoC evaluation metric.

Result: Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate effectiveness in both gaze object detection and gaze following tasks.

Conclusion: GaTector+ successfully eliminates dependency on head-related priors during inference while achieving strong performance through unified framework design and novel attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Gaze object detection and gaze following are fundamental tasks for
interpreting human gaze behavior or intent. However, most previous methods
usually solve these two tasks separately, and their prediction of gaze objects
and gaze following typically depend on head-related prior knowledge during both
the training phase and real-world deployment. This dependency necessitates an
auxiliary network to extract head location, thus precluding joint optimization
across the entire system and constraining the practical applicability. To this
end, we propose GaTector+, a unified framework for gaze object detection and
gaze following, which eliminates the dependence on the head-related priors
during inference. Specifically, GaTector+ uses an expanded
specific-general-specific feature extractor that leverages a shared backbone,
which extracts general features for gaze following and object detection using
the shared backbone while using specific blocks before and after the shared
backbone to better consider the specificity of each sub-task. To obtain
head-related knowledge without prior information, we first embed a head
detection branch to predict the head of each person. Then, before regressing
the gaze point, a head-based attention mechanism is proposed to fuse the sense
feature and gaze feature with the help of head location. Since the
suboptimization of the gaze point heatmap leads to the performance bottleneck,
we propose an attention supervision mechanism to accelerate the learning of the
gaze heatmap. Finally, we propose a novel evaluation metric, mean Similarity
over Candidates (mSoC), for gaze object detection, which is more sensitive to
variations between bounding boxes. The experimental results on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in both gaze
object detection and gaze following tasks.

*Zongxi Yu,Xiaolong Qian,Shaohua Gao,Qi Jiang,Yao Gao,Kailun Yang,Kaiwei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents Bionic Monocentric Imaging (BMI), a co-designed system combining a bio-inspired all-spherical monocentric lens with a dual-head reconstruction network to achieve high-fidelity RGBD imaging from a single coded capture, outperforming both software-only methods and other deep optics approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional compact optics struggle with RGB sharpness across depth-of-field, while software-only Monocular Depth Estimation is ill-posed and relies on unreliable semantic priors. Existing deep optics solutions introduce trade-offs in fabrication complexity and chromatic aberrations.

Method: Developed a bio-inspired all-spherical monocentric lens that naturally encodes depth into depth-varying PSFs. Created a physically-based forward model for synthetic dataset generation, co-designed with a dual-head multi-scale reconstruction network that uses a shared encoder to jointly recover All-in-Focus images and depth maps.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance: depth estimation with Abs Rel of 0.026 and RMSE of 0.130, significantly outperforming software-only approaches and other deep optics systems. Image restoration achieved SSIM of 0.960 and LPIPS of 0.082, demonstrating superior balance between image fidelity and depth accuracy.

Conclusion: Integration of bio-inspired fully spherical optics with joint reconstruction algorithms effectively addresses intrinsic challenges in high-performance compact RGBD imaging, providing a simpler alternative to complex diffractive or freeform elements.

Abstract: Achieving high-fidelity, compact RGBD imaging presents a dual challenge:
conventional compact optics struggle with RGB sharpness across the entire
depth-of-field, while software-only Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is an
ill-posed problem reliant on unreliable semantic priors. While deep optics with
elements like DOEs can encode depth, they introduce trade-offs in fabrication
complexity and chromatic aberrations, compromising simplicity. To address this,
we first introduce a novel bio-inspired all-spherical monocentric lens, around
which we build the Bionic Monocentric Imaging (BMI) framework, a holistic
co-design. This optical design naturally encodes depth into its depth-varying
Point Spread Functions (PSFs) without requiring complex diffractive or freeform
elements. We establish a rigorous physically-based forward model to generate a
synthetic dataset by precisely simulating the optical degradation process. This
simulation pipeline is co-designed with a dual-head, multi-scale reconstruction
network that employs a shared encoder to jointly recover a high-fidelity
All-in-Focus (AiF) image and a precise depth map from a single coded capture.
Extensive experiments validate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed
framework. In depth estimation, the method attains an Abs Rel of 0.026 and an
RMSE of 0.130, markedly outperforming leading software-only approaches and
other deep optics systems. For image restoration, the system achieves an SSIM
of 0.960 and a perceptual LPIPS score of 0.082, thereby confirming a superior
balance between image fidelity and depth accuracy. This study illustrates that
the integration of bio-inspired, fully spherical optics with a joint
reconstruction algorithm constitutes an effective strategy for addressing the
intrinsic challenges in high-performance compact RGBD imaging. Source code will
be publicly available at https://github.com/ZongxiYu-ZJU/BMI.

*Yushen Huang,Zhiming Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PDA is a lightweight plug-in metric head for DeFRCN that uses prototype-based matching to improve few-shot object detection by reducing base-class bias and improving calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few-shot object detection suffers from base-class bias and unstable calibration when only limited novel samples are available, requiring complementary approaches to traditional linear classifiers.

Method: Maintains support-only prototypes in a learnable projection space, uses prototype-conditioned RoI alignment, adapts prototypes via EMA updates during fine-tuning, and employs best-of-K matching with temperature-scaled fusion.

Result: Consistently improves novel-class performance on VOC FSOD and GFSOD benchmarks with minimal impact on base classes and negligible computational overhead.

Conclusion: PDA provides an effective prototype-driven approach that enhances few-shot object detection performance while maintaining protocol compliance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Few-shot object detection (FSOD) often suffers from base-class bias and
unstable calibration when only a few novel samples are available. We propose
Prototype-Driven Alignment (PDA), a lightweight, plug-in metric head for DeFRCN
that provides a prototype-based "second opinion" complementary to the linear
classifier. PDA maintains support-only prototypes in a learnable
identity-initialized projection space and optionally applies
prototype-conditioned RoI alignment to reduce geometric mismatch. During
fine-tuning, prototypes can be adapted via exponential moving average(EMA)
updates on labeled foreground RoIs-without introducing class-specific
parameters-and are frozen at inference to ensure strict protocol compliance.
PDA employs a best-of-K matching scheme to capture intra-class multi-modality
and temperature-scaled fusion to combine metric similarities with detector
logits. Experiments on VOC FSOD and GFSOD benchmarks show that PDA consistently
improves novel-class performance with minimal impact on base classes and
negligible computational overhead.

*Runxi Huang,Mingxuan Yu,Mingyu Tsoi,Xiaomin Ouyang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMEdge is a real-time multimodal inference framework for edge devices that uses pipelined sensing and encoding to process data incrementally, with temporal aggregation and adaptive optimization to maintain accuracy while reducing latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous approaches overlook the coupling between sensing dynamics and model execution, and complex inter-modality dependencies in real-time multimodal inference on resource-constrained edge devices.

Method: Decomposes inference into fine-grained sensing/encoding units for incremental processing, adds temporal aggregation module, adaptive multimodal configuration optimizer, and cross-modal speculative skipping mechanism.

Result: Significantly reduces end-to-end latency while maintaining high task accuracy across various system and data dynamics, validated on public datasets and UAV testbed.

Conclusion: MMEdge effectively addresses the challenges of real-time multimodal inference on edge devices through its pipelined design and optimization techniques.

Abstract: Real-time multimodal inference on resource-constrained edge devices is
essential for applications such as autonomous driving, human-computer
interaction, and mobile health. However, prior work often overlooks the tight
coupling between sensing dynamics and model execution, as well as the complex
inter-modality dependencies. In this paper, we propose MMEdge, an new on-device
multi-modal inference framework based on pipelined sensing and encoding.
Instead of waiting for complete sensor inputs, MMEdge decomposes the entire
inference process into a sequence of fine-grained sensing and encoding units,
allowing computation to proceed incrementally as data arrive. MMEdge also
introduces a lightweight but effective temporal aggregation module that
captures rich temporal dynamics across different pipelined units to maintain
accuracy performance. Such pipelined design also opens up opportunities for
fine-grained cross-modal optimization and early decision-making during
inference. To further enhance system performance under resource variability and
input data complexity, MMEdge incorporates an adaptive multimodal configuration
optimizer that dynamically selects optimal sensing and model configurations for
each modality under latency constraints, and a cross-modal speculative skipping
mechanism that bypasses future units of slower modalities when early
predictions reach sufficient confidence. We evaluate MMEdge using two public
multimodal datasets and deploy it on a real-world unmanned aerial vehicle
(UAV)-based multimodal testbed. The results show that MMEdge significantly
reduces end-to-end latency while maintaining high task accuracy across various
system and data dynamics.

TL;DR: StreamingCoT is the first dataset for temporally evolving reasoning in streaming VideoQA and multimodal Chain-of-Thought tasks, addressing limitations in current datasets through dynamic hierarchical annotation and explicit reasoning chain generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VideoQA datasets have limitations: static annotations fail to capture evolving answers in temporal video streams, and lack of explicit reasoning process annotations restricts model interpretability and logical deduction capabilities.

Method: Establishes dynamic hierarchical annotation architecture with per-second dense descriptions and temporally-dependent semantic segments. Proposes explicit reasoning chain generation via spatiotemporal object extraction, object state transition-based reasoning paths using LLMs, and human-verified validation for logical coherence.

Result: Created StreamingCoT dataset that provides foundation for streaming video understanding, complex temporal reasoning, and multimodal inference research.

Conclusion: StreamingCoT addresses critical gaps in VideoQA datasets and enables advancement in temporal reasoning and multimodal inference capabilities for streaming video applications.

Abstract: The rapid growth of streaming video applications demands multimodal models
with enhanced capabilities for temporal dynamics understanding and complex
reasoning. However, current Video Question Answering (VideoQA) datasets suffer
from two critical limitations: 1) Static annotation mechanisms fail to capture
the evolving nature of answers in temporal video streams, and 2) The absence of
explicit reasoning process annotations restricts model interpretability and
logical deduction capabilities. To address these challenges, We introduce
StreamingCoT, the first dataset explicitly designed for temporally evolving
reasoning in streaming VideoQA and multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) tasks. Our
framework first establishes a dynamic hierarchical annotation architecture that
generates per-second dense descriptions and constructs temporally-dependent
semantic segments through similarity fusion, paired with question-answer sets
constrained by temporal evolution patterns. We further propose an explicit
reasoning chain generation paradigm that extracts spatiotemporal objects via
keyframe semantic alignment, derives object state transition-based reasoning
paths using large language models, and ensures logical coherence through
human-verified validation. This dataset establishes a foundation for advancing
research in streaming video understanding, complex temporal reasoning, and
multimodal inference. Our StreamingCoT and its construction toolkit can be

*Zhigang Tu,Zhengbo Zhang,Jia Gong,Junsong Yuan,Bo Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel approach for semi-supervised 3D action recognition using active learning, reformulating the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and leveraging hyperbolic space projection to enhance sample selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing active learning methods in semi-supervised 3D action recognition may select representative but not necessarily informative skeleton sequences, as the model may already have similar knowledge from previously seen samples.

Method: Reformulate semi-supervised 3D action recognition via active learning as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), train an informative sample selection model, project state-action pairs from Euclidean to hyperbolic space for enhanced representation, and introduce meta tuning for faster real-world deployment.

Result: Extensive experiments on three 3D action recognition benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Conclusion: The MDP-based framework with hyperbolic space projection and meta tuning provides an effective solution for intelligent sample selection in semi-supervised 3D action recognition.

Abstract: Skeleton-based human action recognition aims to classify human skeletal
sequences, which are spatiotemporal representations of actions, into predefined
categories. To reduce the reliance on costly annotations of skeletal sequences
while maintaining competitive recognition accuracy, the task of 3D Action
Recognition with Limited Training Samples, also known as semi-supervised 3D
Action Recognition, has been proposed. In addition, active learning, which aims
to proactively select the most informative unlabeled samples for annotation,
has been explored in semi-supervised 3D Action Recognition for training sample
selection. Specifically, researchers adopt an encoder-decoder framework to
embed skeleton sequences into a latent space, where clustering information,
combined with a margin-based selection strategy using a multi-head mechanism,
is utilized to identify the most informative sequences in the unlabeled set for
annotation. However, the most representative skeleton sequences may not
necessarily be the most informative for the action recognizer, as the model may
have already acquired similar knowledge from previously seen skeleton samples.
To solve it, we reformulate Semi-supervised 3D action recognition via active
learning from a novel perspective by casting it as a Markov Decision Process
(MDP). Built upon the MDP framework and its training paradigm, we train an
informative sample selection model to intelligently guide the selection of
skeleton sequences for annotation. To enhance the representational capacity of
the factors in the state-action pairs within our method, we project them from
Euclidean space to hyperbolic space. Furthermore, we introduce a meta tuning
strategy to accelerate the deployment of our method in real-world scenarios.
Extensive experiments on three 3D action recognition benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: A radiomics-based pipeline using pseudo-labeling for coronary artery calcium scoring on non-contrast CCTA scans, outperforming foundation model features without expert annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limited annotated data for coronary artery calcium scoring in non-contrast CCTA scans and eliminate the need for expert-defined segmentations.

Method: Proposed radiomics-based pipeline with pseudo-labeling for training labels, compared pretrained foundation models (CT-FM and RadImageNet) features with radiomics features using traditional classifiers on 182 patient CCTA dataset.

Result: Radiomics-based models significantly outperformed CNN-derived embeddings from foundation models, achieving 84% accuracy (p<0.05) for zero vs non-zero calcium score classification.

Conclusion: Radiomics features with pseudo-labeling provide effective coronary artery calcium scoring without expert annotations, outperforming deep learning foundation model features.

Abstract: Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring plays a crucial role in the early
detection and risk stratification of coronary artery disease (CAD). In this
study, we focus on non-contrast coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA)
scans, which are commonly used for early calcification detection in clinical
settings. To address the challenge of limited annotated data, we propose a
radiomics-based pipeline that leverages pseudo-labeling to generate training
labels, thereby eliminating the need for expert-defined segmentations.
Additionally, we explore the use of pretrained foundation models, specifically
CT-FM and RadImageNet, to extract image features, which are then used with
traditional classifiers. We compare the performance of these deep learning
features with that of radiomics features. Evaluation is conducted on a clinical
CCTA dataset comprising 182 patients, where individuals are classified into two
groups: zero versus non-zero calcium scores. We further investigate the impact
of training on non-contrast datasets versus combined contrast and non-contrast
datasets, with testing performed only on non contrast scans. Results show that
radiomics-based models significantly outperform CNN-derived embeddings from
foundation models (achieving 84% accuracy and p<0.05), despite the
unavailability of expert annotations.

TL;DR: PEP-FedPT is a federated prompt tuning framework for Vision Transformers that achieves both generalization and personalization through class-contextualized mixed prompts, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets under data heterogeneity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual Prompt Tuning is parameter-efficient but struggles in Federated Learning - global prompts don't generalize well across heterogeneous clients, while personalized prompts overfit locally and lack generalization.

Method: Proposes PEP-FedPT with Class-Contextualized Mixed Prompt (CCMP) that combines class-specific prompts with global prompts using weights from global class prototypes and client class priors, enabling per-sample personalization without client-dependent parameters.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations on CIFAR-100, TinyImageNet, DomainNet, and iNaturalist show PEP-FedPT consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines under diverse data heterogeneity scenarios.

Conclusion: Establishes a strong foundation for efficient and generalizable federated prompt tuning of Vision Transformers, achieving both generalization and personalization simultaneously.

Abstract: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) of pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs) has
proven highly effective as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique for
adapting large models to downstream tasks with limited data. Its parameter
efficiency makes it particularly suitable for Federated Learning (FL), where
both communication and computation budgets are often constrained. However,
global prompt tuning struggles to generalize across heterogeneous clients,
while personalized tuning overfits to local data and lacks generalization. We
propose PEP-FedPT (Prompt Estimation from Prototypes for Federated Prompt
Tuning), a unified framework designed to achieve both generalization and
personalization in federated prompt tuning of ViTs. Within this framework, we
introduce the novel Class-Contextualized Mixed Prompt (CCMP) - based on
class-specific prompts maintained alongside a globally shared prompt. For each
input, CCMP adaptively combines class-specific prompts using weights derived
from global class prototypes and client class priors. This approach enables
per-sample prompt personalization without storing client-dependent trainable
parameters. The prompts are collaboratively optimized via traditional federated
averaging technique on the same. Comprehensive evaluations on CIFAR-100,
TinyImageNet, DomainNet, and iNaturalist datasets demonstrate that PEP-FedPT
consistently surpasses the state-of-the-art baselines under diverse data
heterogeneity scenarios, establishing a strong foundation for efficient and
generalizable federated prompt tuning of Vision Transformers.

TL;DR: The paper introduces i-CIR, a new instance-level composed image retrieval dataset with hard negatives, and proposes BASIC, a training-free method using pre-trained VLMs that achieves state-of-the-art performance on CIR tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Progress in composed image retrieval (CIR) is limited by the lack of high-quality training and evaluation data. Existing datasets don't focus on instance-level retrieval where the goal is to find the same particular object under various modifications.

Method: Proposes BASIC - a training-free approach using pre-trained vision-and-language models. It separately estimates query-image-to-image and query-text-to-image similarities, performs late fusion to upweight images satisfying both queries, and includes simple components to improve individual similarities.

Result: BASIC achieves new state-of-the-art performance on both the new i-CIR dataset and existing CIR datasets. The i-CIR dataset maintains challenge comparable to retrieval among 40M+ distractors through semi-automated hard negative selection.

Conclusion: The introduced i-CIR dataset and BASIC method address key limitations in CIR research, providing both better evaluation data and a training-free approach that outperforms existing methods on multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: The progress of composed image retrieval (CIR), a popular research direction
in image retrieval, where a combined visual and textual query is used, is held
back by the absence of high-quality training and evaluation data. We introduce
a new evaluation dataset, i-CIR, which, unlike existing datasets, focuses on an
instance-level class definition. The goal is to retrieve images that contain
the same particular object as the visual query, presented under a variety of
modifications defined by textual queries. Its design and curation process keep
the dataset compact to facilitate future research, while maintaining its
challenge-comparable to retrieval among more than 40M random
distractors-through a semi-automated selection of hard negatives.
  To overcome the challenge of obtaining clean, diverse, and suitable training
data, we leverage pre-trained vision-and-language models (VLMs) in a
training-free approach called BASIC. The method separately estimates
query-image-to-image and query-text-to-image similarities, performing late
fusion to upweight images that satisfy both queries, while down-weighting those
that exhibit high similarity with only one of the two. Each individual
similarity is further improved by a set of components that are simple and
intuitive. BASIC sets a new state of the art on i-CIR but also on existing CIR
datasets that follow a semantic-level class definition. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoherentAD is a training-free method that generates coherent Audio Descriptions by selecting from multiple candidates across sequences, outperforming independent generation approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automatic AD methods generate descriptions independently, leading to repetitive and incoherent sequences that fail to help visually impaired audiences visualize unfolding scenes.

Method: Generate multiple candidate descriptions for each AD time interval, then perform auto-regressive selection across the sequence to form coherent narratives.

Result: Produces coherent AD sequences with enhanced narrative understanding and outperforms prior independent generation approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses coherence issues in automatic AD generation and introduces StoryRecall metric for holistic sequence evaluation.

Abstract: Audio Descriptions (ADs) convey essential on-screen information, allowing
visually impaired audiences to follow videos. To be effective, ADs must form a
coherent sequence that helps listeners to visualise the unfolding scene, rather
than describing isolated moments. However, most automatic methods generate each
AD independently, often resulting in repetitive, incoherent descriptions. To
address this, we propose a training-free method, CoherentAD, that first
generates multiple candidate descriptions for each AD time interval, and then
performs auto-regressive selection across the sequence to form a coherent and
informative narrative. To evaluate AD sequences holistically, we introduce a

Motivation: Current underwater inspection methods using human divers or remotely operated vehicles face perceptual and operational challenges in complex structures or turbid water. Enhancing spatial awareness of underwater vehicles is crucial for reducing piloting risks and enabling greater autonomy.

Method: Two-stage approach: first scales relative depth map with sparse depth points, then refines final metric prediction using proposed Cascade Conv-Deformable Transformer blocks.

Result: Achieves improved accuracy and generalization over state-of-the-art baselines, runs efficiently at over 15 FPS on embedded hardware.

Conclusion: SPADE promises to support practical underwater inspection and intervention by providing accurate depth estimation for autonomous underwater vehicles.

Abstract: Underwater infrastructure requires frequent inspection and maintenance due to
harsh marine conditions. Current reliance on human divers or remotely operated
vehicles is limited by perceptual and operational challenges, especially around
complex structures or in turbid water. Enhancing the spatial awareness of
underwater vehicles is key to reducing piloting risks and enabling greater
autonomy. To address these challenges, we present SPADE: SParsity Adaptive
Depth Estimator, a monocular depth estimation pipeline that combines
pre-trained relative depth estimator with sparse depth priors to produce dense,
metric scale depth maps. Our two-stage approach first scales the relative depth
map with the sparse depth points, then refines the final metric prediction with
our proposed Cascade Conv-Deformable Transformer blocks. Our approach achieves
improved accuracy and generalisation over state-of-the-art baselines and runs
efficiently at over 15 FPS on embedded hardware, promising to support practical
underwater inspection and intervention. This work has been submitted to IEEE

Method: Evaluated UNet-based architectures with ResNet, Transformer, and Mamba backbones, then incorporated attention mechanisms including CBAM. Used Grad-CAM for interpretability.

Result: ResNetUNet3+ with CBAM achieved best performance: Dice 0.755, IoU 0.662, HD95 77.911, accuracy 0.925, specificity 0.926. ResNet consistently outperformed Transformer and Mamba alternatives.

Conclusion: Classical ResNet architecture combined with modern attention modules remains highly competitive for medical image segmentation, offering promising direction for clinical liver tumor detection.

Abstract: Segmentation of liver structures in multi-phase contrast-enhanced computed
tomography (CECT) plays a crucial role in computer-aided diagnosis and
treatment planning for liver diseases, including tumor detection. In this
study, we investigate the performance of UNet-based architectures for liver
tumor segmentation, starting from the original UNet and extending to UNet3+
with various backbone networks. We evaluate ResNet, Transformer-based, and
State-space (Mamba) backbones, all initialized with pretrained weights.
Surprisingly, despite the advances in modern architecture, ResNet-based models
consistently outperform Transformer- and Mamba-based alternatives across
multiple evaluation metrics. To further improve segmentation quality, we
introduce attention mechanisms into the backbone and observe that incorporating
the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) yields the best performance.
ResNetUNet3+ with CBAM module not only produced the best overlap metrics with a
Dice score of 0.755 and IoU of 0.662, but also achieved the most precise
boundary delineation, evidenced by the lowest HD95 distance of 77.911. The
model's superiority was further cemented by its leading overall accuracy of
0.925 and specificity of 0.926, showcasing its robust capability in accurately
identifying both lesion and healthy tissue. To further enhance
interpretability, Grad-CAM visualizations were employed to highlight the
region's most influential predictions, providing insights into its
decision-making process. These findings demonstrate that classical ResNet
architecture, when combined with modern attention modules, remain highly
competitive for medical image segmentation tasks, offering a promising
direction for liver tumor detection in clinical practice.

### [72] [RegionE: Adaptive Region-Aware Generation for Efficient Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25590)
*Pengtao Chen,Xianfang Zeng,Maosen Zhao,Mingzhu Shen,Peng Ye,Bangyin Xiang,Zhibo Wang,Wei Cheng,Gang Yu,Tao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RegionE is a region-aware image editing framework that accelerates instruction-based image editing by distinguishing between edited and unedited regions, applying different generation strategies to each for faster processing while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing instruction-based image editing models treat all image regions uniformly, despite significant differences in generation difficulty and computational redundancy between edited and unedited areas. This leads to inefficiency as unedited regions undergo unnecessary processing.

Method: 1) Adaptive Region Partition based on trajectory differences between edited and unedited regions; 2) Region-Aware Generation with one-step prediction for unedited areas and local iterative denoising for edited regions using Region-Instruction KV Cache; 3) Adaptive Velocity Decay Cache to accelerate local denoising by leveraging velocity similarity between adjacent timesteps.

Result: Applied to state-of-the-art IIE models (Step1X-Edit, FLUX.1 Kontext, Qwen-Image-Edit), RegionE achieved acceleration factors of 2.57, 2.41, and 2.06 respectively. GPT-4o evaluations confirmed preserved semantic and perceptual fidelity.

Conclusion: RegionE provides an effective training-free acceleration framework for instruction-based image editing by exploiting the distinct characteristics of edited and unedited regions, achieving significant speed improvements without compromising quality.

Abstract: Recently, instruction-based image editing (IIE) has received widespread
attention. In practice, IIE often modifies only specific regions of an image,
while the remaining areas largely remain unchanged. Although these two types of
regions differ significantly in generation difficulty and computational
redundancy, existing IIE models do not account for this distinction, instead
applying a uniform generation process across the entire image. This motivates
us to propose RegionE, an adaptive, region-aware generation framework that
accelerates IIE tasks without additional training. Specifically, the RegionE
framework consists of three main components: 1) Adaptive Region Partition. We
observed that the trajectory of unedited regions is straight, allowing for
multi-step denoised predictions to be inferred in a single step. Therefore, in
the early denoising stages, we partition the image into edited and unedited
regions based on the difference between the final estimated result and the
reference image. 2) Region-Aware Generation. After distinguishing the regions,
we replace multi-step denoising with one-step prediction for unedited areas.
For edited regions, the trajectory is curved, requiring local iterative
denoising. To improve the efficiency and quality of local iterative generation,
we propose the Region-Instruction KV Cache, which reduces computational cost
while incorporating global information. 3) Adaptive Velocity Decay Cache.
Observing that adjacent timesteps in edited regions exhibit strong velocity
similarity, we further propose an adaptive velocity decay cache to accelerate
the local denoising process. We applied RegionE to state-of-the-art IIE base
models, including Step1X-Edit, FLUX.1 Kontext, and Qwen-Image-Edit. RegionE
achieved acceleration factors of 2.57, 2.41, and 2.06. Evaluations by GPT-4o
confirmed that semantic and perceptual fidelity were well preserved.

*Zhi-Kai Chen,Jun-Peng Jiang,Han-Jia Ye,De-Chuan Zhan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hawk introduces speculative decoding for autoregressive image generation, achieving 1.71x speedup while maintaining image quality by leveraging spatial structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive image generation models suffer from slow inference due to sequential decoding. Speculative decoding has shown promise in text generation but faces challenges in image generation due to larger sampling space and underutilization of spatial structure.

Method: Hawk uses spatial structure of images to guide speculative model predictions, employing a lightweight draft model to approximate the larger AR model's output while better modeling local dependencies.

Result: Experimental results show 1.71x speedup over standard AR models on multiple text-to-image benchmarks while preserving image fidelity and diversity.

Conclusion: Hawk successfully adapts speculative decoding to image generation, demonstrating significant acceleration without compromising quality by effectively utilizing spatial structure.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) image generation models are capable of producing
high-fidelity images but often suffer from slow inference due to their
inherently sequential, token-by-token decoding process. Speculative decoding,
which employs a lightweight draft model to approximate the output of a larger
AR model, has shown promise in accelerating text generation without
compromising quality. However, its application to image generation remains
largely underexplored. The challenges stem from a significantly larger sampling
space, which complicates the alignment between the draft and target model
outputs, coupled with the inadequate use of the two-dimensional spatial
structure inherent in images, thereby limiting the modeling of local
dependencies. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Hawk, a new approach
that harnesses the spatial structure of images to guide the speculative model
toward more accurate and efficient predictions. Experimental results on
multiple text-to-image benchmarks demonstrate a 1.71x speedup over standard AR
models, while preserving both image fidelity and diversity.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans have strong spatial reasoning abilities through multimodal observations, but systematic reviews and public benchmarks for large multimodal reasoning models are limited.

Method: The survey outlines general spatial reasoning, examines 2D and 3D tasks including spatial relationship reasoning, scene understanding, visual question answering, and reviews embodied AI advances and emerging modalities like audio and egocentric video.

Conclusion: This survey offers insights into the growing field of multimodal spatial reasoning and provides a solid foundation for future research.

Abstract: Humans possess spatial reasoning abilities that enable them to understand
spaces through multimodal observations, such as vision and sound. Large
multimodal reasoning models extend these abilities by learning to perceive and
reason, showing promising performance across diverse spatial tasks. However,
systematic reviews and publicly available benchmarks for these models remain
limited. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of multimodal
spatial reasoning tasks with large models, categorizing recent progress in
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and introducing open benchmarks for
evaluation. We begin by outlining general spatial reasoning, focusing on
post-training techniques, explainability, and architecture. Beyond classical 2D
tasks, we examine spatial relationship reasoning, scene and layout
understanding, as well as visual question answering and grounding in 3D space.
We also review advances in embodied AI, including vision-language navigation
and action models. Additionally, we consider emerging modalities such as audio
and egocentric video, which contribute to novel spatial understanding through
new sensors. We believe this survey establishes a solid foundation and offers
insights into the growing field of multimodal spatial reasoning. Updated

### [75] [FreeArt3D: Training-Free Articulated Object Generation using 3D Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25765)
*Chuhao Chen,Isabella Liu,Xinyue Wei,Hao Su,Minghua Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreeArt3D is a training-free framework that generates articulated 3D objects by extending pre-trained static 3D diffusion models into the 4D domain, treating articulation as an additional generative dimension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for articulated 3D objects either require dense-view supervision or produce coarse geometry without surface texture, while training native 3D diffusion models for articulated objects is challenging due to limited data.

Method: Repurposes pre-trained static 3D diffusion models as shape priors and extends Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) to 3D-to-4D domain, treating articulation as additional dimension. Jointly optimizes geometry, texture, and articulation parameters from few images in different articulation states.

Result: Generates high-fidelity geometry and textures, accurately predicts kinematic structures, generalizes across diverse object categories, completes in minutes, and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: FreeArt3D provides an effective training-free solution for articulated 3D generation that leverages existing static 3D models while avoiding the need for large-scale articulated datasets or task-specific training.

Abstract: Articulated 3D objects are central to many applications in robotics, AR/VR,
and animation. Recent approaches to modeling such objects either rely on
optimization-based reconstruction pipelines that require dense-view supervision
or on feed-forward generative models that produce coarse geometric
approximations and often overlook surface texture. In contrast, open-world 3D
generation of static objects has achieved remarkable success, especially with
the advent of native 3D diffusion models such as Trellis. However, extending
these methods to articulated objects by training native 3D diffusion models
poses significant challenges. In this work, we present FreeArt3D, a
training-free framework for articulated 3D object generation. Instead of
training a new model on limited articulated data, FreeArt3D repurposes a
pre-trained static 3D diffusion model (e.g., Trellis) as a powerful shape
prior. It extends Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) into the 3D-to-4D domain by
treating articulation as an additional generative dimension. Given a few images
captured in different articulation states, FreeArt3D jointly optimizes the
object's geometry, texture, and articulation parameters without requiring
task-specific training or access to large-scale articulated datasets. Our
method generates high-fidelity geometry and textures, accurately predicts
underlying kinematic structures, and generalizes well across diverse object
categories. Despite following a per-instance optimization paradigm, FreeArt3D
completes in minutes and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art
approaches in both quality and versatility.

*Baolu Li,Yiming Zhang,Qinghe Wang,Liqian Ma,Xiaoyu Shi,Xintao Wang,Pengfei Wan,Zhenfei Yin,Yunzhi Zhuge,Huchuan Lu,Xu Jia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VFXMaster is a unified, reference-based framework for VFX video generation that treats effect generation as an in-context learning task, enabling reproduction of diverse dynamic effects from reference videos with strong generalization to unseen effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VFX generation methods rely on one-LoRA-per-effect paradigm, which is resource-intensive and cannot generalize to unseen effects, limiting scalability and creative potential.

Method: Uses in-context conditioning strategy with reference videos, in-context attention masks to decouple and inject effect attributes, and one-shot effect adaptation mechanism for rapid generalization to tough unseen effects.

Result: Effectively imitates various effect categories and demonstrates outstanding generalization to out-of-domain effects through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: VFXMaster provides a scalable unified solution for VFX generation that overcomes limitations of previous methods and will be released to foster future research.

Abstract: Visual effects (VFX) are crucial to the expressive power of digital media,
yet their creation remains a major challenge for generative AI. Prevailing
methods often rely on the one-LoRA-per-effect paradigm, which is
resource-intensive and fundamentally incapable of generalizing to unseen
effects, thus limiting scalability and creation. To address this challenge, we
introduce VFXMaster, the first unified, reference-based framework for VFX video
generation. It recasts effect generation as an in-context learning task,
enabling it to reproduce diverse dynamic effects from a reference video onto
target content. In addition, it demonstrates remarkable generalization to
unseen effect categories. Specifically, we design an in-context conditioning
strategy that prompts the model with a reference example. An in-context
attention mask is designed to precisely decouple and inject the essential
effect attributes, allowing a single unified model to master the effect
imitation without information leakage. In addition, we propose an efficient
one-shot effect adaptation mechanism to boost generalization capability on
tough unseen effects from a single user-provided video rapidly. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method effectively imitates various categories
of effect information and exhibits outstanding generalization to out-of-domain
effects. To foster future research, we will release our code, models, and a
comprehensive dataset to the community.
