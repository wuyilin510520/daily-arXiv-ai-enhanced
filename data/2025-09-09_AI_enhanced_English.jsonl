Albeit efficient,\nPointPillars is typically outperformed by state-of-the-art 3D detection methods\ndue to the following limitations: 1) The pseudo image representations fail to\npreserve precise 3D structures, and 2) they make it difficult to adopt a\ntwo-stage detection pipeline using 3D object proposals that typically shows\nbetter performance than a single-stage approach. We introduce in this paper the\nfirst two-stage 3D detection framework exploiting pseudo image representations,\nnarrowing the performance gaps between PointPillars and state-of-the-art\nmethods, while retaining its efficiency. Our framework consists of two novel\ncomponents that overcome the aforementioned limitations of PointPillars: First,\nwe introduce a new CNN architecture, dubbed 3DPillars, that enables learning 3D\nvoxel-based features from the pseudo image representation efficiently using 2D\nconvolutions. The basic idea behind 3DPillars is that 3D features from voxels\ncan be viewed as a stack of pseudo images. To implement this idea, we propose a\nseparable voxel feature module that extracts voxel-based features without using\n3D convolutions. Second, we introduce an RoI head with a sparse scene context\nfeature module that aggregates multi-scale features from 3DPillars to obtain a\nsparse scene feature. This enables adopting a two-stage pipeline effectively,\nand fully leveraging contextual information of a scene to refine 3D object\nproposals. Experimental results on the KITTI and Waymo Open datasets\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, achieving a good\ncompromise in terms of speed and accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "A two-stage 3D detection framework that improves PointPillars by introducing 3DPillars CNN architecture for better 3D feature learning and sparse scene context features for effective two-stage processing.", "motivation": "PointPillars is fast but underperforms state-of-the-art methods due to poor 3D structure preservation and inability to effectively use two-stage detection pipelines with 3D object proposals.", "method": "Introduces 3DPillars CNN that treats 3D voxel features as stacked pseudo images using separable voxel feature module without 3D convolutions, plus RoI head with sparse scene context feature module for multi-scale feature aggregation.", "result": "Achieves good compromise between speed and accuracy on KITTI and Waymo Open datasets, narrowing performance gaps with state-of-the-art methods while retaining efficiency.", "conclusion": "The framework successfully overcomes PointPillars' limitations by enabling effective two-stage detection with pseudo image representations and better 3D feature learning."}}

Motivated by\nrecent advances in interleaving reasoning, we explore whether such reasoning\ncan further improve Text-to-Image (T2I) generation. We introduce Interleaving\nReasoning Generation (IRG), a framework that alternates between text-based\nthinking and image synthesis: the model first produces a text-based thinking to\nguide an initial image, then reflects on the result to refine fine-grained\ndetails, visual quality, and aesthetics while preserving semantics. To train\nIRG effectively, we propose Interleaving Reasoning Generation Learning (IRGL),\nwhich targets two sub-goals: (1) strengthening the initial think-and-generate\nstage to establish core content and base quality, and (2) enabling high-quality\ntextual reflection and faithful implementation of those refinements in a\nsubsequent image. We curate IRGL-300K, a dataset organized into six decomposed\nlearning modes that jointly cover learning text-based thinking, and full\nthinking-image trajectories. Starting from a unified foundation model that\nnatively emits interleaved text-image outputs, our two-stage training first\nbuilds robust thinking and reflection, then efficiently tunes the IRG pipeline\nin the full thinking-image trajectory data. Extensive experiments show SoTA\nperformance, yielding absolute gains of 5-10 points on GenEval, WISE, TIIF,\nGenAI-Bench, and OneIG-EN, alongside substantial improvements in visual quality\nand fine-grained fidelity.

However, the high computational costs of these video\npose transformers (VPTs) make them impractical on resource-constrained devices.\nIn this paper, we present a hierarchical plug-and-play pruning-and-recovering\nframework, called Hierarchical Hourglass Tokenizer (H$_{2}$OT), for efficient\ntransformer-based 3D human pose estimation from videos. H$_{2}$OT begins with\nprogressively pruning pose tokens of redundant frames and ends with recovering\nfull-length sequences, resulting in a few pose tokens in the intermediate\ntransformer blocks and thus improving the model efficiency. It works with two\nkey modules, namely, a Token Pruning Module (TPM) and a Token Recovering Module\n(TRM). TPM dynamically selects a few representative tokens to eliminate the\nredundancy of video frames, while TRM restores the detailed spatio-temporal\ninformation based on the selected tokens, thereby expanding the network output\nto the original full-length temporal resolution for fast inference. Our method\nis general-purpose: it can be easily incorporated into common VPT models on\nboth seq2seq and seq2frame pipelines while effectively accommodating different\ntoken pruning and recovery strategies. In addition, our H$_{2}$OT reveals that\nmaintaining the full pose sequence is unnecessary, and a few pose tokens of\nrepresentative frames can achieve both high efficiency and estimation accuracy.\nExtensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate both the\neffectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.
