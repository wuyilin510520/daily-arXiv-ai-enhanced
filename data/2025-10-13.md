### [1] [Beyond CNNs: Efficient Fine-Tuning of Multi-Modal LLMs for Object Detection on Low-Data Regimes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08589)
*Nirmal Elamon,Rouzbeh Davoudi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fine-tuned multi-modal LLMs achieve up to 36% accuracy improvement on artificial text overlay detection using only 1,000 images, matching or surpassing CNN baselines that require much more data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge vision and language by exploring how LLMs can be adapted for precise visual understanding with minimal supervision, addressing the underexploited potential of pre-trained multi-modal LLMs on specialized visual tasks.

Method: Comprehensive comparison of fine-tuned traditional CNNs, zero-shot pre-trained multi-modal LLMs, and fine-tuned multi-modal LLMs on artificial text overlay detection in images.

Result: LLMs fine-tuned on very limited data (fewer than 1,000 images) achieved up to 36% accuracy improvement, matching or surpassing CNN-based baselines that typically require orders of magnitude more data.

Conclusion: LLM-based approaches demonstrate superior adaptability and data efficiency for real-world object detection tasks, providing actionable guidance for applying multi-modal transformers in low-resource visual environments.

Abstract: The field of object detection and understanding is rapidly evolving, driven
by advances in both traditional CNN-based models and emerging multi-modal large
language models (LLMs). While CNNs like ResNet and YOLO remain highly effective
for image-based tasks, recent transformer-based LLMs introduce new capabilities
such as dynamic context reasoning, language-guided prompts, and holistic scene
understanding. However, when used out-of-the-box, the full potential of LLMs
remains underexploited, often resulting in suboptimal performance on
specialized visual tasks. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison
of fine-tuned traditional CNNs, zero-shot pre-trained multi-modal LLMs, and
fine-tuned multi-modal LLMs on the challenging task of artificial text overlay
detection in images. A key contribution of our study is demonstrating that LLMs
can be effectively fine-tuned on very limited data (fewer than 1,000 images) to
achieve up to 36% accuracy improvement, matching or surpassing CNN-based
baselines that typically require orders of magnitude more data. By exploring
how language-guided models can be adapted for precise visual understanding with
minimal supervision, our work contributes to the broader effort of bridging
vision and language, offering novel insights into efficient cross-modal
learning strategies. These findings highlight the adaptability and data
efficiency of LLM-based approaches for real-world object detection tasks and
provide actionable guidance for applying multi-modal transformers in
low-resource visual environments. To support continued progress in this area,
we have made the code used to fine-tune the models available in our GitHub,
enabling future improvements and reuse in related applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in brain tumor segmentation including class imbalance and limited model generalization that hinder progress in diagnosis and treatment planning.

Method: Reproducible evaluation of U-Net segmentation with focal loss and basic data augmentation (horizontal flip, rotation, scaling) on publicly available MRI dataset, including focal loss parameter tuning.

Result: U-Net with focal loss achieved 90% precision, comparable to state-of-the-art results in brain tumor segmentation.

Conclusion: Establishes a transparent, reproducible baseline for future research on augmentation strategies and loss function design in brain tumor segmentation, with all code and results made publicly available.

Abstract: Brain tumor segmentation is crucial for diagnosis and treatment planning, yet
challenges such as class imbalance and limited model generalization continue to
hinder progress. This work presents a reproducible evaluation of U-Net
segmentation performance on brain tumor MRI using focal loss and basic data
augmentation strategies. Experiments were conducted on a publicly available MRI
dataset, focusing on focal loss parameter tuning and assessing the impact of
three data augmentation techniques: horizontal flip, rotation, and scaling. The
U-Net with focal loss achieved a precision of 90%, comparable to
state-of-the-art results. By making all code and results publicly available,
this study establishes a transparent, reproducible baseline to guide future
research on augmentation strategies and loss function design in brain tumor
segmentation.

### [3] [Adjusting Initial Noise to Mitigate Memorization in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08625)
*Hyeonggeun Han,Sehwan Kim,Hyungjun Joo,Sangwoo Hong,Jungwoo Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses memorization in text-to-image diffusion models by showing that initial noise samples affect when the denoising process escapes memorization basins, and proposes strategies to adjust initial noise for earlier escape while maintaining image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models often memorize training data, raising privacy and copyright concerns. Current methods that delay classifier-free guidance result in poor image-text alignment, creating a need for approaches that enable earlier escape from memorization basins.

Method: Two mitigation strategies: (1) collective adjustment of initial noise to find samples that encourage earlier basin escape, and (2) individual adjustment of initial noise samples to achieve the same goal.

Result: The proposed approaches significantly reduce memorization while preserving image-text alignment, enabling earlier application of classifier-free guidance without compromising output quality.

Conclusion: Initial noise selection plays a crucial role in memorization behavior, and strategically adjusting initial noise can effectively mitigate memorization while maintaining the generative capabilities of text-to-image diffusion models.

Abstract: Despite their impressive generative capabilities, text-to-image diffusion
models often memorize and replicate training data, prompting serious concerns
over privacy and copyright. Recent work has attributed this memorization to an
attraction basin-a region where applying classifier-free guidance (CFG) steers
the denoising trajectory toward memorized outputs-and has proposed deferring
CFG application until the denoising trajectory escapes this basin. However,
such delays often result in non-memorized images that are poorly aligned with
the input prompts, highlighting the need to promote earlier escape so that CFG
can be applied sooner in the denoising process. In this work, we show that the
initial noise sample plays a crucial role in determining when this escape
occurs. We empirically observe that different initial samples lead to varying
escape times. Building on this insight, we propose two mitigation strategies
that adjust the initial noise-either collectively or individually-to find and
utilize initial samples that encourage earlier basin escape. These approaches
significantly reduce memorization while preserving image-text alignment.

### [4] [The Digital Mirror: Gender Bias and Occupational Stereotypes in AI-Generated Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08628)
*Siiri Lepp√§lampi,Sonja M. Hyrynsalmi,Erno Vanhala*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Study examines gender representation biases in AI-generated occupational images from DALL-E 3 and Ideogram, finding both tools reinforce traditional gender stereotypes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in AI visualization research by focusing on representational biases rather than just creation process and image quality, as AI image tools become more widely used.

Method: Generated over 750 AI images of occupations using DALL-E 3 and Ideogram, then conducted thematic analysis to evaluate gender representation biases.

Result: Both DALL-E 3 and Ideogram reinforce traditional gender stereotypes in AI-generated images, though to varying degrees, risking reinforcement of narrow representations.

Conclusion: Proposes suggestions for practitioners, individuals and researchers to increase diverse representation when generating images with visible genders to mitigate harmful biases.

Abstract: Generative AI offers vast opportunities for creating visualisations, such as
graphics, videos, and images. However, recent studies around AI-generated
visualisations have primarily focused on the creation process and image
quality, overlooking representational biases. This study addresses this gap by
testing representation biases in AI-generated pictures in an occupational
setting and evaluating how two AI image generator tools, DALL-E 3 and Ideogram,
compare. Additionally, the study discusses topics such as ageing and emotions
in AI-generated images. As AI image tools are becoming more widely used,
addressing and mitigating harmful gender biases becomes essential to ensure
diverse representation in media and professional settings. In this study, over
750 AI-generated images of occupations were prompted. The thematic analysis
results revealed that both DALL-E 3 and Ideogram reinforce traditional gender
stereotypes in AI-generated images, although to varying degrees. These findings
emphasise that AI visualisation tools risk reinforcing narrow representations.
In our discussion section, we propose suggestions for practitioners,
individuals and researchers to increase representation when generating images
with visible genders.

### [5] [Dynamic Mixture-of-Experts for Visual Autoregressive Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08629)
*Jort Vincenti,Metod Jazbec,Guoxuan Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VAR models suffer from computational redundancy. A dynamic Mixture-of-Experts router is introduced with scale-aware thresholding to reduce FLOPs by 20% and speed up inference by 11% while maintaining image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual Autoregressive Models (VAR) have computational redundancy due to repeated Transformer calls at increasing resolutions, which affects efficiency.

Method: Integrate a dynamic Mixture-of-Experts router with scale-aware thresholding that balances expert selection based on token complexity and resolution, without requiring additional training.

Result: Achieved 20% fewer FLOPs, 11% faster inference, and matched the image quality of the dense baseline.

Conclusion: The proposed dynamic Mixture-of-Experts router effectively reduces computational costs while maintaining image generation quality in VAR models.

Abstract: Visual Autoregressive Models (VAR) offer efficient and high-quality image
generation but suffer from computational redundancy due to repeated Transformer
calls at increasing resolutions. We introduce a dynamic Mixture-of-Experts
router integrated into VAR. The new architecture allows to trade compute for
quality through scale-aware thresholding. This thresholding strategy balances
expert selection based on token complexity and resolution, without requiring
additional training. As a result, we achieve 20% fewer FLOPs, 11% faster
inference and match the image quality achieved by the dense baseline.

### [6] [Out-of-Distribution Detection in LiDAR Semantic Segmentation Using Epistemic Uncertainty from Hierarchical GMMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08631)
*Hanieh Shojaei Miandashti,Claus Brenner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unsupervised OOD detection method using epistemic uncertainty from hierarchical Bayesian modeling of GMM parameters in neural network feature space, outperforming predictive entropy approaches without auxiliary data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unsupervised OOD detection methods conflate epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties, misclassifying ambiguous in-distribution regions as OOD. Need to prevent incorrect assignment of unknown objects to known classes in LiDAR point cloud segmentation.

Method: Uses hierarchical Bayesian modeling of Gaussian Mixture Model parameters in deep neural network feature space to derive epistemic uncertainty, avoiding the need for auxiliary OOD datasets or additional training stages.

Result: Achieved 18% improvement in AUROC, 22% increase in AUPRC, and 36% reduction in FPR95 (from 76% to 40%) compared to predictive entropy methods on SemanticKITTI dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed epistemic uncertainty-based approach effectively separates OOD detection from data ambiguity, significantly outperforming existing uncertainty-based methods without requiring auxiliary data.

Abstract: In addition to accurate scene understanding through precise semantic
segmentation of LiDAR point clouds, detecting out-of-distribution (OOD)
objects, instances not encountered during training, is essential to prevent the
incorrect assignment of unknown objects to known classes. While supervised OOD
detection methods depend on auxiliary OOD datasets, unsupervised methods avoid
this requirement but typically rely on predictive entropy, the entropy of the
predictive distribution obtained by averaging over an ensemble or multiple
posterior weight samples. However, these methods often conflate epistemic
(model) and aleatoric (data) uncertainties, misclassifying ambiguous in
distribution regions as OOD. To address this issue, we present an unsupervised
OOD detection approach that employs epistemic uncertainty derived from
hierarchical Bayesian modeling of Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) parameters in
the feature space of a deep neural network. Without requiring auxiliary data or
additional training stages, our approach outperforms existing uncertainty-based
methods on the SemanticKITTI dataset, achieving an 18\% improvement in AUROC,
22\% increase in AUPRC, and 36\% reduction in FPR95 (from 76\% to 40\%),
compared to the predictive entropy approach used in prior works.

### [7] [Hi-OSCAR: Hierarchical Open-set Classifier for Human Activity Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08635)
*Conor McCarthy,Loes Quirijnen,Jan Peter van Zandwijk,Zeno Geradts,Marcel Worring*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hi-OSCAR is a hierarchical open-set classifier for activity recognition that identifies known activities with high accuracy while rejecting unknown ones, and can localize unknown classes to the nearest internal node in the hierarchy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a gap between real-world activities and annotated sensor datasets in HAR, and traditional classifiers fail to handle unseen activities properly. Also, activity classes have varying degrees of similarity and hierarchical relationships.

Method: Proposed Hi-OSCAR: a hierarchical open-set classifier that arranges activity classes into a structured hierarchy and can reject unknown activities while localizing them to the nearest internal node.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for known activities while enabling open-set classification. A new dataset NFI_FARED with 19 activities from various contexts was collected to support open-set HAR research.

Conclusion: Hi-OSCAR provides reliable open-set classification in HAR by leveraging hierarchical structure, offering more insight than binary known/unknown classification, and the NFI_FARED dataset enables future research in this area.

Abstract: Within Human Activity Recognition (HAR), there is an insurmountable gap
between the range of activities performed in life and those that can be
captured in an annotated sensor dataset used in training. Failure to properly
handle unseen activities seriously undermines any HAR classifier's reliability.
Additionally within HAR, not all classes are equally dissimilar, some
significantly overlap or encompass other sub-activities. Based on these
observations, we arrange activity classes into a structured hierarchy. From
there, we propose Hi-OSCAR: a Hierarchical Open-set Classifier for Activity
Recognition, that can identify known activities at state-of-the-art accuracy
while simultaneously rejecting unknown activities. This not only enables
open-set classification, but also allows for unknown classes to be localized to
the nearest internal node, providing insight beyond a binary "known/unknown"
classification. To facilitate this and future open-set HAR research, we
collected a new dataset: NFI_FARED. NFI_FARED contains data from multiple
subjects performing nineteen activities from a range of contexts, including
daily living, commuting, and rapid movements, which is fully public and
available for download.

### [8] [Detection of high-frequency oscillations using time-frequency analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08637)
*Mostafa Mohammadpour,Mehdi Zekriyapanah Gashti,Yusif S. Gasimov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel unsupervised clustering method for detecting high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) in epilepsy patients achieves high accuracy (97.67% sensitivity, 98.57% precision) and shows strong correlation with surgical outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual identification of HFOs is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and subjective, making automated detection methods critical for research and clinical use in epilepsy treatment.

Method: Uses unsupervised clustering technique to categorize events extracted from time-frequency domain using S-transform, differentiating HFOs from spikes, background activity, and artifacts in ripple and fast ripple frequency bands (80-500 Hz).

Result: Achieved 97.67% sensitivity, 98.57% precision, and 97.78% F-score on controlled dataset. In epilepsy patients, showed 0.73 ratio between HFOs rates in resected vs non-resected contacts, correlating strongly with surgical outcomes.

Conclusion: HFOs are promising biomarkers of epileptogenicity. Removing HFOs, especially fast ripple, leads to seizure freedom, while remaining HFOs lead to seizure recurrence, confirming their clinical importance.

Abstract: High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) are a new biomarker for identifying the
epileptogenic zone. Mapping HFO-generating regions can improve the precision of
resection sites in patients with refractory epilepsy. However, detecting HFOs
remains challenging, and their clinical features are not yet fully defined.
Visual identification of HFOs is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and
subjective. As a result, developing automated methods to detect HFOs is
critical for research and clinical use. In this study, we developed a novel
method for detecting HFOs in the ripple and fast ripple frequency bands (80-500
Hz). We validated it using both controlled datasets and data from epilepsy
patients. Our method employs an unsupervised clustering technique to categorize
events extracted from the time-frequency domain using the S-transform. The
proposed detector differentiates HFOs events from spikes, background activity,
and artifacts. Compared to existing detectors, our method achieved a
sensitivity of 97.67%, a precision of 98.57%, and an F-score of 97.78% on the
controlled dataset. In epilepsy patients, our results showed a stronger
correlation with surgical outcomes, with a ratio of 0.73 between HFOs rates in
resected versus non-resected contacts. The study confirmed previous findings
that HFOs are promising biomarkers of epileptogenicity in epileptic patients.
Removing HFOs, especially fast ripple, leads to seizure freedom, while
remaining HFOs lead to seizure recurrence.

### [9] [Into the Rabbit Hull: From Task-Relevant Concepts in DINO to Minkowski Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08638)
*Thomas Fel,Binxu Wang,Michael A. Lepori,Matthew Kowal,Andrew Lee,Randall Balestriero,Sonia Joseph,Ekdeep S. Lubana,Talia Konkle,Demba Ba,Martin Wattenberg*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper analyzes DINOv2's internal representations using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), revealing functional specialization across tasks, geometric properties of learned concepts, and proposes a new Minkowski Representation Hypothesis based on convex mixtures of archetypes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand what DINOv2 actually perceives internally, as it's widely used for object recognition, scene understanding, and action recognition but its internal representations remain unknown.

Method: Adopted Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH) operationalized using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to create a 32,000-unit dictionary, then analyzed functional specialization across tasks, geometric properties of learned concepts, and proposed Minkowski Representation Hypothesis.

Result: Found functional specialization: classification uses 'Elsewhere' concepts (negations), segmentation relies on boundary detectors, depth estimation uses monocular depth cues. Representations are partly dense rather than strictly sparse, organized in low-dimensional locally connected sets. Concepts form convex mixtures of archetypes.

Conclusion: Proposes Minkowski Representation Hypothesis (MRH) where tokens are formed by combining convex mixtures of archetypes, grounded in Gardenfors' conceptual spaces and multi-head attention mechanisms, providing a refined view of vision-transformer representations.

Abstract: DINOv2 is routinely deployed to recognize objects, scenes, and actions; yet
the nature of what it perceives remains unknown. As a working baseline, we
adopt the Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH) and operationalize it using
SAEs, producing a 32,000-unit dictionary that serves as the interpretability
backbone of our study, which unfolds in three parts.
  In the first part, we analyze how different downstream tasks recruit concepts
from our learned dictionary, revealing functional specialization:
classification exploits "Elsewhere" concepts that fire everywhere except on
target objects, implementing learned negations; segmentation relies on boundary
detectors forming coherent subspaces; depth estimation draws on three distinct
monocular depth cues matching visual neuroscience principles.
  Following these functional results, we analyze the geometry and statistics of
the concepts learned by the SAE. We found that representations are partly dense
rather than strictly sparse. The dictionary evolves toward greater coherence
and departs from maximally orthogonal ideals (Grassmannian frames). Within an
image, tokens occupy a low dimensional, locally connected set persisting after
removing position. These signs suggest representations are organized beyond
linear sparsity alone.
  Synthesizing these observations, we propose a refined view: tokens are formed
by combining convex mixtures of archetypes (e.g., a rabbit among animals, brown
among colors, fluffy among textures). This structure is grounded in Gardenfors'
conceptual spaces and in the model's mechanism as multi-head attention produces
sums of convex mixtures, defining regions bounded by archetypes. We introduce
the Minkowski Representation Hypothesis (MRH) and examine its empirical
signatures and implications for interpreting vision-transformer
representations.

### [10] [PhyDAE: Physics-Guided Degradation-Adaptive Experts for All-in-One Remote Sensing Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08653)
*Zhe Dong,Yuzhe Sun,Haochen Jiang,Tianzhu Liu,Yanfeng Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhyDAE is a physics-guided degradation-adaptive method for remote sensing image restoration that explicitly models multiple heterogeneous degradations (haze, noise, blur, low-light) using a two-stage cascaded architecture with progressive degradation mining mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing all-in-one restoration methods overly rely on implicit feature representations and lack explicit modeling of degradation physics, making them ineffective for handling complex and heterogeneous degradations in remote sensing images.

Method: Two-stage cascaded architecture with Residual Manifold Projector (RMP) and Frequency-Aware Degradation Decomposer (FADD) for comprehensive degradation analysis, plus physics-aware expert modules with temperature-controlled sparse activation strategies.

Result: Superior performance across all four restoration tasks on three benchmark datasets, with substantial improvements in restoration quality while achieving significant reductions in parameter count and computational complexity.

Conclusion: PhyDAE achieves optimal balance between performance and efficiency, comprehensively outperforming state-of-the-art methods in remote sensing image restoration.

Abstract: Remote sensing images inevitably suffer from various degradation factors
during acquisition, including atmospheric interference, sensor limitations, and
imaging conditions. These complex and heterogeneous degradations pose severe
challenges to image quality and downstream interpretation tasks. Addressing
limitations of existing all-in-one restoration methods that overly rely on
implicit feature representations and lack explicit modeling of degradation
physics, this paper proposes Physics-Guided Degradation-Adaptive Experts
(PhyDAE). The method employs a two-stage cascaded architecture transforming
degradation information from implicit features into explicit decision signals,
enabling precise identification and differentiated processing of multiple
heterogeneous degradations including haze, noise, blur, and low-light
conditions. The model incorporates progressive degradation mining and
exploitation mechanisms, where the Residual Manifold Projector (RMP) and
Frequency-Aware Degradation Decomposer (FADD) comprehensively analyze
degradation characteristics from manifold geometry and frequency perspectives.
Physics-aware expert modules and temperature-controlled sparse activation
strategies are introduced to enhance computational efficiency while ensuring
imaging physics consistency. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets
(MD-RSID, MD-RRSHID, and MDRS-Landsat) demonstrate that PhyDAE achieves
superior performance across all four restoration tasks, comprehensively
outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Notably, PhyDAE substantially improves
restoration quality while achieving significant reductions in parameter count
and computational complexity, resulting in remarkable efficiency gains compared
to mainstream approaches and achieving optimal balance between performance and
efficiency. Code is available at https://github.com/HIT-SIRS/PhyDAE.

Abstract: Real-world clinical decision-making grapples with integrating information
from diverse data modalities, including medical text, 2D/3D images, and video,

across all these modalities. Built upon a unified patch-based vision encoder
and an LLM decoder, Hulu-Med was progressively trained on 16.7 million (M)
samples to scale from 2D to 3D and video comprehension. The medical-aware token
reduction enables efficient training, requiring only 4,000 to 40,000 GPU hours
for 7B to 32B parameter variants. Extensive evaluation across 30 benchmarks
exhibits state-of-the-art performance, surpassing leading open-source models
and competing with proprietary systems in tasks spanning visual
question-answering, medical report generation, and complex reasoning in
multilingual and rare disease scenarios. By open-sourcing our complete
pipeline, we establish that high-performance medical VLM can be achieved
transparently, providing a foundational tool for accessible and impactful
clinical AI. Code is released on

### [12] [Thinking with Camera: A Unified Multimodal Model for Camera-Centric Understanding and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08673)
*Kang Liao,Size Wu,Zhonghua Wu,Linyi Jin,Chao Wang,Yikai Wang,Fei Wang,Wei Li,Chen Change Loy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Puffin is a unified multimodal model that integrates camera-centric understanding and generation, treating camera parameters as language to enable spatial reasoning and scene creation from arbitrary viewpoints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between camera-centric understanding and generation, which are typically studied separately, and create a unified model for spatial intelligence tasks.

Method: Introduces a novel paradigm that treats camera as language, integrates language regression and diffusion-based generation, and is trained on Puffin-4M dataset with 4 million vision-language-camera triplets using both global camera parameters and pixel-wise camera maps.

Result: Puffin demonstrates superior performance over specialized models for camera-centric generation and understanding, and generalizes to diverse cross-view tasks through instruction tuning.

Conclusion: Puffin advances multimodal spatial intelligence research by providing a unified approach to camera-centric tasks, with plans to release code, models, dataset pipeline, and benchmark.

Abstract: Camera-centric understanding and generation are two cornerstones of spatial
intelligence, yet they are typically studied in isolation. We present Puffin, a
unified camera-centric multimodal model that extends spatial awareness along
the camera dimension. Puffin integrates language regression and diffusion-based
generation to interpret and create scenes from arbitrary viewpoints. To bridge
the modality gap between cameras and vision-language, we introduce a novel
paradigm that treats camera as language, enabling thinking with camera. This
guides the model to align spatially grounded visual cues with photographic
terminology while reasoning across geometric context. Puffin is trained on
Puffin-4M, a large-scale dataset of 4 million vision-language-camera triplets.
We incorporate both global camera parameters and pixel-wise camera maps,
yielding flexible and reliable spatial generation. Experiments demonstrate
Puffin superior performance over specialized models for camera-centric
generation and understanding. With instruction tuning, Puffin generalizes to
diverse cross-view tasks such as spatial imagination, world exploration, and
photography guidance. We will release the code, models, dataset pipeline, and
benchmark to advance multimodal spatial intelligence research.

### [13] [Structured Output Regularization: a framework for few-shot transfer learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08728)
*Nicolas Ewen,Jairo Diaz-Rodriguez,Kelly Ramsay*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Structured Output Regularization (SOR) - a transfer learning method that freezes internal network structures while using group lasso and L1 penalties to adapt models to specific data with minimal parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional transfer learning with frozen weights limits adaptation to domain-specific features and can still overfit with limited data.

Method: Freeze internal network structures (e.g., convolutional filters) and use combination of group lasso and L1 penalties to tailor models to specific data with minimal additional parameters.

Result: Achieved competitive results on three few-shot medical imaging classification tasks using DenseNet121 and EfficientNetB4 bases compared to established benchmarks.

Conclusion: SOR is a simple yet effective framework that enables broad applicability for transfer learning tasks with minimal parameter overhead.

Abstract: Traditional transfer learning typically reuses large pre-trained networks by
freezing some of their weights and adding task-specific layers. While this
approach is computationally efficient, it limits the model's ability to adapt
to domain-specific features and can still lead to overfitting with very limited
data. To address these limitations, we propose Structured Output Regularization
(SOR), a simple yet effective framework that freezes the internal network
structures (e.g., convolutional filters) while using a combination of group
lasso and $L_1$ penalties. This framework tailors the model to specific data
with minimal additional parameters and is easily applicable to various network
components, such as convolutional filters or various blocks in neural networks
enabling broad applicability for transfer learning tasks. We evaluate SOR on
three few shot medical imaging classification tasks and we achieve competitive
results using DenseNet121, and EfficientNetB4 bases compared to established
benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BEAR is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating multimodal large language models' embodied capabilities across 14 domains, revealing persistent limitations and proposing BEAR-Agent to enhance perception and planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for multimodal LLMs focus on specific domains like planning or spatial understanding, lacking systematic evaluation of comprehensive embodied capabilities needed for physical world interaction.

Method: Created BEAR benchmark with 4,469 multimodal entries across 14 domains in 6 categories, and proposed BEAR-Agent that integrates pretrained vision models to strengthen MLLM perception, 3D understanding, and planning.

Result: Evaluation of 20 MLLMs showed persistent limitations across all embodied domains. BEAR-Agent achieved 9.12% absolute gain and 17.5% relative improvement on GPT-5, and improved performance in simulated environments.

Conclusion: BEAR provides systematic evaluation of embodied capabilities, revealing MLLM limitations, and BEAR-Agent demonstrates that enhancing embodied capabilities can benefit broader embodied tasks.

Abstract: Embodied capabilities refer to a suite of fundamental abilities for an agent
to perceive, comprehend, and interact with the physical world. While multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) show promise as embodied agents, a thorough and
systematic evaluation of their embodied capabilities remains underexplored, as
existing benchmarks primarily focus on specific domains such as planning or
spatial understanding. To bridge this gap, we introduce BEAR, a comprehensive
and fine-grained benchmark that evaluates MLLMs on atomic embodied
capabilities. BEAR comprises 4,469 interleaved image-video-text entries across
14 domains in 6 categories, including tasks from low-level pointing, trajectory
understanding, spatial reasoning, to high-level planning. Extensive evaluation
results of 20 representative MLLMs reveal their persistent limitations across
all domains of embodied capabilities. To tackle the shortfall, we propose
BEAR-Agent, a multimodal conversable agent that integrates pretrained vision
models to strengthen MLLM perception, 3D understanding, and planning
capabilities. It substantially enhances MLLM performance across diverse
embodied capabilities on BEAR, yielding a 9.12% absolute gain and a relative
improvement of 17.5% on GPT-5. Furthermore, our experiments indicate that
improving MLLM embodied capabilities can benefit embodied tasks in simulated
environments. Project website: https://bear-official66.github.io/

### [15] [SAFER-AiD: Saccade-Assisted Foveal-peripheral vision Enhanced Reconstruction for Adversarial Defense](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08761)
*Jiayang Liu,Daniel Tso,Yiming Bu,Qinru Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A biologically inspired defense framework that uses foveal-peripheral processing, saccadic eye movements, and cortical filling-in to mitigate adversarial attacks without requiring classifier retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional adversarial defenses are computationally intensive, while the human visual system achieves inherent robustness through biological mechanisms. The paper aims to replicate this biological robustness in deep learning models.

Method: Proposes a defense framework using reinforcement learning-guided saccades to capture multiple foveal-peripheral glimpses, which are integrated into reconstructed images before classification. Incorporates three biological mechanisms: foveal-peripheral processing, saccadic eye movements, and cortical filling-in.

Result: Experiments on ImageNet show improved system robustness across diverse classifiers and attack types. The method significantly reduces training overhead compared to other defense techniques while preserving semantic integrity.

Conclusion: The biologically inspired preprocessing effectively mitigates adversarial noise and enables seamless integration with existing systems without requiring retraining or fine-tuning of downstream classifiers.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks significantly challenge the safe deployment of deep
learning models, particularly in real-world applications. Traditional defenses
often rely on computationally intensive optimization (e.g., adversarial
training or data augmentation) to improve robustness, whereas the human visual
system achieves inherent robustness to adversarial perturbations through
evolved biological mechanisms. We hypothesize that attention guided
non-homogeneous sparse sampling and predictive coding plays a key role in this
robustness. To test this hypothesis, we propose a novel defense framework
incorporating three key biological mechanisms: foveal-peripheral processing,
saccadic eye movements, and cortical filling-in. Our approach employs
reinforcement learning-guided saccades to selectively capture multiple
foveal-peripheral glimpses, which are integrated into a reconstructed image
before classification. This biologically inspired preprocessing effectively
mitigates adversarial noise, preserves semantic integrity, and notably requires
no retraining or fine-tuning of downstream classifiers, enabling seamless
integration with existing systems. Experiments on the ImageNet dataset
demonstrate that our method improves system robustness across diverse
classifiers and attack types, while significantly reducing training overhead
compared to both biologically and non-biologically inspired defense techniques.

TL;DR: LinearSR introduces a holistic framework that overcomes key challenges in applying Linear Attention to photorealistic image super-resolution, achieving state-of-the-art perceptual quality with exceptional efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational bottleneck of self-attention's quadratic complexity in generative SR models and unlock the potential of Linear Attention's O(N) efficiency for photorealistic super-resolution.

Method: Uses three key innovations: 1) ESGF strategy to resolve training instability, 2) SNR-based MoE architecture to mitigate perception-distortion trade-off, and 3) TAG guidance paradigm based on 'precision-over-volume' principle.

Result: LinearSR delivers SOTA perceptual quality with exceptional efficiency, achieving SOTA-level speed in core diffusion forward pass while maintaining competitive multi-step inference time.

Conclusion: This work provides the first robust methodology for applying Linear Attention in photorealistic SR domain, establishing a foundational paradigm for future efficient generative super-resolution research.

Abstract: Generative models for Image Super-Resolution (SR) are increasingly powerful,
yet their reliance on self-attention's quadratic complexity (O(N^2)) creates a
major computational bottleneck. Linear Attention offers an O(N) solution, but
its promise for photorealistic SR has remained largely untapped, historically
hindered by a cascade of interrelated and previously unsolved challenges. This
paper introduces LinearSR, a holistic framework that, for the first time,
systematically overcomes these critical hurdles. Specifically, we resolve a
fundamental, training instability that causes catastrophic model divergence
using our novel "knee point"-based Early-Stopping Guided Fine-tuning (ESGF)
strategy. Furthermore, we mitigate the classic perception-distortion trade-off
with a dedicated SNR-based Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. Finally, we
establish an effective and lightweight guidance paradigm, TAG, derived from our
"precision-over-volume" principle. Our resulting LinearSR model simultaneously
delivers state-of-the-art perceptual quality with exceptional efficiency. Its
core diffusion forward pass (1-NFE) achieves SOTA-level speed, while its
overall multi-step inference time remains highly competitive. This work
provides the first robust methodology for applying Linear Attention in the
photorealistic SR domain, establishing a foundational paradigm for future
research in efficient generative super-resolution.

TL;DR: A pipeline for extracting key frames from kƒÅkƒÅ parrot videos using computer vision for non-invasive wildlife re-identification, achieving high accuracy without physical tagging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional wildlife monitoring methods like leg banding are invasive and time-consuming. Computer vision offers non-invasive alternatives for efficient conservation.

Method: Unsupervised pipeline combining YOLO and Grounding DINO for object detection, optical flow blur detection, DINOv2 for image encoding, and clustering to identify representative key frames from feeder videos.

Result: The key frame selection methods achieved high accuracy in kƒÅkƒÅ re-identification, providing a foundation for monitoring in challenging environments.

Conclusion: This AI-based approach offers a valuable non-invasive alternative to traditional tagging methods, contributing to improved wildlife monitoring in ecology and conservation biology.

Abstract: Accurate recognition and re-identification of individual animals is essential
for successful wildlife population monitoring. Traditional methods, such as leg
banding of birds, are time consuming and invasive. Recent progress in
artificial intelligence, particularly computer vision, offers encouraging
solutions for smart conservation and efficient automation. This study presents
a unique pipeline for extracting high-quality key frames from videos of
k\={a}k\={a} (Nestor meridionalis), a threatened forest-dwelling parrot in New
Zealand. Key frame extraction is well-studied in person re-identification,
however, its application to wildlife is limited. Using video recordings at a
custom-built feeder, we extract key frames and evaluate the re-identification
performance of our pipeline. Our unsupervised methodology combines object
detection using YOLO and Grounding DINO, optical flow blur detection, image
encoding with DINOv2, and clustering methods to identify representative key
frames. The results indicate that our proposed key frame selection methods
yield image collections which achieve high accuracy in k\={a}k\={a}
re-identification, providing a foundation for future research using media
collected in more diverse and challenging environments. Through the use of
artificial intelligence and computer vision, our non-invasive and efficient
approach provides a valuable alternative to traditional physical tagging
methods for recognising k\={a}k\={a} individuals and therefore improving the
monitoring of populations. This research contributes to developing fresh
approaches in wildlife monitoring, with applications in ecology and
conservation biology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Q-Router is an agentic framework for universal video quality assessment that uses vision-language models as dynamic routers to ensemble expert models based on video semantics, achieving superior generalization and interpretability across diverse video types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VQA models suffer from poor generalization across different video types (UGC, short-form, AIGC), limited interpretability, and lack of extensibility to new use cases or content types.

Method: Multi-tier model routing system with VLMs as real-time routers that dynamically reason and ensemble appropriate expert models based on input video semantics, including a heavy tier for spatiotemporal artifacts localization.

Result: Matches or surpasses state-of-the-art VQA models on various benchmarks, substantially improves generalization and interpretability, excels on Q-Bench-Video, and capably localizes spatiotemporal artifacts.

Conclusion: Q-Router shows promise as a foundation for next-generation VQA systems and potential as a reward function for post-training video generation models due to its flexibility, robustness, and interpretability.

Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) is a fundamental computer vision task that
aims to predict the perceptual quality of a given video in alignment with human
judgments. Existing performant VQA models trained with direct score supervision
suffer from (1) poor generalization across diverse content and tasks, ranging
from user-generated content (UGC), short-form videos, to AI-generated content
(AIGC), (2) limited interpretability, and (3) lack of extensibility to novel
use cases or content types. We propose Q-Router, an agentic framework for
universal VQA with a multi-tier model routing system. Q-Router integrates a
diverse set of expert models and employs vision--language models (VLMs) as
real-time routers that dynamically reason and then ensemble the most
appropriate experts conditioned on the input video semantics. We build a
multi-tiered routing system based on the computing budget, with the heaviest
tier involving a specific spatiotemporal artifacts localization for
interpretability. This agentic design enables Q-Router to combine the
complementary strengths of specialized experts, achieving both flexibility and
robustness in delivering consistent performance across heterogeneous video
sources and tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Q-Router matches or
surpasses state-of-the-art VQA models on a variety of benchmarks, while
substantially improving generalization and interpretability. Moreover, Q-Router
excels on the quality-based question answering benchmark, Q-Bench-Video,
highlighting its promise as a foundation for next-generation VQA systems.
Finally, we show that Q-Router capably localizes spatiotemporal artifacts,
showing potential as a reward function for post-training video generation
models.

*Yuanhao Zou,Zhaozheng Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified framework for Medical Visual Question Answering that addresses modality alignment challenges, hard negative mining, and knowledge fusion through multi-level alignment, soft-label-based hard negative mining, and gated cross-attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Med-VQA approaches lack unified modality alignment solutions, under-explore hard negatives, and may introduce irrelevant information through knowledge fusion techniques.

Method: Three key components: (1) unified multi-level modality alignment using contrastive learning and optimal transport, (2) soft-label-based hard negative mining for better discrimination, (3) gated cross-attention module that integrates answer vocabulary as prior knowledge.

Result: Outperforms previous state-of-the-art on multiple Med-VQA datasets including RAD-VQA, SLAKE, PathVQA and VQA-2019.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses key challenges in Med-VQA through comprehensive modality alignment, improved negative mining, and selective knowledge integration.

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) is a challenging task that
requires a deep understanding of both medical images and textual questions.
Although recent works leveraging Medical Vision-Language Pre-training (Med-VLP)
have shown strong performance on the Med-VQA task, there is still no unified
solution for modality alignment, and the issue of hard negatives remains
under-explored. Additionally, commonly used knowledge fusion techniques for
Med-VQA may introduce irrelevant information. In this work, we propose a
framework to address these challenges through three key contributions: (1) a
unified solution for heterogeneous modality alignments across multiple levels,
modalities, views, and stages, leveraging methods like contrastive learning and
optimal transport theory; (2) a hard negative mining method that employs soft
labels for multi-modality alignments and enforces the hard negative pair
discrimination; and (3) a Gated Cross-Attention Module for Med-VQA that
integrates the answer vocabulary as prior knowledge and selects relevant
information from it. Our framework outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on
widely used Med-VQA datasets like RAD-VQA, SLAKE, PathVQA and VQA-2019.

TL;DR: SkipSR accelerates video super-resolution by identifying and skipping computation on low-detail regions, achieving up to 60% faster latency without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based super-resolution is slow and expensive, limiting scalability to higher resolutions and longer videos, while many video regions are low-detail and don't need refinement.

Method: Propose SkipSR framework that identifies low-detail regions from low-resolution input and skips computation on them entirely, only super-resolving areas that require refinement.

Result: Achieves up to 60% faster end-to-end latency than prior models on 720p videos with no perceptible loss in quality, working with both standard and one-step diffusion SR models.

Conclusion: SkipSR provides an effective strategy for accelerating video super-resolution while preserving perceptual quality by selectively processing only regions that need refinement.

Abstract: Diffusion-based super-resolution (SR) is a key component in video generation
and video restoration, but is slow and expensive, limiting scalability to
higher resolutions and longer videos. Our key insight is that many regions in
video are inherently low-detail and gain little from refinement, yet current
methods process all pixels uniformly. To take advantage of this, we propose
SkipSR, a simple framework for accelerating video SR by identifying low-detail
regions directly from low-resolution input, then skipping computation on them
entirely, only super-resolving the areas that require refinement. This simple
yet effective strategy preserves perceptual quality in both standard and
one-step diffusion SR models while significantly reducing computation. In
standard SR benchmarks, our method achieves up to 60% faster end-to-end latency
than prior models on 720p videos with no perceptible loss in quality. Video

*Yiyang Huang,Yizhou Wang,Yun Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: D-CoDe is a training-free framework that adapts image-pretrained vision-language models for video understanding by addressing perception bottlenecks and token overload through dynamic compression and question decomposition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending image-based vision-language models to video is challenging due to dense temporal inputs that exceed model capacity, creating perception bottlenecks and token overload issues.

Method: Uses dynamic compression (adaptive frame selection and content-aware spatial token aggregation) to reduce redundancy, and question decomposition (reformulating queries into sub-questions) to guide focused video understanding.

Result: Effectively improves video understanding across various benchmarks and shows strong performance on challenging long-video tasks.

Conclusion: D-CoDe demonstrates potential for handling complex video-language tasks by efficiently adapting image-pretrained models without additional training.

Abstract: Video large language models (Vid-LLMs), which excel in diverse video-language
tasks, can be effectively constructed by adapting image-pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs). However, this adaptation remains challenging, as
it requires processing dense and temporally extended visual inputs that exceed
the capacity of image-based models. This paper identifies the perception
bottleneck and token overload as key challenges in extending image-based VLMs
to the video domain. To address these issues, we propose D-CoDe, a
training-free adaptation framework that incorporates dynamic compression and
question decomposition. Specifically, dynamic compression alleviates the
perception bottleneck through adaptive selection of representative frames and
content-aware aggregation of spatial tokens, thereby reducing redundancy while
preserving informative content. In parallel, question decomposition mitigates
token overload by reformulating the original query into sub-questions, guiding
the model to focus on distinct aspects of the video and enabling more
comprehensive understanding. Experiments demonstrate that D-CoDe effectively
improves video understanding across various benchmarks. Furthermore, strong
performance on the challenging long-video benchmark highlights the potential of
D-CoDe in handling complex video-language tasks. Code is available at

*Hongrui Wu,Zhicheng Gao,Jin Cao,Kelu Yao,Wen Shen,Zhihua Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FOLK is a fast open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation method that uses label-guided knowledge distillation to transfer open-vocabulary knowledge from a 2D teacher model to a 3D student model, avoiding noisy 2D mappings and significantly accelerating inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods map 3D instances to 2D RGB-D images for classification using vision-language models, but this introduces noise from 2D occlusions and incurs high computational costs, slowing down inference speed.

Method: Design a teacher model that generates high-quality 2D CLIP embeddings for 3D instances with visibility and viewpoint diversity, then distill this knowledge into a 3D student model using label-guided distillation to directly produce 3D embeddings.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet200 with AP50 score of 35.7, while running 6.0x to 152.2x faster than previous methods.

Conclusion: FOLK successfully addresses the limitations of existing methods by enabling direct 3D instance classification through knowledge distillation, achieving both superior performance and significantly faster inference speeds.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation seeks to segment and classify
instances beyond the annotated label space. Existing methods typically map 3D
instances to 2D RGB-D images, and then employ vision-language models (VLMs) for
classification. However, such a mapping strategy usually introduces noise from
2D occlusions and incurs substantial computational and memory costs during
inference, slowing down the inference speed. To address the above problems, we
propose a Fast Open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation method via Label-guided
Knowledge distillation (FOLK). Our core idea is to design a teacher model that
extracts high-quality instance embeddings and distills its open-vocabulary
knowledge into a 3D student model. In this way, during inference, the distilled
3D model can directly classify instances from the 3D point cloud, avoiding
noise caused by occlusions and significantly accelerating the inference
process. Specifically, we first design a teacher model to generate a 2D CLIP
embedding for each 3D instance, incorporating both visibility and viewpoint
diversity, which serves as the learning target for distillation. We then
develop a 3D student model that directly produces a 3D embedding for each 3D
instance. During training, we propose a label-guided distillation algorithm to
distill open-vocabulary knowledge from label-consistent 2D embeddings into the
student model. FOLK conducted experiments on the ScanNet200 and Replica
datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNet200 dataset with
an AP50 score of 35.7, while running approximately 6.0x to 152.2x faster than
previous methods. All codes will be released after the paper is accepted.

*Ronan John,Anis Chihoub,Ryan Meegan,Gina Sidelli,Jeffery Neyhart,Peter Oudemans,Kristin Dana*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-supervised vision transformer method for monitoring cranberry crop growth using time-lapse images without manual annotations, enabling growth prediction and variety comparison.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual change monitoring in cranberry farming is time-consuming, and deep learning approaches require tedious image annotations and produce hard-to-interpret features.

Method: Fine-tuning vision transformers using self-supervised learning with two pretext tasks (time regression and class prediction) to learn temporal evolution of plant appearance from time-lapse images.

Result: Created interpretable 2D temporal tracks that model crop growth over time and distinguish temporal differences between cranberry varieties. Also provided a novel time-lapse dataset of 8 cranberry varieties observed 52 times over 4 months.

Conclusion: The approach provides an interpretable time-series model for crop growth monitoring that avoids manual annotations and can be generalized to other crops.

Abstract: Change monitoring is an essential task for cranberry farming as it provides
both breeders and growers with the ability to analyze growth, predict yield,
and make treatment decisions. However, this task is often done manually,
requiring significant time on the part of a cranberry grower or breeder. Deep
learning based change monitoring holds promise, despite the caveat of
hard-to-interpret high dimensional features and hand-annotations for
fine-tuning. To address this gap, we introduce a method for modeling crop
growth based on fine-tuning vision transformers (ViTs) using a self-supervised
approach that avoids tedious image annotations. We use a two-fold pretext task
(time regression and class prediction) to learn a latent space for the
time-lapse evolution of plant and fruit appearance. The resulting 2D temporal
tracks provide an interpretable time-series model of crop growth that can be
used to: 1) predict growth over time and 2) distinguish temporal differences of
cranberry varieties. We also provide a novel time-lapse dataset of cranberry
fruit featuring eight distinct varieties, observed 52 times over the growing
season (span of around four months), annotated with information about fungicide
application, yield, and rot. Our approach is general and can be applied to
other crops and applications (code and dataset can be found at https://github.

*Daiki Yoshikawa,Takashi Matsubara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PHyCLIP is a vision-language model that uses an ‚Ñì‚ÇÅ-Product metric on a Cartesian product of hyperbolic factors to simultaneously capture hierarchical relationships within concept families and compositional relationships across different concept families.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models struggle to simultaneously express hierarchical structures within concept families and compositional structures across different concept families. While hyperbolic space efficiently captures tree-like hierarchy, its suitability for representing compositionality remains unclear.

Method: PHyCLIP employs an ‚Ñì‚ÇÅ-Product metric on a Cartesian product of hyperbolic factors. Intra-family hierarchies emerge within individual hyperbolic factors, while cross-family composition is captured by the ‚Ñì‚ÇÅ-product metric, analogous to a Boolean algebra.

Result: Experiments on zero-shot classification, retrieval, hierarchical classification, and compositional understanding tasks demonstrate that PHyCLIP outperforms existing single-space approaches and offers more interpretable structures in the embedding space.

Conclusion: The proposed PHyCLIP framework successfully resolves the dilemma of simultaneously capturing hierarchical and compositional semantic structures in vision-language representation learning.

Abstract: Vision-language models have achieved remarkable success in multi-modal
representation learning from large-scale pairs of visual scenes and linguistic
descriptions. However, they still struggle to simultaneously express two
distinct types of semantic structures: the hierarchy within a concept family
(e.g., dog $\preceq$ mammal $\preceq$ animal) and the compositionality across
different concept families (e.g., "a dog in a car" $\preceq$ dog, car). Recent
works have addressed this challenge by employing hyperbolic space, which
efficiently captures tree-like hierarchy, yet its suitability for representing
compositionality remains unclear. To resolve this dilemma, we propose PHyCLIP,
which employs an $\ell_1$-Product metric on a Cartesian product of Hyperbolic
factors. With our design, intra-family hierarchies emerge within individual
hyperbolic factors, and cross-family composition is captured by the
$\ell_1$-product metric, analogous to a Boolean algebra. Experiments on
zero-shot classification, retrieval, hierarchical classification, and
compositional understanding tasks demonstrate that PHyCLIP outperforms existing
single-space approaches and offers more interpretable structures in the
embedding space.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SegTrans is a novel transfer attack framework that improves adversarial example transferability across segmentation models by dividing inputs into local regions and remapping semantic information to generate enhanced samples for perturbation optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Segmentation models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks but existing methods have poor transferability due to complex contextual dependencies and feature distribution gaps between surrogate and target models.

Method: Divides input samples into multiple local regions and remaps their semantic information to generate diverse enhanced samples, which replace original samples for perturbation optimization while retaining only local semantic information.

Result: Significantly improves transfer attack success rates by average 8.55% compared to state-of-the-art methods, with over 100% computational efficiency improvement on PASCAL VOC and Cityscapes datasets across four segmentation models and three backbone networks.

Conclusion: SegTrans effectively addresses transferability challenges in segmentation model attacks through local semantic remapping, achieving superior performance without additional computational overhead.

Abstract: Segmentation models exhibit significant vulnerability to adversarial examples
in white-box settings, but existing adversarial attack methods often show poor
transferability across different segmentation models. While some researchers
have explored transfer-based adversarial attack (i.e., transfer attack) methods
for segmentation models, the complex contextual dependencies within these
models and the feature distribution gaps between surrogate and target models
result in unsatisfactory transfer success rates. To address these issues, we
propose SegTrans, a novel transfer attack framework that divides the input
sample into multiple local regions and remaps their semantic information to
generate diverse enhanced samples. These enhanced samples replace the original
ones for perturbation optimization, thereby improving the transferability of
adversarial examples across different segmentation models. Unlike existing
methods, SegTrans only retains local semantic information from the original
input, rather than using global semantic information to optimize perturbations.
Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, PASCAL VOC and Cityscapes,
four different segmentation models, and three backbone networks show that
SegTrans significantly improves adversarial transfer success rates without
introducing additional computational overhead. Compared to the current
state-of-the-art methods, SegTrans achieves an average increase of 8.55% in
transfer attack success rate and improves computational efficiency by more than
100%.

*Han Hu,Zhuoran Zheng,Chen Lyu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ASVP is a runtime defense method that protects image restoration models from knowledge distillation attacks by perturbing internal feature maps using singular value decomposition to inject structured high-frequency noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Knowledge distillation attacks threaten deep model intellectual property, but existing defenses from image classification don't work well for image restoration tasks due to their continuous, high-dimensional outputs and spatial coherence requirements.

Method: Adaptive Singular Value Perturbation (ASVP) uses singular value decomposition on internal feature maps, amplifying top-k singular values to inject structured high-frequency perturbations that disrupt distillation while preserving output quality.

Result: ASVP reduces student PSNR by up to 4 dB and SSIM by 60-75% across five image restoration tasks (super-resolution, low-light enhancement, underwater enhancement, dehazing, deraining) with negligible impact on teacher performance.

Conclusion: ASVP provides a practical and effective defense against unauthorized knowledge distillation for open-source image restoration models, outperforming prior methods in strength and consistency.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) attacks pose a significant threat to deep model
intellectual property by enabling adversaries to train student networks using a
teacher model's outputs. While recent defenses in image classification have
successfully disrupted KD by perturbing output probabilities, extending these
methods to image restoration is difficult. Unlike classification, restoration
is a generative task with continuous, high-dimensional outputs that depend on
spatial coherence and fine details. Minor perturbations are often insufficient,
as students can still learn the underlying mapping.To address this, we propose
Adaptive Singular Value Perturbation (ASVP), a runtime defense tailored for
image restoration models. ASVP operates on internal feature maps of the teacher
using singular value decomposition (SVD). It amplifies the topk singular values
to inject structured, high-frequency perturbations, disrupting the alignment
needed for distillation. This hinders student learning while preserving the
teacher's output quality.We evaluate ASVP across five image restoration tasks:
super-resolution, low-light enhancement, underwater enhancement, dehazing, and
deraining. Experiments show ASVP reduces student PSNR by up to 4 dB and SSIM by
60-75%, with negligible impact on the teacher's performance. Compared to prior
methods, ASVP offers a stronger and more consistent defense.Our approach
provides a practical solution to protect open-source restoration models from
unauthorized knowledge distillation.

Motivation: While MLLMs show strong performance in video understanding, their robustness against manipulated video content remains unexplored, creating a need to evaluate how they handle counterfactual scenarios.

Method: Created Ro-Bench benchmark with high-quality, diverse video data by editing Style, Object, Background and their compositions to generate counterfactual video test sets, then evaluated 8 recent video MLLMs and tested fine-tuning with counterfactual data.

Result: Current MLLMs show substantial performance degradation on counterfactual videos. Fine-tuning with counterfactual data achieved 21.73% performance increase on Ro-Bench and 12.78% improvement across 20 tasks in MVBench dataset.

Conclusion: Counterfactual data is highly effective for enhancing MLLMs' video understanding robustness, and Ro-Bench provides a valuable benchmark for evaluating model resilience against manipulated content.

Abstract: Recently, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
significant performance across various video understanding tasks. However,
their robustness, particularly when faced with manipulated video content,
remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Ro-Bench, the first
benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on dynamic out-of-distribution (OOD)
counterfactual video test sets. Ro-Bench incorporates high-quality, diverse and
temporally relevant video data, by editing Style, Object, Background and their
compositions. We evaluated eight recent video MLLMs and found that current
models exhibit substantial performance degradation on Ro-Bench when exposed to
counterfactual video content. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fine-tuning
MLLMs with counterfactual data enhances robustness, achieving a 21.73%
performance increase on Ro-Bench and a 12.78% improvement across 20 tasks in
the MVBench dataset. These findings underscore the effectiveness of
counterfactual data in enhancing the video understanding ability of MLLMs. The
code and data will be released shortly.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an object-focused data augmentation framework using segmentation and diffusion-based synthesis to enhance animal detection in drone-based monitoring with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses limited data availability in aerial drone-based animal health monitoring, compounded by scene-specific issues like small, occluded animals, and the failure of transfer learning due to lack of farm-specific datasets.

Method: Segments animals from backgrounds and augments them through transformations and diffusion-based synthesis to create realistic, diverse scenes for enhanced animal detection.

Result: Initial experiments show superior performance compared to baseline models on animal detection task using the augmented dataset.

Conclusion: The method enables real-time animal health monitoring in data-scarce scenarios by generating domain-specific data, bridging the gap between limited data and practical application.

Abstract: Modern agricultural operations increasingly rely on integrated monitoring
systems that combine multiple data sources for farm optimization. Aerial
drone-based animal health monitoring serves as a key component but faces
limited data availability, compounded by scene-specific issues such as small,
occluded, or partially visible animals. Transfer learning approaches often fail
to address this limitation due to the unavailability of large datasets that
reflect specific farm conditions, including variations in animal breeds,
environments, and behaviors. Therefore, there is a need for developing a
problem-specific, animal-focused data augmentation strategy tailored to these
unique challenges. To address this gap, we propose an object-focused data
augmentation framework designed explicitly for animal health monitoring in
constrained data settings. Our approach segments animals from backgrounds and
augments them through transformations and diffusion-based synthesis to create
realistic, diverse scenes that enhance animal detection and monitoring
performance. Our initial experiments demonstrate that our augmented dataset
yields superior performance compared to our baseline models on the animal
detection task. By generating domain-specific data, our method empowers
real-time animal health monitoring solutions even in data-scarce scenarios,
bridging the gap between limited data and practical applicability.

*Yifan Li,Zhenghao Chen,Ziheng Wu,Kun Zhou,Ruipu Luo,Can Zhang,Zhentao He,Yufei Zhan,Wayne Xin Zhao,Minghui Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DisTANCE benchmark and Perception-Time Scaling (PTS) to address LVLMs' limited visual perception precision, showing significant improvements from 8.0% to 64.7% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLMs have limited visual estimation precision and inference-time scaling provides only marginal gains for perception tasks, due to treating visual understanding as one-shot output without modeling perceptual processes.

Method: Proposed Perception-Time Scaling (PTS) paradigm that encourages token-rich perception and decomposes complex perception problems into intermediate tractable sub-problems, combined with reinforcement learning techniques.

Result: PTS significantly improves perception accuracy from 8.0% to 64.7% on DisTANCE benchmark, generalizes well to out-of-domain tasks, and shows consistent gains in both reasoning and real-world perception benchmarks even with synthetic data.

Conclusion: PTS enables perception to align with and benefit from inference-time scaling by introducing more perception-related tokens and increasing attention to image tokens, addressing the limitations of current fast perception paradigm in LVLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in inference-time scaling, particularly those leveraging
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards, have substantially enhanced the
reasoning capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Inspired by
this success, similar strategies have been applied to multimodal reasoning, yet
their impact on visual perception remains unclear. To investigate this gap, we
introduce DisTANCE, a perception-centric benchmark for visual estimation tasks.
Evaluation results show that LVLMs exhibit limited estimation precision, and
inference-time scaling offers only marginal gains. We attribute this to the
fast perception paradigm of current LVLMs, where visual understanding is
treated as a one-shot output without modeling the underlying perceptual
process. To address this, we propose Perception-Time Scaling (PTS), a novel
paradigm that encourages token-rich perception and decomposes complex
perception problems into intermediate tractable sub-problems, thereby enabling
perception to align with and benefit from inference-time scaling. Combined with
reinforcement learning techniques, PTS significantly improves perception
accuracy, raising high-precision performance on DisTANCE from 8.0% to 64.7%,
and generalizes well to out-of-domain tasks. Surprisingly, even though PTS data
are purely synthetic, combining them with math reasoning data yields consistent
gains in both reasoning and real-world perception benchmarks. Further analysis
reveals that PTS introduces more perception-related tokens and increases the
model's attention to image tokens. Our code and data will be publicly released.

*Zhenyu Wang,Mahathir Monjur,Shahriar Nirjon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: mmJoints framework enhances mmWave-based pose estimation by adding joint descriptors that indicate sensing likelihood and location reliability, improving interpretability and downstream task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In mmWave pose estimation, sparse signals cause models to rely on statistical priors rather than actual sensor data, which degrades performance in downstream tasks like gesture and activity recognition.

Method: Augments pre-trained pose estimator output with additional joint descriptors that estimate the likelihood of a joint being sensed and the reliability of its predicted location, making bias explicit.

Result: Achieves descriptor estimation error rate below 4.2%, improves joint position accuracy by up to 12.5%, and boosts activity recognition by up to 16% over state-of-the-art methods across 115,000+ signal frames.

Conclusion: mmJoints successfully enhances pose estimation interpretability and downstream task performance by explicitly quantifying joint sensing reliability rather than mitigating bias.

Abstract: In mmWave-based pose estimation, sparse signals and weak reflections often
cause models to infer body joints from statistical priors rather than sensor
data. While prior knowledge helps in learning meaningful representations,
over-reliance on it degrades performance in downstream tasks like gesture and
activity recognition. In this paper, we introduce mmJoints, a framework that
augments a pre-trained, black-box mmWave-based 3D pose estimator's output with
additional joint descriptors. Rather than mitigating bias, mmJoints makes it
explicit by estimating the likelihood of a joint being sensed and the
reliability of its predicted location. These descriptors enhance
interpretability and improve downstream task accuracy. Through extensive
evaluations using over 115,000 signal frames across 13 pose estimation
settings, we show that mmJoints estimates descriptors with an error rate below
4.2%. mmJoints also improves joint position accuracy by up to 12.5% and boosts
activity recognition by up to 16% over state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiMIR is an efficient hierarchical scheduling framework for image retrieval that improves accuracy and reduces computation by using multiple granularities for better query-image alignment and minimizing redundancy through cross-hierarchy similarity consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional retrieval approaches in multimodal LLMs suffer from limited accuracy, and recent multi-vector retrieval methods still have sub-optimal accuracy and efficiency due to poor query-image object alignment and redundant fine-grained image segments.

Method: Proposes HiMIR framework with: 1) hierarchical paradigm using multiple intermediate granularities for varying image objects, 2) redundancy minimization through cross-hierarchy similarity consistency and hierarchy sparsity, 3) automatic parameter configuration for different datasets.

Result: HiMIR achieves substantial accuracy improvements while reducing computation by up to 3.5 times compared to existing multi-vector retrieval systems.

Conclusion: HiMIR provides an efficient and accurate solution for image retrieval in multimodal LLM applications by addressing alignment and redundancy issues through hierarchical scheduling and automatic parameter optimization.

Abstract: To effectively leverage user-specific data, retrieval augmented generation
(RAG) is employed in multimodal large language model (MLLM) applications.
However, conventional retrieval approaches often suffer from limited retrieval
accuracy. Recent advances in multi-vector retrieval (MVR) improve accuracy by
decomposing queries and matching against segmented images. They still suffer
from sub-optimal accuracy and efficiency, overlooking alignment between the
query and varying image objects and redundant fine-grained image segments. In
this work, we present an efficient scheduling framework for image retrieval -
HiMIR. First, we introduce a novel hierarchical paradigm, employing multiple
intermediate granularities for varying image objects to enhance alignment.
Second, we minimize redundancy in retrieval by leveraging cross-hierarchy
similarity consistency and hierarchy sparsity to minimize unnecessary matching
computation. Furthermore, we configure parameters for each dataset
automatically for practicality across diverse scenarios. Our empirical study
shows that, HiMIR not only achieves substantial accuracy improvements but also
reduces computation by up to 3.5 times over the existing MVR system.

*Zichuan Wang,Bo Peng,Songlin Yang,Zhenchen Tang,Jing Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HandEval, a hand-specific quality assessment model for evaluating generated hand images from text-to-image models, addressing the common problem of distorted and unrealistic hand generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models struggle with generating accurate details in complex local regions like human hands, leading to structural distortions and unrealistic textures. The quality assessment of hand regions is largely neglected, limiting downstream applications.

Method: Proposed HandEval model leveraging Multimodal Large Language Model capabilities with hand keypoint prior knowledge. Created HandPair dataset with 48k high/low-quality hand image pairs for training without manual annotation, plus a human-annotated test set from various SOTA T2I models.

Result: HandEval aligns better with human judgments than existing SOTA methods. When integrated into image generation and AIGC detection pipelines, it significantly enhances generated hand realism and detection accuracy respectively.

Conclusion: HandEval provides the first quality assessment solution for generated hand regions and demonstrates universal effectiveness in downstream applications, addressing a critical gap in text-to-image generation evaluation.

Abstract: Although recent text-to-image (T2I) models have significantly improved the
overall visual quality of generated images, they still struggle in the
generation of accurate details in complex local regions, especially human
hands. Generated hands often exhibit structural distortions and unrealistic
textures, which can be very noticeable even when the rest of the body is
well-generated. However, the quality assessment of hand regions remains largely
neglected, limiting downstream task performance like human-centric generation
quality optimization and AIGC detection. To address this, we propose the first
quality assessment task targeting generated hand regions and showcase its
abundant downstream applications. We first introduce the HandPair dataset for
training hand quality assessment models. It consists of 48k images formed by
high- and low-quality hand pairs, enabling low-cost, efficient supervision
without manual annotation. Based on it, we develop HandEval, a carefully
designed hand-specific quality assessment model. It leverages the powerful
visual understanding capability of Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) and
incorporates prior knowledge of hand keypoints, gaining strong perception of
hand quality. We further construct a human-annotated test set with hand images
from various state-of-the-art (SOTA) T2I models to validate its quality
evaluation capability. Results show that HandEval aligns better with human
judgments than existing SOTA methods. Furthermore, we integrate HandEval into
image generation and AIGC detection pipelines, prominently enhancing generated
hand realism and detection accuracy, respectively, confirming its universal
effectiveness in downstream applications. Code and dataset will be available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First defensive method against unauthorized AI colorization using imperceptible perturbations to degrade colorization quality while preserving visual appearance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address copyright infringement risks from unauthorized AI colorization of monochrome content like manga and films, where no effective prevention methods currently exist.

Method: PAChroma (Perception-Aware Chroma-Restrictive Perturbation) optimizes imperceptible perturbations with Laplacian filter for perceptual quality and uses diverse input transformations to enhance transferability and robustness against post-processing.

Result: Effectively degrades colorization quality on ImageNet and Danbooru datasets while maintaining visual appearance, meeting all four criteria: effectiveness, imperceptibility, transferability, and robustness.

Conclusion: First step toward protecting visual content from illegitimate AI colorization, paving way for copyright-aware defenses in generative media.

Abstract: AI-based colorization has shown remarkable capability in generating realistic
color images from grayscale inputs. However, it poses risks of copyright
infringement -- for example, the unauthorized colorization and resale of
monochrome manga and films. Despite these concerns, no effective method
currently exists to prevent such misuse. To address this, we introduce the
first defensive paradigm, Uncolorable Examples, which embed imperceptible
perturbations into grayscale images to invalidate unauthorized colorization. To
ensure real-world applicability, we establish four criteria: effectiveness,
imperceptibility, transferability, and robustness. Our method, Perception-Aware
Chroma-Restrictive Perturbation (PAChroma), generates Uncolorable Examples that
meet these four criteria by optimizing imperceptible perturbations with a
Laplacian filter to preserve perceptual quality, and applying diverse input
transformations during optimization to enhance transferability across models
and robustness against common post-processing (e.g., compression). Experiments
on ImageNet and Danbooru datasets demonstrate that PAChroma effectively
degrades colorization quality while maintaining the visual appearance. This
work marks the first step toward protecting visual content from illegitimate AI
colorization, paving the way for copyright-aware defenses in generative media.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SJD2 is a framework that accelerates autoregressive text-to-image generation by enabling parallel token decoding through speculative Jacobi-denoising iterations, reducing the number of sequential model forward passes required.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive text-to-image models suffer from slow inference due to sequential token-by-token decoding, requiring thousands of model forward passes per image generation.

Method: Proposes Speculative Jacobi-Denoising Decoding (SJD2) that incorporates denoising into Jacobi iterations for parallel token generation. Uses next-clean-token prediction with noise-perturbed embeddings and probabilistic verification to accept multiple tokens in parallel.

Result: The method accelerates generation by reducing model forward passes while maintaining visual quality of generated images.

Conclusion: SJD2 successfully addresses the inefficiency of sequential decoding in autoregressive models through parallel token generation via denoising-based Jacobi iterations.

Abstract: As a new paradigm of visual content generation, autoregressive text-to-image
models suffer from slow inference due to their sequential token-by-token
decoding process, often requiring thousands of model forward passes to generate
a single image. To address this inefficiency, we propose Speculative
Jacobi-Denoising Decoding (SJD2), a framework that incorporates the denoising
process into Jacobi iterations to enable parallel token generation in
autoregressive models. Our method introduces a next-clean-token prediction
paradigm that enables the pre-trained autoregressive models to accept
noise-perturbed token embeddings and predict the next clean tokens through
low-cost fine-tuning. This denoising paradigm guides the model towards more
stable Jacobi trajectories. During inference, our method initializes token
sequences with Gaussian noise and performs iterative
next-clean-token-prediction in the embedding space. We employ a probabilistic
criterion to verify and accept multiple tokens in parallel, and refine the
unaccepted tokens for the next iteration with the denoising trajectory.
Experiments show that our method can accelerate generation by reducing model
forward passes while maintaining the visual quality of generated images.

### [36] [On Epistemic Uncertainty of Visual Tokens for Object Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09008)
*Hoigi Seo,Dong Un Kang,Hyunjin Cho,Joohoon Lee,Se Young Chun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies uncertain visual tokens in vision encoders as a key cause of object hallucination in LVLMs and proposes a method to detect and mask these tokens to reduce hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object hallucination in large vision-language models (LVLMs) remains a critical challenge, where models generate descriptions of objects not present in input images. The authors argue that uncertain visual tokens within the vision encoder contribute significantly to this problem.

Method: Proposes a two-step approach: 1) Uses adversarial perturbations to efficiently identify uncertain visual tokens (those with high epistemic uncertainty), 2) Masks these uncertain tokens during self-attention in middle vision encoder layers to suppress their influence on visual encoding.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that the method significantly reduces object hallucinations in LVLMs and can work synergistically with other existing techniques.

Conclusion: The study shows that addressing uncertain visual tokens in vision encoders is an effective strategy for mitigating object hallucination in LVLMs, providing a simple yet powerful solution that requires only vision encoder modifications.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs), which integrate a vision encoder (VE)
with a large language model, have achieved remarkable success across various
tasks. However, there are still crucial challenges in LVLMs such as object
hallucination, generating descriptions of objects that are not in the input
image. Here, we argue that uncertain visual tokens within the VE is a key
factor that contributes to object hallucination. Our statistical analysis found
that there are positive correlations between visual tokens with high epistemic
uncertainty and the occurrence of hallucinations. Furthermore, we show
theoretically and empirically that visual tokens in early VE layers that
exhibit large representation deviations under small adversarial perturbations
indicate high epistemic uncertainty. Based on these findings, we propose a
simple yet effective strategy to mitigate object hallucination by modifying the
VE only. Our method comprises a proxy method with adversarial perturbations for
identifying uncertain visual tokens efficiently and a method to mask these
uncertain visual tokens during the self-attention process in the middle layers
of the VE, suppressing their influence on visual encoding and thus alleviating
hallucinations. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly
reduces object hallucinations in LVLMs and can synergistically work with other
prior arts.

*Xiaoxiao Ma,Feng Zhao,Pengyang Ling,Haibo Qiu,Zhixiang Wei,Hu Yu,Jie Huang,Zhixiong Zeng,Lin Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an entropy-informed decoding strategy to improve autoregressive image generation by addressing sampling issues related to low information density and non-uniform spatial distribution of image tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autoregressive image generation models suffer from sampling issues where image tokens have lower information density and non-uniform spatial distribution compared to text tokens, leading to suboptimal generation quality and speed.

Method: The method introduces two innovations: 1) dynamic temperature control guided by spatial entropy of token distributions to balance content diversity, alignment accuracy, and structural coherence, and 2) entropy-aware acceptance rules in speculative decoding for near-lossless generation with reduced inference cost.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show the approach enhances both generation quality and sampling speed, achieving near-lossless generation at about 85% of the inference cost of conventional acceleration methods.

Conclusion: The proposed entropy-informed decoding strategy effectively addresses sampling issues in autoregressive image generation, improving quality and speed without extra computational overhead, demonstrating broad applicability across diverse AR image generation models.

Abstract: In this work, we first revisit the sampling issues in current autoregressive
(AR) image generation models and identify that image tokens, unlike text
tokens, exhibit lower information density and non-uniform spatial distribution.
Accordingly, we present an entropy-informed decoding strategy that facilitates
higher autoregressive generation quality with faster synthesis speed.
Specifically, the proposed method introduces two main innovations: 1) dynamic
temperature control guided by spatial entropy of token distributions, enhancing
the balance between content diversity, alignment accuracy, and structural
coherence in both mask-based and scale-wise models, without extra computational
overhead, and 2) entropy-aware acceptance rules in speculative decoding,
achieving near-lossless generation at about 85\% of the inference cost of
conventional acceleration methods. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks using diverse AR image generation models demonstrate the
effectiveness and generalizability of our approach in enhancing both generation
quality and sampling speed.

*Weitong Kong,Zichao Zeng,Di Wen,Jiale Wei,Kunyu Peng,June Moh Goo,Jan Boehm,Rainer Stiefelhagen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DGLSS-NL, a new task for domain generalization in LiDAR semantic segmentation under noisy labels, and proposes DuNe, a dual-view framework that achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR annotations are often noisy due to sensor imperfections, occlusions, and human errors, which degrades segmentation accuracy and is amplified under domain shifts. While noisy-label learning is well-studied in images, it remains unexplored for 3D LiDAR segmentation under domain generalization due to the sparse and irregular structure of point clouds.

Method: Proposes DuNe, a dual-view framework with strong and weak branches that enforce feature-level consistency and apply cross-entropy loss based on confidence-aware filtering of predictions. The approach adapts noisy-label learning strategies to handle LiDAR data's unique characteristics.

Result: Achieves 56.86% mIoU on SemanticKITTI, 42.28% on nuScenes, and 52.58% on SemanticPOSS under 10% symmetric label noise, with overall Arithmetic Mean of 49.57% and Harmonic Mean of 48.50%, demonstrating robust domain generalization.

Conclusion: The proposed DuNe framework effectively addresses the DGLSS-NL task, showing state-of-the-art performance and robust domain generalization across multiple LiDAR datasets under noisy label conditions.

Abstract: Accurate perception is critical for vehicle safety, with LiDAR as a key
enabler in autonomous driving. To ensure robust performance across
environments, sensor types, and weather conditions without costly
re-annotation, domain generalization in LiDAR-based 3D semantic segmentation is
essential. However, LiDAR annotations are often noisy due to sensor
imperfections, occlusions, and human errors. Such noise degrades segmentation
accuracy and is further amplified under domain shifts, threatening system
reliability. While noisy-label learning is well-studied in images, its
extension to 3D LiDAR segmentation under domain generalization remains largely
unexplored, as the sparse and irregular structure of point clouds limits direct
use of 2D methods. To address this gap, we introduce the novel task Domain
Generalization for LiDAR Semantic Segmentation under Noisy Labels (DGLSS-NL)
and establish the first benchmark by adapting three representative noisy-label
learning strategies from image classification to 3D segmentation. However, we
find that existing noisy-label learning approaches adapt poorly to LiDAR data.
We therefore propose DuNe, a dual-view framework with strong and weak branches
that enforce feature-level consistency and apply cross-entropy loss based on
confidence-aware filtering of predictions. Our approach shows state-of-the-art
performance by achieving 56.86% mIoU on SemanticKITTI, 42.28% on nuScenes, and
52.58% on SemanticPOSS under 10% symmetric label noise, with an overall
Arithmetic Mean (AM) of 49.57% and Harmonic Mean (HM) of 48.50%, thereby
demonstrating robust domain generalization in DGLSS-NL tasks. The code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel post-training framework for latent diffusion models in medical image-to-image translation that incorporates lesion-aware pixel space objectives to improve lesion delineation and overall image quality, particularly for brain CT-to-MRI translation in stroke patients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Latent diffusion models (LDMs) are efficient but may compromise pixel-level detail crucial for medical images, especially small lesions that are clinically significant. This limitation affects diagnostic reliability and clinical decision-making.

Method: Proposed a post-training framework for LDMs that incorporates lesion-aware medical pixel space objectives. The approach enhances image quality and lesion delineation precision, evaluated on brain CT-to-MRI translation for acute ischemic stroke patients.

Result: The framework improves overall image quality and enhances lesion delineation when synthesizing DWI and ADC images from CT perfusion scans, outperforming existing image-to-image translation models on a dataset of 817 patients.

Conclusion: The post-training strategy is easily adaptable to pre-trained LDMs and shows substantial potential for broader applications across diverse medical image translation tasks.

Abstract: Image-to-Image translation models can help mitigate various challenges
inherent to medical image acquisition. Latent diffusion models (LDMs) leverage
efficient learning in compressed latent space and constitute the core of
state-of-the-art generative image models. However, this efficiency comes with a
trade-off, potentially compromising crucial pixel-level detail essential for
high-fidelity medical images. This limitation becomes particularly critical
when generating clinically significant structures, such as lesions, which often
occupy only a small portion of the image. Failure to accurately reconstruct
these regions can severely impact diagnostic reliability and clinical
decision-making. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel post-training
framework for LDMs in medical image-to-image translation by incorporating
lesion-aware medical pixel space objectives. This approach is essential, as it
not only enhances overall image quality but also improves the precision of
lesion delineation. We evaluate our framework on brain CT-to-MRI translation in
acute ischemic stroke patients, where early and accurate diagnosis is critical
for optimal treatment selection and improved patient outcomes. While diffusion
MRI is the gold standard for stroke diagnosis, its clinical utility is often
constrained by high costs and low accessibility. Using a dataset of 817
patients, we demonstrate that our framework improves overall image quality and
enhances lesion delineation when synthesizing DWI and ADC images from CT
perfusion scans, outperforming existing image-to-image translation models.
Furthermore, our post-training strategy is easily adaptable to pre-trained LDMs
and exhibits substantial potential for broader applications across diverse
medical image translation tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An image-based anomaly detection framework using vision transformers for monitoring flexible microelectrode implantation into brain cortex at four critical checkpoints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flexible microelectrode implantation is challenging due to the probe's deformable structure and interaction with sensitive brain tissue, requiring careful monitoring for reliability and safety.

Method: Uses microscopic cameras and a pretrained vision transformer with progressive granularity patch feature sampling and selective feature channel extraction from aligned ROIs at four checkpoints.

Result: The proposed methods effectively address sensitivity-tolerance trade-offs and provide better descriptors for specific implantation scenes, validated with system-collected image datasets.

Conclusion: The developed framework successfully enables reliable anomaly detection during robotic FME implantation through optimized vision transformer feature extraction and processing.

Abstract: Flexible microelectrode (FME) implantation into brain cortex is challenging
due to the deformable fiber-like structure of FME probe and the interaction
with critical bio-tissue. To ensure reliability and safety, the implantation
process should be monitored carefully. This paper develops an image-based
anomaly detection framework based on the microscopic cameras of the robotic FME
implantation system. The unified framework is utilized at four checkpoints to
check the micro-needle, FME probe, hooking result, and implantation point,
respectively. Exploiting the existing object localization results, the aligned
regions of interest (ROIs) are extracted from raw image and input to a
pretrained vision transformer (ViT). Considering the task specifications, we
propose a progressive granularity patch feature sampling method to address the
sensitivity-tolerance trade-off issue at different locations. Moreover, we
select a part of feature channels with higher signal-to-noise ratios from the
raw general ViT features, to provide better descriptors for each specific
scene. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is validated with the image
datasets collected from our implantation system.

TL;DR: MambaH-Fit is a state space modeling framework for point cloud normal estimation that improves fine-grained geometric structure modeling through attention-driven hierarchical feature fusion and patch-wise state space modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing normal estimation methods struggle with modeling fine-grained geometric structures, and current Mamba-based approaches focus mainly on global shape understanding while neglecting local geometric details.

Method: Introduces Attention-driven Hierarchical Feature Fusion (AHFF) to adaptively fuse multi-scale point cloud patch features, and Patch-wise State Space Model (PSSM) that models point cloud patches as implicit hyper-surfaces via state dynamics.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method outperforms existing approaches in accuracy, robustness, and flexibility. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the proposed components.

Conclusion: MambaH-Fit successfully addresses the limitations of existing methods by effectively modeling fine-grained geometric structures for improved point cloud normal estimation.

Abstract: We present MambaH-Fit, a state space modelling framework tailored for
hyper-surface fitting-based point cloud normal estimation. Existing normal
estimation methods often fall short in modelling fine-grained geometric
structures, thereby limiting the accuracy of the predicted normals. Recently,
state space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have demonstrated strong
modelling capability by capturing long-range dependencies with linear
complexity and inspired adaptations to point cloud processing. However,
existing Mamba-based approaches primarily focus on understanding global shape
structures, leaving the modelling of local, fine-grained geometric details
largely under-explored. To address the issues above, we first introduce an
Attention-driven Hierarchical Feature Fusion (AHFF) scheme to adaptively fuse
multi-scale point cloud patch features, significantly enhancing geometric
context learning in local point cloud neighbourhoods. Building upon this, we
further propose Patch-wise State Space Model (PSSM) that models point cloud
patches as implicit hyper-surfaces via state dynamics, enabling effective
fine-grained geometric understanding for normal prediction. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms existing
ones in terms of accuracy, robustness, and flexibility. Ablation studies
further validate the contribution of the proposed components.

*Juanqin Liu,Leonardo Plotegher,Eloy Roura,Shaoming He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes GL-DT framework with STFF module and JPTrack algorithm to improve multi-object tracking for UAVs, addressing challenges like small targets, occlusions, and trajectory fragmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UAV applications in military reconnaissance and environmental monitoring require accurate multi-object tracking, but existing methods struggle with complex backgrounds, small targets, occlusions, and trajectory continuity issues.

Method: GL-DT framework with Spatio-Temporal Feature Fusion (STFF) module for motion and appearance modeling, global-local collaborative detection strategy for small targets, and JPTrack tracking algorithm to reduce ID switches and fragmentation.

Result: Experimental results show significant improvements in MOT continuity and stability while maintaining real-time performance.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively advances UAV detection and tracking technologies by enhancing tracking accuracy and trajectory continuity.

Abstract: The extensive application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in military
reconnaissance, environmental monitoring, and related domains has created an
urgent need for accurate and efficient multi-object tracking (MOT)
technologies, which are also essential for UAV situational awareness. However,
complex backgrounds, small-scale targets, and frequent occlusions and
interactions continue to challenge existing methods in terms of detection
accuracy and trajectory continuity. To address these issues, this paper
proposes the Global-Local Detection and Tracking (GL-DT) framework. It employs
a Spatio-Temporal Feature Fusion (STFF) module to jointly model motion and
appearance features, combined with a global-local collaborative detection
strategy, effectively enhancing small-target detection. Building upon this, the
JPTrack tracking algorithm is introduced to mitigate common issues such as ID
switches and trajectory fragmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed approach significantly improves the continuity and stability of
MOT while maintaining real-time performance, providing strong support for the
advancement of UAV detection and tracking technologies.

*Youwei Zheng,Yuxi Ren,Xin Xia,Xuefeng Xiao,Xiaohua Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dense2MoE transforms dense Diffusion Transformers into Mixture of Experts structure, reducing activated parameters by 60% while maintaining performance, outperforming pruning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DiT models have large parameter sizes causing substantial inference overhead, and aggressive pruning leads to severe performance degradation due to reduced model capacity.

Method: Replace FFNs in DiT Blocks with MoE layers (62.5% reduction), propose Mixture of Blocks for selective activation, and use multi-step distillation pipeline with Taylor metric-based expert initialization, knowledge distillation with load balancing, and group feature loss.

Result: Reduces activated parameters by 60% while maintaining original performance, surpassing pruning-based approaches in experiments.

Conclusion: Dense2MoE establishes a new paradigm for efficient text-to-image generation through structured sparsification while preserving model capacity.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer (DiT) has demonstrated remarkable performance in
text-to-image generation; however, its large parameter size results in
substantial inference overhead. Existing parameter compression methods
primarily focus on pruning, but aggressive pruning often leads to severe
performance degradation due to reduced model capacity. To address this
limitation, we pioneer the transformation of a dense DiT into a Mixture of
Experts (MoE) for structured sparsification, reducing the number of activated
parameters while preserving model capacity. Specifically, we replace the
Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) in DiT Blocks with MoE layers, reducing the number
of activated parameters in the FFNs by 62.5\%. Furthermore, we propose the
Mixture of Blocks (MoB) to selectively activate DiT blocks, thereby further
enhancing sparsity. To ensure an effective dense-to-MoE conversion, we design a
multi-step distillation pipeline, incorporating Taylor metric-based expert
initialization, knowledge distillation with load balancing, and group feature
loss for MoB optimization. We transform large diffusion transformers (e.g.,
FLUX.1 [dev]) into an MoE structure, reducing activated parameters by 60\%
while maintaining original performance and surpassing pruning-based approaches
in extensive experiments. Overall, Dense2MoE establishes a new paradigm for
efficient text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Intelligent analysis of medical imaging plays a crucial role in assisting
clinical diagnosis, especially for identifying subtle pathological features.
This paper introduces a novel multi-branch ConvNeXt architecture designed
specifically for the nuanced challenges of medical image analysis. While
applied here to the specific problem of COVID-19 diagnosis, the methodology
offers a generalizable framework for classifying a wide range of pathologies
from CT scans. The proposed model incorporates a rigorous end-to-end pipeline,
from meticulous data preprocessing and augmentation to a disciplined two-phase
training strategy that leverages transfer learning effectively. The
architecture uniquely integrates features extracted from three parallel
branches: Global Average Pooling, Global Max Pooling, and a new
Attention-weighted Pooling mechanism. The model was trained and validated on a
combined dataset of 2,609 CT slices derived from two distinct datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate a superior performance on the validation set,
achieving a final ROC-AUC of 0.9937, a validation accuracy of 0.9757, and an
F1-score of 0.9825 for COVID-19 cases, outperforming all previously reported
models on this dataset. These findings indicate that a modern, multi-branch
architecture, coupled with careful data handling, can achieve performance
comparable to or exceeding contemporary state-of-the-art models, thereby
proving the efficacy of advanced deep learning techniques for robust medical
diagnostics.

*Weikai Huang,Jieyu Zhang,Taoyang Jia,Chenhao Zheng,Ziqi Gao,Jae Sung Park,Ranjay Krishna*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SOS is a scalable data synthesis pipeline that generates high-quality synthetic object segments using object-centric composition, structured layout priors, and generative relighting, outperforming larger real-image datasets on detection and grounding tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large annotated datasets for visual grouping tasks are costly, biased, and hard to scale. Synthetic data offers promise but often lacks flexibility, accuracy, and compositional diversity.

Method: Object-centric composition strategy that pastes high-quality synthetic object segments into new images using structured layout priors and generative relighting to produce accurate masks, boxes, and referring expressions.

Result: Models trained on 100K synthetic images from SOS outperform those trained on larger real datasets (GRIT with 20M images, V3Det with 200K images), achieving +10.9 AP on LVIS detection and +8.4 NAcc on gRefCOCO grounding. Also shows strong performance gains in low-data settings.

Conclusion: SOS enables controllable dataset construction and improves generalization across various data scales, with particular benefits in limited real data scenarios and targeted data generation for challenging visual grounding tasks.

Abstract: Visual grouping -- operationalized via instance segmentation, visual
grounding, and object detection -- underpins applications from robotic
perception to photo editing. Large annotated datasets are costly, biased in
coverage, and hard to scale. Synthetic data are promising but often lack
flexibility, accuracy, and compositional diversity.
  We present SOS, a simple and scalable data synthesis pipeline based on an
object-centric composition strategy. It pastes high-quality synthetic object
segments into new images using structured layout priors and generative
relighting, producing accurate and diverse masks, boxes, and referring
expressions. Models trained on 100000 synthetic images from SOS outperform
those trained on larger real-image datasets such as GRIT (20M) and V3Det (200K)
on detection and grounding tasks, achieving +10.9 AP on LVIS detection and +8.4
$N_{\text{Acc}}$ on gRefCOCO grounding. SOS enables controllable dataset
construction and improves generalization in both low-data and closed-vocabulary
settings. Augmenting LVIS and COCO with synthetic object segments yields strong
performance across real-data scales and even larger gains under extremely
limited real data (for example, +3.83 $AP_{\text{rare}}$ on LVIS instance
segmentation and +6.59 AP with a 1 percent COCO setup). This controllability
also supports targeted data generation for challenging intra-class referring in
visual grounding.

*Dominik Winter,Mai Bui,Monica Azqueta Gavaldon,Nicolas Triltsch,Marco Rosati,Nicolas Brieu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multimodal semantic diffusion model (MSDM) generates realistic synthetic image-mask pairs for cell/nuclei segmentation to address data scarcity in computational pathology, improving segmentation model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the scarcity of annotated data for rare cell morphologies in computational pathology, where manual annotation is expensive and labor-intensive.

Method: MSDM uses multimodal conditioning with cellular morphologies (horizontal/vertical maps), RGB colors, and BERT-encoded metadata, integrated via multi-head cross-attention for fine-grained control over generated images.

Result: Synthetic images closely match real data with low Wasserstein distances, and incorporating synthetic samples (e.g., columnar cells) significantly improves segmentation model accuracy on targeted cell types.

Conclusion: Multimodal diffusion-based augmentation effectively enhances robustness and generalizability of segmentation models, paving the way for broader generative model applications in computational pathology.

Abstract: Scarcity of annotated data, particularly for rare or atypical morphologies,
present significant challenges for cell and nuclei segmentation in
computational pathology. While manual annotation is labor-intensive and costly,
synthetic data offers a cost-effective alternative. We introduce a Multimodal
Semantic Diffusion Model (MSDM) for generating realistic pixel-precise
image-mask pairs for cell and nuclei segmentation. By conditioning the
generative process with cellular/nuclear morphologies (using horizontal and
vertical maps), RGB color characteristics, and BERT-encoded assay/indication
metadata, MSDM generates datasests with desired morphological properties. These
heterogeneous modalities are integrated via multi-head cross-attention,
enabling fine-grained control over the generated images. Quantitative analysis
demonstrates that synthetic images closely match real data, with low
Wasserstein distances between embeddings of generated and real images under
matching biological conditions. The incorporation of these synthetic samples,
exemplified by columnar cells, significantly improves segmentation model
accuracy on columnar cells. This strategy systematically enriches data sets,
directly targeting model deficiencies. We highlight the effectiveness of
multimodal diffusion-based augmentation for advancing the robustness and
generalizability of cell and nuclei segmentation models. Thereby, we pave the
way for broader application of generative models in computational pathology.

### [47] [Polar Separable Transform for Efficient Orthogonal Rotation-Invariant Image Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09125)
*Satya P. Singh,Rashmi Chaudhry,Anand Srivastava,Jagath C. Rajapakse*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PSepT is a new separable orthogonal transform that overcomes non-separability in polar coordinates, achieving exponential improvements in computational complexity, memory requirements, and numerical stability compared to classical orthogonal moment methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical orthogonal moment-based image representations (like Zernike and pseudo-Zernike moments) suffer from high computational complexity, numerical instability at large orders, and non-separability that prevents efficient factorization.

Method: PSepT uses tensor-product construction combining Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) radial bases and Fourier harmonic angular bases, enabling independent radial and angular processing through complete kernel factorization.

Result: Reduces computational complexity from O(n¬≥N¬≤)-O(n‚Å∂N¬≤) to O(N¬≤ log N), memory from O(N‚Å¥) to O(N¬≤), and condition number scaling from O(N‚Å¥) to O(‚àöN). Exhibits orthogonality, completeness, energy conservation, and rotation-covariance.

Conclusion: PSepT enables high-order moment analysis previously infeasible with classical methods, offering better numerical stability, computational efficiency, and competitive classification performance while preserving exact reconstruction.

Abstract: Orthogonal moment-based image representations are fundamental in computer
vision, but classical methods suffer from high computational complexity and
numerical instability at large orders. Zernike and pseudo-Zernike moments, for
instance, require coupled radial-angular processing that precludes efficient
factorization, resulting in $\mathcal{O}(n^3N^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n^6N^2)$
complexity and $\mathcal{O}(N^4)$ condition number scaling for the $n$th-order
moments on an $N\times N$ image. We introduce \textbf{PSepT} (Polar Separable
Transform), a separable orthogonal transform that overcomes the
non-separability barrier in polar coordinates. PSepT achieves complete kernel
factorization via tensor-product construction of Discrete Cosine Transform
(DCT) radial bases and Fourier harmonic angular bases, enabling independent
radial and angular processing. This separable design reduces computational
complexity to $\mathcal{O}(N^2 \log N)$, memory requirements to
$\mathcal{O}(N^2)$, and condition number scaling to $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$,
representing exponential improvements over polynomial approaches. PSepT
exhibits orthogonality, completeness, energy conservation, and
rotation-covariance properties. Experimental results demonstrate better
numerical stability, computational efficiency, and competitive classification
performance on structured datasets, while preserving exact reconstruction. The
separable framework enables high-order moment analysis previously infeasible
with classical methods, opening new possibilities for robust image analysis
applications.

### [48] [Training Feature Attribution for Vision Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09135)
*Aziz Bacha,Thomas George*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces training feature attribution, a method that links test predictions to specific regions in training images, providing joint analysis of input features and influential training examples for better model explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks are opaque systems, and existing explainability methods only attribute predictions to either input features or training examples separately. The authors argue both perspectives should be studied jointly to improve trust and accountability.

Method: The paper proposes training feature attribution, which connects test-time predictions to specific regions within specific training images, providing fine-grained explanations of model behavior.

Result: Experiments on vision datasets show that training feature attribution identifies harmful examples that cause misclassifications and reveals spurious correlations (like patch-based shortcuts) that conventional attribution methods miss.

Conclusion: Training feature attribution provides new insights into deep model inner workings by jointly analyzing test predictions and training data features, offering more comprehensive explanations than existing methods.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are often considered opaque systems, prompting the need
for explainability methods to improve trust and accountability. Existing
approaches typically attribute test-time predictions either to input features
(e.g., pixels in an image) or to influential training examples. We argue that
both perspectives should be studied jointly. This work explores *training
feature attribution*, which links test predictions to specific regions of
specific training images and thereby provides new insights into the inner
workings of deep models. Our experiments on vision datasets show that training
feature attribution yields fine-grained, test-specific explanations: it
identifies harmful examples that drive misclassifications and reveals spurious
correlations, such as patch-based shortcuts, that conventional attribution
methods fail to expose.

### [49] [Online Topological Localization for Navigation Assistance in Bronchoscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09144)
*Clara Tomasini,Luis Riazuelo,Ana C. Murillo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel image-based bronchoscopy topological localization pipeline that provides navigation assistance without requiring patient CT scans, trained only on phantom data with good generalization to real procedures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current bronchoscopy navigation methods require CT scans and additional sensors, which involve extra setup, scans, and training. A simpler topological localization approach could provide sufficient navigation assistance without these requirements.

Method: Image-based bronchoscopy topological localization pipeline trained exclusively on phantom data, eliminating the need for expensive real data labeling while maintaining good generalization capabilities.

Result: The approach surpasses existing methods, particularly showing strong performance on real data test sequences despite being trained only on phantom data.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides effective topological localization for bronchoscopy navigation without requiring patient CT scans, reducing setup complexity and costs while maintaining good performance on real clinical data.

Abstract: Video bronchoscopy is a fundamental procedure in respiratory medicine, where
medical experts navigate through the bronchial tree of a patient to diagnose or
operate the patient. Surgeons need to determine the position of the scope as
they go through the airway until they reach the area of interest. This task is
very challenging for practitioners due to the complex bronchial tree structure
and varying doctor experience and training. Navigation assistance to locate the
bronchoscope during the procedure can improve its outcome. Currently used
techniques for navigational guidance commonly rely on previous CT scans of the
patient to obtain a 3D model of the airway, followed by tracking of the scope
with additional sensors or image registration. These methods obtain accurate
locations but imply additional setup, scans and training. Accurate metric
localization is not always required, and a topological localization with regard
to a generic airway model can often suffice to assist the surgeon with
navigation. We present an image-based bronchoscopy topological localization
pipeline to provide navigation assistance during the procedure, with no need of
patient CT scan. Our approach is trained only on phantom data, eliminating the
high cost of real data labeling, and presents good generalization capabilities.
The results obtained surpass existing methods, particularly on real data test
sequences.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel synthetic data generation method for instance-level recognition that creates diverse object instances from multiple domains without real images, enabling improved retrieval performance across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Instance-level recognition requires fine-grained identification but faces challenges in creating large-scale annotated datasets, limiting real-world applicability across domains.

Method: Synthetically generates diverse object instances from multiple domains under varied conditions and backgrounds to create a large-scale training set without relying on real images.

Result: Fine-tuning foundation vision models on the generated data significantly improves retrieval performance across seven ILR benchmarks spanning multiple domains.

Conclusion: The approach offers an efficient alternative to extensive data collection and curation, introducing a new ILR paradigm where only domain names are needed as input, enabling wide real-world applications.

Abstract: Instance-level recognition (ILR) focuses on identifying individual objects
rather than broad categories, offering the highest granularity in image
classification. However, this fine-grained nature makes creating large-scale
annotated datasets challenging, limiting ILR's real-world applicability across
domains. To overcome this, we introduce a novel approach that synthetically
generates diverse object instances from multiple domains under varied
conditions and backgrounds, forming a large-scale training set. Unlike prior
work on automatic data synthesis, our method is the first to address
ILR-specific challenges without relying on any real images. Fine-tuning
foundation vision models on the generated data significantly improves retrieval
performance across seven ILR benchmarks spanning multiple domains. Our approach
offers a new, efficient, and effective alternative to extensive data collection
and curation, introducing a new ILR paradigm where the only input is the names
of the target domains, unlocking a wide range of real-world applications.

*Yuchen Zhang,Yao Lu,Johannes Betz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TARO is a novel object detection framework that goes beyond traditional open-set detection by categorizing unknown objects into meaningful coarse parent categories within a semantic hierarchy, rather than treating all unknowns as a single class.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional object detectors operate under a 'closed-world' assumption and struggle with novel objects in real-world scenarios. While open-set methods identify unknowns, treating all unknowns as a single class is insufficient for safety-critical applications where different types of unknowns require different responses.

Method: TARO uses a unique architecture with: 1) sparsemax-based head for modeling objectness, 2) hierarchy-guided relabeling component for auxiliary supervision, and 3) classification module that learns hierarchical relationships to categorize unknowns into coarse parent categories.

Result: TARO can categorize up to 29.9% of unknowns into meaningful coarse classes, significantly reduces confusion between unknown and known classes, and achieves competitive performance in both unknown recall and known mAP.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges the gap between traditional open-set detection and practical needs by providing more descriptive categorization of unknown objects, which is crucial for safety-critical applications like autonomous driving.

Abstract: Modern object detectors are largely confined to a "closed-world" assumption,
limiting them to a predefined set of classes and posing risks when encountering
novel objects in real-world scenarios. While open-set detection methods aim to
address this by identifying such instances as 'Unknown', this is often
insufficient. Rather than treating all unknowns as a single class, assigning
them more descriptive subcategories can enhance decision-making in
safety-critical contexts. For example, identifying an object as an 'Unknown
Animal' (requiring an urgent stop) versus 'Unknown Debris' (requiring a safe
lane change) is far more useful than just 'Unknown' in autonomous driving. To
bridge this gap, we introduce TARO, a novel detection framework that not only
identifies unknown objects but also classifies them into coarse parent
categories within a semantic hierarchy. TARO employs a unique architecture with
a sparsemax-based head for modeling objectness, a hierarchy-guided relabeling
component that provides auxiliary supervision, and a classification module that
learns hierarchical relationships. Experiments show TARO can categorize up to
29.9% of unknowns into meaningful coarse classes, significantly reduce
confusion between unknown and known classes, and achieve competitive
performance in both unknown recall and known mAP. Code will be made available.

TL;DR: Online Video Depth Anything (oVDA) enables real-time monocular depth estimation from video by adapting LLM techniques like feature caching and frame masking, achieving 20-42 FPS on edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Video Depth Anything (VDA) requires batch processing, making it unsuitable for real-time online applications. The goal is to enable online video depth estimation for deployment on edge devices.

Method: Adapts Large Language Model techniques: caching latent features during inference and masking frames during training to enable online processing.

Result: oVDA outperforms all competing online video depth estimation methods in accuracy and VRAM usage. Achieves 42 FPS on NVIDIA A100 and 20 FPS on NVIDIA Jetson edge device.

Conclusion: The method successfully enables real-time online video depth estimation with low VRAM usage, making it suitable for deployment on edge devices. Code and compilation scripts will be released for easy deployment.

Abstract: Depth estimation from monocular video has become a key component of many
real-world computer vision systems. Recently, Video Depth Anything (VDA) has
demonstrated strong performance on long video sequences. However, it relies on
batch-processing which prohibits its use in an online setting. In this work, we
overcome this limitation and introduce online VDA (oVDA). The key innovation is
to employ techniques from Large Language Models (LLMs), namely, caching latent
features during inference and masking frames at training. Our oVDA method
outperforms all competing online video depth estimation methods in both
accuracy and VRAM usage. Low VRAM usage is particularly important for
deployment on edge devices. We demonstrate that oVDA runs at 42 FPS on an
NVIDIA A100 and at 20 FPS on an NVIDIA Jetson edge device. We will release
both, code and compilation scripts, making oVDA easy to deploy on low-power
hardware.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cricket shot classification from videos is challenging due to the need for effective spatial-temporal modeling, and there's a lack of standardized evaluation protocols in existing literature with potentially inflated performance claims.

Method: Systematically implemented and evaluated 7 deep learning approaches across 4 paradigms: CNN-LSTM, attention models, vision transformers, transfer learning, and EfficientNet-GRU combinations, using PyTorch Lightning with MLOps practices.

Result: Found significant performance gaps - re-implementations of previous methods achieved 46.0%, 55.6%, and 57.7% vs claimed 96%, 99.2%, and 93%. Modern EfficientNet-GRU achieved 92.25% accuracy, showing substantial improvement with modern architectures.

Conclusion: Modern architectures with systematic optimization can achieve high accuracy, and standardized evaluation protocols are critically important for reproducible research in sports video analysis.

Abstract: Cricket shot classification from video sequences remains a challenging
problem in sports video analysis, requiring effective modeling of both spatial
and temporal features. This paper presents the first comprehensive baseline
study comparing seven different deep learning approaches across four distinct
research paradigms for cricket shot classification. We implement and
systematically evaluate traditional CNN-LSTM architectures, attention-based
models, vision transformers, transfer learning approaches, and modern
EfficientNet-GRU combinations on a unified benchmark. A critical finding of our
study is the significant performance gap between claims in academic literature
and practical implementation results. While previous papers reported accuracies
of 96\% (Balaji LRCN), 99.2\% (IJERCSE), and 93\% (Sensors), our standardized
re-implementations achieve 46.0\%, 55.6\%, and 57.7\% respectively. Our modern
SOTA approach, combining EfficientNet-B0 with a GRU-based temporal model,
achieves 92.25\% accuracy, demonstrating that substantial improvements are
possible with modern architectures and systematic optimization. All
implementations follow modern MLOps practices with PyTorch Lightning, providing
a reproducible research platform that exposes the critical importance of
standardized evaluation protocols in sports video analysis research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DAAD-X dataset for interpretable driver intent prediction and proposes VCBM framework that generates spatio-temporally coherent explanations without post-hoc techniques, showing transformers outperform CNNs in interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As autonomous driving systems interact more with humans, interpretability of decision-making becomes crucial for safety. Current deep learning systems lack understanding of underlying representations and causal reasoning for driver decisions.

Method: Created DAAD-X multimodal ego-centric video dataset with hierarchical textual explanations from driver eye-gaze and vehicle perspective. Proposed Video Concept Bottleneck Model (VCBM) for generating coherent explanations inherently without post-hoc techniques.

Result: Transformer-based models demonstrate greater interpretability than CNN-based models. Introduced multilabel t-SNE visualization to show disentanglement and causal correlation among multiple explanations.

Conclusion: The VCBM framework with DAAD-X dataset enables interpretable driver intent prediction, providing causal reasoning for driver decisions and advancing human-machine interaction in autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Autonomous driving (AD) systems are becoming increasingly capable of handling
complex tasks, mainly due to recent advances in deep learning and AI. As
interactions between autonomous systems and humans increase, the
interpretability of decision-making processes in driving systems becomes
increasingly crucial for ensuring safe driving operations. Successful
human-machine interaction requires understanding the underlying representations
of the environment and the driving task, which remains a significant challenge
in deep learning-based systems. To address this, we introduce the task of
interpretability in maneuver prediction before they occur for driver safety,
i.e., driver intent prediction (DIP), which plays a critical role in AD
systems. To foster research in interpretable DIP, we curate the eXplainable
Driving Action Anticipation Dataset (DAAD-X), a new multimodal, ego-centric
video dataset to provide hierarchical, high-level textual explanations as
causal reasoning for the driver's decisions. These explanations are derived
from both the driver's eye-gaze and the ego-vehicle's perspective. Next, we
propose Video Concept Bottleneck Model (VCBM), a framework that generates
spatio-temporally coherent explanations inherently, without relying on post-hoc
techniques. Finally, through extensive evaluations of the proposed VCBM on the
DAAD-X dataset, we demonstrate that transformer-based models exhibit greater
interpretability than conventional CNN-based models. Additionally, we introduce
a multilabel t-SNE visualization technique to illustrate the disentanglement
and causal correlation among multiple explanations. Our data, code and models

TL;DR: Cattle-CLIP is a multimodal deep learning framework for cattle behavior recognition that adapts CLIP with temporal integration and specialized text prompts, achieving 96.1% accuracy on six indoor behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cattle behavior is crucial for animal health and well-being, but existing video-based monitoring faces challenges with domain gaps between pre-trained models and real-world surveillance footage, especially in data-scarce scenarios.

Method: Adapts CLIP model by adding temporal integration module, uses tailored data augmentation and specialized text prompts to bridge domain gap, and evaluates in both fully-supervised and few-shot learning scenarios.

Result: Achieves 96.1% overall accuracy across six behaviors, with nearly 100% recall for feeding, drinking and standing-ruminating behaviors. Demonstrates robust generalization with limited data in few-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: Cattle-CLIP highlights the potential of multimodal learning for agricultural and animal behavior analysis, particularly effective for data-scarce behavior recognition tasks.

Abstract: Cattle behaviour is a crucial indicator of an individual animal health,
productivity and overall well-being. Video-based monitoring, combined with deep
learning techniques, has become a mainstream approach in animal biometrics, and
it can offer high accuracy in some behaviour recognition tasks. We present
Cattle-CLIP, a multimodal deep learning framework for cattle behaviour
recognition, using semantic cues to improve the performance of video-based
visual feature recognition. It is adapted from the large-scale image-language
model CLIP by adding a temporal integration module. To address the domain gap
between web data used for the pre-trained model and real-world cattle
surveillance footage, we introduce tailored data augmentation strategies and
specialised text prompts. Cattle-CLIP is evaluated under both fully-supervised
and few-shot learning scenarios, with a particular focus on data-scarce
behaviour recognition - an important yet under-explored goal in livestock
monitoring. To evaluate the proposed method, we release the CattleBehaviours6
dataset, which comprises six types of indoor behaviours: feeding, drinking,
standing-self-grooming, standing-ruminating, lying-self-grooming and
lying-ruminating. The dataset consists of 1905 clips collected from our John
Oldacre Centre dairy farm research platform housing 200 Holstein-Friesian cows.
Experiments show that Cattle-CLIP achieves 96.1% overall accuracy across six
behaviours in a supervised setting, with nearly 100% recall for feeding,
drinking and standing-ruminating behaviours, and demonstrates robust
generalisation with limited data in few-shot scenarios, highlighting the
potential of multimodal learning in agricultural and animal behaviour analysis.

*Yue Li,Shida Sun,Yu Hong,Feihu Xu,Zhiwei Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Time-Resolved Transformer (TRT) architecture for photon-efficient 3D reconstruction in LOS and NLOS imaging, with specialized attention mechanisms for spatio-temporal transient data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in 3D reconstruction from transient measurements due to low quantum efficiency of sensors and high noise levels, especially for long-range or complex scenes.

Method: TRT architecture with spatio-temporal self-attention encoders that explore local/global correlations, and spatio-temporal cross attention decoders that integrate features in token space. Two task-specific embodiments: TRT-LOS for line-of-sight imaging and TRT-NLOS for non-line-of-sight imaging.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing methods on synthetic and real-world data from different imaging systems. Also contributes a large-scale synthetic LOS dataset and real-world NLOS measurements.

Conclusion: TRT provides a generic and effective solution for photon-efficient 3D reconstruction in both LOS and NLOS imaging scenarios, with superior performance demonstrated across various datasets.

Abstract: Transient measurements, captured by the timeresolved systems, are widely
employed in photon-efficient reconstruction tasks, including line-of-sight
(LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging. However, challenges persist in
their 3D reconstruction due to the low quantum efficiency of sensors and the
high noise levels, particularly for long-range or complex scenes. To boost the
3D reconstruction performance in photon-efficient imaging, we propose a generic
Time-Resolved Transformer (TRT) architecture. Different from existing
transformers designed for high-dimensional data, TRT has two elaborate
attention designs tailored for the spatio-temporal transient measurements.
Specifically, the spatio-temporal self-attention encoders explore both local
and global correlations within transient data by splitting or downsampling
input features into different scales. Then, the spatio-temporal cross attention
decoders integrate the local and global features in the token space, resulting
in deep features with high representation capabilities. Building on TRT, we
develop two task-specific embodiments: TRT-LOS for LOS imaging and TRT-NLOS for
NLOS imaging. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both embodiments
significantly outperform existing methods on synthetic data and real-world data
captured by different imaging systems. In addition, we contribute a
large-scale, high-resolution synthetic LOS dataset with various noise levels
and capture a set of real-world NLOS measurements using a custom-built imaging
system, enhancing the data diversity in this field. Code and datasets are
available at https://github.com/Depth2World/TRT.

*Wuyang Li,Wentao Pan,Po-Chien Luan,Yang Gao,Alexandre Alahi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SVI generates infinite-length videos with high temporal consistency and controllable storylines by using Error-Recycling Fine-Tuning, which trains the model to correct its own errors through closed-loop recycling of self-generated errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing long-video methods suffer from accumulated errors and produce homogeneous scenes with repetitive motions due to the discrepancy between training on clean data and testing on self-generated outputs.

Method: Error-Recycling Fine-Tuning that injects historical errors into clean inputs, approximates predictions with one-step bidirectional integration, calculates errors with residuals, and dynamically banks errors into replay memory for resampling.

Result: SVI scales videos from seconds to infinite durations with no additional inference cost, maintaining compatibility with diverse conditions like audio, skeleton, and text streams.

Conclusion: SVI achieves state-of-the-art performance on three benchmarks, demonstrating versatility in consistent, creative, and conditional video generation settings.

Abstract: We propose Stable Video Infinity (SVI) that is able to generate
infinite-length videos with high temporal consistency, plausible scene
transitions, and controllable streaming storylines. While existing long-video
methods attempt to mitigate accumulated errors via handcrafted anti-drifting
(e.g., modified noise scheduler, frame anchoring), they remain limited to
single-prompt extrapolation, producing homogeneous scenes with repetitive
motions. We identify that the fundamental challenge extends beyond error
accumulation to a critical discrepancy between the training assumption (seeing
clean data) and the test-time autoregressive reality (conditioning on
self-generated, error-prone outputs). To bridge this hypothesis gap, SVI
incorporates Error-Recycling Fine-Tuning, a new type of efficient training that
recycles the Diffusion Transformer (DiT)'s self-generated errors into
supervisory prompts, thereby encouraging DiT to actively identify and correct
its own errors. This is achieved by injecting, collecting, and banking errors
through closed-loop recycling, autoregressively learning from error-injected
feedback. Specifically, we (i) inject historical errors made by DiT to
intervene on clean inputs, simulating error-accumulated trajectories in flow
matching; (ii) efficiently approximate predictions with one-step bidirectional
integration and calculate errors with residuals; (iii) dynamically bank errors
into replay memory across discretized timesteps, which are resampled for new
input. SVI is able to scale videos from seconds to infinite durations with no
additional inference cost, while remaining compatible with diverse conditions
(e.g., audio, skeleton, and text streams). We evaluate SVI on three benchmarks,
including consistent, creative, and conditional settings, thoroughly verifying
its versatility and state-of-the-art role.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TEMA-LLM is a cross-domain sequential recommendation framework that uses LLMs for semantic tag generation and multi-attention mechanisms to model user preferences across domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve cross-domain sequential recommendation by better capturing domain-specific and cross-domain behavioral patterns for personalized consumer experiences in e-commerce platforms.

Method: Uses LLMs to generate descriptive tags from item titles/descriptions, fuses tag embeddings with item identifiers and features, and employs Tag-Enriched Multi-Attention to model user preferences within and across domains.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on four large-scale e-commerce datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of LLM-based semantic tagging and multi-attention integration.

Conclusion: LLMs show strong potential for advancing intelligent, user-centric recommendation systems in consumer electronics through semantic enrichment and cross-domain modeling.

Abstract: Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) plays a crucial role in modern
consumer electronics and e-commerce platforms, where users interact with
diverse services such as books, movies, and online retail products. These
systems must accurately capture both domain-specific and cross-domain
behavioral patterns to provide personalized and seamless consumer experiences.
To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{TEMA-LLM} (\textit{Tag-Enriched
Multi-Attention with Large Language Models}), a practical and effective
framework that integrates \textit{Large Language Models (LLMs)} for semantic
tag generation and enrichment. Specifically, TEMA-LLM employs LLMs to assign
domain-aware prompts and generate descriptive tags from item titles and
descriptions. The resulting tag embeddings are fused with item identifiers as
well as textual and visual features to construct enhanced item representations.
A \textit{Tag-Enriched Multi-Attention} mechanism is then introduced to jointly
model user preferences within and across domains, enabling the system to
capture complex and evolving consumer interests. Extensive experiments on four
large-scale e-commerce datasets demonstrate that TEMA-LLM consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, underscoring the benefits of LLM-based
semantic tagging and multi-attention integration for consumer-facing
recommendation systems. The proposed approach highlights the potential of LLMs
to advance intelligent, user-centric services in the field of consumer
electronics.

TL;DR: This paper proposes HMVDx, a hybrid framework using Multimodal Large Language Models for low-cost shoulder disorder diagnosis from consumer-grade videos, achieving 79.6% accuracy improvement over direct video diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of early and accurate diagnosis of shoulder disorders in resource-scarce regions by developing low-cost, scalable solutions using consumer-grade devices.

Method: Proposes HMVDx framework that divides action understanding and disease diagnosis tasks between two MLLMs, using videos from consumer devices and introducing a Usability Index metric based on medical decision-making logic.

Result: HMVDx achieved 79.6% higher accuracy in diagnosing shoulder joint injuries compared to direct video diagnosis methods.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates significant potential for low-cost MLLM applications in medical diagnostics, particularly for video understanding in healthcare settings with limited resources.

Abstract: Shoulder disorders, such as frozen shoulder (a.k.a., adhesive capsulitis),
are common conditions affecting the health of people worldwide, and have a high
incidence rate among the elderly and workers engaged in repetitive shoulder
tasks. In regions with scarce medical resources, achieving early and accurate
diagnosis poses significant challenges, and there is an urgent need for
low-cost and easily scalable auxiliary diagnostic solutions. This research
introduces videos captured by consumer-grade devices as the basis for
diagnosis, reducing the cost for users. We focus on the innovative application
of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in the preliminary diagnosis of
shoulder disorders and propose a Hybrid Motion Video Diagnosis framework
(HMVDx). This framework divides the two tasks of action understanding and
disease diagnosis, which are respectively completed by two MLLMs. In addition
to traditional evaluation indicators, this work proposes a novel metric called
Usability Index by the logical process of medical decision-making (action
recognition, movement diagnosis, and final diagnosis). This index evaluates the
effectiveness of MLLMs in the medical field from the perspective of the entire
medical diagnostic pathway, revealing the potential value of low-cost MLLMs in
medical applications for medical practitioners. In experimental comparisons,
the accuracy of HMVDx in diagnosing shoulder joint injuries has increased by
79.6\% compared with direct video diagnosis, a significant technical
contribution to future research on the application of MLLMs for video
understanding in the medical field.

*Alina Elena Baia,Alessio Xompero,Andrea Cavallaro*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs lag behind specialized models in image privacy prediction accuracy despite being more resource-intensive, though they show higher robustness to image perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of systematic evaluation comparing large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) against specialized models for image privacy prediction, as current trends favor VLMs without considering performance ceilings of purpose-built models.

Method: Established a zero-shot benchmark for image privacy classification, evaluated top-3 open-source VLMs using task-aligned prompts, and compared their performance, efficiency, and robustness against established vision-only and multi-modal methods.

Result: VLMs currently lag behind specialized, smaller models in privacy prediction accuracy despite their resource-intensive nature (high parameter count and slower inference). However, VLMs exhibit higher robustness to image perturbations.

Conclusion: Specialized models still outperform VLMs in image privacy prediction accuracy, challenging the trend of favoring generic VLMs over purpose-built solutions, though VLMs offer advantages in robustness.

Abstract: While specialized learning-based models have historically dominated image
privacy prediction, the current literature increasingly favours adopting large
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) designed for generic tasks. This trend risks
overlooking the performance ceiling set by purpose-built models due to a lack
of systematic evaluation. To address this problem, we establish a zero-shot
benchmark for image privacy classification, enabling a fair comparison. We
evaluate the top-3 open-source VLMs, according to a privacy benchmark, using
task-aligned prompts and we contrast their performance, efficiency, and
robustness against established vision-only and multi-modal methods.
Counter-intuitively, our results show that VLMs, despite their
resource-intensive nature in terms of high parameter count and slower
inference, currently lag behind specialized, smaller models in privacy
prediction accuracy. We also find that VLMs exhibit higher robustness to image
perturbations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Using discrete semantic entropy (DSE) to filter out high-entropy questions improves accuracy of black-box vision-language models in radiologic VQA by detecting and rejecting questions likely to cause hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve accuracy of black-box vision-language models in radiologic image-based visual question answering by detecting and filtering out questions that are likely to generate hallucinations.

Method: Evaluated DSE using two datasets: VQA-Med 2019 benchmark and diagnostic radiology dataset. GPT-4o and GPT-4.1 answered questions multiple times with temperature 1.0. Meaning-equivalent responses were grouped using bidirectional entailment checks, and DSE was computed from semantic cluster frequencies. Accuracy was recalculated after excluding high-entropy questions.

Result: After filtering high-entropy questions (DSE > 0.3), accuracy improved from 51.7% to 76.3% for GPT-4o (retaining 334/706 questions) and from 54.8% to 63.8% for GPT-4.1 (retaining 499/706 questions), both statistically significant (p < .001).

Conclusion: DSE enables reliable hallucination detection in black-box VLMs by quantifying semantic inconsistency, significantly improves diagnostic answer accuracy, and offers a practical filtering strategy for clinical VLM applications.

Abstract: To determine whether using discrete semantic entropy (DSE) to reject
questions likely to generate hallucinations can improve the accuracy of
black-box vision-language models (VLMs) in radiologic image based visual
question answering (VQA). This retrospective study evaluated DSE using two
publicly available, de-identified datasets: (i) the VQA-Med 2019 benchmark (500
images with clinical questions and short-text answers) and (ii) a diagnostic
radiology dataset (206 cases: 60 computed tomography scans, 60 magnetic
resonance images, 60 radiographs, 26 angiograms) with corresponding
ground-truth diagnoses. GPT-4o and GPT-4.1 answered each question 15 times
using a temperature of 1.0. Baseline accuracy was determined using
low-temperature answers (temperature 0.1). Meaning-equivalent responses were
grouped using bidirectional entailment checks, and DSE was computed from the
relative frequencies of the resulting semantic clusters. Accuracy was
recalculated after excluding questions with DSE > 0.6 or > 0.3. p-values and
95% confidence intervals were obtained using bootstrap resampling and a
Bonferroni-corrected threshold of p < .004 for statistical significance. Across
706 image-question pairs, baseline accuracy was 51.7% for GPT-4o and 54.8% for
GPT-4.1. After filtering out high-entropy questions (DSE > 0.3), accuracy on
the remaining questions was 76.3% (retained questions: 334/706) for GPT-4o and
63.8% (retained questions: 499/706) for GPT-4.1 (both p < .001). Accuracy gains
were observed across both datasets and largely remained statistically
significant after Bonferroni correction. DSE enables reliable hallucination
detection in black-box VLMs by quantifying semantic inconsistency. This method
significantly improves diagnostic answer accuracy and offers a filtering
strategy for clinical VLM applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified framework that jointly optimizes Temporal Sentence Grounding and Referring Video Object Segmentation, using a FIND token for key moment identification and Moment-Centric Sampling for efficient frame selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sampling strategies for LLM-based RefVOS approaches either use handcrafted heuristics that miss temporal cues or external keyframe models that increase system complexity.

Method: Proposes a unified framework with: 1) TSG paradigm using FIND token for key moment identification via temporal token similarity matching, 2) Moment-Centric Sampling strategy for dense sampling of informative moments, 3) Bidirectional Anchor-updated Propagation for stable tracking with dynamic anchor updates.

Result: The approach avoids external timestamp encodings, preserves both motion details and global context through intelligent sampling, and enhances tracking stability by mitigating accumulated errors.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides an integrated solution for RefVOS that naturally incorporates key moment grounding capability while maintaining system simplicity and improving temporal reasoning.

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RefVOS) seeks to segment target objects
in videos guided by natural language descriptions, demanding both temporal
reasoning and fine-grained visual comprehension. Existing sampling strategies
for LLM-based approaches typically rely on either handcrafted heuristics or
external keyframe models. The former often overlooks essential temporal cues,
while the latter increases system complexity. To address this, we propose a
unified framework that jointly optimizes Temporal Sentence Grounding (TSG) and
RefVOS, naturally incorporating key moment grounding capability. During
training, we introduce a novel TSG paradigm that employs a dedicated
\texttt{[FIND]} token for key moment identification through temporal token
similarity matching, thereby avoiding the need for external timestamp
encodings. For inference, we design a Moment-Centric Sampling (MCS) strategy
that densely samples informative moments while sparsely sampling non-essential
frames, preserving both motion details and global context. To further enhance
tracking stability, we develop Bidirectional Anchor-updated Propagation (BAP),
which leverages the most relevant moment as start point for high-quality mask
initialization and dynamically updates at sampled points to mitigate
accumulated errors. Code and model will be available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VPPO is a novel policy gradient algorithm that leverages token perception in multimodal RLVR, focusing on visually-dependent tokens to enhance reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal RLVR methods neglect visual perception's role in optimization, particularly how different tokens vary in their visual dependency during reasoning processes.

Method: VPPO uses token perception analysis to identify visually-dependent tokens, then applies dual mechanisms: reweighting trajectory advantages by visual dependency and focusing policy updates on perceptually pivotal tokens.

Result: VPPO achieves substantial gains over leading open-source RL-tuned models across eight perception and reasoning benchmarks, with consistent effectiveness at 7B and 32B model scales.

Conclusion: The work establishes a token-level perceptual perspective for analyzing multimodal RLVR and presents an effective optimization strategy to significantly enhance LVLMs' multimodal reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has advanced the
reasoning capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), most existing
methods in multimodal reasoning neglect the critical role of visual perception
within the RLVR optimization process. In this paper, we undertake a pioneering
exploration of multimodal RLVR through the novel perspective of token
perception, which measures the visual dependency of each generated token. With
a granular analysis of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) processes, we uncover two key
insights: first, token perception in a rollout trajectory is sparsely
distributed, where only a small fraction of tokens have high visual dependency
for visually-grounded reasoning; second, different trajectories exhibit
significant divergence in their overall visual dependency. Based on these
observations, we propose Visually-Perceptive Policy Optimization (VPPO), a
novel policy gradient algorithm that explicitly leverages token perception to
refine the learning signal. Specifically, VPPO achieves this through a dual
mechanism: it reweights a trajectory's advantage by its overall visual
dependency, and focuses policy updates exclusively on perceptually pivotal
tokens. On a comprehensive suite of eight perception and reasoning benchmarks,
VPPO demonstrates substantial gains over leading open-source RL-tuned models,
with its effectiveness consistently validated across 7B and 32B model scales.
Our findings not only establish a new token-level perceptual perspective for
analyzing multimodal RLVR but also present a novel and effective optimization
strategy to significantly enhance the multimodal reasoning capabilities of
LVLMs.

TL;DR: Human visual gaze follows Levy walk dynamics similar to animal foraging, suggesting optimal information search efficiency. A CNN model can predict fixation patterns from images alone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the spatiotemporal statistics of human eye movements during visual exploration, which has applications in attention modeling and vision-based interfaces.

Method: Conducted large-scale experiment with 40 participants viewing 50 diverse images, recording over 4 million gaze points using high-speed eye tracker. Analyzed gaze trajectories and trained CNN to predict fixation heatmaps from images.

Result: Human gaze trajectories follow Levy walk patterns similar to animal foraging. CNN model successfully predicted salient fixation regions in novel images, showing gaze behavior is learnable from visual structure.

Conclusion: Human visual exploration obeys statistical laws analogous to natural foraging, opening avenues for modeling gaze through generative and predictive frameworks.

Abstract: Animals often forage via Levy walks stochastic trajectories with heavy tailed
step lengths optimized for sparse resource environments. We show that human
visual gaze follows similar dynamics when scanning images. While traditional
models emphasize image based saliency, the underlying spatiotemporal statistics
of eye movements remain underexplored. Understanding these dynamics has broad
applications in attention modeling and vision-based interfaces. In this study,
we conducted a large scale human subject experiment involving 40 participants
viewing 50 diverse images under unconstrained conditions, recording over 4
million gaze points using a high speed eye tracker. Analysis of these data
shows that the gaze trajectory of the human eye also follows a Levy walk akin
to animal foraging. This suggests that the human eye forages for visual
information in an optimally efficient manner. Further, we trained a
convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict fixation heatmaps from image
input alone. The model accurately reproduced salient fixation regions across
novel images, demonstrating that key components of gaze behavior are learnable
from visual structure alone. Our findings present new evidence that human
visual exploration obeys statistical laws analogous to natural foraging and
open avenues for modeling gaze through generative and predictive frameworks.

TL;DR: CapGeo introduces a caption-assisted reasoning framework that converts geometric diagrams into textual descriptions to improve MLLMs' geometric reasoning, achieving substantial performance gains (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-72B from 8.6% to 59.0%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Geometric reasoning remains a core challenge for MLLMs, with advanced systems struggling despite strong textual reasoning abilities. The bottleneck appears to be understanding geometric diagrams rather than reasoning itself.

Method: Proposes CapGeo, a caption-assisted reasoning framework that bridges visual and textual modalities by converting geometric figures into concise textual descriptions. Also introduces CapGeo-Bench, a dataset of 4,641 figure-caption pairs with keypoint-based evaluation metric.

Result: Substantial improvements when models use captions: Qwen2.5-VL-72B improved from 8.6% (vision-only) to 59.0%, Claude-Opus-4 from 44.8% to 73.0%. The keypoint-based metric strongly correlates with downstream CapGeo performance.

Conclusion: Caption-assisted reasoning provides a new pathway for advancing geometric reasoning in MLLMs, effectively bridging the gap between visual understanding and textual reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Geometric reasoning remains a core challenge for Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs). Even the most advanced closed-source systems, such as GPT-O3
and Gemini-2.5-Pro, still struggle to solve geometry problems reliably, despite
exhibiting strong textual reasoning abilities on tasks like the International
Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). This gap suggests that the bottleneck lies in
understanding geometric diagrams rather than reasoning itself. Since geometric
figures can often be faithfully described in concise textual form, converting
visual content into captions offers a promising direction. Motivated by this
insight, we introduce CapGeo, a caption-assisted reasoning framework that
bridges visual and textual modalities. Experiments show substantial
improvements when models are equipped with captions: Qwen2.5-VL-72B improves
from 8.6% (vision-only) to 59.0%, while Claude-Opus-4 rises from 44.8% to
73.0%. To systematically evaluate and identify high-quality geometric
captioning models, we further propose CapGeo-Bench, a dataset of 4,641 curated
figure-caption pairs. Crucially, CapGeo-Bench incorporates a keypoint-based
evaluation metric that correlates strongly with downstream CapGeo performance,
enabling reliable assessment of geometric captioning ability. Together, our
framework and benchmark highlight a new pathway toward advancing geometric
reasoning in MLLMs.

Abstract: Accurate and real-time radio map (RM) generation is crucial for

Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that RadioFlow achieves state-of-the-art
performance with \textbf{up to 8$\times$ fewer parameters} and \textbf{over

Method: A coarse-to-fine progressive learning framework: 1) Aggregates multi-grained features from CLIP (global semantics) and DINO (local details) under contrastive language guidance with a proxy task comparing close-distant image patches; 2) Integrates camera pose information and pixel-wise language alignment to refine depth predictions, working as a plug-and-play encoder for existing MDE pipelines.

Result: Extensive experiments on KITTI benchmark show significant outperformance over state-of-the-art methods across all metrics, with demonstrated benefits for downstream tasks like BEV perception.

Conclusion: Hybrid-depth effectively addresses feature granularity mismatches by combining CLIP's semantic context and DINO's spatial details through language guidance, providing a powerful plug-and-play solution for self-supervised monocular depth estimation.

Abstract: Current self-supervised monocular depth estimation (MDE) approaches encounter
performance limitations due to insufficient semantic-spatial knowledge
extraction. To address this challenge, we propose Hybrid-depth, a novel
framework that systematically integrates foundation models (e.g., CLIP and
DINO) to extract visual priors and acquire sufficient contextual information
for MDE. Our approach introduces a coarse-to-fine progressive learning
framework: 1) Firstly, we aggregate multi-grained features from CLIP (global
semantics) and DINO (local spatial details) under contrastive language
guidance. A proxy task comparing close-distant image patches is designed to
enforce depth-aware feature alignment using text prompts; 2) Next, building on
the coarse features, we integrate camera pose information and pixel-wise
language alignment to refine depth predictions. This module seamlessly
integrates with existing self-supervised MDE pipelines (e.g., Monodepth2,
ManyDepth) as a plug-and-play depth encoder, enhancing continuous depth
estimation. By aggregating CLIP's semantic context and DINO's spatial details
through language guidance, our method effectively addresses feature granularity
mismatches. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms SOTA methods across all metrics, which also
indeed benefits downstream tasks like BEV perception. Code is available at

*Zenan Lin,Wei Li,Jintao Chen,Zihao Wu,Wenxiong Kang,Changxin Gao,Liansheng Wang,Jin-Gang Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IRCR-Net is a semi-supervised method for nuclei instance segmentation that uses instance-aware consistency regularization and morphological priors to handle dense and overlapping nuclei while reducing pseudo-label noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fully supervised methods are limited by scarce annotated data, while existing semi-supervised methods fail to regularize instance-level consistency, lack pathological structure priors, and introduce noisy pseudo-labels during training.

Method: Proposes Instance-Aware Robust Consistency Regularization Network (IRCR-Net) with Matching-Driven Instance-Aware Consistency (MIAC) and Prior-Driven Instance-Aware Consistency (PIAC) mechanisms. Uses morphological priors to assess pseudo-label quality, discarding low-quality and enhancing high-quality predictions.

Result: Significantly enhances semi-supervised nuclei instance segmentation performance across multiple public datasets, even surpassing fully supervised methods in some scenarios.

Conclusion: IRCR-Net effectively addresses limitations of existing semi-supervised methods by incorporating instance-level consistency regularization and morphological priors, achieving robust performance in nuclei segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Nuclei instance segmentation in pathological images is crucial for downstream
tasks such as tumor microenvironment analysis. However, the high cost and
scarcity of annotated data limit the applicability of fully supervised methods,
while existing semi-supervised methods fail to adequately regularize
consistency at the instance level, lack leverage of the inherent prior
knowledge of pathological structures, and are prone to introducing noisy
pseudo-labels during training. In this paper, we propose an Instance-Aware
Robust Consistency Regularization Network (IRCR-Net) for accurate
instance-level nuclei segmentation. Specifically, we introduce the
Matching-Driven Instance-Aware Consistency (MIAC) and Prior-Driven
Instance-Aware Consistency (PIAC) mechanisms to refine the nuclei instance
segmentation result of the teacher and student subnetwork, particularly for
densely distributed and overlapping nuclei. We incorporate morphological prior
knowledge of nuclei in pathological images and utilize these priors to assess
the quality of pseudo-labels generated from unlabeled data. Low-quality
pseudo-labels are discarded, while high-quality predictions are enhanced to
reduce pseudo-label noise and benefit the network's robust training.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly
enhances semi-supervised nuclei instance segmentation performance across
multiple public datasets compared to existing approaches, even surpassing fully
supervised methods in some scenarios.

*Jinyuan Liu,Zihang Chen,Zhu Liu,Zhiying Jiang,Long Ma,Xin Fan,Risheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes PPFN, a Progressive Prompt Fusion Network for thermal infrared image enhancement that handles coupled degradations through prompt-based feature modulation and selective progressive training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on individual degradations and struggle with coupled degradations, while all-in-one enhancement methods for RGB sensors are ineffective due to different imaging models in thermal infrared.

Method: PPFN establishes prompt pairs based on thermal imaging process, fuses them to modulate features for specific degradations, and uses Selective Progressive Training to gradually refine handling of composite cases.

Result: The approach achieves 8.76% improvement on complex degradation scenes, removes camera noise while retaining structural details, and enhances overall contrast of thermal images.

Conclusion: PPFN effectively addresses coupled degradations in thermal infrared images through prompt fusion and progressive training, outperforming existing methods on a new high-quality benchmark.

Abstract: We engage in the relatively underexplored task named thermal infrared image
enhancement. Existing infrared image enhancement methods primarily focus on
tackling individual degradations, such as noise, contrast, and blurring, making
it difficult to handle coupled degradations. Meanwhile, all-in-one enhancement
methods, commonly applied to RGB sensors, often demonstrate limited
effectiveness due to the significant differences in imaging models. In sight of
this, we first revisit the imaging mechanism and introduce a Progressive Prompt
Fusion Network (PPFN). Specifically, the PPFN initially establishes prompt
pairs based on the thermal imaging process. For each type of degradation, we
fuse the corresponding prompt pairs to modulate the model's features, providing
adaptive guidance that enables the model to better address specific
degradations under single or multiple conditions. In addition, a Selective
Progressive Training (SPT) mechanism is introduced to gradually refine the
model's handling of composite cases to align the enhancement process, which not
only allows the model to remove camera noise and retain key structural details,
but also enhancing the overall contrast of the thermal image. Furthermore, we
introduce the most high-quality, multi-scenarios infrared benchmark covering a
wide range of scenarios. Extensive experiments substantiate that our approach
not only delivers promising visual results under specific degradation but also
significantly improves performance on complex degradation scenes, achieving a
notable 8.76\% improvement. Code is available at

*Qihang Ma,Shengyu Li,Jie Tang,Dingkang Yang,Shaodong Chen,Yingyi Zhang,Chao Feng,Jiao Ran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes using vision-language models (VLMs) for multi-modal keyphrase prediction, addressing limitations of traditional methods through zero-shot/SFT baselines, Fine-tune-CoT for reasoning enhancement, and dynamic CoT to prevent overthinking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multi-modal approaches have limitations in handling absence and unseen scenarios, and existing benchmarks overestimate model capability due to training-test overlap.

Method: Three strategies: 1) zero-shot and supervised fine-tuning for baseline performance, 2) Fine-tune-CoT using teacher-generated reasoning data, 3) dynamic CoT that adaptively injects reasoning data during training.

Result: Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed VLM-based strategies with dynamic CoT effectively address multi-modal keyphrase prediction challenges and improve reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Multi-modal keyphrase prediction (MMKP) aims to advance beyond text-only
methods by incorporating multiple modalities of input information to produce a
set of conclusive phrases. Traditional multi-modal approaches have been proven
to have significant limitations in handling the challenging absence and unseen
scenarios. Additionally, we identify shortcomings in existing benchmarks that
overestimate model capability due to significant overlap in training tests. In
this work, we propose leveraging vision-language models (VLMs) for the MMKP
task. Firstly, we use two widely-used strategies, e.g., zero-shot and
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to assess the lower bound performance of VLMs.
Next, to improve the complex reasoning capabilities of VLMs, we adopt
Fine-tune-CoT, which leverages high-quality CoT reasoning data generated by a
teacher model to finetune smaller models. Finally, to address the
"overthinking" phenomenon, we propose a dynamic CoT strategy which adaptively
injects CoT data during training, allowing the model to flexibly leverage its
reasoning capabilities during the inference stage. We evaluate the proposed
strategies on various datasets and the experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed approaches. The code is available at

*Junyan Ye,Dongzhi Jiang,Jun He,Baichuan Zhou,Zilong Huang,Zhiyuan Yan,Hongsheng Li,Conghui He,Weijia Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BLINK-Twice is a vision-centric reasoning benchmark that tests MLLMs' ability to reason from visual content alone, moving beyond shallow perception to require fine-grained observation and analytical reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reasoning benchmarks primarily assess language-based reasoning and treat visual input as replaceable context, failing to properly evaluate vision-centric reasoning capabilities in MLLMs.

Method: The benchmark integrates seven types of visual challenges, natural adversarial image pairs to enforce visual reliance, and annotated reasoning chains for fine-grained evaluation of the reasoning process rather than just final answers.

Result: BLINK-Twice poses significant challenges to current MLLMs. While language-based reasoning strategies like chain-of-thought can improve performance, they often result in unstable reasoning. Repeated image observation improves performance, and active visual interaction models highlight the need for new vision reasoning paradigms.

Conclusion: Current MLLMs struggle with vision-centric reasoning, and there's a need for new reasoning paradigms specifically designed for visual content rather than adapting language-based reasoning strategies.

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made rapid progress,
particularly in enhancing their reasoning capabilities. However, existing
reasoning benchmarks still primarily assess language-based reasoning, often
treating visual input as replaceable context. To address this gap, we introduce
BLINK-Twice, a vision-centric reasoning benchmark grounded in challenging
perceptual tasks. Instead of relying on external knowledge, our tasks require
models to reason from visual content alone, shifting the focus from
language-based to image-grounded reasoning. Compared to prior perception
benchmarks, it moves beyond shallow perception ("see") and requires
fine-grained observation and analytical reasoning ("observe"). BLINK-Twice
integrates three core components: seven types of visual challenges for testing
visual reasoning, natural adversarial image pairs that enforce reliance on
visual content, and annotated reasoning chains for fine-grained evaluation of
the reasoning process rather than final answers alone. We evaluate 20 leading
MLLMs, including 12 foundation models and 8 reasoning-enhanced models.
BLINK-Twice poses a significant challenge to current models. While existing
reasoning strategies in the language space-such as chain-of-thought or
self-criticism can improve performance, they often result in unstable and
redundant reasoning. We observe that repeated image observation improves
performance across models, and active visual interaction, as demonstrated by
models like o3, highlights the need for a new paradigm for vision reasoning.

*Yikang Zhang,Rui Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VAD-GS improves 3D Gaussian splatting for urban scenes by recovering missing geometry through voxel-based visibility analysis, diversity-aware view selection, and patch matching-based reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS performance depends on initial point cloud quality, which often fails in unbounded, dynamic urban environments due to incomplete coverage and overlapping frustums. Existing densification methods cannot reconstruct missing structures.

Method: VAD-GS uses voxel-based visibility reasoning to identify unreliable geometry, diversity-aware view selection for informative supporting views, and patch matching-based multi-view stereo reconstruction to recover missing structures and generate new Gaussian primitives.

Result: Extensive experiments on Waymo and nuScenes datasets show VAD-GS outperforms state-of-the-art 3DGS approaches and significantly improves reconstructed geometry quality for both static and dynamic objects.

Conclusion: VAD-GS effectively addresses geometry recovery challenges in urban scenes by generating new Gaussian primitives guided by reliable geometric priors, even in regions lacking initial points.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive performance in
synthesizing high-fidelity novel views. Nonetheless, its effectiveness
critically depends on the quality of the initialized point cloud. Specifically,
achieving uniform and complete point coverage over the underlying scene
structure requires overlapping observation frustums, an assumption that is
often violated in unbounded, dynamic urban environments. Training Gaussian
models with partially initialized point clouds often leads to distortions and
artifacts, as camera rays may fail to intersect valid surfaces, resulting in
incorrect gradient propagation to Gaussian primitives associated with occluded
or invisible geometry. Additionally, existing densification strategies simply
clone and split Gaussian primitives from existing ones, incapable of
reconstructing missing structures. To address these limitations, we propose
VAD-GS, a 3DGS framework tailored for geometry recovery in challenging urban
scenes. Our method identifies unreliable geometry structures via voxel-based
visibility reasoning, selects informative supporting views through
diversity-aware view selection, and recovers missing structures via patch
matching-based multi-view stereo reconstruction. This design enables the
generation of new Gaussian primitives guided by reliable geometric priors, even
in regions lacking initial points. Extensive experiments on the Waymo and
nuScenes datasets demonstrate that VAD-GS outperforms state-of-the-art 3DGS
approaches and significantly improves the quality of reconstructed geometry for
both static and dynamic objects. Source code will be released upon publication.

TL;DR: Minkowski-MambaNet is a deep learning framework that directly estimates forest volume and biomass from raw LiDAR data by integrating Mamba's Selective State Space Model with Minkowski networks to capture long-range dependencies for better tree differentiation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate forest biomass quantification is vital for carbon cycle monitoring, but directly estimating woody volume and AGB from LiDAR point clouds is challenging due to difficulties in modeling long-range dependencies needed to distinguish trees.

Method: Proposes Minkowski-MambaNet framework that integrates Mamba model's Selective State Space Model (SSM) into a Minkowski network to encode global context and long-range dependencies. Uses skip connections to enhance features and accelerate convergence.

Conclusion: Offers a powerful tool for large-scale forest biomass analysis, advancing LiDAR-based forest inventories by enabling direct volume and AGB estimation from raw LiDAR without DTM requirements.

Abstract: Accurate forest biomass quantification is vital for carbon cycle monitoring.
While airborne LiDAR excels at capturing 3D forest structure, directly
estimating woody volume and Aboveground Biomass (AGB) from point clouds is
challenging due to difficulties in modeling long-range dependencies needed to
distinguish trees.We propose Minkowski-MambaNet, a novel deep learning
framework that directly estimates volume and AGB from raw LiDAR. Its key
innovation is integrating the Mamba model's Selective State Space Model (SSM)

incorporated to enhance features and accelerate convergence.Evaluated on Danish
National Forest Inventory LiDAR data, Minkowski-MambaNet significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing more accurate and robust

### [75] [Utilizing dynamic sparsity on pretrained DETR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09380)
*Reza Sedghi,Anand Subramoney,David Kappel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces two methods for sparsifying MLP layers in DETR models without retraining: SIBS (static heuristic) and MGS (dynamic gating), with MGS achieving 85-95% sparsity while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based models face efficiency challenges in vision tasks like object detection, particularly due to computational demands of MLP layers.

Method: Two approaches: SIBS uses fixed activation patterns to predict neuron inactivity, while MGS employs a lightweight gating mechanism with a small linear layer to predict dynamic sparsity patterns.

Result: MGS achieves 85-95% activation sparsity on COCO dataset while maintaining or improving performance, significantly reducing computation.

Conclusion: MGS provides a practical, input-adaptive sparsification method that enables efficient deployment of pretrained vision transformers without full model retraining.

Abstract: Efficient inference with transformer-based models remains a challenge,
especially in vision tasks like object detection. We analyze the inherent
sparsity in the MLP layers of DETR and introduce two methods to exploit it
without retraining. First, we propose Static Indicator-Based Sparsification
(SIBS), a heuristic method that predicts neuron inactivity based on fixed
activation patterns. While simple, SIBS offers limited gains due to the
input-dependent nature of sparsity. To address this, we introduce Micro-Gated
Sparsification (MGS), a lightweight gating mechanism trained on top of a
pretrained DETR. MGS predicts dynamic sparsity using a small linear layer and
achieves up to 85 to 95% activation sparsity. Experiments on the COCO dataset
show that MGS maintains or even improves performance while significantly
reducing computation. Our method offers a practical, input-adaptive approach to
sparsification, enabling efficient deployment of pretrained vision transformers
without full model retraining.

TL;DR: Mono4DEditor enables text-driven editing of 4D scenes from monocular videos using language-embedded 3D Gaussians and diffusion-based editing with temporal coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Editing 4D scenes from monocular videos is challenging but valuable for content creation and virtual environments, requiring precise semantic edits while preserving unedited content.

Method: Augments 3D Gaussians with quantized CLIP features for semantic querying, uses two-stage point-level localization (CLIP similarity + spatial refinement), and applies diffusion-based video editing with flow/scribble guidance.

Result: Enables high-quality text-driven edits across diverse scenes and object types while preserving appearance and geometry of unedited areas, outperforming prior approaches.

Conclusion: Mono4DEditor provides a flexible and accurate framework for text-driven 4D scene editing with improved visual fidelity and temporal coherence.

Abstract: Editing 4D scenes reconstructed from monocular videos based on text prompts
is a valuable yet challenging task with broad applications in content creation
and virtual environments. The key difficulty lies in achieving semantically
precise edits in localized regions of complex, dynamic scenes, while preserving
the integrity of unedited content. To address this, we introduce Mono4DEditor,
a novel framework for flexible and accurate text-driven 4D scene editing. Our
method augments 3D Gaussians with quantized CLIP features to form a
language-embedded dynamic representation, enabling efficient semantic querying
of arbitrary spatial regions. We further propose a two-stage point-level
localization strategy that first selects candidate Gaussians via CLIP
similarity and then refines their spatial extent to improve accuracy. Finally,
targeted edits are performed on localized regions using a diffusion-based video
editing model, with flow and scribble guidance ensuring spatial fidelity and
temporal coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mono4DEditor enables
high-quality, text-driven edits across diverse scenes and object types, while
preserving the appearance and geometry of unedited areas and surpassing prior
approaches in both flexibility and visual fidelity.

TL;DR: DWTA-Net is a two-stage framework for low-light video enhancement that jointly exploits short- and long-term temporal cues to suppress noise and artifacts in real-world low-light videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning-based approaches for low-light video enhancement struggle with heavy noise in real scenes due to limitations in effectively leveraging temporal information.

Method: Two-stage framework: Stage I uses Visual State-Space blocks for multi-frame alignment to recover brightness, color and structure. Stage II introduces recurrent refinement with dynamic weight-based temporal aggregation guided by optical flow to balance static and dynamic regions, plus texture-adaptive loss for detail preservation.

Result: Experiments on real-world low-light videos show DWTA-Net effectively suppresses noise and artifacts, delivering superior visual quality compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: DWTA-Net successfully addresses the challenge of heavy noise in low-light video enhancement by effectively leveraging both short- and long-term temporal information through its two-stage framework.

Abstract: Low-light video enhancement (LLVE) is challenging due to noise, low contrast,
and color degradations. Learning-based approaches offer fast inference but
still struggle with heavy noise in real low-light scenes, primarily due to
limitations in effectively leveraging temporal information. In this paper, we
address this issue with DWTA-Net, a novel two-stage framework that jointly
exploits short- and long-term temporal cues. Stage I employs Visual State-Space
blocks for multi-frame alignment, recovering brightness, color, and structure
with local consistency. Stage II introduces a recurrent refinement module with
dynamic weight-based temporal aggregation guided by optical flow, adaptively
balancing static and dynamic regions. A texture-adaptive loss further preserves
fine details while promoting smoothness in flat areas. Experiments on
real-world low-light videos show that DWTA-Net effectively suppresses noise and
artifacts, delivering superior visual quality compared with state-of-the-art
methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets are inadequate for developing perception systems for forest management as they focus on urban settings or limited species, while robotics in forestry requires advanced perceptual capabilities for precision forestry and biodiversity monitoring.

Method: Collected SilvaScenes dataset across five bioclimatic domains in Quebec with 1476 trees from 24 species, annotated by forestry experts, and benchmarked modern deep learning approaches for instance segmentation.

Result: Tree segmentation achieved 67.65% mAP, while species classification remained challenging with only 35.69% mAP, demonstrating the dataset's relevance and difficulty.

Conclusion: SilvaScenes addresses the critical gap in forest perception datasets and shows that while tree segmentation is feasible, fine-grained species classification remains a significant challenge for automated forestry systems.

Abstract: Interest in robotics for forest management is growing, but perception in
complex, natural environments remains a significant hurdle. Conditions such as
heavy occlusion, variable lighting, and dense vegetation pose challenges to
automated systems, which are essential for precision forestry, biodiversity
monitoring, and the automation of forestry equipment. These tasks rely on
advanced perceptual capabilities, such as detection and fine-grained species
classification of individual trees. Yet, existing datasets are inadequate to
develop such perception systems, as they often focus on urban settings or a
limited number of species. To address this, we present SilvaScenes, a new
dataset for instance segmentation of tree species from under-canopy images.
Collected across five bioclimatic domains in Quebec, Canada, SilvaScenes
features 1476 trees from 24 species with annotations from forestry experts. We
demonstrate the relevance and challenging nature of our dataset by benchmarking
modern deep learning approaches for instance segmentation. Our results show
that, while tree segmentation is easy, with a top mean average precision (mAP)
of 67.65%, species classification remains a significant challenge with an mAP

TL;DR: The paper proposes dimensional entropy maximization to address modality gap issues in contrastive Vision-Language Models during test-time prompt tuning, improving calibration performance and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models face modality gaps caused by dominant feature dimensions across modalities, which degrade calibration performance during test-time adaptation to unlabeled target data.

Method: The authors propose dimensional entropy maximization that regularizes the distribution of textual features toward uniformity to mitigate the dependency of dominant dimensions in contrastive VLMs.

Result: The method alleviates calibration performance degradation in test-time prompt tuning, enhancing the reliability of VLMs in real-world deployment scenarios.

Conclusion: Dimensional entropy maximization offers a simple yet effective solution to improve VLM reliability by addressing modality gap issues through regularization of dominant feature dimensions.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation paradigm provides flexibility towards domain shifts by
performing immediate adaptation on unlabeled target data from the source model.
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) leverage their generalization capabilities for
diverse downstream tasks, and test-time prompt tuning has emerged as a
prominent solution for adapting VLMs. In this work, we explore contrastive VLMs
and identify the modality gap caused by a single dominant feature dimension
across modalities. We observe that the dominant dimensions in both text and
image modalities exhibit high predictive sensitivity, and that constraining
their influence can improve calibration error. Building on this insight, we
propose dimensional entropy maximization that regularizes the distribution of
textual features toward uniformity to mitigate the dependency of dominant
dimensions. Our method alleviates the degradation of calibration performance in
test-time prompt tuning, offering a simple yet effective solution to enhance
the reliability of VLMs in real-world deployment scenarios.

TL;DR: Proposes a method for generating unlimited novel characters that preserve artistic style from few reference characters, adapting DreamBooth with multi-token strategy and LoRA fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable creation of virtually unlimited novel characters while preserving artistic style from small sets of human-designed references, expanding creative possibilities in animation and gaming.

Method: Adapts DreamBooth fine-tuning with multi-token strategy using clustering for individual characters and collective style, combined with LoRA-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Removes class-specific regularization and introduces random tokens during generation.

Result: Produces high-quality, diverse characters while preserving distinctive aesthetic features of reference characters, validated through quantitative metrics and human evaluation on five specialized datasets.

Conclusion: The approach effectively enables unlimited character creation while maintaining learned artistic style, demonstrating potential for creative applications in animation and gaming domains.

Abstract: The audiovisual industry is undergoing a profound transformation as it is
integrating AI developments not only to automate routine tasks but also to
inspire new forms of art. This paper addresses the problem of producing a
virtually unlimited number of novel characters that preserve the artistic style
and shared visual traits of a small set of human-designed reference characters,
thus broadening creative possibilities in animation, gaming, and related
domains. Our solution builds upon DreamBooth, a well-established fine-tuning
technique for text-to-image diffusion models, and adapts it to tackle two core
challenges: capturing intricate character details beyond textual prompts and
the few-shot nature of the training data. To achieve this, we propose a
multi-token strategy, using clustering to assign separate tokens to individual
characters and their collective style, combined with LoRA-based
parameter-efficient fine-tuning. By removing the class-specific regularization
set and introducing random tokens and embeddings during generation, our
approach allows for unlimited character creation while preserving the learned
style. We evaluate our method on five small specialized datasets, comparing it
to relevant baselines using both quantitative metrics and a human evaluation
study. Our results demonstrate that our approach produces high-quality, diverse
characters while preserving the distinctive aesthetic features of the reference
characters, with human evaluation further reinforcing its effectiveness and
highlighting the potential of our method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a standardized evaluation framework for interactive medical image segmentation to address inconsistent evaluation practices, and analyzes key factors affecting algorithm performance across diverse clinical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods for interactive medical image segmentation are inconsistent and clinically unrealistic, which hinders fair algorithm comparison and misrepresents real-world performance.

Method: Developed a clinically grounded methodology for defining evaluation tasks and metrics, and built a software framework for constructing standardized evaluation pipelines to assess state-of-the-art algorithms.

Result: Key findings include: minimizing information loss in user interactions is critical for robustness; adaptive-zooming boosts robustness and convergence; performance drops when validation differs from training; 2D methods work well with slab-like images but 3D context helps with large/irregular targets; non-medical models degrade with poor contrast and complex shapes.

Conclusion: Standardized evaluation is essential for fair comparison of interactive segmentation algorithms, and algorithm design should focus on preserving interaction information, adaptive mechanisms, and domain-specific considerations for medical imaging.

Abstract: Interactive segmentation is a promising strategy for building robust,
generalisable algorithms for volumetric medical image segmentation. However,
inconsistent and clinically unrealistic evaluation hinders fair comparison and
misrepresents real-world performance. We propose a clinically grounded
methodology for defining evaluation tasks and metrics, and built a software
framework for constructing standardised evaluation pipelines. We evaluate
state-of-the-art algorithms across heterogeneous and complex tasks and observe
that (i) minimising information loss when processing user interactions is
critical for model robustness, (ii) adaptive-zooming mechanisms boost
robustness and speed convergence, (iii) performance drops if validation
prompting behaviour/budgets differ from training, (iv) 2D methods perform well
with slab-like images and coarse targets, but 3D context helps with large or
irregularly shaped targets, (v) performance of non-medical-domain models (e.g.
SAM2) degrades with poor contrast and complex shapes.

TL;DR: PhysToolBench is the first benchmark to evaluate multimodal large language models' understanding of physical tools through a VQA dataset with 1,000+ image-text pairs across three difficulty levels: recognition, understanding, and creation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify MLLMs' true understanding of physical tools, as tool use is fundamental to human intelligence and essential for versatile intelligent agents, but current MLLMs' tool comprehension remains unmeasured.

Method: Created a Visual Question Answering benchmark with three progressive difficulty levels: Tool Recognition (identifying function), Tool Understanding (grasping operational principles), and Tool Creation (making new tools from available objects).

Result: Evaluation of 32 MLLMs (proprietary, open-source, embodied, and VLA backbones) revealed significant deficiencies in tool understanding across all model types.

Conclusion: Current MLLMs lack comprehensive tool understanding capabilities, highlighting a critical gap that needs addressing for developing truly versatile intelligent agents.

Abstract: The ability to use, understand, and create tools is a hallmark of human
intelligence, enabling sophisticated interaction with the physical world. For
any general-purpose intelligent agent to achieve true versatility, it must also
master these fundamental skills. While modern Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) leverage their extensive common knowledge for high-level planning in
embodied AI and in downstream Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, the extent
of their true understanding of physical tools remains unquantified. To bridge
this gap, we present PhysToolBench, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating
the comprehension of physical tools by MLLMs. Our benchmark is structured as a
Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset comprising over 1,000 image-text pairs.
It assesses capabilities across three distinct difficulty levels: (1) Tool
Recognition: Requiring the recognition of a tool's primary function. (2) Tool
Understanding: Testing the ability to grasp the underlying principles of a
tool's operation. (3) Tool Creation: Challenging the model to fashion a new
tool from surrounding objects when conventional options are unavailable. Our
comprehensive evaluation of 32 MLLMs-spanning proprietary, open-source,
specialized embodied, and backbones in VLAs-reveals a significant deficiency in
tool understanding. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis and propose
preliminary solutions. Code and dataset are publicly available.

*David V√°zquez-Pad√≠n,Fernando P√©rez-Gonz√°lez,Alejandro Mart√≠n-Del-R√≠o*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Samsung smartphone images show diagonal artifacts affecting PRNU-based camera verification. Galaxy S and A models share patterns causing fingerprint collisions. Raw images bypass artifacts, enabling reliable verification on PRO mode devices, but mid-range models lack this option. Artifacts can help reduce HDR misdetections and localize synthetic bokeh regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate diagonal artifacts in Samsung smartphone images and their impact on PRNU-based camera source verification, addressing fingerprint collision issues and forensic limitations.

Method: Analysis of diagonal artifacts in Samsung Galaxy S and A series images, comparison of raw vs processed images, and exploration of artifact applications in forensic scenarios.

Result: Certain Samsung models share common patterns causing fingerprint collisions. Raw images from PRO mode devices bypass artifacts for reliable verification, but mid-range models lack raw capture. Artifacts can reduce HDR misdetections and identify synthetic bokeh regions.

Conclusion: Diagonal artifacts in Samsung smartphones affect PRNU verification but raw images provide a solution where available. The artifacts have forensic applications for improving detection accuracy and localization in processed images.

Abstract: We investigate diagonal artifacts present in images captured by several
Samsung smartphones and their impact on PRNU-based camera source verification.
We first show that certain Galaxy S series models share a common pattern
causing fingerprint collisions, with a similar issue also found in some Galaxy
A models. Next, we demonstrate that reliable PRNU verification remains feasible
for devices supporting PRO mode with raw capture, since raw images bypass the
processing pipeline that introduces artifacts. This option, however, is not
available for the mid-range A series models or in forensic cases without access
to raw images. Finally, we outline potential forensic applications of the
diagonal artifacts, such as reducing misdetections in HDR images and localizing
regions affected by synthetic bokeh in portrait-mode images.

### [84] [PRNet: Original Information Is All You Have](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09531)
*PeiHuang Zheng,Yunlong Zhao,Zheng Cui,Yang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRNet is a real-time detection framework that preserves primitive shallow spatial features to improve small object detection in aerial images, addressing information degradation issues through Progressive Refinement Neck and Enhanced SliceSamp modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small object detection in aerial images suffers from severe information degradation during feature extraction, where shallow spatial details fail to align effectively with semantic information, leading to frequent misses and false positives. Existing FPN-based methods have limitations as reconstructed details often deviate from original image information.

Method: PRNet uses two key modules: Progressive Refinement Neck (PRN) for spatial-semantic alignment through backbone reuse and iterative refinement, and Enhanced SliceSamp (ESSamp) for preserving shallow information during downsampling via optimized rearrangement and convolution.

Result: Extensive experiments on VisDrone, AI-TOD, and UAVDT datasets demonstrate that PRNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods under comparable computational constraints, achieving superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.

Conclusion: PRNet effectively addresses small object detection challenges in aerial images by prioritizing preservation and efficient utilization of primitive shallow spatial features, offering a practical solution with real-time performance.

Abstract: Small object detection in aerial images suffers from severe information
degradation during feature extraction due to limited pixel representations,
where shallow spatial details fail to align effectively with semantic
information, leading to frequent misses and false positives. Existing FPN-based
methods attempt to mitigate these losses through post-processing enhancements,
but the reconstructed details often deviate from the original image
information, impeding their fusion with semantic content. To address this
limitation, we propose PRNet, a real-time detection framework that prioritizes
the preservation and efficient utilization of primitive shallow spatial
features to enhance small object representations. PRNet achieves this via two
modules:the Progressive Refinement Neck (PRN) for spatial-semantic alignment
through backbone reuse and iterative refinement, and the Enhanced SliceSamp
(ESSamp) for preserving shallow information during downsampling via optimized
rearrangement and convolution. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone, AI-TOD,
and UAVDT datasets demonstrate that PRNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods
under comparable computational constraints, achieving superior
accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FLOWING is a novel framework that treats warping as differential vector flow construction, ensuring continuity, invertibility, and temporal coherence for high-quality morphing of 2D images and 3D shapes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard MLPs for implicit neural representations in morphing require costly regularizations that lead to unstable training and poor feature alignment. There's a need for more principled approaches that naturally ensure structural properties.

Method: Recasts warping as construction of differential vector flow, encoding structural flow properties directly into network architectures to ensure continuity, invertibility, and temporal coherence.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art morphing quality with faster convergence across various applications including face/image morphing and Gaussian Splatting morphing.

Conclusion: FLOWING provides a principled and stable framework for structure-preserving morphing that outperforms existing methods while being more efficient and reliable.

Abstract: Morphing is a long-standing problem in vision and computer graphics,
requiring a time-dependent warping for feature alignment and a blending for
smooth interpolation. Recently, multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) have been
explored as implicit neural representations (INRs) for modeling such
deformations, due to their meshlessness and differentiability; however,
extracting coherent and accurate morphings from standard MLPs typically relies
on costly regularizations, which often lead to unstable training and prevent
effective feature alignment. To overcome these limitations, we propose FLOWING
(FLOW morphING), a framework that recasts warping as the construction of a
differential vector flow, naturally ensuring continuity, invertibility, and
temporal coherence by encoding structural flow properties directly into the
network architectures. This flow-centric approach yields principled and stable
transformations, enabling accurate and structure-preserving morphing of both 2D
images and 3D shapes. Extensive experiments across a range of applications -
including face and image morphing, as well as Gaussian Splatting morphing -
show that FLOWING achieves state-of-the-art morphing quality with faster
convergence. Code and pretrained models are available at

*Minkyoung Cho,Ruben Ohana,Christian Jacobsen,Adityan Jothi,Min-Hung Chen,Z. Morley Mao,Ethem Can*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TC-LoRA introduces dynamic, context-aware control for diffusion models by conditioning model weights directly through time-dependent LoRA adapters generated by a hypernetwork, improving over static activation-based conditioning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current controllable diffusion models use static conditioning strategies that modify intermediate activations, limiting the model's ability to adapt its response as generation evolves from coarse structure to fine detail in the multi-stage denoising process.

Method: Uses a hypernetwork to generate LoRA adapters on-the-fly that tailor weight modifications for the frozen backbone at each diffusion step based on time and user conditions, enabling explicit adaptive strategy for conditional guidance.

Result: Through experiments on various data domains, TC-LoRA significantly enhances generative fidelity and adherence to spatial conditions compared to static, activation-based methods.

Conclusion: TC-LoRA establishes an alternative approach where conditioning strategy is modified through deeper functional adaptation of weights, allowing control to align with dynamic demands of the task and generative stage.

Abstract: Current controllable diffusion models typically rely on fixed architectures
that modify intermediate activations to inject guidance conditioned on a new
modality. This approach uses a static conditioning strategy for a dynamic,
multi-stage denoising process, limiting the model's ability to adapt its
response as the generation evolves from coarse structure to fine detail. We
introduce TC-LoRA (Temporally Modulated Conditional LoRA), a new paradigm that
enables dynamic, context-aware control by conditioning the model's weights
directly. Our framework uses a hypernetwork to generate LoRA adapters
on-the-fly, tailoring weight modifications for the frozen backbone at each
diffusion step based on time and the user's condition. This mechanism enables
the model to learn and execute an explicit, adaptive strategy for applying
conditional guidance throughout the entire generation process. Through
experiments on various data domains, we demonstrate that this dynamic,
parametric control significantly enhances generative fidelity and adherence to
spatial conditions compared to static, activation-based methods. TC-LoRA
establishes an alternative approach in which the model's conditioning strategy
is modified through a deeper functional adaptation of its weights, allowing
control to align with the dynamic demands of the task and generative stage.

*Shubham Trehan,Udhav Ramachandran,Akash Rao,Ruth Scimeca,Sathyanarayanan N. Aakur*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FSP-DETR is a unified detection framework for biomedical settings that enables few-shot detection, open-set recognition, and generalization to unseen tasks within a single model, outperforming prior methods especially in low-shot and open-set scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object detection in biomedical settings faces challenges due to scarce labeled data and frequent emergence of novel or rare categories, requiring robust solutions that can handle few-shot learning, open-set recognition, and cross-task adaptation.

Method: Built on class-agnostic DETR backbone, constructs class prototypes from support images, learns embedding space using augmented views and lightweight transformer decoder, and jointly optimizes prototype matching loss, alignment-based separation loss, and KL divergence regularization.

Result: Significantly outperforms prior few-shot and prototype-based detectors across ova, blood cell, and malaria detection tasks, particularly in low-shot and open-set scenarios, and introduces new ova species detection benchmark with 20 parasite classes.

Conclusion: FSP-DETR provides a unified framework that enables inference-time flexibility for unseen class recognition, background rejection, and cross-task adaptation without retraining, addressing fundamental constraints in biomedical object detection.

Abstract: Object detection in biomedical settings is fundamentally constrained by the
scarcity of labeled data and the frequent emergence of novel or rare
categories. We present FSP-DETR, a unified detection framework that enables
robust few-shot detection, open-set recognition, and generalization to unseen
biomedical tasks within a single model. Built upon a class-agnostic DETR
backbone, our approach constructs class prototypes from original support images
and learns an embedding space using augmented views and a lightweight
transformer decoder. Training jointly optimizes a prototype matching loss, an
alignment-based separation loss, and a KL divergence regularization to improve
discriminative feature learning and calibration under scarce supervision.
Unlike prior work that tackles these tasks in isolation, FSP-DETR enables
inference-time flexibility to support unseen class recognition, background
rejection, and cross-task adaptation without retraining. We also introduce a
new ova species detection benchmark with 20 parasite classes and establish
standardized evaluation protocols. Extensive experiments across ova, blood
cell, and malaria detection tasks demonstrate that FSP-DETR significantly
outperforms prior few-shot and prototype-based detectors, especially in
low-shot and open-set scenarios.

### [88] [Vision Language Models: A Survey of 26K Papers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09586)
*Fengming Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Large-scale analysis of 26,104 AI papers from CVPR, ICLR, and NeurIPS (2023-2025) reveals three major trends: multimodal vision-language-LLM surge, generative methods expansion, and resilient 3D/video research with human-centric focus.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide transparent, reproducible measurement of research trends in computer vision and machine learning by systematically analyzing thousands of accepted papers across major conferences.

Method: Normalized titles and abstracts, applied phrase-protection, matched against hand-crafted lexicon with 35 topical labels to analyze tasks, architectures, training regimes, objectives, datasets, and modalities.

Result: Identified three macro shifts: multimodal vision-language-LLM work rising sharply, generative methods expanding steadily, and resilient 3D/video activity with human-centric focus. Found parameter-efficient adaptation dominating VLMs, training shifting to instruction tuning, and contrastive objectives receding.

Conclusion: The analysis provides consistent longitudinal signals across venues and years, with released lexicon enabling auditing and extension, though limited by lexicon recall and abstract-only scope.

Abstract: We present a transparent, reproducible measurement of research trends across
26,104 accepted papers from CVPR, ICLR, and NeurIPS spanning 2023-2025. Titles
and abstracts are normalized, phrase-protected, and matched against a
hand-crafted lexicon to assign up to 35 topical labels and mine fine-grained
cues about tasks, architectures, training regimes, objectives, datasets, and
co-mentioned modalities. The analysis quantifies three macro shifts: (1) a
sharp rise of multimodal vision-language-LLM work, which increasingly reframes
classic perception as instruction following and multi-step reasoning; (2)
steady expansion of generative methods, with diffusion research consolidating
around controllability, distillation, and speed; and (3) resilient 3D and video
activity, with composition moving from NeRFs to Gaussian splatting and a
growing emphasis on human- and agent-centric understanding. Within VLMs,
parameter-efficient adaptation like prompting/adapters/LoRA and lightweight
vision-language bridges dominate; training practice shifts from building
encoders from scratch to instruction tuning and finetuning strong backbones;
contrastive objectives recede relative to cross-entropy/ranking and
distillation. Cross-venue comparisons show CVPR has a stronger 3D footprint and
ICLR the highest VLM share, while reliability themes such as efficiency or
robustness diffuse across areas. We release the lexicon and methodology to
enable auditing and extension. Limitations include lexicon recall and
abstract-only scope, but the longitudinal signals are consistent across venues
and years.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SpaceVista-1M dataset with 1M spatial QA pairs across 5 scales and 19 tasks, and SpaceVista-7B model for all-scale spatial reasoning using scale-aware experts and progressive training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in current spatial reasoning: heavy reliance on indoor 3D scans and manual annotations, and lack of effective all-scale scene modeling that leads to overfitting.

Method: Created SpaceVista-1M dataset using automated pipeline with 38K video scenes across 5 scales. Built SpaceVista-7B model with scale-aware experts, progressive rewards, and dense input processing beyond semantics.

Result: Achieved competitive performance across 5 benchmarks including their SpaceVista-Bench, demonstrating strong generalization across all scales and scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed holistic solution successfully advances all-scale spatial reasoning with broad generalization capabilities, and the dataset, model, and benchmark will be publicly released.

Abstract: With the current surge in spatial reasoning explorations, researchers have
made significant progress in understanding indoor scenes, but still struggle
with diverse applications such as robotics and autonomous driving. This paper
aims to advance all-scale spatial reasoning across diverse scenarios by
tackling two key challenges: 1) the heavy reliance on indoor 3D scans and
labor-intensive manual annotations for dataset curation; 2) the absence of
effective all-scale scene modeling, which often leads to overfitting to
individual scenes. In this paper, we introduce a holistic solution that
integrates a structured spatial reasoning knowledge system, scale-aware
modeling, and a progressive training paradigm, as the first attempt to broaden
the all-scale spatial intelligence of MLLMs to the best of our knowledge. Using
a task-specific, specialist-driven automated pipeline, we curate over 38K video
scenes across 5 spatial scales to create SpaceVista-1M, a dataset comprising
approximately 1M spatial QA pairs spanning 19 diverse task types. While
specialist models can inject useful domain knowledge, they are not reliable for
evaluation. We then build an all-scale benchmark with precise annotations by
manually recording, retrieving, and assembling video-based data. However, naive
training with SpaceVista-1M often yields suboptimal results due to the
potential knowledge conflict. Accordingly, we introduce SpaceVista-7B, a
spatial reasoning model that accepts dense inputs beyond semantics and uses
scale as an anchor for scale-aware experts and progressive rewards. Finally,
extensive evaluations across 5 benchmarks, including our SpaceVista-Bench,
demonstrate competitive performance, showcasing strong generalization across
all scales and scenarios. Our dataset, model, and benchmark will be released on
https://peiwensun2000.github.io/mm2km .

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A distillation-based framework that equips vision-language models with action-execution capability by transferring knowledge from small pretrained action models, avoiding expensive full training while achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training Vision-Language Action (VLA) models from scratch is costly, and existing methods need efficient ways to leverage pretrained vision-language models for robotic manipulation tasks.

Method: Two-stage training: 1) Lightweight alignment maps VLM hidden states to action space of small action model, 2) Selective fine-tuning of language model, state encoder, and action modules. Architecture adds only action token and state encoder to original VLM.

Result: Achieves 97.3% average success rate on LIBERO (11.8% improvement) and 93.5% on LIBERO-LONG (24.5% improvement). Real-world experiments show 82.0% success rate (17% improvement over teacher model).

Conclusion: Action distillation effectively enables VLMs to generate precise actions while substantially reducing training costs, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Vision-Language Action (VLA) models significantly advance robotic
manipulation by leveraging the strong perception capabilities of pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs). By integrating action modules into these
pretrained models, VLA methods exhibit improved generalization. However,
training them from scratch is costly. In this work, we propose a simple yet
effective distillation-based framework that equips VLMs with action-execution
capability by transferring knowledge from pretrained small action models. Our
architecture retains the original VLM structure, adding only an action token
and a state encoder to incorporate physical inputs. To distill action
knowledge, we adopt a two-stage training strategy. First, we perform
lightweight alignment by mapping VLM hidden states into the action space of the
small action model, enabling effective reuse of its pretrained action decoder
and avoiding expensive pretraining. Second, we selectively fine-tune the
language model, state encoder, and action modules, enabling the system to
integrate multimodal inputs with precise action generation. Specifically, the
action token provides the VLM with a direct handle for predicting future
actions, while the state encoder allows the model to incorporate robot dynamics
not captured by vision alone. This design yields substantial efficiency gains
over training large VLA models from scratch. Compared with previous
state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves 97.3% average success rate on
LIBERO (11.8% improvement) and 93.5% on LIBERO-LONG (24.5% improvement). In
real-world experiments across five manipulation tasks, our method consistently
outperforms the teacher model, achieving 82.0% success rate (17% improvement),
which demonstrate that action distillation effectively enables VLMs to generate
precise actions while substantially reducing training costs.

*Ruyi Xu,Guangxuan Xiao,Yukang Chen,Liuning He,Kelly Peng,Yao Lu,Song Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StreamingVLM enables real-time understanding of infinite video streams by maintaining compact KV cache with attention sinks and recent tokens, achieving stable performance at 8 FPS on H100 GPU.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models struggle with infinite video streams due to quadratic computational costs and poor long-video performance, while sliding window methods break coherence or have high latency.

Method: Unified framework aligning training with streaming inference, using compact KV cache with attention sinks, recent vision tokens, and recent text tokens. Fine-tuned via supervised SFT on short overlapped video chunks to mimic inference attention patterns.

Result: Achieves 66.18% win rate against GPT-4O mini on Inf-Streams-Eval benchmark (2+ hour videos), maintains stable real-time performance at 8 FPS on H100. Also improves VQA performance on LongVideoBench (+4.30) and OVOBench Realtime (+5.96) without VQA-specific fine-tuning.

Conclusion: StreamingVLM successfully enables real-time understanding of infinite video streams with stable performance, and the SFT strategy enhances general VQA capabilities as a beneficial side effect.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) could power real-time assistants and autonomous
agents, but they face a critical challenge: understanding near-infinite video
streams without escalating latency and memory usage. Processing entire videos
with full attention leads to quadratic computational costs and poor performance
on long videos. Meanwhile, simple sliding window methods are also flawed, as
they either break coherence or suffer from high latency due to redundant
recomputation. In this paper, we introduce StreamingVLM, a model designed for
real-time, stable understanding of infinite visual input. Our approach is a
unified framework that aligns training with streaming inference. During
inference, we maintain a compact KV cache by reusing states of attention sinks,
a short window of recent vision tokens, and a long window of recent text
tokens. This streaming ability is instilled via a simple supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) strategy that applies full attention on short, overlapped video chunks,
which effectively mimics the inference-time attention pattern without training
on prohibitively long contexts. For evaluation, we build Inf-Streams-Eval, a
new benchmark with videos averaging over two hours that requires dense,
per-second alignment between frames and text. On Inf-Streams-Eval, StreamingVLM
achieves a 66.18% win rate against GPT-4O mini and maintains stable, real-time
performance at up to 8 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100. Notably, our SFT strategy
also enhances general VQA abilities without any VQA-specific fine-tuning,
improving performance on LongVideoBench by +4.30 and OVOBench Realtime by
+5.96. Code is available at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/streaming-vlm.
