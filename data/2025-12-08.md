### [1] [AREA3D: Active Reconstruction Agent with Unified Feed-Forward 3D Perception and Vision-Language Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05131)
*Tianling Xu,Shengzhe Gan,Leslie Gu,Yuelei Li,Fangneng Zhan,Hanspeter Pfister*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AREA3D is an active 3D reconstruction agent that uses feed-forward 3D reconstruction models with vision-language guidance to autonomously select informative viewpoints, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy especially in sparse-view scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing active 3D reconstruction methods rely on hand-crafted geometric heuristics, which often lead to redundant observations without significantly improving reconstruction quality. There's a need for more intelligent viewpoint selection that goes beyond purely geometric cues.

Method: AREA3D decouples view-uncertainty modeling from the underlying feed-forward reconstructor, enabling precise uncertainty estimation without expensive online optimization. It integrates vision-language models to provide high-level semantic guidance for selecting informative and diverse viewpoints beyond geometric cues.

Result: Extensive experiments on both scene-level and object-level benchmarks demonstrate that AREA3D achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy, particularly in the sparse-view regime where limited observations are available.

Conclusion: AREA3D successfully addresses limitations of traditional active reconstruction methods by combining feed-forward 3D reconstruction with vision-language guidance, enabling more efficient and accurate autonomous viewpoint selection for 3D reconstruction tasks.

Abstract: Active 3D reconstruction enables an agent to autonomously select viewpoints to efficiently obtain accurate and complete scene geometry, rather than passively reconstructing scenes from pre-collected images. However, existing active reconstruction methods often rely on hand-crafted geometric heuristics, which can lead to redundant observations without substantially improving reconstruction quality. To address this limitation, we propose AREA3D, an active reconstruction agent that leverages feed-forward 3D reconstruction models and vision-language guidance. Our framework decouples view-uncertainty modeling from the underlying feed-forward reconstructor, enabling precise uncertainty estimation without expensive online optimization. In addition, an integrated vision-language model provides high-level semantic guidance, encouraging informative and diverse viewpoints beyond purely geometric cues. Extensive experiments on both scene-level and object-level benchmarks demonstrate that AREA3D achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy, particularly in the sparse-view regime.

### [2] [Breaking Scale Anchoring: Frequency Representation Learning for Accurate High-Resolution Inference from Low-Resolution Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05132)
*Wenshuo Wang,Fan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies "Scale Anchoring" as a fundamental problem in zero-shot super-resolution spatiotemporal forecasting, where models trained on low-resolution data fail to reduce error at higher resolutions due to unseen frequency components. It proposes Frequency Representation Learning to address this issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches incorrectly interpret maintaining similar error across resolutions as successful generalization, but models should actually reduce error as resolution increases. The fundamental limitation is that low-resolution data has constrained Nyquist frequencies, preventing models from processing unseen high-frequency components during high-resolution inference.

Method: Proposes architecture-agnostic Frequency Representation Learning (FRL) with resolution-aligned frequency representations and spectral consistency training. FRL ensures more stable frequency response in high-frequency bands on grids with higher Nyquist frequencies.

Result: FRL-enhanced variants allow errors to decrease with resolution and significantly outperform baselines within the task and resolution range, while incurring only modest computational overhead.

Conclusion: The paper identifies Scale Anchoring as a distinct problem from existing issues and demonstrates that Frequency Representation Learning effectively addresses it by enabling proper error reduction with increasing resolution.

Abstract: Zero-Shot Super-Resolution Spatiotemporal Forecasting requires a deep learning model to be trained on low-resolution data and deployed for inference on high-resolution. Existing studies consider maintaining similar error across different resolutions as indicative of successful multi-resolution generalization. However, deep learning models serving as alternatives to numerical solvers should reduce error as resolution increases. The fundamental limitation is, the upper bound of physical law frequencies that low-resolution data can represent is constrained by its Nyquist frequency, making it difficult for models to process signals containing unseen frequency components during high-resolution inference. This results in errors being anchored at low resolution, incorrectly interpreted as successful generalization. We define this fundamental phenomenon as a new problem distinct from existing issues: Scale Anchoring. Therefore, we propose architecture-agnostic Frequency Representation Learning. It alleviates Scale Anchoring through resolution-aligned frequency representations and spectral consistency training: on grids with higher Nyquist frequencies, the frequency response in high-frequency bands of FRL-enhanced variants is more stable. This allows errors to decrease with resolution and significantly outperform baselines within our task and resolution range, while incurring only modest computational overhead.

### [3] [InvarDiff: Cross-Scale Invariance Caching for Accelerated Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05134)
*Zihao Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InvarDiff is a training-free acceleration method for diffusion models that exploits feature invariance across timesteps and layers to cache and reuse computations, achieving 2-3× speedups with minimal quality degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models produce high-quality synthesis but suffer from slow inference due to iterative sampling. The authors observed feature invariance in deterministic sampling that can be exploited to accelerate inference without retraining.

Method: InvarDiff computes a binary cache plan matrix from a few deterministic runs using quantile-based change metrics. This matrix identifies which modules at which timesteps can be reused. The method applies step-first and layer-wise caching during inference with re-sampling correction to prevent drift when consecutive caches occur.

Result: Experiments show InvarDiff achieves 2-3× end-to-end speedups on DiT and FLUX models with minimal impact on standard quality metrics. Visual quality is almost indistinguishable from full computations.

Conclusion: InvarDiff effectively exploits temporal and layer-wise feature invariance in diffusion models to significantly accelerate inference while maintaining synthesis quality, offering a practical training-free acceleration solution.

Abstract: Diffusion models deliver high-fidelity synthesis but remain slow due to iterative sampling. We empirically observe there exists feature invariance in deterministic sampling, and present InvarDiff, a training-free acceleration method that exploits the relative temporal invariance across timestep-scale and layer-scale. From a few deterministic runs, we compute a per-timestep, per-layer, per-module binary cache plan matrix and use a re-sampling correction to avoid drift when consecutive caches occur. Using quantile-based change metrics, this matrix specifies which module at which step is reused rather than recomputed. The same invariance criterion is applied at the step scale to enable cross-timestep caching, deciding whether an entire step can reuse cached results. During inference, InvarDiff performs step-first and layer-wise caching guided by this matrix. When applied to DiT and FLUX, our approach reduces redundant compute while preserving fidelity. Experiments show that InvarDiff achieves $2$-$3\times$ end-to-end speed-ups with minimal impact on standard quality metrics. Qualitatively, we observe almost no degradation in visual quality compared with full computations.

### [4] [Fine-tuning an ECG Foundation Model to Predict Coronary CT Angiography Outcomes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05136)
*Yujie Xiao,Gongzhen Tang,Deyun Zhang,Jun Li,Guangkun Nie,Haoyu Wang,Shun Huang,Tong Liu,Qinghao Zhao,Kangyin Chen,Shenda Hong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AI-ECG model predicts severe coronary artery stenosis with good accuracy, offering a radiation-free alternative to CT angiography for CAD screening.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Coronary CT angiography (CCTA) has limitations for large-scale CAD screening due to equipment requirements, radiation exposure, and patient cooperation needs. AI-ECG offers a promising alternative given ECG's widespread availability.

Method: Developed an interpretable AI-ECG model to predict severe or complete stenosis in four major coronary arteries (RCA, LM, LAD, LCX) using CCTA as reference standard. Validated internally and externally with subgroup analyses across demographics and acquisition times.

Result: Model achieved AUCs of 0.794-0.818 on internal validation and 0.667-0.971 on external validation for different arteries. Performance remained stable in normal-ECG subset. Interpretability analyses revealed distinct waveform differences between high- and low-risk groups.

Conclusion: AI-ECG shows promise as a radiation-free, accessible screening tool for coronary artery stenosis, with interpretable features providing insights into ECG correlates of coronary disease.

Abstract: Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains a major global health burden. Accurate identification of the culprit vessel and assessment of stenosis severity are essential for guiding individualized therapy. Although coronary CT angiography (CCTA) is the first-line non-invasive modality for CAD diagnosis, its dependence on high-end equipment, radiation exposure, and strict patient cooperation limits large-scale use. With advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and the widespread availability of electrocardiography (ECG), AI-ECG offers a promising alternative for CAD screening. In this study, we developed an interpretable AI-ECG model to predict severe or complete stenosis of the four major coronary arteries on CCTA. On the internal validation set, the model's AUCs for the right coronary artery (RCA), left main coronary artery (LM), left anterior descending artery (LAD), and left circumflex artery (LCX) were 0.794, 0.818, 0.744, and 0.755, respectively; on the external validation set, the AUCs reached 0.749, 0.971, 0.667, and 0.727, respectively. Performance remained stable in a clinically normal-ECG subset, indicating robustness beyond overt ECG abnormalities. Subgroup analyses across demographic and acquisition-time strata further confirmed model stability. Risk stratification based on vessel-specific incidence thresholds showed consistent separation on calibration and cumulative event curves. Interpretability analyses revealed distinct waveform differences between high- and low-risk groups, highlighting key electrophysiological regions contributing to model decisions and offering new insights into the ECG correlates of coronary stenosis.

*Yunfei Zhang,Yizhuo He,Yuanxun Shao,Zhengtao Yao,Haoyan Xu,Junhao Dong,Zhen Yao,Zhikang Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ChromouVQA is a new benchmark using Ishihara-style chromatic camouflaged images to test VLMs on figure-ground segregation tasks, revealing significant performance gaps compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language Models struggle with figure-ground segregation when targets are embedded in cluttered backgrounds, especially in chromatic camouflage scenarios.

Method: Created ChromouVQA benchmark with Ishihara-style chromatic camouflaged images, varying chromatic separation, density, size, occlusion, and rotation. Includes 9 VQA tasks and proposes a contrastive recipe aligning silhouettes with camouflaged renderings.

Result: Evaluations show large performance gaps between humans and VLMs, particularly under subtle chromatic contrast or disruptive geometric fills. The proposed contrastive method improves global shape recovery.

Conclusion: ChromouVQA provides a controlled benchmark for reproducible evaluation of VLMs on figure-ground segregation tasks, with potential for extension and model improvement.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have advanced multimodal understanding, yet still struggle when targets are embedded in cluttered backgrounds requiring figure-ground segregation. To address this, we introduce ChromouVQA, a large-scale, multi-task benchmark based on Ishihara-style chromatic camouflaged images. We extend classic dot plates with multiple fill geometries and vary chromatic separation, density, size, occlusion, and rotation, recording full metadata for reproducibility. The benchmark covers nine vision-question-answering tasks, including recognition, counting, comparison, and spatial reasoning. Evaluations of humans and VLMs reveal large gaps, especially under subtle chromatic contrast or disruptive geometric fills. We also propose a model-agnostic contrastive recipe aligning silhouettes with their camouflaged renderings, improving recovery of global shapes. ChromouVQA provides a compact, controlled benchmark for reproducible evaluation and extension. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Chromou-VQA-Benchmark/Chromou-VQA.

### [6] [Spatiotemporal Satellite Image Downscaling with Transfer Encoders and Autoregressive Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05139)
*Yang Xiang,Jingwen Zhong,Yige Yan,Petros Koutrakis,Eric Garshick,Meredith Franklin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A transfer-learning generative downscaling framework using U-Net encoder with diffusion model to reconstruct fine-resolution satellite images from coarse inputs, achieving excellent performance while preserving physical consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a robust method for downscaling long time series of coarse resolution satellite images (50 km) to fine resolution (7 km) with limited training periods, enabling improved environmental exposure assessment and long-term monitoring.

Method: Combines lightweight U-Net transfer encoder with diffusion-based generative model. U-Net pretrained on coarse resolution data to learn spatiotemporal representations, then encoder frozen and transferred to larger downscaling model as physically meaningful latent features. Applied to NASA's MERRA-2 (50 km) to GEOS-5 Nature Run (7 km) downscaling in Asian region, split into subregions and seasons.

Result: Achieved excellent performance (R2 = 0.65 to 0.94 across seasonal regional splits), outperforming deterministic U-Nets, variational autoencoders, and prior transfer learning baselines. Predicted images preserved physically consistent spatial variability and temporal autocorrelation, enabling stable autoregressive reconstruction beyond training data.

Conclusion: Transfer-enhanced diffusion models provide robust and physically coherent solution for downscaling long time series of coarse resolution images with limited training, with significant implications for environmental exposure assessment and long-term monitoring.

Abstract: We present a transfer-learning generative downscaling framework to reconstruct fine resolution satellite images from coarse scale inputs. Our approach combines a lightweight U-Net transfer encoder with a diffusion-based generative model. The simpler U-Net is first pretrained on a long time series of coarse resolution data to learn spatiotemporal representations; its encoder is then frozen and transferred to a larger downscaling model as physically meaningful latent features. Our application uses NASA's MERRA-2 reanalysis as the low resolution source domain (50 km) and the GEOS-5 Nature Run (G5NR) as the high resolution target (7 km). Our study area included a large area in Asia, which was made computationally tractable by splitting into two subregions and four seasons. We conducted domain similarity analysis using Wasserstein distances confirmed minimal distributional shift between MERRA-2 and G5NR, validating the safety of parameter frozen transfer. Across seasonal regional splits, our model achieved excellent performance (R2 = 0.65 to 0.94), outperforming comparison models including deterministic U-Nets, variational autoencoders, and prior transfer learning baselines. Out of data evaluations using semivariograms, ACF/PACF, and lag-based RMSE/R2 demonstrated that the predicted downscaled images preserved physically consistent spatial variability and temporal autocorrelation, enabling stable autoregressive reconstruction beyond the G5NR record. These results show that transfer enhanced diffusion models provide a robust and physically coherent solution for downscaling a long time series of coarse resolution images with limited training periods. This advancement has significant implications for improving environmental exposure assessment and long term environmental monitoring.

### [7] [FlowEO: Generative Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Earth Observation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05140)
*Georges Le Bellier,Nicolas Audebert*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlowEO: A flow-matching based unsupervised domain adaptation framework for Earth observation that learns semantically-preserving image translations between heterogeneous remote sensing domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Earth observation data is highly heterogeneous due to different sensors, regions, times, and conditions, causing distribution shifts that limit pretrained model generalization. Unsupervised domain adaptation is crucial for real-world remote sensing applications.

Method: FlowEO uses flow matching to learn a semantically preserving mapping that transports images from source to target distribution. It's a generative model approach for image-space UDA that handles challenging adaptation scenarios like SAR to optical translation and temporal/semantic shifts.

Result: Extensive experiments across four datasets show FlowEO outperforms existing image translation approaches for domain adaptation while achieving on-par or better perceptual image quality.

Conclusion: FlowEO demonstrates the potential of flow-matching-based UDA for remote sensing, effectively handling challenging domain adaptation scenarios in Earth observation applications.

Abstract: The increasing availability of Earth observation data offers unprecedented opportunities for large-scale environmental monitoring and analysis. However, these datasets are inherently heterogeneous, stemming from diverse sensors, geographical regions, acquisition times, and atmospheric conditions. Distribution shifts between training and deployment domains severely limit the generalization of pretrained remote sensing models, making unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) crucial for real-world applications. We introduce FlowEO, a novel framework that leverages generative models for image-space UDA in Earth observation. We leverage flow matching to learn a semantically preserving mapping that transports from the source to the target image distribution. This allows us to tackle challenging domain adaptation configurations for classification and semantic segmentation of Earth observation images. We conduct extensive experiments across four datasets covering adaptation scenarios such as SAR to optical translation and temporal and semantic shifts caused by natural disasters. Experimental results demonstrate that FlowEO outperforms existing image translation approaches for domain adaptation while achieving on-par or better perceptual image quality, highlighting the potential of flow-matching-based UDA for remote sensing.

### [8] [Self-Improving VLM Judges Without Human Annotations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05145)
*Inna Wanyin Lin,Yushi Hu,Shuyue Stella Li,Scott Geng,Pang Wei Koh,Luke Zettlemoyer,Tim Althoff,Marjan Ghazvininejad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Self-training framework for VLM judges without human annotations, using iterative synthetic data generation and reasoning-based filtering to create effective multimodal evaluators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLM judge training requires costly human preference annotations that quickly become obsolete as models improve rapidly. Need for scalable, annotation-free methods that can evolve with model capabilities.

Method: Three-stage iterative framework: (1) generate diverse multimodal instruction-response pairs at varying quality levels, (2) generate reasoning traces and judgments, filtering mismatched quality pairs, (3) train on correct judge answers with reasoning traces.

Result: Improves Llama-3.2-11B multimodal judge from 0.38 to 0.51 overall accuracy on VL-RewardBench, outperforming larger models (Llama-3.2-90B, GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet) with strong gains in general, hallucination, and reasoning dimensions.

Conclusion: Human-annotation-free self-training shows potential for creating VLM judges that can evolve alongside rapidly improving model capabilities, offering scalable evaluation solution.

Abstract: Effective judges of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are crucial for model development. Current methods for training VLM judges mainly rely on large-scale human preference annotations. However, such an approach is costly, and the annotations easily become obsolete as models rapidly improve. In this work, we present a framework to self-train a VLM judge model without any human preference annotations, using only self-synthesized data. Our method is iterative and has three stages: (1) generate diverse multimodal instruction-response pairs at varying quality levels, (2) generate reasoning traces and judgments for each pair, removing the ones that do not match our expected quality levels, and (3) training on correct judge answers and their reasoning traces. We evaluate the resulting judge on Multimodal RewardBench and VL-RewardBench across domains: correctness, preference, reasoning, safety, and visual question-answering. Our method improves a Llama-3.2-11B multimodal judge from 0.38 to 0.51 in overall accuracy on VL-RewardBench, often outperforming much larger models including Llama-3.2-90B, GPT-4o, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, with particularly strong gains in general, hallucination, and reasoning dimensions. The overall strength of these human-annotation-free results suggest the potential for a future self-judge that evolves alongside rapidly improving VLM capabilities.

### [9] [TwinFlow: Realizing One-step Generation on Large Models with Self-adversarial Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05150)
*Zhenglin Cheng,Peng Sun,Jianguo Li,Tao Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TwinFlow: A simple framework for training 1-step generative models that bypasses teacher models and adversarial networks, achieving 100x speedup with minimal quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-modal generative models using diffusion/flow matching require 40-100 NFEs, making them inefficient. Existing few-step methods have limitations: distillation methods need iterative procedures or degrade at <4 NFEs, while adversarial training methods suffer from instability, complexity, and high memory overhead.

Method: TwinFlow is a simple framework that trains 1-step generative models without fixed pretrained teacher models and avoids standard adversarial networks during training. It's designed for building large-scale, efficient models by bypassing traditional distillation and adversarial training complexities.

Result: On text-to-image tasks, TwinFlow achieves GenEval score of 0.83 in 1-NFE, outperforming SANA-Sprint and RCGM baselines. When scaled to Qwen-Image-20B, it matches original 100-NFE model performance on GenEval and DPG-Bench with just 1-NFE, reducing computational cost by 100x with minor quality degradation.

Conclusion: TwinFlow provides an effective solution for efficient 1-step generative modeling that avoids the limitations of existing distillation and adversarial training methods, enabling 100x computational savings while maintaining comparable quality to multi-step models.

Abstract: Recent advances in large multi-modal generative models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in multi-modal generation, including image and video generation. These models are typically built upon multi-step frameworks like diffusion and flow matching, which inherently limits their inference efficiency (requiring 40-100 Number of Function Evaluations (NFEs)). While various few-step methods aim to accelerate the inference, existing solutions have clear limitations. Prominent distillation-based methods, such as progressive and consistency distillation, either require an iterative distillation procedure or show significant degradation at very few steps (< 4-NFE). Meanwhile, integrating adversarial training into distillation (e.g., DMD/DMD2 and SANA-Sprint) to enhance performance introduces training instability, added complexity, and high GPU memory overhead due to the auxiliary trained models. To this end, we propose TwinFlow, a simple yet effective framework for training 1-step generative models that bypasses the need of fixed pretrained teacher models and avoids standard adversarial networks during training, making it ideal for building large-scale, efficient models. On text-to-image tasks, our method achieves a GenEval score of 0.83 in 1-NFE, outperforming strong baselines like SANA-Sprint (a GAN loss-based framework) and RCGM (a consistency-based framework). Notably, we demonstrate the scalability of TwinFlow by full-parameter training on Qwen-Image-20B and transform it into an efficient few-step generator. With just 1-NFE, our approach matches the performance of the original 100-NFE model on both the GenEval and DPG-Bench benchmarks, reducing computational cost by $100\times$ with minor quality degradation.

### [10] [EFDiT: Efficient Fine-grained Image Generation Using Diffusion Transformer Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05152)
*Kun Wang,Donglin Di,Tonghua Su,Lei Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a tiered embedder approach for fine-grained image generation using diffusion models, addressing semantic entanglement and detail insufficiency through super-resolution and a ProAttention mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current class-conditional diffusion models focus on common categories and struggle with semantic information entanglement and insufficient detail in fine-grained image generation, especially for large-scale fine-grained datasets.

Method: 1) Tiered embedder integrating semantic information from both super and child classes; 2) Super-resolution during perceptual information generation stage using enhancement and degradation models; 3) ProAttention mechanism for efficient implementation in diffusion models.

Result: The method outperforms other state-of-the-art fine-tuning methods on public benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance in fine-grained image generation.

Conclusion: The proposed tiered embedder with super-resolution and ProAttention effectively addresses semantic entanglement and detail insufficiency in fine-grained image generation, improving diffusion model performance for specialized categories.

Abstract: Diffusion models are highly regarded for their controllability and the diversity of images they generate. However, class-conditional generation methods based on diffusion models often focus on more common categories. In large-scale fine-grained image generation, issues of semantic information entanglement and insufficient detail in the generated images still persist. This paper attempts to introduce a concept of a tiered embedder in fine-grained image generation, which integrates semantic information from both super and child classes, allowing the diffusion model to better incorporate semantic information and address the issue of semantic entanglement. To address the issue of insufficient detail in fine-grained images, we introduce the concept of super-resolution during the perceptual information generation stage, enhancing the detailed features of fine-grained images through enhancement and degradation models. Furthermore, we propose an efficient ProAttention mechanism that can be effectively implemented in the diffusion model. We evaluate our method through extensive experiments on public benchmarks, demonstrating that our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art fine-tuning methods in terms of performance.

### [11] [Semore: VLM-guided Enhanced Semantic Motion Representations for Visual Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05172)
*Wentao Wang,Chunyang Liu,Kehua Sheng,Bo Zhang,Yan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Semore is a VLM-based framework for visual RL that extracts both semantic and motion representations from RGB flows using a dual-path backbone, guided by VLM knowledge and CLIP alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based RL methods focus mainly on control policy guidance and suffer from limited backbone network representations. There's a need for better semantic understanding and motion representation in visual RL.

Method: Uses a dual-path backbone to extract semantic and motion representations from RGB flows. Leverages VLM with common-sense knowledge to retrieve key information and pre-trained CLIP for text-image alignment. Employs separate supervision to guide extraction of both semantics and motion while allowing spontaneous interaction between them.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method exhibits efficient and adaptive ability compared to state-of-the-art methods under VLM guidance at the feature level.

Conclusion: Semore successfully addresses representation limitations in LLM-based RL by integrating semantic and motion understanding through VLM guidance, demonstrating improved performance in visual reinforcement learning tasks.

Abstract: The growing exploration of Large Language Models (LLM) and Vision-Language Models (VLM) has opened avenues for enhancing the effectiveness of reinforcement learning (RL). However, existing LLM-based RL methods often focus on the guidance of control policy and encounter the challenge of limited representations of the backbone networks. To tackle this problem, we introduce Enhanced Semantic Motion Representations (Semore), a new VLM-based framework for visual RL, which can simultaneously extract semantic and motion representations through a dual-path backbone from the RGB flows. Semore utilizes VLM with common-sense knowledge to retrieve key information from observations, while using the pre-trained clip to achieve the text-image alignment, thereby embedding the ground-truth representations into the backbone. To efficiently fuse semantic and motion representations for decision-making, our method adopts a separately supervised approach to simultaneously guide the extraction of semantics and motion, while allowing them to interact spontaneously. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, under the guidance of VLM at the feature level, our method exhibits efficient and adaptive ability compared to state-of-art methods. All codes are released.

### [12] [Your Latent Mask is Wrong: Pixel-Equivalent Latent Compositing for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05198)
*Rowan Bradbury,Dazhi Zhong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PELC enables pixel-equivalent latent compositing for diffusion models, fixing artifacts from linear interpolation with a lightweight transformer (DecFormer) that matches pixel-space alpha compositing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current latent inpainting uses linear interpolation of VAE latents under downsampled masks, causing artifacts at seams, global degradation, and color shifts. There's a need for pixel-equivalent latent compositing that matches pixel-space alpha compositing.

Method: Propose Pixel-Equivalent Latent Compositing (PELC) principle. Introduce DecFormer, a 7.7M-parameter transformer that predicts per-channel blend weights and residual correction for mask-consistent latent fusion. Trained to match pixel-space alpha compositing when decoded.

Result: DecFormer restores global color consistency, soft-mask support, sharp boundaries, and high-fidelity masking, reducing edge errors by up to 53%. As inpainting prior with lightweight LoRA, achieves fidelity comparable to fully finetuned FLUX.1-Fill model.

Conclusion: PELC enables pixel-equivalent latent editing, fixing fundamental issues with linear latent blending. DecFormer provides plug-compatible solution with minimal overhead (0.07% parameters, 3.5% FLOPs), applicable beyond inpainting to general latent editing tasks.

Abstract: Latent inpainting in diffusion models still relies almost universally on linearly interpolating VAE latents under a downsampled mask. We propose a key principle for compositing image latents: Pixel-Equivalent Latent Compositing (PELC). An equivalent latent compositor should be the same as compositing in pixel space. This principle enables full-resolution mask control and true soft-edge alpha compositing, even though VAEs compress images 8x spatially. Modern VAEs capture global context beyond patch-aligned local structure, so linear latent blending cannot be pixel-equivalent: it produces large artifacts at mask seams and global degradation and color shifts. We introduce DecFormer, a 7.7M-parameter transformer that predicts per-channel blend weights and an off-manifold residual correction to realize mask-consistent latent fusion. DecFormer is trained so that decoding after fusion matches pixel-space alpha compositing, is plug-compatible with existing diffusion pipelines, requires no backbone finetuning and adds only 0.07% of FLUX.1-Dev's parameters and 3.5% FLOP overhead. On the FLUX.1 family, DecFormer restores global color consistency, soft-mask support, sharp boundaries, and high-fidelity masking, reducing error metrics around edges by up to 53% over standard mask interpolation. Used as an inpainting prior, a lightweight LoRA on FLUX.1-Dev with DecFormer achieves fidelity comparable to FLUX.1-Fill, a fully finetuned inpainting model. While we focus on inpainting, PELC is a general recipe for pixel-equivalent latent editing, as we demonstrate on a complex color-correction task.

*Vsevolod Plohotnuk,Artyom Panshin,Nikola Banić,Simone Bianco,Michael Freeman,Egor Ershov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DEAR is the first benchmark dataset for evaluating image rendering aesthetics based on human preferences, addressing the gap in traditional distortion-focused IQA by capturing subjective style judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional IQA focuses on technical degradations (noise, blur, compression) but fails to address rendering aesthetics, which is crucial for photographic editing, content creation, and AI-generated imagery. There's a lack of datasets capturing subjective style preferences.

Method: Built upon MIT-Adobe FiveK dataset, DEAR incorporates pairwise human preference scores collected via large-scale crowdsourcing (25 evaluators per image pair, total 13,648 participants). The dataset captures nuanced, context-sensitive aesthetic preferences.

Result: Created the first systematic dataset for image aesthetics of rendering assessment grounded in subjective human preferences. Published subset of 100 images with markup on HuggingFace. Enables new tasks like style preference prediction, aesthetic benchmarking, and personalized aesthetic modeling.

Conclusion: DEAR addresses the underexplored domain of rendering aesthetics evaluation, providing a benchmark for models that go beyond traditional distortion-based IQA to capture subjective human preferences in image style assessment.

Abstract: Traditional Image Quality Assessment~(IQA) focuses on quantifying technical degradations such as noise, blur, or compression artifacts, using both full-reference and no-reference objective metrics. However, evaluation of rendering aesthetics, a growing domain relevant to photographic editing, content creation, and AI-generated imagery, remains underexplored due to the lack of datasets that reflect the inherently subjective nature of style preference. In this work, a novel benchmark dataset designed to model human aesthetic judgments of image rendering styles is introduced: the Dataset for Evaluating the Aesthetics of Rendering (DEAR). Built upon the MIT-Adobe FiveK dataset, DEAR incorporates pairwise human preference scores collected via large-scale crowdsourcing, with each image pair evaluated by 25 distinct human evaluators with a total of 13,648 of them participating overall. These annotations capture nuanced, context-sensitive aesthetic preferences, enabling the development and evaluation of models that go beyond traditional distortion-based IQA, focusing on a new task: Evaluation of Aesthetics of Rendering (EAR). The data collection pipeline is described, human voting patterns are analyzed, and multiple use cases are outlined, including style preference prediction, aesthetic benchmarking, and personalized aesthetic modeling. To the best of the authors' knowledge, DEAR is the first dataset to systematically address image aesthetics of rendering assessment grounded in subjective human preferences.

*Dmitrii Torbunov,Onur Okuducu,Yi Huang,Odera Dim,Rebecca Coles,Yonggang Cui,Yihui Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hybrid capture system combining sparse RGB keyframes with continuous event streams to reconstruct full RGB video offline, reducing power consumption while maintaining video quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address power constraints in continuous video monitoring by leveraging event cameras' low-power motion-driven sensing while maintaining standard RGB video output for downstream applications.

Method: Two approaches: 1) HyperE2VID - adapting autoregressive model for RGB generation, 2) LTX - injecting event representations into pretrained text-to-video diffusion model via learned encoders and low-rank adaptation.

Result: Diffusion-based approach achieves 33% better perceptual quality than autoregressive baseline (0.283 vs 0.422 LPIPS). Robust cross-dataset generalization demonstrated across three event camera datasets at varying sequence lengths.

Conclusion: Hybrid capture paradigm successfully reduces power consumption while maintaining video quality, with diffusion-based reconstruction outperforming autoregressive methods for the IE2Video task.

Abstract: Continuous video monitoring in surveillance, robotics, and wearable systems faces a fundamental power constraint: conventional RGB cameras consume substantial energy through fixed-rate capture. Event cameras offer sparse, motion-driven sensing with low power consumption, but produce asynchronous event streams rather than RGB video. We propose a hybrid capture paradigm that records sparse RGB keyframes alongside continuous event streams, then reconstructs full RGB video offline -- reducing capture power consumption while maintaining standard video output for downstream applications. We introduce the Image and Event to Video (IE2Video) task: reconstructing RGB video sequences from a single initial frame and subsequent event camera data. We investigate two architectural strategies: adapting an autoregressive model (HyperE2VID) for RGB generation, and injecting event representations into a pretrained text-to-video diffusion model (LTX) via learned encoders and low-rank adaptation. Our experiments demonstrate that the diffusion-based approach achieves 33\% better perceptual quality than the autoregressive baseline (0.283 vs 0.422 LPIPS). We validate our approach across three event camera datasets (BS-ERGB, HS-ERGB far/close) at varying sequence lengths (32-128 frames), demonstrating robust cross-dataset generalization with strong performance on unseen capture configurations.

TL;DR: AionHMR: A framework for age-inclusive 3D human shape and pose estimation that works for adults, children, and infants using SMPL-A body model and transformer architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D human pose and shape estimation methods perform well for adults but fail to generalize to children and infants, creating a significant domain gap in age-inclusive human modeling.

Method: 1) Optimization-based extension of top-performing model with SMPL-A body model for concurrent modeling of all age groups. 2) Generation of pseudo-ground-truth annotations for child/infant databases. 3) Development of specialized transformer-based deep learning model for real-time 3D age-inclusive reconstruction.

Result: Significantly improved shape and pose estimation for children and infants without compromising adult accuracy. Created 3D-BabyRobot dataset of action-preserving 3D reconstructions of children interacting with robots.

Conclusion: Bridges crucial domain gap in age-inclusive 3D human modeling, enables privacy-preserving datasets through mesh reconstruction, and establishes foundation for inclusive, privacy-aware, age-diverse human modeling.

Abstract: While three-dimensional (3D) shape and pose estimation is a highly researched area that has yielded significant advances, the resulting methods, despite performing well for the adult population, generally fail to generalize effectively to children and infants. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing AionHMR, a comprehensive framework designed to bridge this domain gap. We propose an optimization-based method that extends a top-performing model by incorporating the SMPL-A body model, enabling the concurrent and accurate modeling of adults, children, and infants. Leveraging this approach, we generated pseudo-ground-truth annotations for publicly available child and infant image databases. Using these new training data, we then developed and trained a specialized transformer-based deep learning model capable of real-time 3D age-inclusive human reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our methods significantly improve shape and pose estimation for children and infants without compromising accuracy on adults. Importantly, our reconstructed meshes serve as privacy-preserving substitutes for raw images, retaining essential action, pose, and geometry information while enabling anonymized datasets release. As a demonstration, we introduce the 3D-BabyRobot dataset, a collection of action-preserving 3D reconstructions of children interacting with robots. This work bridges a crucial domain gap and establishes a foundation for inclusive, privacy-aware, and age-diverse 3D human modeling.

### [16] [CARD: Correlation Aware Restoration with Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05268)
*Niki Nezakati,Arnab Ghosh,Amit Roy-Chowdhury,Vishwanath Saragadam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CARD is a training-free diffusion method that handles correlated sensor noise via whitening, outperforming existing methods on denoising, deblurring, and super-resolution tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world sensors exhibit spatially correlated noise due to readout mechanisms, but most diffusion-based restoration methods assume i.i.d. Gaussian noise, limiting their practical effectiveness.

Method: CARD whitens noisy observations to convert correlated noise to i.i.d. form, then uses noise-whitened updates in diffusion restoration steps while maintaining DDRM's closed-form sampling efficiency.

Result: CARD consistently outperforms existing methods on standard benchmarks with synthetic correlated noise and on the new CIN-D dataset for real rolling-shutter sensor noise.

Conclusion: CARD effectively handles correlated noise in image restoration tasks, and the CIN-D dataset fills a critical gap for evaluating methods on real-world correlated noise.

Abstract: Denoising diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in image restoration by modeling the process as sequential denoising steps. However, most approaches assume independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian noise, while real-world sensors often exhibit spatially correlated noise due to readout mechanisms, limiting their practical effectiveness. We introduce Correlation Aware Restoration with Diffusion (CARD), a training-free extension of DDRM that explicitly handles correlated Gaussian noise. CARD first whitens the noisy observation, which converts the noise into an i.i.d. form. Then, the diffusion restoration steps are replaced with noise-whitened updates, which inherits DDRM's closed-form sampling efficiency while now being able to handle correlated noise. To emphasize the importance of addressing correlated noise, we contribute CIN-D, a novel correlated noise dataset captured across diverse illumination conditions to evaluate restoration methods on real rolling-shutter sensor noise. This dataset fills a critical gap in the literature for experimental evaluation with real-world correlated noise. Experiments on standard benchmarks with synthetic correlated noise and on CIN-D demonstrate that CARD consistently outperforms existing methods across denoising, deblurring, and super-resolution tasks.

*Ahmet Berke Gokmen,Ajad Chhatkuli,Luc Van Gool,Danda Pani Paudel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COM4D is a method for reconstructing complete 4D scenes with multiple interacting objects from monocular videos without requiring 4D compositional training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 4D scene reconstruction often focus on single objects and rely on category-specific parametric models, leading to inconsistent scene configurations and limited applicability to specific object categories.

Method: Uses disentangled training of spatial and temporal attentions on 2D video input, learning object compositions and single object dynamics separately, then combines them at inference via attention mixing without 4D compositional training data.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results in 4D object and composed 3D reconstruction, reconstructing complete and persistent 4D scenes with multiple interacting objects from monocular videos.

Conclusion: COM4D provides a data-driven approach to consistently predict 4D scene structures and spatio-temporal configurations without relying on 4D compositional training data or category-specific models.

Abstract: Scenes in the real world are often composed of several static and dynamic objects. Capturing their 4-dimensional structures, composition and spatio-temporal configuration in-the-wild, though extremely interesting, is equally hard. Therefore, existing works often focus on one object at a time, while relying on some category-specific parametric shape model for dynamic objects. This can lead to inconsistent scene configurations, in addition to being limited to the modeled object categories. We propose COM4D (Compositional 4D), a method that consistently and jointly predicts the structure and spatio-temporal configuration of 4D/3D objects using only static multi-object or dynamic single object supervision. We achieve this by a carefully designed training of spatial and temporal attentions on 2D video input. The training is disentangled into learning from object compositions on the one hand, and single object dynamics throughout the video on the other, thus completely avoiding reliance on 4D compositional training data. At inference time, our proposed attention mixing mechanism combines these independently learned attentions, without requiring any 4D composition examples. By alternating between spatial and temporal reasoning, COM4D reconstructs complete and persistent 4D scenes with multiple interacting objects directly from monocular videos. Furthermore, COM4D provides state-of-the-art results in existing separate problems of 4D object and composed 3D reconstruction despite being purely data-driven.

TL;DR: Introduces TAD benchmark for evaluating temporal understanding in autonomous driving, shows current VLMs perform poorly, and proposes two training-free methods (Scene-CoT and TCogMap) that improve accuracy by up to 17.72%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing temporal reasoning benchmarks focus on general video content (sports, cooking, movies) but lack specialized evaluation for ego-centric autonomous driving footage, which has unique temporal understanding challenges.

Method: Created TAD benchmark with ~6,000 QA pairs across 7 tasks. Evaluated 9 generalist and AD specialist models. Proposed two training-free solutions: Scene-CoT (Chain-of-Thought reasoning) and TCogMap (ego-centric temporal cognitive map).

Result: Current SoTA models show substandard accuracy on TAD due to poor fine-grained motion understanding. Proposed methods improve average accuracy by up to 17.72% when integrated with existing VLMs.

Conclusion: TAD benchmark reveals critical gaps in temporal understanding for autonomous driving. The proposed training-free methods effectively enhance performance, providing a foundation for future research in this domain.

Abstract: Temporal understanding in autonomous driving (AD) remains a significant challenge, even for recent state-of-the-art (SoTA) Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Prior work has introduced datasets and benchmarks aimed at improving temporal reasoning, but these have emphasized other video content, including sports, cooking, and movies. No existing benchmark focuses exclusively on the unique challenges of temporal understanding in ego-centric AD footage. To fill this gap, the Temporal Understanding in Autonomous Driving (TAD) benchmark is presented, which evaluates VLMs' ability to capture the dynamic relationships between actions in AD. TAD comprises nearly 6,000 question-answer (QA) pairs, spanning 7 human-designed tasks. In addition, an evaluation is performed that consists of 9 closed- and open-source generalist models as well as SoTA AD specialist models. When applied to TAD, current SoTA models demonstrated substandard accuracies, largely due to imperfect fine-grained motion understanding. To improve motion understanding and overall accuracy on TAD, two novel training-free solutions are proposed: Scene-CoT, that leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and TCogMap, which incorporates an ego-centric temporal cognitive map. The proposed approaches are integrated with existing VLMs and improve average accuracy on TAD by up to 17.72%. By introducing TAD, benchmarking multiple SoTA models, and proposing effective enhancements, this work aims to catalyze future research on temporal understanding in AD. The benchmark and evaluation code are available at \href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/vbdai/TAD}{Hugging Face} and \href{https://github.com/vbdi/tad_bench}{Github}, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D generative methods rely on text or image prompts which lack geometric specificity - language is ambiguous and images are cumbersome to edit, creating a need for more precise spatial control.

Method: A training-free test-time approach that accepts diverse geometric inputs (from coarse primitives to detailed meshes) and integrates with pre-trained generative models, featuring a controllable parameter to balance geometric fidelity and realism.

Result: Outperforms both training-based and optimization-based baselines in geometric faithfulness while maintaining high visual quality, as demonstrated through quantitative evaluation and user studies.

Conclusion: SpaceControl enables practical deployment in creative workflows through an interactive UI for editing superquadrics and direct conversion into textured 3D assets, offering precise spatial control without additional training.

Abstract: Generative methods for 3D assets have recently achieved remarkable progress, yet providing intuitive and precise control over the object geometry remains a key challenge. Existing approaches predominantly rely on text or image prompts, which often fall short in geometric specificity: language can be ambiguous, and images are cumbersome to edit. In this work, we introduce SpaceControl, a training-free test-time method for explicit spatial control of 3D generation. Our approach accepts a wide range of geometric inputs, from coarse primitives to detailed meshes, and integrates seamlessly with modern pre-trained generative models without requiring any additional training. A controllable parameter lets users trade off between geometric fidelity and output realism. Extensive quantitative evaluation and user studies demonstrate that SpaceControl outperforms both training-based and optimization-based baselines in geometric faithfulness while preserving high visual quality. Finally, we present an interactive user interface that enables online editing of superquadrics for direct conversion into textured 3D assets, facilitating practical deployment in creative workflows.

Abstract: The rise of 3D Gaussian Splatting has revolutionized photorealistic 3D asset creation, yet a critical gap remains for their interactive refinement and editing. Existing approaches based on diffusion or optimization are ill-suited for this task, as they are often prohibitively slow, destructive to the original asset's identity, or lack the precision for fine-grained control. To address this, we introduce \ourmethod, a state-aware feedforward model that enables continuous editing of 3D Gaussian assets from user-provided 2D view(s). Our method directly predicts updates to the attributes of a compact, feature-rich Gaussian representation and leverages Test-Time Training to create a state-aware, iterative workflow. The versatility of our approach allows a single architecture to perform diverse tasks, including high-fidelity local detail refinement, local paint-over, and consistent global recoloring, all at interactive speeds, paving the way for fluid and intuitive 3D content authoring.

*Zekai Shao,Yufan Hu,Jingyuan Liu,Bin Fan,Hongmin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GOLA framework reduces rank redundancy in RGB-T tracking by grouping redundant ranks and enforcing orthogonal constraints between groups to learn complementary features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-rank adaptation in RGB-T tracking suffers from significant redundancy in rank space, where many ranks contribute little practical information, limiting the model's ability to learn diverse knowledge for various tracking challenges.

Method: Group Orthogonal Low-Rank Adaptation (GOLA) framework uses rank decomposition partitioning via SVD to quantify rank importance, freezes crucial ranks, clusters redundant ranks into groups, and applies inter-group orthogonal constraints to enforce complementary feature learning.

Result: GOLA effectively reduces parameter redundancy and enhances feature representation capabilities, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods across four benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed GOLA framework successfully addresses rank redundancy in RGB-T tracking through structured parameter learning and orthogonal constraints, validating its effectiveness for parameter-efficient fine-tuning in tracking tasks.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning has emerged as a promising paradigm in RGB-T tracking, enabling downstream task adaptation by freezing pretrained parameters and fine-tuning only a small set of parameters. This set forms a rank space made up of multiple individual ranks, whose expressiveness directly shapes the model's adaptability. However, quantitative analysis reveals low-rank adaptation exhibits significant redundancy in the rank space, with many ranks contributing almost no practical information. This hinders the model's ability to learn more diverse knowledge to address the various challenges in RGB-T tracking. To address this issue, we propose the Group Orthogonal Low-Rank Adaptation (GOLA) framework for RGB-T tracking, which effectively leverages the rank space through structured parameter learning. Specifically, we adopt a rank decomposition partitioning strategy utilizing singular value decomposition to quantify rank importance, freeze crucial ranks to preserve the pretrained priors, and cluster the redundant ranks into groups to prepare for subsequent orthogonal constraints. We further design an inter-group orthogonal constraint strategy. This constraint enforces orthogonality between rank groups, compelling them to learn complementary features that target diverse challenges, thereby alleviating information redundancy. Experimental results demonstrate that GOLA effectively reduces parameter redundancy and enhances feature representation capabilities, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods across four benchmark datasets and validating its effectiveness in RGB-T tracking tasks.

TL;DR: PoolNet is a deep learning framework that quickly validates whether image data is suitable for Structure-from-Motion processing, saving time compared to traditional SfM algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional SfM processing is time-consuming and computationally expensive, and most publicly available image data is unsuitable due to issues like inadequate camera pose variation, obscuring elements, and noise.

Method: PoolNet is a versatile deep learning framework designed for frame-level and scene-level validation of in-the-wild image data to determine SfM readiness.

Result: The model successfully differentiates SfM-ready scenes from unfit ones while significantly reducing the time required compared to state-of-the-art SfM algorithms.

Conclusion: PoolNet provides an efficient solution for pre-screening image data for SfM processing, addressing the challenges of time consumption and data quality in traditional approaches.

Abstract: Lifting Structure-from-Motion (SfM) information from sequential and non-sequential image data is a time-consuming and computationally expensive task. In addition to this, the majority of publicly available data is unfit for processing due to inadequate camera pose variation, obscuring scene elements, and noisy data. To solve this problem, we introduce PoolNet, a versatile deep learning framework for frame-level and scene-level validation of in-the-wild data. We demonstrate that our model successfully differentiates SfM ready scenes from those unfit for processing while significantly undercutting the amount of time state of the art algorithms take to obtain structure-from-motion data.

TL;DR: ShaRP is an improved attention-based pruning framework for Video LLMs that enables effective pruning at shallow decoder layers while maintaining performance under high compression rates without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLLMs face high computational load during pre-filling due to processing enormous visual tokens. Existing attention-based pruning methods suffer significant performance degradation when applied at early decoder layers, especially under high compression rates, due to positional encoding bias and insufficient information interaction.

Method: ShaRP integrates three key components: segment-aware causal masking, positional debiasing, and token deduplication for enhanced token selection. This framework enables effective pruning at shallow layers while maintaining stable performance.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that ShaRP achieves competitive performance across multiple video understanding benchmarks, establishing a new paradigm for accelerating VLLM inference.

Conclusion: ShaRP provides an effective solution to the computational bottleneck in VLLMs by enabling efficient pruning at shallow decoder layers without performance degradation, offering a practical approach to accelerate VLLM inference.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) face the challenge of high computational load during the pre-filling stage due to the processing of an enormous number of visual tokens. Although attention-based pruning methods are widely used to accelerate inference, trials at early decoder layers often result in significant performance degradation, especially under high compression rates. We argue that while attention-based pruning inherently holds the potential to identify the most relevant visual tokens, its effectiveness in shallow decoder layers is limited by factors such as positional encoding bias and insufficient information interaction. In this paper, we propose an improved attention-based pruning framework, termed ShaRP, that integrates segment-aware causal masking, positional debiasing, and token deduplication for enhanced token selection. It enables effective pruning at shallow layers while maintaining stable performance under high compression rates without retraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ShaRP achieves competitive performance across multiple video understanding benchmarks, establishing a new paradigm for accelerating VLLM inference.

*Qingqiao Hu,Weimin Lyu,Meilong Xu,Kehan Qi,Xiaoling Hu,Saumya Gupta,Jiawei Zhou,Chao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoC-Path is an efficient multimodal LLM for pathology that reduces computational costs by identifying and focusing on only task-relevant tiles in whole slide images, rather than processing all patches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing slide-level MLLMs for pathology are computationally expensive because they process thousands of patch features in a brute-force manner, while human experts focus only on key diagnostic regions. The authors observed that tile-level features exhibit strong redundancy, with only a small subset being truly task-relevant.

Method: 1) Sparse Token Merger (STM) and MAE-pretrained resampler to remove local redundancy and compress globally redundant tile tokens into compact slide-level representations. 2) Cross-Attention Routing Adapter (CARA) and Token Importance Scorer (TIS) to integrate compressed visual representations with language models efficiently.

Result: The approach achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art whole-slide MLLMs while requiring significantly lower computation and memory resources.

Conclusion: LoC-Path demonstrates that efficient WSI-language modeling is possible by focusing on task-relevant tiles and reducing redundancy, offering a more practical solution for computational pathology applications.

Abstract: Whole Slide Image (WSI) understanding is fundamentally challenging due to its gigapixel scale and the extreme sparsity of diagnostically relevant regions. Unlike human experts who primarily rely on key areas to arrive at a diagnosis, existing slide-level multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for pathology rely on heavy slide-level encoders that process thousands of patch features in a brute-force manner, resulting in excessive computational cost. In this work, we revisit the WSI-language modeling paradigm and show that tile-level features exhibit strong global and local redundancy, whereas only a small subset of tiles are truly task-relevant. Motivated by this observation, we introduce an efficient MLLM framework, called LoC-Path, that replaces the expensive slide-level encoder with redundancy-reducing modules. We first design a Sparse Token Merger (STM) and an MAE-pretrained resampler to remove local redundancy and compress globally redundant tile tokens into a compact slide-level representation set. We then propose a Cross-Attention Routing Adapter (CARA) and a Token Importance Scorer (TIS) to integrate the compressed visual representation with the language model in a computation-efficient manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves performance comparable to existing state-of-the-art whole-slide MLLMs, while requiring significantly lower computation and memory.

TL;DR: SSVAE introduces spectral-structured video VAE with two regularizers to optimize latent space for diffusion training, achieving 3x faster convergence and 10% better video quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video VAEs focus on reconstruction fidelity but overlook latent structure, which strongly influences diffusion training difficulty. The spectral properties of VAE latents are crucial for efficient diffusion training but are not addressed by current approaches.

Method: Proposes Spectral-Structured VAE (SSVAE) with two lightweight regularizers: 1) Local Correlation Regularization to create spatio-temporal frequency spectrum biased toward low frequencies, and 2) Latent Masked Reconstruction to achieve channel-wise eigenspectrum dominated by few modes. Both are backbone-agnostic.

Result: SSVAE achieves 3x speedup in text-to-video generation convergence and 10% gain in video reward compared to strong open-source VAEs. The method demonstrates superior performance in diffusion training efficiency and output quality.

Conclusion: Optimizing VAE latent structure through spectral properties is crucial for efficient diffusion training. SSVAE's regularizers effectively shape latent space for better diffusion performance, offering significant improvements in training speed and video quality.

Abstract: Latent diffusion models pair VAEs with diffusion backbones, and the structure of VAE latents strongly influences the difficulty of diffusion training. However, existing video VAEs typically focus on reconstruction fidelity, overlooking latent structure. We present a statistical analysis of video VAE latent spaces and identify two spectral properties essential for diffusion training: a spatio-temporal frequency spectrum biased toward low frequencies, and a channel-wise eigenspectrum dominated by a few modes. To induce these properties, we propose two lightweight, backbone-agnostic regularizers: Local Correlation Regularization and Latent Masked Reconstruction. Experiments show that our Spectral-Structured VAE (SSVAE) achieves a $3\times$ speedup in text-to-video generation convergence and a 10\% gain in video reward, outperforming strong open-source VAEs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical structure from motion pipelines struggle with dynamic objects in videos, and existing learning-based methods require large motion segmentation datasets which limit their accuracy and generalization.

Method: Proposes Dynamic Prior (DP) that leverages Vision-Language Models for reasoning about object dynamics and SAM2 for fine-grained spatial segmentation, integrated into state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction pipelines.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art motion segmentation performance and significantly improves accuracy and robustness for structural 3D understanding on both synthetic and real-world videos.

Conclusion: Dynamic Prior provides an effective training-free solution for identifying dynamic objects, enabling more accurate camera pose optimization, depth reconstruction, and 4D trajectory estimation in complex real-world scenes.

Abstract: Estimating accurate camera poses, 3D scene geometry, and object motion from in-the-wild videos is a long-standing challenge for classical structure from motion pipelines due to the presence of dynamic objects. Recent learning-based methods attempt to overcome this challenge by training motion estimators to filter dynamic objects and focus on the static background. However, their performance is largely limited by the availability of large-scale motion segmentation datasets, resulting in inaccurate segmentation and, therefore, inferior structural 3D understanding. In this work, we introduce the Dynamic Prior (\ourmodel) to robustly identify dynamic objects without task-specific training, leveraging the powerful reasoning capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and the fine-grained spatial segmentation capacity of SAM2. \ourmodel can be seamlessly integrated into state-of-the-art pipelines for camera pose optimization, depth reconstruction, and 4D trajectory estimation. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world videos demonstrate that \ourmodel not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on motion segmentation, but also significantly improves accuracy and robustness for structural 3D understanding.

Conclusion: GA-based parameter optimization provides a practical solution for resource-constrained UAV systems, enabling precise tree branch distance measurement while maintaining processing efficiency for real-world forestry applications.

Abstract: Traditional stereo matching algorithms like Semi-Global Block Matching (SGBM) with Weighted Least Squares (WLS) filtering offer speed advantages over neural networks for UAV applications, generating disparity maps in approximately 0.5 seconds per frame. However, these algorithms require meticulous parameter tuning. We propose a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based parameter optimization framework that systematically searches for optimal parameter configurations for SGBM and WLS, enabling UAVs to measure distances to tree branches with enhanced precision while maintaining processing efficiency. Our contributions include: (1) a novel GA-based parameter optimization framework that eliminates manual tuning; (2) a comprehensive evaluation methodology using multiple image quality metrics; and (3) a practical solution for resource-constrained UAV systems. Experimental results demonstrate that our GA-optimized approach reduces Mean Squared Error by 42.86% while increasing Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio and Structural Similarity by 8.47% and 28.52%, respectively, compared with baseline configurations. Furthermore, our approach demonstrates superior generalization performance across varied imaging conditions, which is critcal for real-world forestry applications.

TL;DR: A multi-input CNN with attention module achieves 99% accuracy for automated solar system moving object detection, reducing human workload by 99%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current moving object detection in solar system surveys relies heavily on manual verification by human eyes, which is labor-intensive and costly. There's a need to automate this process and reduce reliance on human intervention.

Method: Proposes a multi-input convolutional neural network integrated with a convolutional block attention module (CBAM). The multi-input architecture processes multiple stacked images simultaneously, while CBAM enables the model to focus on essential features in both spatial and channel dimensions.

Result: Achieved nearly 99% accuracy with AUC >0.99 on a dataset of approximately 2,000 observational images. By adjusting detection thresholds, the model reduces human workload by more than 99% compared to manual verification.

Conclusion: The proposed model achieves excellent classification performance for moving object detection in solar system surveys, significantly reducing manual labor while maintaining high accuracy, representing a major advancement in automated astronomical data analysis.

Abstract: One of the greatest challenges for detecting moving objects in the solar system from wide-field survey data is determining whether a signal indicates a true object or is due to some other source, like noise. Object verification has relied heavily on human eyes, which usually results in significant labor costs. In order to address this limitation and reduce the reliance on manual intervention, we propose a multi-input convolutional neural network integrated with a convolutional block attention module. This method is specifically tailored to enhance the moving object detection system that we have developed and used previously. The current method introduces two innovations. This first one is a multi-input architecture that processes multiple stacked images simultaneously. The second is the incorporation of the convolutional block attention module which enables the model to focus on essential features in both spatial and channel dimensions. These advancements facilitate efficient learning from multiple inputs, leading to more robust detection of moving objects. The performance of the model is evaluated on a dataset consisting of approximately 2,000 observational images. We achieved an accuracy of nearly 99% with AUC (an Area Under the Curve) of >0.99. These metrics indicate that the proposed model achieves excellent classification performance. By adjusting the threshold for object detection, the new model reduces the human workload by more than 99% compared to manual verification.

TL;DR: ParaUni is a unified multimodal model that extracts parallel features from different VLM layers to balance interaction and flexibility, using layer integration and dynamic adjustment mechanisms to improve visual generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unified multimodal models struggle to balance sufficient interaction between vision-language models and diffusion models with flexible implementation due to vast representation differences between them.

Method: Proposes ParaUni with two key components: 1) Layer Integration Module (LIM) that extracts visual features from all VLM layers in parallel and fuses them for diffusion conditioning, and 2) Layer-wise Dynamic Adjustment Mechanism (LDAM) that uses RL to align hierarchical layer properties with multiple rewards.

Result: Extensive experiments show ParaUni substantially improves generation quality by leveraging complementary multi-layer features and demonstrates strong potential for multiple reward advances during RL stages.

Conclusion: ParaUni effectively balances interaction and flexibility in unified multimodal models by parallel feature extraction from hierarchical VLM layers, achieving better visual generation through comprehensive information integration and RL-based layer alignment.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models significantly improve visual generation by combining vision-language models (VLMs) with diffusion models. However, existing methods struggle to fully balance sufficient interaction and flexible implementation due to vast representation difference. Considering abundant and hierarchical information in VLM's layers from low-level details to high-level semantics, we propose \textbf{ParaUni}. It extracts features from variants VLM's layers in a \textbf{Para}llel way for comprehensive information interaction and retains a flexible separation architecture to enhance generation in \textbf{Uni}fied multimodal model. Concretely, visual features from all VLM's layers are fed in parallel into a Layer Integration Module (LIM), which efficiently integrates fine-grained details and semantic abstractions and provides the fused representation as a condition to the diffusion model. To further enhance performance, we reveal that these hierarchical layers respond unequally to different rewards in Reinforcement Learning (RL). Crucially, we design a Layer-wise Dynamic Adjustment Mechanism (LDAM) to facilitate multiple reward improvements that aligns the hierarchical properties of these layers using RL. Extensive experiments show ParaUni leverages complementary multi-layer features to substantially improve generation quality and shows strong potential for multiple reward advances during RL stages.

TL;DR: TED-4DGS: A rate-distortion-optimized compression framework for dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting using temporally activated anchor-based deformation with neural compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current dynamic 3DGS methods have limitations: 4DGS uses overspecified short-lived Gaussians, while canonical 3DGS with deformation lacks explicit temporal control. There's a need for compact, efficient deformation schemes with rate-distortion-optimized compression for dynamic 3DGS representations.

Method: TED-4DGS uses sparse anchor-based 3DGS representation with learnable temporal-activation parameters for appearance/disappearance transitions. Lightweight per-anchor temporal embeddings query a shared deformation bank. For compression, uses INR-based hyperprior to model anchor attribute distributions and channel-wise autoregressive model for intra-anchor correlations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance on several real-world datasets. Represents one of the first attempts at rate-distortion-optimized compression for dynamic 3DGS representations.

Conclusion: TED-4DGS successfully unifies strengths of both 4DGS and canonical 3DGS approaches, providing compact deformation with explicit temporal control and efficient compression for dynamic 3D scene representation.

Abstract: Building on the success of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) in static 3D scene representation, its extension to dynamic scenes, commonly referred to as 4DGS or dynamic 3DGS, has attracted increasing attention. However, designing more compact and efficient deformation schemes together with rate-distortion-optimized compression strategies for dynamic 3DGS representations remains an underexplored area. Prior methods either rely on space-time 4DGS with overspecified, short-lived Gaussian primitives or on canonical 3DGS with deformation that lacks explicit temporal control. To address this, we present TED-4DGS, a temporally activated and embedding-based deformation scheme for rate-distortion-optimized 4DGS compression that unifies the strengths of both families. TED-4DGS is built on a sparse anchor-based 3DGS representation. Each canonical anchor is assigned learnable temporal-activation parameters to specify its appearance and disappearance transitions over time, while a lightweight per-anchor temporal embedding queries a shared deformation bank to produce anchor-specific deformation. For rate-distortion compression, we incorporate an implicit neural representation (INR)-based hyperprior to model anchor attribute distributions, along with a channel-wise autoregressive model to capture intra-anchor correlations. With these novel elements, our scheme achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance on several real-world datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents one of the first attempts to pursue a rate-distortion-optimized compression framework for dynamic 3DGS representations.

Abstract: Many industrial sectors have been using of machine learning at inference mode on edge devices. Future directions show that training on edge devices is promising due to improvements in semiconductor performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image stylization methods transform visual appearance but overlook emotional impact. The authors aim to bridge this gap by creating stylization that evokes specific emotions while maintaining content integrity.

Method: 1) Construct EmoStyleSet dataset from ArtEmis; 2) Develop Emotion-Content Reasoner to integrate emotional cues with content for style queries; 3) Create Style Quantizer to convert continuous features into emotion-related codebook entries for discrete artistic styles.

Result: Extensive evaluations show EmoStyle enhances emotional expressiveness while maintaining content consistency. The learned emotion-aware style dictionary is adaptable to other generative tasks.

Conclusion: This work establishes a foundation for emotion-driven image stylization, expanding the creative potential of AI-generated art and enabling broader applications in affective computing and artistic expression.

Abstract: Art has long been a profound medium for expressing emotions. While existing image stylization methods effectively transform visual appearance, they often overlook the emotional impact carried by styles. To bridge this gap, we introduce Affective Image Stylization (AIS), a task that applies artistic styles to evoke specific emotions while preserving content. We present EmoStyle, a framework designed to address key challenges in AIS, including the lack of training data and the emotion-style mapping. First, we construct EmoStyleSet, a content-emotion-stylized image triplet dataset derived from ArtEmis to support AIS. We then propose an Emotion-Content Reasoner that adaptively integrates emotional cues with content to learn coherent style queries. Given the discrete nature of artistic styles, we further develop a Style Quantizer that converts continuous style features into emotion-related codebook entries. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations, including user studies, demonstrate that EmoStyle enhances emotional expressiveness while maintaining content consistency. Moreover, the learned emotion-aware style dictionary is adaptable to other generative tasks, highlighting its potential for broader applications. Our work establishes a foundation for emotion-driven image stylization, expanding the creative potential of AI-generated art.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniFS is a unified frequency-spatial fusion model for multi-contrast MR reconstruction that handles multiple k-space undersampling patterns without retraining, achieving state-of-the-art performance through adaptive prompt learning and frequency fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MCMR methods struggle with generalization across different k-space undersampling patterns, requiring separate models for each pattern. They also tend to neglect deep frequency characteristics and fail to fully leverage complementary cross-modal frequency information.

Method: UniFS integrates three key modules: 1) Cross-Modal Frequency Fusion module, 2) Adaptive Mask-Based Prompt Learning module, and 3) Dual-Branch Complementary Refinement module. It uses adaptive prompt-guided frequency fusion for k-space learning to extract domain-invariant features from diverse undersampling patterns.

Result: Experimental results on BraTS and HCP datasets with various k-space undersampling patterns and acceleration factors (including unseen patterns) demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and superior generalizability compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: UniFS successfully addresses the generalization challenge in MCMR by handling multiple k-space undersampling patterns without retraining, effectively leveraging both frequency and spatial information through adaptive prompt learning and fusion mechanisms.

Abstract: Recently, Multi-Contrast MR Reconstruction (MCMR) has emerged as a hot research topic that leverages high-quality auxiliary modalities to reconstruct undersampled target modalities of interest. However, existing methods often struggle to generalize across different k-space undersampling patterns, requiring the training of a separate model for each specific pattern, which limits their practical applicability. To address this challenge, we propose UniFS, a Unified Frequency-Spatial Fusion model designed to handle multiple k-space undersampling patterns for MCMR tasks without any need for retraining. UniFS integrates three key modules: a Cross-Modal Frequency Fusion module, an Adaptive Mask-Based Prompt Learning module, and a Dual-Branch Complementary Refinement module. These modules work together to extract domain-invariant features from diverse k-space undersampling patterns while dynamically adapt to their own variations. Another limitation of existing MCMR methods is their tendency to focus solely on spatial information while neglect frequency characteristics, or extract only shallow frequency features, thus failing to fully leverage complementary cross-modal frequency information. To relieve this issue, UniFS introduces an adaptive prompt-guided frequency fusion module for k-space learning, significantly enhancing the model's generalization performance. We evaluate our model on the BraTS and HCP datasets with various k-space undersampling patterns and acceleration factors, including previously unseen patterns, to comprehensively assess UniFS's generalizability. Experimental results across multiple scenarios demonstrate that UniFS achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/LIKP0/UniFS.

TL;DR: A cross-modal framework using 2D Vision-Language Models to mine rare objects from driving scenes, improving 3D object detection with less training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rare-object detection is challenging in autonomous driving, especially with point cloud data alone. VLMs have strong image understanding capabilities but their potential for enhancing 3D object detection through intelligent data mining hasn't been fully explored.

Method: Proposes a cross-modal framework that leverages 2D VLMs to identify and mine rare objects. Combines object detection, semantic feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, and multi-faceted outlier detection (Isolation Forest + t-SNE) with concept-based filtering into a cohesive pipeline.

Result: Experiments on nuScenes dataset show the concept-guided data mining strategy enhances 3D object detection performance while using only a fraction of training data. Particularly notable improvements for challenging categories like trailers and bicycles compared to random data sampling.

Conclusion: The framework effectively identifies semantically meaningful rare objects, reduces annotation burden, and focuses on valuable training samples. This has substantial implications for efficient dataset curation in safety-critical autonomous systems.

Abstract: Rare-object detection remains a challenging task in autonomous driving systems, particularly when relying solely on point cloud data. Although Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit strong capabilities in image understanding, their potential to enhance 3D object detection through intelligent data mining has not been fully explored. This paper proposes a novel cross-modal framework that leverages 2D VLMs to identify and mine rare objects from driving scenes, thereby improving 3D object detection performance. Our approach synthesizes complementary techniques such as object detection, semantic feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, and multi-faceted outlier detection into a cohesive, explainable pipeline that systematically identifies rare but critical objects in driving scenes. By combining Isolation Forest and t-SNE-based outlier detection methods with concept-based filtering, the framework effectively identifies semantically meaningful rare objects. A key strength of this approach lies in its ability to extract and annotate targeted rare object concepts such as construction vehicles, motorcycles, and barriers. This substantially reduces the annotation burden and focuses only on the most valuable training samples. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that this concept-guided data mining strategy enhances the performance of 3D object detection models while utilizing only a fraction of the training data, with particularly notable improvements for challenging object categories such as trailers and bicycles compared with the same amount of random data. This finding has substantial implications for the efficient curation of datasets in safety-critical autonomous systems.

TL;DR: WaterWave: An implicit representation method for temporally consistent underwater video enhancement using wavelet-based temporal consistency fields and flow correction, without requiring paired training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater video enhancement faces challenges due to difficulty obtaining paired underwater video data and lack of temporal consistency when applying single-image enhancement methods frame-by-frame, leading to unnatural video results.

Method: Proposes WaterWave, which uses implicit representation in wavelet-based temporal consistency fields. It leverages temporal consistency priors from local temporal frequency perspective, progressively filters inconsistent components while preserving motion details, and includes an underwater flow correction module to accurately represent temporal frequency bands by considering underwater transmission effects.

Result: Significantly improves quality of videos enhanced by single-image methods and shows strong performance in downstream underwater tracking tasks (UOSTrack and MAT), outperforming original videos by 19.7% and 9.7% on precision metrics respectively.

Conclusion: WaterWave effectively addresses temporal consistency in underwater video enhancement without paired data, achieving natural-flowing videos and demonstrating practical value for underwater computer vision applications.

Abstract: Underwater video pairs are fairly difficult to obtain due to the complex underwater imaging. In this case, most existing video underwater enhancement methods are performed by directly applying the single-image enhancement model frame by frame, but a natural issue is lacking temporal consistency. To relieve the problem, we rethink the temporal manifold inherent in natural videos and observe a temporal consistency prior in dynamic scenes from the local temporal frequency perspective. Building upon the specific prior and no paired-data condition, we propose an implicit representation manner for enhanced video signals, which is conducted in the wavelet-based temporal consistency field, WaterWave. Specifically, under the constraints of the prior, we progressively filter and attenuate the inconsistent components while preserving motion details and scenes, achieving a natural-flowing video. Furthermore, to represent temporal frequency bands more accurately, an underwater flow correction module is designed to rectify estimated flows considering the transmission in underwater scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WaterWave significantly enhances the quality of videos generated using single-image underwater enhancements. Additionally, our method demonstrates high potential in downstream underwater tracking tasks, such as UOSTrack and MAT, outperforming the original video by a large margin, i.e., 19.7% and 9.7% on precise respectively.

Motivation: To overcome limitations of Transformer decoders in medical image segmentation, particularly their inability to effectively capture edge details, recognize local textures, and model spatial continuity, which are crucial for high-precision tasks like tumor segmentation and organ boundary extraction.

Method: Proposes a three-module decoder framework: 1) Adaptive Cross-Fusion Attention (ACFA) with learnable guidance in three directions for enhanced key region responsiveness, 2) Triple Feature Fusion Attention (TFFA) that fuses spatial, Fourier, and wavelet domain features for joint frequency-spatial representation, and 3) Structural-aware Multi-scale Masking Module (SMMM) that optimizes encoder-decoder skip connections using multi-scale context and structural saliency filtering.

Result: The framework significantly enhances performance in high-precision medical image segmentation tasks, improving both segmentation accuracy and model generalization, particularly effective in complex and blurred boundary scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed decoder framework provides an efficient and practical solution for medical image segmentation by addressing traditional decoder shortcomings through synergistic modules that enhance edge detail capture, local texture recognition, and spatial continuity modeling.

Abstract: To address the limitations of Transformer decoders in capturing edge details, recognizing local textures and modeling spatial continuity, this paper proposes a novel decoder framework specifically designed for medical image segmentation, comprising three core modules. First, the Adaptive Cross-Fusion Attention (ACFA) module integrates channel feature enhancement with spatial attention mechanisms and introduces learnable guidance in three directions (planar, horizontal, and vertical) to enhance responsiveness to key regions and structural orientations. Second, the Triple Feature Fusion Attention (TFFA) module fuses features from Spatial, Fourier and Wavelet domains, achieving joint frequency-spatial representation that strengthens global dependency and structural modeling while preserving local information such as edges and textures, making it particularly effective in complex and blurred boundary scenarios. Finally, the Structural-aware Multi-scale Masking Module (SMMM) optimizes the skip connections between encoder and decoder by leveraging multi-scale context and structural saliency filtering, effectively reducing feature redundancy and improving semantic interaction quality. Working synergistically, these modules not only address the shortcomings of traditional decoders but also significantly enhance performance in high-precision tasks such as tumor segmentation and organ boundary extraction, improving both segmentation accuracy and model generalization. Experimental results demonstrate that this framework provides an efficient and practical solution for medical image segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large visual foundation models have strong generalization but their potential for single-frame infrared small target (SIRST) detection remains unexplored. The authors aim to leverage VFMs for SIRST detection without adding inference burden.

Method: Proposes FDEP framework with: 1) Semantic Alignment Modulation Fusion (SAMF) module for dynamic alignment of VFM priors with task features; 2) Collaborative Optimization-based Implicit Self-Distillation (CO-ISD) strategy for implicit semantic transfer via parameter sharing; 3) Holistic SIRST Evaluation (HSE) metric for unified evaluation.

Result: Extensive experiments show SIRST detection networks equipped with FDEP achieve state-of-the-art performance on multiple public datasets without additional inference overhead.

Conclusion: FDEP successfully adapts visual foundation models to SIRST detection, improving accuracy efficiently. The framework is compatible with existing encoder-decoder methods and provides a comprehensive evaluation metric for fair comparison.

Abstract: While large-scale visual foundation models (VFMs) exhibit strong generalization across diverse visual domains, their potential for single-frame infrared small target (SIRST) detection remains largely unexplored. To fill this gap, we systematically introduce the frozen representations from VFMs into the SIRST task for the first time and propose a Foundation-Driven Efficient Paradigm (FDEP), which can seamlessly adapt to existing encoder-decoder-based methods and significantly improve accuracy without additional inference overhead. Specifically, a Semantic Alignment Modulation Fusion (SAMF) module is designed to achieve dynamic alignment and deep fusion of the global semantic priors from VFMs with task-specific features. Meanwhile, to avoid the inference time burden introduced by VFMs, we propose a Collaborative Optimization-based Implicit Self-Distillation (CO-ISD) strategy, which enables implicit semantic transfer between the main and lightweight branches through parameter sharing and synchronized backpropagation. In addition, to unify the fragmented evaluation system, we construct a Holistic SIRST Evaluation (HSE) metric that performs multi-threshold integral evaluation at both pixel-level confidence and target-level robustness, providing a stable and comprehensive basis for fair model comparison. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the SIRST detection networks equipped with our FDEP framework achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on multiple public datasets.

TL;DR: Know-Show is a new benchmark for evaluating spatio-temporal grounded reasoning in Video-LMs, revealing significant gaps between current models and human reasoning, with GRAM proposed as a training-free plug-in to improve fine-grained grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Video-LMs show impressive multimodal understanding but lack spatio-temporal grounding - they can't properly ground their reasoning in visual and temporal evidence. There's a need to evaluate and improve models' ability to "show what they know" and vice versa.

Method: Created Know-Show benchmark with 2.5K human-authored questions across five scenarios (person, object, person-object, hand-object, temporal) from Charades, Action Genome, and Ego4D. Proposed GRAM - a training-free plug-in using attention-based video token selection and explicit timestamp encoding.

Result: Existing Video-LMs (Qwen, VideoLLaVA, GPT-4o, Gemini) struggle with spatio-temporal grounded reasoning, especially in fine-grained hand-object interactions. GRAM improves grounding capabilities without additional training.

Conclusion: Know-Show establishes a unified standard for assessing grounded reasoning in video-language understanding, revealing current model limitations and providing insights for developing more interpretable and reliable multimodal reasoning systems.

Abstract: Large Video-Language Models (Video-LMs) have achieved impressive progress in multimodal understanding, yet their reasoning remains weakly grounded in space and time. We present Know-Show, a new benchmark designed to evaluate spatio-temporal grounded reasoning, the ability of a model to reason about actions and their semantics while simultaneously grounding its inferences in visual and temporal evidence. Know-Show unifies reasoning and localization within a single evaluation framework consisting of five complementary scenarios across spatial (person, object, person-object, and hand-object) and temporal dimensions. Built from Charades, Action Genome, and Ego4D with 2.5K human-authored questions, the benchmark exposes significant gaps between current Video-LMs and human reasoning. To bridge this gap, we propose GRAM, a training-free plug-in that augments Video-LMs with fine-grained grounding through attention-based video token selection and explicit timestamp encoding. Extensive experiments across open and closed Video-LMs (Qwen, VideoLLaVA, GPT-4o, and Gemini, etc.) reveal that existing models struggle to "show what they know" and vice versa, especially in fine-grained hand-object interactions. Know-Show establishes a unified standard for assessing grounded reasoning in video-language understanding and provides insights toward developing interpretable and reliable multimodal reasoning systems.

### [41] [DashFusion: Dual-stream Alignment with Hierarchical Bottleneck Fusion for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05515)
*Yuhua Wen,Qifei Li,Yingying Zhou,Yingming Gao,Zhengqi Wen,Jianhua Tao,Ya Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DashFusion is a novel multimodal sentiment analysis framework that addresses alignment and fusion challenges through dual-stream alignment (temporal and semantic) and hierarchical bottleneck fusion, achieving state-of-the-art performance with computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal sentiment analysis faces challenges with alignment (temporal and semantic synchronization across modalities) and fusion (integrating aligned features). Existing methods often handle these issues separately, leading to performance and efficiency limitations.

Method: Proposes DashFusion with: 1) Dual-stream alignment module (temporal alignment via cross-modal attention for frame-level correspondences, semantic alignment via contrastive learning for feature space consistency), 2) Supervised contrastive learning to refine modality features, 3) Hierarchical bottleneck fusion that progressively integrates multimodal information through compressed bottleneck tokens.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, and CH-SIMS datasets across various metrics. Ablation studies confirm effectiveness of alignment and fusion techniques. Code is publicly available.

Conclusion: DashFusion effectively addresses multimodal sentiment analysis challenges by jointly handling alignment and fusion, achieving superior performance while maintaining computational efficiency through hierarchical bottleneck fusion.

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) integrates various modalities, such as text, image, and audio, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of sentiment. However, effective MSA is challenged by alignment and fusion issues. Alignment requires synchronizing both temporal and semantic information across modalities, while fusion involves integrating these aligned features into a unified representation. Existing methods often address alignment or fusion in isolation, leading to limitations in performance and efficiency. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel framework called Dual-stream Alignment with Hierarchical Bottleneck Fusion (DashFusion). Firstly, dual-stream alignment module synchronizes multimodal features through temporal and semantic alignment. Temporal alignment employs cross-modal attention to establish frame-level correspondences among multimodal sequences. Semantic alignment ensures consistency across the feature space through contrastive learning. Secondly, supervised contrastive learning leverages label information to refine the modality features. Finally, hierarchical bottleneck fusion progressively integrates multimodal information through compressed bottleneck tokens, which achieves a balance between performance and computational efficiency. We evaluate DashFusion on three datasets: CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, and CH-SIMS. Experimental results demonstrate that DashFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance across various metrics, and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of our alignment and fusion techniques. The codes for our experiments are available at https://github.com/ultramarineX/DashFusion.

*Chinthani Sugandhika,Chen Li,Deepu Rajan,Basura Fernando*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VOST-SGG is a VLM-aided one-stage spatio-temporal scene graph generation framework that integrates vision-language models to address limitations in existing DETR-style approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance on Action Genome.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DETR-style ST-SGG models have two key limitations: (1) semantically uninformed and instance-agnostic learnable query initialization, and (2) reliance on unimodal visual features for predicate classification, lacking semantic grounding and common sense reasoning.

Method: Proposes VOST-SGG with two main innovations: (1) dual-source query initialization strategy that disentangles "what to attend to" from "where to attend" for semantically grounded reasoning, and (2) multi-modal feature bank that fuses visual, textual, and spatial cues from VLMs for improved predicate classification.

Result: Extensive experiments on Action Genome dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of integrating VLM-aided semantic priors and multi-modal features for ST-SGG.

Conclusion: Integrating vision-language models' common sense reasoning capabilities into ST-SGG pipelines addresses key limitations of existing approaches and significantly improves performance through semantically grounded query initialization and multi-modal feature fusion.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal scene graph generation (ST-SGG) aims to model objects and their evolving relationships across video frames, enabling interpretable representations for downstream reasoning tasks such as video captioning and visual question answering. Despite recent advancements in DETR-style single-stage ST-SGG models, they still suffer from several key limitations. First, while these models rely on attention-based learnable queries as a core component, these learnable queries are semantically uninformed and instance-agnostically initialized. Second, these models rely exclusively on unimodal visual features for predicate classification. To address these challenges, we propose VOST-SGG, a VLM-aided one-stage ST-SGG framework that integrates the common sense reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) into the ST-SGG pipeline. First, we introduce the dual-source query initialization strategy that disentangles what to attend to from where to attend, enabling semantically grounded what-where reasoning. Furthermore, we propose a multi-modal feature bank that fuses visual, textual, and spatial cues derived from VLMs for improved predicate classification. Extensive experiments on the Action Genome dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of integrating VLM-aided semantic priors and multi-modal features for ST-SGG.

*Kunyi Yang,Qingyu Wang,Cheng Yuan,Yutong Ban*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DepSeg is a training-free surgical scene segmentation framework that uses monocular depth as geometric prior with vision foundation models, achieving 35.9% mIoU on CholecSeg8k with annotation-efficient approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pixel-wise segmentation of laparoscopic scenes is essential for computer-assisted surgery but difficult to scale due to the high cost of dense annotations. There's a need for annotation-efficient approaches.

Method: Depth-guided surgical scene segmentation (DepSeg) framework: 1) Estimates relative depth map with pretrained monocular depth estimation network, 2) Proposes depth-guided point prompts, 3) SAM2 converts prompts into class-agnostic masks, 4) Each mask described by pooled pretrained visual features, 5) Classification via template matching against template bank built from annotated frames.

Result: On CholecSeg8k dataset: DepSeg achieves 35.9% mIoU vs. 14.7% for direct SAM2 auto segmentation baseline. Maintains competitive performance even when using only 10-20% of object templates.

Conclusion: Depth-guided prompting and template-based classification offer an annotation-efficient segmentation approach for surgical scenes, leveraging geometric priors and foundation models without requiring extensive training.

Abstract: Pixel-wise segmentation of laparoscopic scenes is essential for computer-assisted surgery but difficult to scale due to the high cost of dense annotations. We propose depth-guided surgical scene segmentation (DepSeg), a training-free framework that utilizes monocular depth as a geometric prior together with pretrained vision foundation models. DepSeg first estimates a relative depth map with a pretrained monocular depth estimation network and proposes depth-guided point prompts, which SAM2 converts into class-agnostic masks. Each mask is then described by a pooled pretrained visual feature and classified via template matching against a template bank built from annotated frames. On the CholecSeg8k dataset, DepSeg improves over a direct SAM2 auto segmentation baseline (35.9% vs. 14.7% mIoU) and maintains competitive performance even when using only 10--20% of the object templates. These results show that depth-guided prompting and template-based classification offer an annotation-efficient segmentation approach.

*Swantje Mahncke,Malte Ott*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a Bayesian ideal observer framework for image segmentation using dead leaves models, providing theoretical foundations and computational considerations for principled performance upper bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a principled theoretical framework for studying visual segmentation decisions by creating an ideal observer model that can serve as an upper-bound performance benchmark for comparing human vision and computational algorithms.

Method: Extends previous work on dead leaves models (generative models of overlapping objects) to derive a Bayesian ideal observer for pixel partitioning. Provides detailed step-by-step explanations for computing posterior probabilities and analyzes practical computational feasibility factors.

Result: A theoretical approach for Bayesian ideal observer computation in dead leaves model segmentation, with considerations for practical application feasibility and computational limitations.

Conclusion: The dead leaves image model and associated ideal observer provide a principled upper-bound on segmentation performance that can be used to benchmark human vision and computational algorithms, particularly in limited pixel scenarios.

Abstract: The human visual environment is comprised of different surfaces that are distributed in space. The parts of a scene that are visible at any one time are governed by the occlusion of overlapping objects. In this work we consider "dead leaves" models, which replicate these occlusions when generating images by layering objects on top of each other. A dead leaves model is a generative model comprised of distributions for object position, shape, color and texture. An image is generated from a dead leaves model by sampling objects ("leaves") from these distributions until a stopping criterion is reached, usually when the image is fully covered or until a given number of leaves was sampled. Here, we describe a theoretical approach, based on previous work, to derive a Bayesian ideal observer for the partition of a given set of pixels based on independent dead leaves model distributions. Extending previous work, we provide step-by-step explanations for the computation of the posterior probability as well as describe factors that determine the feasibility of practically applying this computation. The dead leaves image model and the associated ideal observer can be applied to study segmentation decisions in a limited number of pixels, providing a principled upper-bound on performance, to which humans and vision algorithms could be compared.

*Weijue Bu,Guan Yuan,Guixian Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CG-VLM is a training-free inference framework that uses game-theoretic interpretability to detect and correct text inertia in VLMs, reducing object hallucinations by selectively reorienting attention to visual tokens when needed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Vision-Language Models suffer from text inertia where attention drifts from visual evidence to linguistic priors, causing object hallucinations. Existing methods either intervene only at output logits (can't correct internal reasoning) or use heuristic internal controls without principled grounding.

Method: CG-VLM uses a Cognitive Demand Sensor based on Harsanyi interactions to estimate vision-text synergy and detect when visual grounding is needed. A Focused Consensus Induction module then selectively reorients mid-layer attention toward visual tokens before collapse into text priors.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on POPE and CHAIR benchmarks across multiple VLMs (InstructBLIP, LLaVA, Qwen-VL, mPLUG) while preserving general capabilities.

Conclusion: Token-level sensing enables precise, context-aware intervention without compromising foundational knowledge, demonstrating that game-theoretic interpretability can be converted into actionable decoding control.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often exhibit text inertia, where attention drifts from visual evidence toward linguistic priors, resulting in object hallucinations. Existing decoding strategies intervene only at the output logits and thus cannot correct internal reasoning drift, while recent internal-control methods based on heuristic head suppression or global steering vectors lack principled grounding. We introduce Conscious Gaze (CG-VLM), a training-free, inference-time framework that converts game-theoretic interpretability into actionable decoding control. A Cognitive Demand Sensor built on Harsanyi interactions estimates instantaneous vision-text synergy and identifies moments when visual grounding is necessary. Conditioned on this signal, a Focused Consensus Induction module selectively reorients mid-layer attention toward visual tokens before collapse into text priors. CG-VLM achieves state-of-the-art results on POPE and CHAIR across InstructBLIP, LLaVA, Qwen-VL, and mPLUG, while preserving general capabilities, demonstrating that token-level sensing enables precise, context-aware intervention without compromising foundational knowledge.

*Xingxi Yin,Yicheng Li,Gong Yan,Chenglin Li,Jian Zhao,Cong Huang,Yue Deng,Yin Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces 2K-Characters-10K-Stories, a novel dataset for controllable visual storytelling with sequential identity consistency, featuring 2,000 unique stylized characters across 10,000 stories with decoupled control over identity, pose, and expression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack sufficient fidelity and fail to disentangle stable identities from transient attributes, limiting structured control over pose, expression, and scene composition, which constrains reliable sequential synthesis in visual storytelling.

Method: The authors introduce a Human-in-the-Loop pipeline (HiL) with expert-verified character templates and LLM-guided narrative planning. They use a decoupled control scheme separating persistent identity from transient attributes (pose and expression), and implement a Quality-Gated loop with MMLM evaluation, Auto-Prompt Tuning, and Local Image Editing for pixel-level consistency.

Result: The dataset contains 2,000 uniquely stylized characters across 10,000 illustration stories. Models fine-tuned on this dataset achieve performance comparable to closed-source models in generating visual narratives, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach.

Conclusion: The proposed dataset and pipeline successfully address the challenge of sequential identity consistency in controllable visual storytelling by providing large-scale unique identities with explicit, decoupled control signals, enabling reliable sequential synthesis with structured control over identity, pose, and expression.

Abstract: Sequential identity consistency under precise transient attribute control remains a long-standing challenge in controllable visual storytelling. Existing datasets lack sufficient fidelity and fail to disentangle stable identities from transient attributes, limiting structured control over pose, expression, and scene composition and thus constraining reliable sequential synthesis. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{2K-Characters-10K-Stories}, a multi-modal stylized narrative dataset of \textbf{2{,}000} uniquely stylized characters appearing across \textbf{10{,}000} illustration stories. It is the first dataset that pairs large-scale unique identities with explicit, decoupled control signals for sequential identity consistency. We introduce a \textbf{Human-in-the-Loop pipeline (HiL)} that leverages expert-verified character templates and LLM-guided narrative planning to generate highly-aligned structured data. A \textbf{decoupled control} scheme separates persistent identity from transient attributes -- pose and expression -- while a \textbf{Quality-Gated loop} integrating MMLM evaluation, Auto-Prompt Tuning, and Local Image Editing enforces pixel-level consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models fine-tuned on our dataset achieves performance comparable to closed-source models in generating visual narratives.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProPhy is a Progressive Physical Alignment Framework that improves video generation by explicitly modeling physics through a two-stage Mixture-of-Physics-Experts mechanism, enabling more physically consistent and realistic dynamic content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation models struggle with physical consistency, especially for large-scale or complex dynamics, because they respond isotropically to physical prompts and lack fine-grained alignment between generated content and localized physical cues.

Method: ProPhy uses a two-stage Mixture-of-Physics-Experts (MoPE) mechanism: Semantic Experts infer semantic-level physical principles from text, and Refinement Experts capture token-level physical dynamics. It also employs a physical alignment strategy to transfer physical reasoning capabilities from vision-language models into the Refinement Experts.

Result: Extensive experiments on physics-aware video generation benchmarks show that ProPhy produces more realistic, dynamic, and physically coherent results than existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: ProPhy successfully addresses the physical consistency limitations in video generation through explicit physics-aware conditioning and anisotropic generation, enabling better world simulation capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have shown remarkable potential for constructing world simulators. However, current models still struggle to produce physically consistent results, particularly when handling large-scale or complex dynamics. This limitation arises primarily because existing approaches respond isotropically to physical prompts and neglect the fine-grained alignment between generated content and localized physical cues. To address these challenges, we propose ProPhy, a Progressive Physical Alignment Framework that enables explicit physics-aware conditioning and anisotropic generation. ProPhy employs a two-stage Mixture-of-Physics-Experts (MoPE) mechanism for discriminative physical prior extraction, where Semantic Experts infer semantic-level physical principles from textual descriptions, and Refinement Experts capture token-level physical dynamics. This mechanism allows the model to learn fine-grained, physics-aware video representations that better reflect underlying physical laws. Furthermore, we introduce a physical alignment strategy that transfers the physical reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) into the Refinement Experts, facilitating a more accurate representation of dynamic physical phenomena. Extensive experiments on physics-aware video generation benchmarks demonstrate that ProPhy produces more realistic, dynamic, and physically coherent results than existing state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: MedDIFT is a training-free 3D medical image registration framework that uses features from pretrained diffusion models as voxel descriptors, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy without task-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional medical image registration methods rely on local intensity-based similarity measures that fail to capture global semantic structure and perform poorly in low-contrast or anatomically variable regions, limiting their accuracy for longitudinal analysis and lesion tracking.

Method: MedDIFT extracts multi-scale features from a pretrained latent medical diffusion model and fuses them into rich voxel-wise descriptors. Correspondence is established via cosine similarity matching with an optional local-search prior, requiring no task-specific training.

Result: On lung CT datasets, MedDIFT achieves correspondence accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art learning-based UniGradICON and surpasses conventional B-spline-based registration. Ablation studies show multi-level feature fusion and modest diffusion noise improve performance.

Conclusion: Pretrained diffusion models encode rich geometric and semantic information that can be effectively leveraged for medical image registration without additional training, offering a powerful training-free alternative to conventional and learning-based methods.

Abstract: Accurate spatial correspondence between medical images is essential for longitudinal analysis, lesion tracking, and image-guided interventions. Medical image registration methods rely on local intensity-based similarity measures, which fail to capture global semantic structure and often yield mismatches in low-contrast or anatomically variable regions. Recent advances in diffusion models suggest that their intermediate representations encode rich geometric and semantic information. We present MedDIFT, a training-free 3D correspondence framework that leverages multi-scale features from a pretrained latent medical diffusion model as voxel descriptors. MedDIFT fuses diffusion activations into rich voxel-wise descriptors and matches them via cosine similarity, with an optional local-search prior. On a publicly available lung CT dataset, MedDIFT achieves correspondence accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art learning-based UniGradICON model and surpasses conventional B-spline-based registration, without requiring any task-specific model training. Ablation experiments confirm that multi-level feature fusion and modest diffusion noise improve performance.

*Rong Wang,Wei Mao,Changsheng Lu,Hongdong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A skinning-free method for 3D garment animation that decouples low-frequency shape and high-frequency wrinkles, using 2D image transfer with pretrained models for superior wrinkle detail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing skinning-based methods produce misaligned shapes when posing garments, which corrupts high-frequency signals and fails to recover high-fidelity wrinkles needed for realistic virtual try-on and extended reality applications.

Method: Proposes a skinning-free approach that independently estimates vertex positions (low-frequency shape) and vertex normals (high-frequency wrinkles). Encodes both as rendered texture images for 2D image transfer using pretrained models, then uses multimodal fusion to recover deformed 3D garments.

Result: Extensive experiments show significant improvement in animation quality across various garment types, recovering finer wrinkles than state-of-the-art methods while maintaining scalability for diverse garment topologies.

Conclusion: The skinning-free approach with frequency decoupling and 2D image transfer enables high-fidelity 3D garment animation with superior wrinkle detail, outperforming existing methods without requiring manual UV partitioning.

Abstract: We present a novel method for generating 3D garment deformations from given body poses, which is key to a wide range of applications, including virtual try-on and extended reality. To simplify the cloth dynamics, existing methods mostly rely on linear blend skinning to obtain low-frequency posed garment shape and only regress high-frequency wrinkles. However, due to the lack of explicit skinning supervision, such skinning-based approach often produces misaligned shapes when posing the garment, consequently corrupts the high-frequency signals and fails to recover high-fidelity wrinkles. To tackle this issue, we propose a skinning-free approach by independently estimating posed (i) vertex position for low-frequency posed garment shape, and (ii) vertex normal for high-frequency local wrinkle details. In this way, each frequency modality can be effectively decoupled and directly supervised by the geometry of the deformed garment. To further improve the visual quality of animation, we propose to encode both vertex attributes as rendered texture images, so that 3D garment deformation can be equivalently achieved via 2D image transfer. This enables us to leverage powerful pretrained image models to recover fine-grained visual details in wrinkles, while maintaining superior scalability for garments of diverse topologies without relying on manual UV partition. Finally, we propose a multimodal fusion to incorporate constraints from both frequency modalities and robustly recover deformed 3D garments from transferred images. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly improves animation quality on various garment types and recovers finer wrinkles than state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: Fast SceneScript: A structured language model for 3D scene layout estimation that uses multi-token prediction and confidence-guided decoding to achieve 9x faster inference without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current perception-generalist approaches using language models achieve SOTA results but rely on slow autoregressive next-token prediction. Need for faster inference while maintaining accuracy in 3D scene layout estimation.

Method: 1) Multi-token prediction (MTP) reduces autoregressive iterations; 2) Adapt self-speculative decoding (SSD) for structured language models; 3) Confidence-guided decoding (CGD) with improved scoring for token reliability; 4) Parameter-efficient mechanism to reduce MTP overhead.

Result: Generates up to 9 tokens per decoder inference step without compromising accuracy, with only ~7.5% additional parameters. Validated on ASE and Structured3D benchmarks.

Conclusion: Fast SceneScript enables efficient and accurate 3D scene layout estimation by combining multi-token prediction with reliability filtering, achieving significant speed improvements while maintaining state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Recent perception-generalist approaches based on language models have achieved state-of-the-art results across diverse tasks, including 3D scene layout estimation, via unified architecture and interface. However, these approaches rely on autoregressive next-token prediction, which is inherently slow. In this work, we introduce Fast SceneScript, a novel structured language model for accurate and efficient 3D scene layout estimation. Our method employs multi-token prediction (MTP) to reduce the number of autoregressive iterations and significantly accelerate inference. While MTP improves speed, unreliable token predictions can significantly reduce accuracy. To filter out unreliable tokens, we adapt self-speculative decoding (SSD) for structured language models and introduce confidence-guided decoding (CGD) with an improved scoring mechanism for token reliability. Furthermore, we design a parameter-efficient mechanism that reduces the parameter overhead of MTP. Extensive experiments on the ASE and Structured3D benchmarks demonstrate that Fast SceneScript can generate up to 9 tokens per decoder inference step without compromising accuracy, while adding only $\sim7.5\%$ additional parameters.

TL;DR: NormalView: A sensor-agnostic projection-based deep learning method for tree species classification from point cloud data using normal vector projections and YOLOv11 image classification network.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile laser scanning (MLS) shows promise for accurate tree-level inventory, but there's a need for effective tree species classification methods that work across different sensor types and can leverage both geometric and multispectral information.

Method: NormalView embeds local geometric information (normal vector estimates) into 2D projections and uses these as inputs to YOLOv11 image classification network. The method is sensor-agnostic and tested with both MLS and ALS data, including evaluation of multispectral intensity information effects.

Result: Achieved 95.5% overall accuracy (94.8% macro-average) on MLS data (7 species) and 91.8% (79.1% macro-average) on ALS data (9 species). Multispectral intensity information from all three channels provided the best performance on ALS data.

Conclusion: Projection-based methods enhanced with geometric information and state-of-the-art image classification backbones can achieve exceptional results for tree species classification. These methods are sensor-agnostic and rely only on geometric information, with multispectral intensity providing additional benefits.

Abstract: Laser scanning has proven to be an invaluable tool in assessing the decomposition of forest environments. Mobile laser scanning (MLS) has shown to be highly promising for extremely accurate, tree level inventory. In this study, we present NormalView, a sensor-agnostic projection-based deep learning method for classifying tree species from point cloud data. NormalView embeds local geometric information into two-dimensional projections, in the form of normal vector estimates, and uses the projections as inputs to an image classification network, YOLOv11. In addition, we inspected the effect of multispectral radiometric intensity information on classification performance. We trained and tested our model on high-density MLS data (7 species, ~5000 pts/m^2), as well as high-density airborne laser scanning (ALS) data (9 species, >1000 pts/m^2). On the MLS data, NormalView achieves an overall accuracy (macro-average accuracy) of 95.5 % (94.8 %), and 91.8 % (79.1 %) on the ALS data. We found that having intensity information from multiple scanners provides benefits in tree species classification, and the best model on the multispectral ALS dataset was a model using intensity information from all three channels of the multispectral ALS. This study demonstrates that projection-based methods, when enhanced with geometric information and coupled with state-of-the-art image classification backbones, can achieve exceptional results. Crucially, these methods are sensor-agnostic, relying only on geometric information. Additionally, we publically release the MLS dataset used in the study.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard episodic methods for Cross-Domain Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation are unreliable and computationally demanding due to substantial domain shifts, disjoint label spaces, and scarce support images.

Method: Teacher-student distillation framework that embeds support-set knowledge into model parameters through a dedicated layer, eliminating need for support images at test time.

Result: Matches or surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, especially in multi-class and multi-shot scenarios, with substantial efficiency gains on new CD-FSS benchmark spanning medical, industrial, and remote sensing domains.

Conclusion: DistillFSS provides an efficient, scalable solution for CD-FSS that internalizes few-shot reasoning into model parameters, enabling fast inference while maintaining strong performance across diverse domains.

Abstract: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation (CD-FSS) seeks to segment unknown classes in unseen domains using only a few annotated examples. This setting is inherently challenging: source and target domains exhibit substantial distribution shifts, label spaces are disjoint, and support images are scarce--making standard episodic methods unreliable and computationally demanding at test time. To address these constraints, we propose DistillFSS, a framework that embeds support-set knowledge directly into a model's parameters through a teacher--student distillation process. By internalizing few-shot reasoning into a dedicated layer within the student network, DistillFSS eliminates the need for support images at test time, enabling fast, lightweight inference, while allowing efficient extension to novel classes in unseen domains through rapid teacher-driven specialization. Combined with fine-tuning, the approach scales efficiently to large support sets and significantly reduces computational overhead. To evaluate the framework under realistic conditions, we introduce a new CD-FSS benchmark spanning medical imaging, industrial inspection, and remote sensing, with disjoint label spaces and variable support sizes. Experiments show that DistillFSS matches or surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in multi-class and multi-shot scenarios, while offering substantial efficiency gains.

TL;DR: Unsupervised ISP training framework using Unbalanced Optimal Transport that works with both paired and unpaired data, achieving state-of-the-art performance without costly paired datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current learned ISP pipelines require large-scale paired raw-to-sRGB datasets which are expensive to acquire, creating a significant bottleneck for practical deployment.

Method: Novel unsupervised training framework based on Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) with a "committee of expert discriminators" - a hybrid adversarial regularizer that provides specialized gradients to correct specific ISP failure modes like color fidelity, structural artifacts, and frequency-domain realism.

Result: When trained in paired mode, the framework exceeds original paired methods across all metrics. In unpaired mode, it achieves performance that rivals and sometimes surpasses original paired-trained counterparts, demonstrating robustness to outliers in target sRGB data.

Conclusion: The UOT-based framework successfully addresses the paired data bottleneck for ISP training, enabling high-performance ISP development with both paired and unpaired data while being robust to atypical samples.

Abstract: Learned Image Signal Processing (ISP) pipelines offer powerful end-to-end performance but are critically dependent on large-scale paired raw-to-sRGB datasets. This reliance on costly-to-acquire paired data remains a significant bottleneck. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel, unsupervised training framework based on Optimal Transport capable of training arbitrary ISP architectures in both unpaired and paired modes. We are the first to successfully apply Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) for this complex, cross-domain translation task. Our UOT-based framework provides robustness to outliers in the target sRGB data, allowing it to discount atypical samples that would be prohibitively costly to map. A key component of our framework is a novel ``committee of expert discriminators,'' a hybrid adversarial regularizer. This committee guides the optimal transport mapping by providing specialized, targeted gradients to correct specific ISP failure modes, including color fidelity, structural artifacts, and frequency-domain realism. To demonstrate the superiority of our approach, we retrained existing state-of-the-art ISP architectures using our paired and unpaired setups. Our experiments show that while our framework, when trained in paired mode, exceeds the performance of the original paired methods across all metrics, our unpaired mode concurrently achieves quantitative and qualitative performance that rivals, and in some cases surpasses, the original paired-trained counterparts.

TL;DR: Self-supervised EXIF-based detector for AI-generated images using camera metadata features, achieving state-of-the-art cross-model generalization and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI-generated image detectors rely on assumptions about specific generative models, limiting cross-model applicability. There's a need for more generalizable detectors that can work across different AI models and handle real-world scenarios.

Method: Self-supervised approach using EXIF camera metadata. Pretext task trains feature extractor on camera-captured photos by classifying categorical EXIF tags (camera model, scene type) and pairwise-ranking ordinal/continuous tags (focal length, aperture). Uses EXIF-induced features for one-class detection via Gaussian mixture modeling, and extends to binary detection with the learned extractor as regularizer for classifier on high-frequency residuals from spatially scrambled patches.

Result: Extensive experiments show EXIF-induced detectors substantially advance state-of-the-art, delivering strong generalization to in-the-wild samples and robustness to common benign image perturbations across various generative models.

Conclusion: Camera metadata (EXIF tags) provides effective features for detecting AI-generated images through self-supervised learning, enabling cross-model applicability and real-world robustness without dependence on specific generative model internals.

Abstract: The proliferation of AI-generated imagery poses escalating challenges for multimedia forensics, yet many existing detectors depend on assumptions about the internals of specific generative models, limiting their cross-model applicability. We introduce a self-supervised approach for detecting AI-generated images that leverages camera metadata -- specifically exchangeable image file format (EXIF) tags -- to learn features intrinsic to digital photography. Our pretext task trains a feature extractor solely on camera-captured photographs by classifying categorical EXIF tags (\eg, camera model and scene type) and pairwise-ranking ordinal and continuous EXIF tags (\eg, focal length and aperture value). Using these EXIF-induced features, we first perform one-class detection by modeling the distribution of photographic images with a Gaussian mixture model and flagging low-likelihood samples as AI-generated. We then extend to binary detection that treats the learned extractor as a strong regularizer for a classifier of the same architecture, operating on high-frequency residuals from spatially scrambled patches. Extensive experiments across various generative models demonstrate that our EXIF-induced detectors substantially advance the state of the art, delivering strong generalization to in-the-wild samples and robustness to common benign image perturbations.

TL;DR: LeAD-M3D is a real-time monocular 3D object detector that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy without LiDAR or geometric priors, using three novel components: A2D2 for depth reasoning, CM3D for better supervision matching, and CGI3D for efficient inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time monocular 3D object detection faces challenges with depth ambiguity, viewpoint shifts, and high computational cost. Existing methods either rely on LiDAR/geometric priors or sacrifice efficiency for accuracy.

Method: Three key components: 1) Asymmetric Augmentation Denoising Distillation (A2D2) transfers geometric knowledge from teacher to student via quality-weighted depth-feature loss; 2) 3D-aware Consistent Matching (CM3D) improves prediction-to-ground truth assignment using 3D MGIoU; 3) Confidence-Gated 3D Inference (CGI3D) accelerates detection by restricting expensive 3D regression to high-confidence regions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on KITTI and Waymo, best reported car AP on Rope3D, while running up to 3.6x faster than prior high-accuracy methods. Sets new Pareto frontier for monocular 3D detection.

Conclusion: High fidelity and real-time efficiency in monocular 3D detection are simultaneously attainable without LiDAR, stereo, or geometric assumptions, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Real-time monocular 3D object detection remains challenging due to severe depth ambiguity, viewpoint shifts, and the high computational cost of 3D reasoning. Existing approaches either rely on LiDAR or geometric priors to compensate for missing depth, or sacrifice efficiency to achieve competitive accuracy. We introduce LeAD-M3D, a monocular 3D detector that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and real-time inference without extra modalities. Our method is powered by three key components. Asymmetric Augmentation Denoising Distillation (A2D2) transfers geometric knowledge from a clean-image teacher to a mixup-noised student via a quality- and importance-weighted depth-feature loss, enabling stronger depth reasoning without LiDAR supervision. 3D-aware Consistent Matching (CM3D) improves prediction-to-ground truth assignment by integrating 3D MGIoU into the matching score, yielding more stable and precise supervision. Finally, Confidence-Gated 3D Inference (CGI3D) accelerates detection by restricting expensive 3D regression to top-confidence regions. Together, these components set a new Pareto frontier for monocular 3D detection: LeAD-M3D achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on KITTI and Waymo, and the best reported car AP on Rope3D, while running up to 3.6x faster than prior high-accuracy methods. Our results demonstrate that high fidelity and real-time efficiency in monocular 3D detection are simultaneously attainable - without LiDAR, stereo, or geometric assumptions.

Conclusion: InverseCrafter provides an efficient alternative to fine-tuning-based approaches for 4D video generation, maintaining generative priors while enabling controllable generation and editing with minimal computational cost.

Abstract: Recent approaches to controllable 4D video generation often rely on fine-tuning pre-trained Video Diffusion Models (VDMs). This dominant paradigm is computationally expensive, requiring large-scale datasets and architectural modifications, and frequently suffers from catastrophic forgetting of the model's original generative priors. Here, we propose InverseCrafter, an efficient inpainting inverse solver that reformulates the 4D generation task as an inpainting problem solved in the latent space.

TL;DR: 3D-CSCNet: An autoencoder-based network using 3D convolutional sparse coding for hyperspectral unmixing, combining algorithm unrolling with endmember initialization via PSVM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve hyperspectral unmixing by jointly learning spectral and spatial relationships in 3D HSI data cubes, overcoming limitations of existing unrolling-based networks by integrating them within the powerful autoencoder framework.

Method: Proposes 3D-CSCNet built on 3D convolutional sparse coding model within autoencoder framework. Uses 3D-CSC blocks derived through deep algorithm unrolling to estimate abundance matrix, then reconstructs HSI via AE decoder to extract endmembers. Initializes decoder weights using PSVM algorithm for endmember estimation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three real datasets and one simulated dataset with three different SNR levels, demonstrating superior performance in hyperspectral unmixing tasks.

Conclusion: 3D-CSCNet effectively integrates algorithm unrolling with autoencoder framework for hyperspectral unmixing, enabling joint learning of spectral-spatial relationships and achieving state-of-the-art performance through proper endmember initialization.

Abstract: Hyperspectral unmixing (HSU) aims to separate each pixel into its constituent endmembers and estimate their corresponding abundance fractions. This work presents an algorithm-unrolling-based network for the HSU task, named the 3D Convolutional Sparse Coding Network (3D-CSCNet), built upon a 3D CSC model. Unlike existing unrolling-based networks, our 3D-CSCNet is designed within the powerful autoencoder (AE) framework. Specifically, to solve the 3D CSC problem, we propose a 3D CSC block (3D-CSCB) derived through deep algorithm unrolling. Given a hyperspectral image (HSI), 3D-CSCNet employs the 3D-CSCB to estimate the abundance matrix. The use of 3D CSC enables joint learning of spectral and spatial relationships in the 3D HSI data cube. The estimated abundance matrix is then passed to the AE decoder to reconstruct the HSI, and the decoder weights are extracted as the endmember matrix. Additionally, we propose a projected simplex volume maximization (PSVM) algorithm for endmember estimation, and the resulting endmembers are used to initialize the decoder weights of 3D-CSCNet. Extensive experiments on three real datasets and one simulated dataset with three different signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels demonstrate that our 3D-CSCNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optical aberrations degrade microscopy image quality, especially in deep imaging. Existing methods treat the problem as black-box mapping without leveraging optical physics, and only handle mild aberrations on limited sample types.

Method: Proposes ZRNet with two key components: 1) Zernike Graph module that explicitly models physical relationships between Zernike polynomials based on azimuthal degrees, and 2) Frequency-Aware Alignment (FAA) loss that aligns Zernike coefficient prediction and image features in Fourier domain for physical consistency.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in both image restoration and Zernike coefficient prediction across diverse microscopy modalities and biological samples with complex, large-amplitude aberrations on CytoImageNet dataset.

Conclusion: ZRNet successfully integrates optical physics principles into deep learning for aberration correction, providing physically consistent solutions that outperform existing methods for challenging microscopy imaging scenarios.

Abstract: Optical aberrations significantly degrade image quality in microscopy, particularly when imaging deeper into samples. These aberrations arise from distortions in the optical wavefront and can be mathematically represented using Zernike polynomials. Existing methods often address only mild aberrations on limited sample types and modalities, typically treating the problem as a black-box mapping without leveraging the underlying optical physics of wavefront distortions. We propose ZRNet, a physics-informed framework that jointly performs Zernike coefficient prediction and optical image Restoration. We contribute a Zernike Graph module that explicitly models physical relationships between Zernike polynomials based on their azimuthal degrees-ensuring that learned corrections align with fundamental optical principles. To further enforce physical consistency between image restoration and Zernike prediction, we introduce a Frequency-Aware Alignment (FAA) loss, which better aligns Zernike coefficient prediction and image features in the Fourier domain. Extensive experiments on CytoImageNet demonstrates that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both image restoration and Zernike coefficient prediction across diverse microscopy modalities and biological samples with complex, large-amplitude aberrations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unsupervised 3D object detection methods rely on self-training with pseudo-labels, but initial pseudo-labels are often incorrect, misleading optimization and making effective filtering/refinement challenging.

Method: 1) Occupancy Guided Warm-up (OGW) - initializes backbone with spatial perception to mitigate incorrect pseudo-label interference. 2) Instance-Cued Reasoning (ICR) - uses large-model priors to assess pseudo-label quality for filtering/refinement. 3) Weight-adapted Self-training (WAS) - dynamically re-weights pseudo-labels during self-training.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods by over 15.0% mAP on Waymo Open Dataset and KITTI.

Conclusion: OWL effectively addresses pseudo-label quality issues in unsupervised 3D object detection through occupancy-guided warm-up and large-model priors, demonstrating significant performance improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Unsupervised 3D object detection leverages heuristic algorithms to discover potential objects, offering a promising route to reduce annotation costs in autonomous driving. Existing approaches mainly generate pseudo labels and refine them through self-training iterations. However, these pseudo-labels are often incorrect at the beginning of training, resulting in misleading the optimization process. Moreover, effectively filtering and refining them remains a critical challenge. In this paper, we propose OWL for unsupervised 3D object detection by occupancy guided warm-up and large-model priors reasoning. OWL first employs an Occupancy Guided Warm-up (OGW) strategy to initialize the backbone weight with spatial perception capabilities, mitigating the interference of incorrect pseudo-labels on network convergence. Furthermore, OWL introduces an Instance-Cued Reasoning (ICR) module that leverages the prior knowledge of large models to assess pseudo-label quality, enabling precise filtering and refinement. Finally, we design a Weight-adapted Self-training (WAS) strategy to dynamically re-weight pseudo-labels, improving the performance through self-training. Extensive experiments on Waymo Open Dataset (WOD) and KITTI demonstrate that OWL outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods by over 15.0% mAP, revealing the effectiveness of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing point cloud completion methods rely on Euclidean proximity and overlook intrinsic nonlinear geometric structure, leading to suboptimal geometric consistency and semantic ambiguity in reconstructed shapes.

Method: Introduces a manifold-aware framework with two key modules: Geodesic Distance Approximator (GDA) to estimate geodesic distances capturing latent manifold topology, and Manifold-Aware Feature Extractor (MAFE) using geodesic-based k-NN groupings and geodesic-relational attention for hierarchical feature extraction.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate consistent outperformance over state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction quality.

Conclusion: The proposed manifold-aware approach effectively incorporates nonlinear geometry information throughout the feature learning pipeline, promoting semantic coherence and structural fidelity in point cloud completion.

Abstract: Point cloud completion seeks to recover geometrically consistent shapes from partial or sparse 3D observations. Although recent methods have achieved reasonable global shape reconstruction, they often rely on Euclidean proximity and overlook the intrinsic nonlinear geometric structure of point clouds, resulting in suboptimal geometric consistency and semantic ambiguity. In this paper, we present a manifold-aware point cloud completion framework that explicitly incorporates nonlinear geometry information throughout the feature learning pipeline. Our approach introduces two key modules: a Geodesic Distance Approximator (GDA), which estimates geodesic distances between points to capture the latent manifold topology, and a Manifold-Aware Feature Extractor (MAFE), which utilizes geodesic-based $k$-NN groupings and a geodesic-relational attention mechanism to guide the hierarchical feature extraction process. By integrating geodesic-aware relational attention, our method promotes semantic coherence and structural fidelity in the reconstructed point clouds. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs lack domain-specific surgical scene understanding capabilities and pose privacy risks when patient data is sent to external servers. Need for locally deployable models to avoid data leakage while maintaining surgical domain expertise.

Method: Generate expert-supervised dataset by prompting teacher LLM using only textual context and binary segmentation masks (no sensitive images). Use this dataset for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and subsequent Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) of locally deployable VLM.

Result: Finetuning VLMs with generated datasets significantly increases surgical domain knowledge compared to base VLM. Framework provides data-efficient and privacy-conforming way to train surgical domain optimized VLM.

Conclusion: Validates effective approach for creating locally deployable VLMs with enhanced surgical scene understanding while maintaining patient data privacy through knowledge distillation from large LLMs.

Abstract: Recently, Vision Large Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated high potential in computer-aided diagnosis and decision-support. However, current VLMs show deficits in domain specific surgical scene understanding, such as identifying and explaining anatomical landmarks during Complete Mesocolic Excision. Additionally, there is a need for locally deployable models to avoid patient data leakage to large VLMs, hosted outside the clinic. We propose a privacy-preserving framework to distill knowledge from large, general-purpose LLMs into an efficient, local VLM. We generate an expert-supervised dataset by prompting a teacher LLM without sensitive images, using only textual context and binary segmentation masks for spatial information. This dataset is used for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and subsequent Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) of the locally deployable VLM. Our evaluation confirms that finetuning VLMs with our generated datasets increases surgical domain knowledge compared to its base VLM by a large margin. Overall, this work validates a data-efficient and privacy-conforming way to train a surgical domain optimized, locally deployable VLM for surgical scene understanding.

Conclusion: HQ-DM effectively addresses activation outlier issues in diffusion model quantization, enabling efficient low-bit deployment with significant performance improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated significant applications in the field of image generation. However, their high computational and memory costs pose challenges for deployment. Model quantization has emerged as a promising solution to reduce storage overhead and accelerate inference. Nevertheless, existing quantization methods for diffusion models struggle to mitigate outliers in activation matrices during inference, leading to substantial performance degradation under low-bit quantization scenarios. To address this, we propose HQ-DM, a novel Quantization-Aware Training framework that applies Single Hadamard Transformation to activation matrices. This approach effectively reduces activation outliers while preserving model performance under quantization. Compared to traditional Double Hadamard Transformation, our proposed scheme offers distinct advantages by seamlessly supporting INT convolution operations while preventing the amplification of weight outliers. For conditional generation on the ImageNet 256x256 dataset using the LDM-4 model, our W4A4 and W4A3 quantization schemes improve the Inception Score by 12.8% and 467.73%, respectively, over the existing state-of-the-art method.

TL;DR: USV is a unified framework that jointly optimizes sparsification across attention computation and denoising steps in video diffusion models, achieving significant speedups while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video diffusion models face scalability issues due to quadratic complexity of global spatio-temporal attention and computational overhead of long iterative denoising. Existing accelerators target single dimensions in isolation, leading to diminishing returns as other bottlenecks dominate.

Method: USV is an end-to-end trainable framework that learns a dynamic, data- and timestep-dependent sparsification policy. It jointly prunes redundant attention connections, adaptively merges semantically similar tokens, and reduces denoising steps, treating them as coordinated actions within a single optimization objective.

Result: Extensive experiments show USV achieves up to 83.3% speedup in denoising process and 22.7% end-to-end acceleration while maintaining high visual fidelity on large-scale video generation benchmarks.

Conclusion: Unified, dynamic sparsification provides a practical path toward efficient, high-quality video generation by enabling strong mutual reinforcement among previously disjoint acceleration strategies.

Abstract: The scalability of high-fidelity video diffusion models (VDMs) is constrained by two key sources of redundancy: the quadratic complexity of global spatio-temporal attention and the computational overhead of long iterative denoising trajectories. Existing accelerators -- such as sparse attention and step-distilled samplers -- typically target a single dimension in isolation and quickly encounter diminishing returns, as the remaining bottlenecks become dominant. In this work, we introduce USV (Unified Sparsification for Video diffusion models), an end-to-end trainable framework that overcomes this limitation by jointly orchestrating sparsification across both the model's internal computation and its sampling process. USV learns a dynamic, data- and timestep-dependent sparsification policy that prunes redundant attention connections, adaptively merges semantically similar tokens, and reduces denoising steps, treating them not as independent tricks but as coordinated actions within a single optimization objective. This multi-dimensional co-design enables strong mutual reinforcement among previously disjoint acceleration strategies. Extensive experiments on large-scale video generation benchmarks demonstrate that USV achieves up to 83.3% speedup in the denoising process and 22.7% end-to-end acceleration, while maintaining high visual fidelity. Our results highlight unified, dynamic sparsification as a practical path toward efficient, high-quality video generation.

TL;DR: A simple active learning method for 3D point cloud segmentation using 2D grid subdivision and network ensemble uncertainty estimation, achieving state-of-the-art performance with lower annotation costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic segmentation of 3D point clouds requires expensive manual annotation. Active learning can reduce annotation costs by selecting the most informative data to label, but existing methods use complex heuristics for region splitting and selection.

Method: Proposes a simple strategy: 1) Use a 2D grid to subdivide point clouds into columns as annotatable regions, 2) Employ a network ensemble to estimate prediction uncertainty for selecting the most uncertain regions to annotate next.

Result: Evaluated on S3DIS, Toronto-3D, and a manually labeled Freiburg urban dataset. The method achieves performance on par with or better than complex state-of-the-art methods across all datasets. Also suggests annotated area is more meaningful than annotated point count for point cloud active learning.

Conclusion: A simple, easy-to-implement active learning approach for 3D point cloud segmentation can match or exceed complex state-of-the-art methods while reducing annotation costs, and the annotated area metric is more appropriate than point count for evaluating such systems.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of 3D point cloud data often comes with high annotation costs. Active learning automates the process of selecting which data to annotate, reducing the total amount of annotation needed to achieve satisfactory performance. Recent approaches to active learning for 3D point clouds are often based on sophisticated heuristics for both, splitting point clouds into annotatable regions and selecting the most beneficial for further neural network training. In this work, we propose a novel and easy-to-implement strategy to separate the point cloud into annotatable regions. In our approach, we utilize a 2D grid to subdivide the point cloud into columns. To identify the next data to be annotated, we employ a network ensemble to estimate the uncertainty in the network output. We evaluate our method on the S3DIS dataset, the Toronto-3D dataset, and a large-scale urban 3D point cloud of the city of Freiburg, which we labeled in parts manually. The extensive evaluation shows that our method yields performance on par with, or even better than, complex state-of-the-art methods on all datasets. Furthermore, we provide results suggesting that in the context of point clouds the annotated area can be a more meaningful measure for active learning algorithms than the number of annotated points.

TL;DR: FNOpt is a self-supervised cloth simulation framework that uses Fourier neural operator-based meta-optimization to simulate cloth dynamics across resolutions without retraining, outperforming prior learning-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior neural cloth simulators have limitations: they require extensive ground truth data, sacrifice fine-scale details, and generalize poorly across different mesh resolutions and motion patterns. There's a need for a more robust, resolution-agnostic approach that doesn't rely on curated data.

Method: FNOpt formulates time integration as an optimization problem and trains a resolution-agnostic neural optimizer parameterized by a Fourier neural operator (FNO). It's trained only on coarse grids using physics-based losses in a self-supervised manner, without requiring ground truth data.

Result: FNOpt achieves stable and accurate rollouts across diverse mesh resolutions and motion patterns without retraining. It captures fine-scale wrinkles and preserves rollout stability while generalizing to finer resolutions than trained on. It outperforms prior learning-based approaches in out-of-distribution settings in both accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: FNO-based meta-optimization presents a compelling alternative to previous neural simulators for cloth, reducing the need for curated data and improving cross-resolution reliability while maintaining physical plausibility and detail preservation.

Abstract: We present FNOpt, a self-supervised cloth simulation framework that formulates time integration as an optimization problem and trains a resolution-agnostic neural optimizer parameterized by a Fourier neural operator (FNO).

TL;DR: AVP is an active video perception framework that uses MLLM agents to iteratively plan, observe, and reflect on video content, focusing only on query-relevant evidence to efficiently solve long video understanding tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video understanding methods waste computation on irrelevant content and lose fine-grained information by using query-agnostic captioners. Inspired by active perception theory, the authors argue that agents should actively decide what, when, and where to observe in videos.

Method: AVP uses MLLM agents in an iterative plan-observe-reflect process: planner proposes targeted video interactions, observer executes them to extract time-stamped evidence, and reflector evaluates evidence sufficiency, either halting with answer or triggering further observation.

Result: AVP achieves state-of-the-art performance across five long video understanding benchmarks, outperforming the best agentic method by 5.7% average accuracy while requiring only 18.4% inference time and 12.4% input tokens.

Conclusion: The active perception approach enables efficient long video understanding by focusing computational resources on query-relevant evidence, significantly reducing processing requirements while improving accuracy.

Abstract: Long video understanding (LVU) is challenging because answering real-world queries often depends on sparse, temporally dispersed cues buried in hours of mostly redundant and irrelevant content. While agentic pipelines improve video reasoning capabilities, prevailing frameworks rely on a query-agnostic captioner to perceive video information, which wastes computation on irrelevant content and blurs fine-grained temporal and spatial information. Motivated by active perception theory, we argue that LVU agents should actively decide what, when, and where to observe, and continuously assess whether the current observation is sufficient to answer the query. We present Active Video Perception (AVP), an evidence-seeking framework that treats the video as an interactive environment and acquires compact, queryrelevant evidence directly from pixels. Concretely, AVP runs an iterative plan-observe-reflect process with MLLM agents. In each round, a planner proposes targeted video interactions, an observer executes them to extract time-stamped evidence, and a reflector evaluates the sufficiency of the evidence for the query, either halting with an answer or triggering further observation. Across five LVU benchmarks, AVP achieves highest performance with significant improvements. Notably, AVP outperforms the best agentic method by 5.7% in average accuracy while only requires 18.4% inference time and 12.4% input tokens.

*Maryam Yousefi,Soodeh Bakhshandeh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Curvature regularization via discrete Laplacian improves 3D reconstruction from sparse (5%) depth measurements by 18.1% over standard VAEs, challenging the assumption that multiple geometric constraints are needed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse depth measurements (only 5% of needed data) make complete 3D scene reconstruction difficult, and autonomous systems cannot tolerate the geometric errors introduced by sparse reconstruction methods.

Method: Proposes curvature regularization through a discrete Laplacian operator for 3D reconstruction, which provides stable gradients and noise suppression with only 15% training overhead and zero inference cost.

Result: Achieves 18.1% better reconstruction accuracy than standard variational autoencoders, demonstrating that a single well-designed regularization term can outperform complex multi-term formulations.

Conclusion: Challenges the implicit assumption in geometric deep learning that combining multiple geometric constraints improves performance, showing that a single effective regularization term can be superior to complex multi-term approaches.

Abstract: When depth sensors provide only 5% of needed measurements, reconstructing complete 3D scenes becomes difficult. Autonomous vehicles and robots cannot tolerate the geometric errors that sparse reconstruction introduces. We propose curvature regularization through a discrete Laplacian operator, achieving 18.1% better reconstruction accuracy than standard variational autoencoders. Our contribution challenges an implicit assumption in geometric deep learning: that combining multiple geometric constraints improves performance. A single well-designed regularization term not only matches but exceeds the effectiveness of complex multi-term formulations. The discrete Laplacian offers stable gradients and noise suppression with just 15% training overhead and zero inference cost.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CCVD is a continual learning framework for customized text-to-video generation that addresses catastrophic forgetting and concept neglect when learning new concepts over time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current customized text-to-video generation methods assume static concepts and struggle with forgetting and concept neglect when continuously learning new subjects and motions over time.

Method: Proposes Continual Customized Video Diffusion (CCVD) with: 1) concept-specific attribute retention module and task-aware concept aggregation to prevent forgetting, and 2) controllable conditional synthesis with layer-specific region attention-guided noise estimation to address concept neglect.

Result: Extensive experiments show CCVD outperforms existing customized text-to-video generation models in continual learning scenarios.

Conclusion: CCVD effectively enables continuous learning of new concepts in text-to-video generation while mitigating forgetting and concept neglect issues.

Abstract: Customized text-to-video generation (CTVG) has recently witnessed great progress in generating tailored videos from user-specific text. However, most CTVG methods assume that personalized concepts remain static and do not expand incrementally over time. Additionally, they struggle with forgetting and concept neglect when continuously learning new concepts, including subjects and motions. To resolve the above challenges, we develop a novel Continual Customized Video Diffusion (CCVD) model, which can continuously learn new concepts to generate videos across various text-to-video generation tasks by tackling forgetting and concept neglect. To address catastrophic forgetting, we introduce a concept-specific attribute retention module and a task-aware concept aggregation strategy. They can capture the unique characteristics and identities of old concepts during training, while combining all subject and motion adapters of old concepts based on their relevance during testing. Besides, to tackle concept neglect, we develop a controllable conditional synthesis to enhance regional features and align video contexts with user conditions, by incorporating layer-specific region attention-guided noise estimation. Extensive experimental comparisons demonstrate that our CCVD outperforms existing CTVG models. The code is available at https://github.com/JiahuaDong/CCVD.

### [70] [Probing the effectiveness of World Models for Spatial Reasoning through Test-time Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05809)
*Saurav Jha,M. Jehanzeb Mirza,Wei Lin,Shiqi Yang,Sarath Chandar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper analyzes test-time verification in vision-language models for spatial reasoning, finding current verifiers unreliable, proposing a new principled verification framework (ViSA) that improves some benchmarks but not others, revealing limitations in world models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models have limitations in spatial reasoning requiring multi-view understanding. Recent approaches like MindJourney use test-time scaling with world models and heuristic verifiers, but their effectiveness and reliability need systematic examination.

Method: The paper systematically analyzes test-time verifiers across benchmarks, revealing their unreliability through uncertainty-based analyses. It then introduces Verification through Spatial Assertions (ViSA) framework that grounds test-time rewards in verifiable, frame-anchored micro-claims for more principled verification.

Result: MindJourney's verifier provides little meaningful calibration, with random scoring often reducing answer entropy equally well. ViSA consistently improves spatial reasoning on SAT-Real benchmark and corrects trajectory-selection biases, but none of the verifiers achieve consistent scaling on the challenging MMSI-Bench, revealing world models as an information bottleneck.

Conclusion: The study charts the "bad, good, and ugly" aspects of test-time verification: bad (current verifiers unreliable), good (ViSA improves some benchmarks), ugly (world models remain bottleneck limiting fine-grained reasoning). The findings highlight fundamental limitations in current world-model-based reasoning approaches.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) remain limited in spatial reasoning tasks that require multi-view understanding and embodied perspective shifts. Recent approaches such as MindJourney attempt to mitigate this gap through test-time scaling where a world model imagines action-conditioned trajectories and a heuristic verifier selects helpful views from such trajectories. In this work, we systematically examine how such test-time verifiers behave across benchmarks, uncovering both their promise and their pitfalls. Our uncertainty-based analyses show that MindJourney's verifier provides little meaningful calibration, and that random scoring often reduces answer entropy equally well, thus exposing systematic action biases and unreliable reward signals. To mitigate these, we introduce a Verification through Spatial Assertions (ViSA) framework that grounds the test-time reward in verifiable, frame-anchored micro-claims. This principled verifier consistently improves spatial reasoning on the SAT-Real benchmark and corrects trajectory-selection biases through more balanced exploratory behavior. However, on the challenging MMSI-Bench, none of the verifiers, including ours, achieve consistent scaling, suggesting that the current world models form an information bottleneck where imagined views fail to enrich fine-grained reasoning. Together, these findings chart the bad, good, and ugly aspects of test-time verification for world-model-based reasoning.

*Fubao Zhu,Zhanyuan Jia,Zhiguo Wang,Huan Huang,Danyang Sun,Chuang Han,Yanting Li,Jiaofen Nan,Chen Zhao,Weihua Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UG-FedDA is a federated domain adaptation framework with uncertainty quantification for Alzheimer's disease classification across multiple medical imaging sites while preserving data privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AD classification frameworks struggle with multicenter studies due to inter-site heterogeneity and lack of uncertainty quantification, limiting their robustness and clinical applicability.

Method: Combines uncertainty quantification with federated domain adaptation, uses self-attention transformer for multi-template ROI feature extraction, and employs UQ to guide feature alignment by down-weighting uncertain samples.

Result: Achieved consistent cross-domain improvements across ADNI, AIBL, and OASIS datasets: 90.54%, 89.04%, 77.78% for AD vs NC; 80.20%, 71.91%, 79.73% for MCI vs AD; 76.87%, 73.91%, 83.73% for NC vs MCI.

Conclusion: UG-FedDA effectively handles cross-site MRI heterogeneity under privacy constraints, demonstrating efficient adaptation across multiple sites while maintaining strict data privacy.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disorder, and early diagnosis is critical for timely intervention. However, most existing classification frameworks face challenges in multicenter studies, as they often neglect inter-site heterogeneity and lack mechanisms to quantify uncertainty, which limits their robustness and clinical applicability. To address these issues, we proposed Uncertainty-Guided Federated Domain Adaptation (UG-FedDA), a novel multicenter AD classification framework that integrates uncertainty quantification (UQ) with federated domain adaptation to handle cross-site structure magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) heterogeneity under privacy constraints. Our approach extracts multi-template region-of-interest (RoI) features using a self-attention transformer, capturing both regional representations and their interactions. UQ is integrated to guide feature alignment, mitigating source-target distribution shifts by down-weighting uncertain samples. Experiments are conducted on three public datasets: the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle study (AIBL), and the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS). UG-FedDA achieved consistent cross-domain improvements in accuracy, sensitivity, and area under the ROC curve across three classification tasks: AD vs. normal controls (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) vs. AD, and NC vs. MCI. For NC vs. AD, UG-FedDA achieves accuracies of 90.54%, 89.04%, and 77.78% on ADNI, AIBL and OASIS datasets, respectively. For MCI vs. AD, accuracies are 80.20% (ADNI), 71.91% (AIBL), and 79.73% (OASIS). For NC vs. MCI, results are 76.87% (ADNI), 73.91% (AIBL), and 83.73% (OASIS). These results demonstrate that the proposed framework not only adapts efficiently across multiple sites but also preserves strict privacy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VRSA is a visual reasoning sequential attack method that decomposes harmful text queries into sequential sub-images to jailbreak MLLMs, achieving higher attack success rates than state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While previous jailbreak attacks have explored reasoning safety risks in text modality, similar threats in visual modality have been largely overlooked. The authors aim to fully evaluate potential safety risks in visual reasoning tasks for MLLMs.

Method: Proposes Visual Reasoning Sequential Attack (VRSA) that decomposes harmful text into sequentially related sub-images. Includes three key components: Adaptive Scene Refinement to optimize relevant scenes, Semantic Coherent Completion to iteratively rewrite sub-texts with context, and Text-Image Consistency Alignment to maintain semantic consistency.

Result: VRSA achieves higher attack success rates compared to state-of-the-art jailbreak attack methods on both open-source and closed-source MLLMs, including GPT-4o and Claude-4.5-Sonnet.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates significant safety vulnerabilities in MLLMs' visual reasoning capabilities and highlights the need for improved safety measures against multimodal jailbreak attacks.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are widely used in various fields due to their powerful cross-modal comprehension and generation capabilities. However, more modalities bring more vulnerabilities to being utilized for jailbreak attacks, which induces MLLMs to output harmful content. Due to the strong reasoning ability of MLLMs, previous jailbreak attacks try to explore reasoning safety risk in text modal, while similar threats have been largely overlooked in the visual modal. To fully evaluate potential safety risks in the visual reasoning task, we propose Visual Reasoning Sequential Attack (VRSA), which induces MLLMs to gradually externalize and aggregate complete harmful intent by decomposing the original harmful text into several sequentially related sub-images. In particular, to enhance the rationality of the scene in the image sequence, we propose Adaptive Scene Refinement to optimize the scene most relevant to the original harmful query. To ensure the semantic continuity of the generated image, we propose Semantic Coherent Completion to iteratively rewrite each sub-text combined with contextual information in this scene. In addition, we propose Text-Image Consistency Alignment to keep the semantical consistency. A series of experiments demonstrates that the VRSA can achieve a higher attack success rate compared with the state-of-the-art jailbreak attack methods on both the open-source and closed-source MLLMs such as GPT-4o and Claude-4.5-Sonnet.

### [74] [Edit-aware RAW Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05859)
*Abhijith Punnappurath,Luxi Zhao,Ke Zhao,Hue Nguyen,Radek Grzeszczuk,Michael S. Brown*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A plug-and-play edit-aware loss function for RAW reconstruction that improves robustness to diverse rendering styles and editing operations by incorporating a differentiable ISP with tunable parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Users often edit camera images post-capture, but typically edit display-referred sRGB images rather than RAW files. Existing RAW reconstruction methods focus on pixel-wise fidelity but degrade under different rendering styles and editing operations, limiting their practical utility for photographic editing.

Method: Introduces an edit-aware loss function with a modular, differentiable image signal processor (ISP) that simulates realistic photofinishing pipelines. During training, ISP parameters are randomly sampled from distributions modeling real camera processing variations, and loss is computed in sRGB space between ground-truth and reconstructed RAWs rendered through this ISP.

Result: Improves sRGB reconstruction quality by 1.5-2 dB PSNR across various editing conditions. When applied to metadata-assisted RAW reconstruction methods, enables fine-tuning for target edits with further gains.

Conclusion: The simple yet effective edit-aware loss function provides a general mechanism for enhancing edit fidelity and rendering flexibility across existing RAW reconstruction methods, addressing the primary motivation for RAW reconstruction in consumer imaging.

Abstract: Users frequently edit camera images post-capture to achieve their preferred photofinishing style. While editing in the RAW domain provides greater accuracy and flexibility, most edits are performed on the camera's display-referred output (e.g., 8-bit sRGB JPEG) since RAW images are rarely stored. Existing RAW reconstruction methods can recover RAW data from sRGB images, but these approaches are typically optimized for pixel-wise RAW reconstruction fidelity and tend to degrade under diverse rendering styles and editing operations. We introduce a plug-and-play, edit-aware loss function that can be integrated into any existing RAW reconstruction framework to make the recovered RAWs more robust to different rendering styles and edits. Our loss formulation incorporates a modular, differentiable image signal processor (ISP) that simulates realistic photofinishing pipelines with tunable parameters. During training, parameters for each ISP module are randomly sampled from carefully designed distributions that model practical variations in real camera processing. The loss is then computed in sRGB space between ground-truth and reconstructed RAWs rendered through this differentiable ISP. Incorporating our loss improves sRGB reconstruction quality by up to 1.5-2 dB PSNR across various editing conditions. Moreover, when applied to metadata-assisted RAW reconstruction methods, our approach enables fine-tuning for target edits, yielding further gains. Since photographic editing is the primary motivation for RAW reconstruction in consumer imaging, our simple yet effective loss function provides a general mechanism for enhancing edit fidelity and rendering flexibility across existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed Swin Transformer-based GAN offers robust underwater image reconstruction suitable for various marine applications, effectively addressing color distortion, low contrast, and haze problems through global dependency modeling.

Abstract: Underwater imaging is essential for marine exploration, environmental monitoring, and infrastructure inspection. However, water causes severe image degradation through wavelength-dependent absorption and scattering, resulting in color distortion, low contrast, and haze effects. Traditional reconstruction methods and convolutional neural network-based approaches often fail to adequately address these challenges due to limited receptive fields and inability to model global dependencies. This paper presented a novel deep learning framework that integrated a Swin Transformer architecture within a generative adversarial network (GAN) for underwater image reconstruction. Our generator employed a U-Net structure with Swin Transformer blocks to capture both local features and long-range dependencies crucial for color correction across entire images. A PatchGAN discriminator provided adversarial training to ensure high-frequency detail preservation. We trained and evaluated our model on the EUVP dataset, which contains paired underwater images of varying quality. Quantitative results demonstrate stateof-the-art performance with PSNR of 24.76 dB and SSIM of 0.89, representing significant improvements over existing methods. Visual results showed effective color balance restoration, contrast improvement, and haze reduction.

Abstract: Achieving character animation that meets studio-grade production standards remains challenging despite recent progress. Existing approaches can transfer motion from a driving video to a reference image, but often fail to preserve structural fidelity and temporal consistency in wild scenarios involving complex motion and cross-identity animations.

TL;DR: NICE uses neural implicit representations with region-specific SDF and deformation decoders to predict facial changes from orthognathic surgery, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and anatomical preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate prediction of postoperative facial appearance after orthognathic surgery is challenging due to complex nonlinear interactions between skeletal movements and facial soft tissue. Existing methods lack computational efficiency or fail to capture these intricate interactions.

Method: Neural Implicit Craniofacial Model (NICE) uses implicit neural representations with two modules: (1) shape module with region-specific implicit Signed Distance Function decoders to reconstruct facial surface, maxilla, and mandible; (2) surgery module with region-specific deformation decoders driven by shared surgical latent code to model nonlinear biomechanical responses, outputting point-wise displacement fields.

Result: NICE outperforms state-of-the-art methods, notably improving prediction accuracy in critical facial regions like lips and chin while robustly preserving anatomical integrity.

Conclusion: NICE provides a clinically viable tool for enhanced surgical planning and patient consultation in orthognathic procedures by accurately predicting surgical outcomes through neural implicit representations.

Abstract: Orthognathic surgery is a crucial intervention for correcting dentofacial skeletal deformities to enhance occlusal functionality and facial aesthetics. Accurate postoperative facial appearance prediction remains challenging due to the complex nonlinear interactions between skeletal movements and facial soft tissue. Existing biomechanical, parametric models and deep-learning approaches either lack computational efficiency or fail to fully capture these intricate interactions. To address these limitations, we propose Neural Implicit Craniofacial Model (NICE) which employs implicit neural representations for accurate anatomical reconstruction and surgical outcome prediction. NICE comprises a shape module, which employs region-specific implicit Signed Distance Function (SDF) decoders to reconstruct the facial surface, maxilla, and mandible, and a surgery module, which employs region-specific deformation decoders. These deformation decoders are driven by a shared surgical latent code to effectively model the complex, nonlinear biomechanical response of the facial surface to skeletal movements, incorporating anatomical prior knowledge. The deformation decoders output point-wise displacement fields, enabling precise modeling of surgical outcomes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NICE outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, notably improving prediction accuracy in critical facial regions such as lips and chin, while robustly preserving anatomical integrity. This work provides a clinically viable tool for enhanced surgical planning and patient consultation in orthognathic procedures.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A one-stage learnable-prototype framework with diversity regularization for weakly supervised semantic segmentation in histopathology, addressing CAM-induced region shrinkage and achieving SOTA performance on BCSS-WSSS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Weakly supervised semantic segmentation in histopathology faces challenges from inter-class homogeneity, intra-class heterogeneity, and CAM-induced region shrinkage where global pooling-based class activation maps only highlight the most distinctive areas and miss nearby class regions. Existing two-stage approaches with clustering prototype banks are costly, hyperparameter-sensitive, and decouple prototype discovery from segmentation learning.

Method: Proposes a cluster-free, one-stage learnable-prototype framework with diversity regularization to enhance morphological intra-class heterogeneity coverage. Unlike previous two-stage methods, this approach integrates prototype learning directly with segmentation in a single stage.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on BCSS-WSSS, outperforming prior methods in mIoU and mDice. Qualitative segmentation maps show sharper boundaries and fewer mislabels. Activation heatmaps reveal that learnable prototypes cover more diverse and complementary regions within each class compared to clustering-based prototypes.

Conclusion: The proposed one-stage learnable-prototype framework with diversity regularization effectively addresses the limitations of existing WSSS methods in histopathology, providing better coverage of intra-class heterogeneity and achieving superior segmentation performance while being more efficient than two-stage approaches.

Abstract: Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) in histopathology reduces pixel-level labeling by learning from image-level labels, but it is hindered by inter-class homogeneity, intra-class heterogeneity, and CAM-induced region shrinkage (global pooling-based class activation maps whose activations highlight only the most distinctive areas and miss nearby class regions). Recent works address these challenges by constructing a clustering prototype bank and then refining masks in a separate stage; however, such two-stage pipelines are costly, sensitive to hyperparameters, and decouple prototype discovery from segmentation learning, limiting their effectiveness and efficiency. We propose a cluster-free, one-stage learnable-prototype framework with diversity regularization to enhance morphological intra-class heterogeneity coverage. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on BCSS-WSSS, outperforming prior methods in mIoU and mDice. Qualitative segmentation maps show sharper boundaries and fewer mislabels, and activation heatmaps further reveal that, compared with clustering-based prototypes, our learnable prototypes cover more diverse and complementary regions within each class, providing consistent qualitative evidence for their effectiveness.

*Zhiting Mei,Tenny Yin,Micah Baker,Ola Shorinwa,Anirudha Majumdar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: C3 is a novel uncertainty quantification method for controllable video models that provides dense, calibrated confidence estimates at subpatch level to identify hallucinated regions in generated videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Controllable video models often hallucinate (generate physically unrealistic frames), which is problematic for applications like robot policy evaluation and planning. Current models lack confidence assessment capabilities, preventing hallucination mitigation.

Method: Three core innovations: 1) Training framework using strictly proper scoring rules for correctness and calibration, 2) Latent-space uncertainty estimation to avoid training instability and high costs of pixel-space approaches, 3) Mapping latent-space uncertainty to interpretable pixel-level RGB uncertainty heatmaps.

Result: Method provides calibrated uncertainty estimates within training distribution and enables effective out-of-distribution detection, demonstrated through extensive experiments on large-scale robot learning datasets (Bridge and DROID) and real-world evaluations.

Conclusion: C3 successfully addresses the hallucination problem in controllable video models by providing high-resolution uncertainty heatmaps that precisely localize untrustworthy regions in generated video frames, enabling better trust and reliability in applications like robotics.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative video models have led to significant breakthroughs in high-fidelity video synthesis, specifically in controllable video generation where the generated video is conditioned on text and action inputs, e.g., in instruction-guided video editing and world modeling in robotics. Despite these exceptional capabilities, controllable video models often hallucinate - generating future video frames that are misaligned with physical reality - which raises serious concerns in many tasks such as robot policy evaluation and planning. However, state-of-the-art video models lack the ability to assess and express their confidence, impeding hallucination mitigation. To rigorously address this challenge, we propose C3, an uncertainty quantification (UQ) method for training continuous-scale calibrated controllable video models for dense confidence estimation at the subpatch level, precisely localizing the uncertainty in each generated video frame. Our UQ method introduces three core innovations to empower video models to estimate their uncertainty. First, our method develops a novel framework that trains video models for correctness and calibration via strictly proper scoring rules. Second, we estimate the video model's uncertainty in latent space, avoiding training instability and prohibitive training costs associated with pixel-space approaches. Third, we map the dense latent-space uncertainty to interpretable pixel-level uncertainty in the RGB space for intuitive visualization, providing high-resolution uncertainty heatmaps that identify untrustworthy regions. Through extensive experiments on large-scale robot learning datasets (Bridge and DROID) and real-world evaluations, we demonstrate that our method not only provides calibrated uncertainty estimates within the training distribution, but also enables effective out-of-distribution detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Facial recognition faces challenges in explainability, demographic bias, privacy, and robustness to variations. Privacy regulations have degraded real datasets, raising legal/ethical concerns.

Evaluation metrics include accuracy, rank-1, rank-5, and true positive rate at false positive rate of 0.01% across eight leading datasets.

Result: Synthetic data demonstrates ability to capture realistic variations, but performance gap with real data persists. Techniques like diffusion models, GANs, and 3D models show substantial progress, though challenges remain in closing the performance gap.

Conclusion: Synthetic facial data generation is a promising solution for privacy, bias, and data scarcity issues in facial recognition, but further research is needed to improve synthetic data quality and close the performance gap with real data.

Abstract: Facial recognition has become a widely used method for authentication and identification, with applications for secure access and locating missing persons. Its success is largely attributed to deep learning, which leverages large datasets and effective loss functions to learn discriminative features. Despite these advances, facial recognition still faces challenges in explainability, demographic bias, privacy, and robustness to aging, pose variations, lighting changes, occlusions, and facial expressions. Privacy regulations have also led to the degradation of several datasets, raising legal, ethical, and privacy concerns. Synthetic facial data generation has been proposed as a promising solution. It mitigates privacy issues, enables experimentation with controlled facial attributes, alleviates demographic bias, and provides supplementary data to improve models trained on real data. This study compares the effectiveness of synthetic facial datasets generated using different techniques in facial recognition tasks. We evaluate accuracy, rank-1, rank-5, and the true positive rate at a false positive rate of 0.01% on eight leading datasets, offering a comparative analysis not extensively explored in the literature. Results demonstrate the ability of synthetic data to capture realistic variations while emphasizing the need for further research to close the performance gap with real data. Techniques such as diffusion models, GANs, and 3D models show substantial progress; however, challenges remain.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Synthetic traffic sign dataset combining GAN-based texture generation with analytical scene modeling for realistic data with parameter control for XAI and robustness testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for realistic synthetic traffic sign data that combines data-driven realism with analytical parameter control for explainable AI and robustness testing applications.

Method: Hybrid approach using GAN-based texture generation for dirt/wear artifacts plus analytical scene modulation for physically correct lighting and parameterization.

Result: Created Synset Signset Germany dataset with 105,500 images of 211 German traffic sign classes, including rare 2020 signs, with masks, segmentation, and extensive metadata.

Conclusion: The hybrid synthesis pipeline produces realistic synthetic data suitable for traffic sign recognition, with parameter control enabling XAI and robustness analysis applications.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a synthesis pipeline and dataset for training / testing data in the task of traffic sign recognition that combines the advantages of data-driven and analytical modeling: GAN-based texture generation enables data-driven dirt and wear artifacts, rendering unique and realistic traffic sign surfaces, while the analytical scene modulation achieves physically correct lighting and allows detailed parameterization. In particular, the latter opens up applications in the context of explainable AI (XAI) and robustness tests due to the possibility of evaluating the sensitivity to parameter changes, which we demonstrate with experiments. Our resulting synthetic traffic sign recognition dataset Synset Signset Germany contains a total of 105500 images of 211 different German traffic sign classes, including newly published (2020) and thus comparatively rare traffic signs. In addition to a mask and a segmentation image, we also provide extensive metadata including the stochastically selected environment and imaging effect parameters for each image. We evaluate the degree of realism of Synset Signset Germany on the real-world German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) and in comparison to CATERED, a state-of-the-art synthetic traffic sign recognition dataset.

### [82] [Measuring the Effect of Background on Classification and Feature Importance in Deep Learning for AV Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05937)
*Anne Sielemann,Valentin Barner,Stefan Wolf,Masoud Roschani,Jens Ziehn,Juergen Beyerer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using synthetic datasets to systematically study how background correlations affect deep learning classifiers and their explanations, focusing on traffic sign recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current XAI methods for deep learning (like SHAP and GradCAM) lack quantitative validation. It's difficult to determine whether classifiers focus on object pixels (healthy) or background pixels (overfitting) because real-world data contains unavoidable correlations, and synthetic data often lacks realism quantification.

Method: Systematically generate six synthetic datasets for traffic sign recognition that differ only in their degree of camera variation and background correlation. This allows isolation of background correlation effects from other factors.

Result: Quantification of when and how much background features gain importance to support classification based on training domain changes. The study provides empirical evidence about background feature importance patterns.

Conclusion: Synthetic datasets enable systematic, controlled study of background correlation effects on classifier behavior and XAI interpretations, addressing the validation gap in current explanation methods.

Abstract: Common approaches to explainable AI (XAI) for deep learning focus on analyzing the importance of input features on the classification task in a given model: saliency methods like SHAP and GradCAM are used to measure the impact of spatial regions of the input image on the classification result. Combined with ground truth information about the location of the object in the input image (e.g., a binary mask), it is determined whether object pixels had a high impact on the classification result, or whether the classification focused on background pixels. The former is considered to be a sign of a healthy classifier, whereas the latter is assumed to suggest overfitting on spurious correlations. A major challenge, however, is that these intuitive interpretations are difficult to test quantitatively, and hence the output of such explanations lacks an explanation itself. One particular reason is that correlations in real-world data are difficult to avoid, and whether they are spurious or legitimate is debatable. Synthetic data in turn can facilitate to actively enable or disable correlations where desired but often lack a sufficient quantification of realism and stochastic properties. [...] Therefore, we systematically generate six synthetic datasets for the task of traffic sign recognition, which differ only in their degree of camera variation and background correlation [...] to quantify the isolated influence of background correlation, different levels of camera variation, and considered traffic sign shapes on the classification performance, as well as background feature importance. [...] Results include a quantification of when and how much background features gain importance to support the classification task based on changes in the training domain [...].

TL;DR: ZoomClick: A training-free method that leverages zoom as a prior for GUI grounding, improving performance of vision-language models on interface element localization tasks without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GUI grounding approaches face challenges with cross-platform generalization, complex layout analysis, and fine-grained element localization despite using large-scale bounding box supervision.

Conclusion: Zoom is a strong prior for GUI grounding that enables dynamic spatial focusing and adaptive context switching without training. The work demonstrates zoom's effectiveness and provides a benchmark to inspire future research on improving zoom for training and test-time scaling in GUI grounding tasks.

Abstract: Grounding is a fundamental capability for building graphical user interface (GUI) agents. Although existing approaches rely on large-scale bounding box supervision, they still face various challenges, such as cross-platform generalization, complex layout analysis, and fine-grained element localization. In this paper, we investigate zoom as a strong yet underexplored prior for GUI grounding, and propose a training-free method, ZoomClick. By characterizing four key properties of zoom (i.e., pre-zoom, depth, shrink size, minimal crop size), we unlock its full capabilities for dynamic spatial focusing and adaptive context switching. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly boosts the performance of both general vision-language and specialized GUI grounding models, achieving state-of-the-art results on several mainstream benchmarks; for example, UI-Venus-72B attains a 73.1% success rate on ScreenSpot-Pro. Furthermore, we present GUIZoom-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating model adaptability to zoom, aiming to inspire future research on improving zoom for further training and test-time scaling in GUI grounding tasks.

TL;DR: AQUA-Net is a lightweight underwater image enhancement model that uses frequency fusion and illumination-aware processing to restore color and contrast while being computationally efficient for real-time applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater images suffer from color distortion, low contrast, and haze due to light absorption/scattering, while existing deep learning models are too computationally complex for real-time deployment in underwater applications.

Method: AQUA-Net integrates a residual encoder-decoder with dual auxiliary branches: (1) frequency fusion encoder that enriches spatial representations with Fourier domain cues, and (2) illumination-aware decoder that performs adaptive exposure correction using learned illumination maps inspired by Retinex theory.

Result: AQUA-Net performs on par with state-of-the-art methods in qualitative and quantitative evaluations while using fewer parameters. The model shows strong generalization capability and robustness across diverse underwater conditions.

Conclusion: The joint spatial, frequency, and illumination design effectively restores color balance, contrast, and perceptual realism, providing an efficient solution for real-world underwater imaging applications with demonstrated complementary benefits from the frequency and illumination branches.

Abstract: Underwater images often suffer from severe color distortion, low contrast, and a hazy appearance due to wavelength-dependent light absorption and scattering. Simultaneously, existing deep learning models exhibit high computational complexity, which limits their practical deployment for real-time underwater applications. To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel underwater image enhancement model, called Adaptive Frequency Fusion and Illumination Aware Network (AQUA-Net). It integrates a residual encoder decoder with dual auxiliary branches, which operate in the frequency and illumination domains. The frequency fusion encoder enriches spatial representations with frequency cues from the Fourier domain and preserves fine textures and structural details. Inspired by Retinex, the illumination-aware decoder performs adaptive exposure correction through a learned illumination map that separates reflectance from lighting effects. This joint spatial, frequency, and illumination design enables the model to restore color balance, visual contrast, and perceptual realism under diverse underwater conditions. Additionally, we present a high-resolution, real-world underwater video-derived dataset from the Mediterranean Sea, which captures challenging deep-sea conditions with realistic visual degradations to enable robust evaluation and development of deep learning models. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that AQUA-Net performs on par with SOTA in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations while using less number of parameters. Ablation studies further confirm that the frequency and illumination branches provide complementary contributions that improve visibility and color representation. Overall, the proposed model shows strong generalization capability and robustness, and it provides an effective solution for real-world underwater imaging applications.

TL;DR: Proposes EditThinker, a deliberative editing framework that uses iterative Think-while-Edit cycles (Critique, Refine, Repeat) to improve instruction-following in image editing models via reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current instruction-based image editing models have high aesthetic quality but limited instruction-following capability due to inherent stochasticity and lack of deliberation. Single-turn success rates remain constrained despite supervised or reinforcement learning approaches.

Method: Develops a deliberative editing framework with iterative Think-while-Edit cycles: Critiquing results and Refining instructions, then Repeating generation. Trains a single MLLM (EditThinker) as reasoning engine to produce critique scores, reasoning processes, and refined instructions. Uses reinforcement learning to align thinking with editing for targeted instruction improvements.

Result: Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate significant improvement in instruction-following capability of any image editing model by a large margin.

Conclusion: The deliberative editing framework with EditThinker effectively addresses instruction-following challenges in image editing by simulating human cognitive loops, achieving substantial performance gains across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing has emerged as a prominent research area, which, benefiting from image generation foundation models, have achieved high aesthetic quality, making instruction-following capability the primary challenge. Existing approaches improve instruction adherence via supervised or reinforcement learning, yet single-turn success rates remain limited due to inherent stochasticity and a lack of deliberation. In this work, we propose a deliberative editing framework to 'think' while they edit, which simulates the human cognitive loop by iteratively executing a Think-while-Edit cycle: Critiquing results and Refining instructions , followed by Repeating the generation until satisfactory. Specifically, we train a single MLLM, EditThinker, to act as the reasoning engine of this framework, which jointly produce the critique score, reasoning process, and refined instructions. We employ reinforcement learning to align the EditThinker's thinking with its editing, thereby generating more targeted instruction improvements. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the instruction-following capability of any image editing model by a large margin. We will release our data construction framework, datasets, and models to benefit the community.
