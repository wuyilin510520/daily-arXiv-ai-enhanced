Various\nmodel configurations are trained, validated and evaluated on a total of three\ndifferent datasets. The trained models are then to be used in a real-time\npipeline to estimate the gaze direction and thus the gaze point of a person in\nfront of a computer screen.

Replacing the Transformer module with a\nMultilayer Perceptron (MLP) improves the error to 26.9mm. These results are\ncoherent with the ones on the other two datasets. On the ETH-XGaze dataset, the\nmodel with Transformer module achieves a mean angular error of 3.59{\\deg} and\nwithout Transformer module 3.26{\\deg}, whereas the fundamentally different\nmodel architecture used by the dataset authors Zhang et al. achieves a mean\nangular error of 2.04{\\deg}.

It has high potential to transform how visual signals are\nprocessed and interpreted with the help of quantum computing that leverages\nquantum-mechanical effects in computations inaccessible to classical (i.e.\nnon-quantum) computers. In scenarios where existing non-quantum methods cannot\nfind a solution in a reasonable time or compute only approximate solutions,\nquantum computers can provide, among others, advantages in terms of better time\nscalability for multiple problem classes. Parametrised quantum circuits can\nalso become, in the long term, a considerable alternative to classical neural\nnetworks in computer vision.
