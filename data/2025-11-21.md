*Wei Zhang,Yeying Jin,Xin Li,Yan Zhang,Xiaofeng Cong,Cong Wang,Fengcai Qiao,zhichao Lian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniFit is a universal virtual try-on framework that uses Multimodal Large Language Models to address semantic gaps and data scarcity in complex VTON tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VTON methods struggle with semantic gaps between text instructions and reference images, and face data scarcity in complex scenarios like multi-garment try-on.

Method: Proposes MLLM-Guided Semantic Alignment Module (MGSA) with learnable queries and semantic alignment loss, plus two-stage progressive training with self-synthesis pipeline.

Result: UniFit supports diverse VTON tasks including multi-garment and model-to-model try-on, achieving state-of-the-art performance in extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges semantic gaps and learns complex tasks from limited data, providing a universal solution for virtual try-on.

Abstract: Image-based virtual try-on (VTON) aims to synthesize photorealistic images of a person wearing specified garments. Despite significant progress, building a universal VTON framework that can flexibly handle diverse and complex tasks remains a major challenge. Recent methods explore multi-task VTON frameworks guided by textual instructions, yet they still face two key limitations: (1) semantic gap between text instructions and reference images, and (2) data scarcity in complex scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose UniFit, a universal VTON framework driven by a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). Specifically, we introduce an MLLM-Guided Semantic Alignment Module (MGSA), which integrates multimodal inputs using an MLLM and a set of learnable queries. By imposing a semantic alignment loss, MGSA captures cross-modal semantic relationships and provides coherent and explicit semantic guidance for the generative process, thereby reducing the semantic gap. Moreover, by devising a two-stage progressive training strategy with a self-synthesis pipeline, UniFit is able to learn complex tasks from limited data. Extensive experiments show that UniFit not only supports a wide range of VTON tasks, including multi-garment and model-to-model try-on, but also achieves state-of-the-art performance. The source code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/zwplus/UniFit.

### [2] [EfficientSAM3: Progressive Hierarchical Distillation for Video Concept Segmentation from SAM1, 2, and 3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15833)
*Chengxi Zeng,Yuxuan Jiang,Aaron Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EfficientSAM3 enables on-device concept segmentation and tracking by distilling SAM3's capabilities into lightweight models through Progressive Hierarchical Distillation, achieving strong performance-efficiency trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM3's unified architecture is too computationally intensive for on-device use, creating a need for efficient models that maintain high performance while being deployable on resource-constrained devices.

Method: Progressive Hierarchical Distillation (PHD) in three stages: Encoder Distillation for image features, Temporal Memory Distillation with Perceiver-based module for spatiotemporal features, and End-to-End Fine-Tuning to preserve concept-level performance.

Result: Created a family of efficient models using RepViT, TinyViT, and EfficientViT backbones that achieve strong performance on VOS datasets while maintaining high fidelity to the teacher model's behavior.

Conclusion: EfficientSAM3 successfully bridges the gap between powerful concept segmentation capabilities and on-device deployment requirements through progressive distillation, enabling practical applications of visual understanding on resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model 3 (SAM3) advances visual understanding with Promptable Concept Segmentation (PCS) across images and videos, but its unified architecture (shared vision backbone, DETR-style detector, dense-memory tracker) remains prohibitive for on-device use. We present EfficientSAM3, a family of efficient models built on Progressive Hierarchical Distillation (PHD) that transfers capability from SAM3 to lightweight students in three stages: (1) Encoder Distillation aligns image features via prompt-in-the-loop training on SA-1B; (2) Temporal Memory Distillation replaces dense memory with a compact Perceiver-based module trained on SA-V to compress and retrieve spatiotemporal features efficiently; and (3) End-to-End Fine-Tuning refines the full pipeline on the official SAM3 PCS data to preserve concept-level performance. PHD yields a spectrum of student variants using RepViT, TinyViT, and EfficientViT backbones, enabling on-device concept segmentation and tracking while maintaining high fidelity to teacher behavior. We benchmark on popular VOS datasets, and compare with varies of releated work, achieing strong performance-efficiency trade-offs.

### [3] [WALDO: Where Unseen Model-based 6D Pose Estimation Meets Occlusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15874)
*Sajjad Pakdamansavoji,Yintao Ma,Amir Rasouli,Tongtong Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel extensions for model-based 6D pose estimation that improve accuracy under occlusion through dynamic sampling, multi-hypothesis inference, iterative refinement, and occlusion-focused training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 6D pose estimation methods struggle with occlusion, where early-stage detection errors propagate through sequential pipelines, degrading performance for unseen objects.

Method: Four key extensions: (1) dynamic non-uniform dense sampling focusing on visible regions, (2) multi-hypothesis inference with confidence-ranked candidates, (3) iterative pose refinement, and (4) occlusion-focused training augmentations. Also proposes new weighted-by-visibility evaluation metric.

Result: Achieves >5% accuracy improvement on ICBIN and >2% on BOP benchmarks, with approximately 3x faster inference speed.

Conclusion: The proposed approach significantly enhances robustness to occlusion in 6D object pose estimation while improving both accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Accurate 6D object pose estimation is vital for robotics, augmented reality, and scene understanding. For seen objects, high accuracy is often attainable via per-object fine-tuning but generalizing to unseen objects remains a challenge. To address this problem, past arts assume access to CAD models at test time and typically follow a multi-stage pipeline to estimate poses: detect and segment the object, propose an initial pose, and then refine it. Under occlusion, however, the early-stage of such pipelines are prone to errors, which can propagate through the sequential processing, and consequently degrade the performance. To remedy this shortcoming, we propose four novel extensions to model-based 6D pose estimation methods: (i) a dynamic non-uniform dense sampling strategy that focuses computation on visible regions, reducing occlusion-induced errors; (ii) a multi-hypothesis inference mechanism that retains several confidence-ranked pose candidates, mitigating brittle single-path failures; (iii) iterative refinement to progressively improve pose accuracy; and (iv) series of occlusion-focused training augmentations that strengthen robustness and generalization. Furthermore, we propose a new weighted by visibility metric for evaluation under occlusion to minimize the bias in the existing protocols. Via extensive empirical evaluations, we show that our proposed approach achieves more than 5% improvement in accuracy on ICBIN and more than 2% on BOP dataset benchmarks, while achieving approximately 3 times faster inference.

### [4] [Automatic Uncertainty-Aware Synthetic Data Bootstrapping for Historical Map Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15875)
*Lukas Arzoumanidis,Julius Knechtel,Jan-Henrik Haunert,Youness Dehbi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes methods to generate synthetic historical maps by transferring cartographic style onto vector data to overcome data scarcity for deep learning applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Historical maps lack sufficient annotated training data for deep learning, and creating such data is time-consuming. Synthetic data often lacks realism and diversity needed for effective learning.

Method: Uses automatic deep generative approach and manual stochastic degradation to emulate visual uncertainty/noise in historical map scans, transferring cartographic style from original maps to vector data.

Result: Generated effectively unlimited synthetic historical maps suitable for tasks like land-cover interpretation, enabling domain-adaptive semantic segmentation using Self-Constructing Graph Convolutional Network.

Conclusion: The approach successfully addresses data scarcity in historical map analysis by creating realistic synthetic training data that supports effective machine learning applications.

Abstract: The automated analysis of historical documents, particularly maps, has drastically benefited from advances in deep learning and its success across various computer vision applications. However, most deep learning-based methods heavily rely on large amounts of annotated training data, which are typically unavailable for historical maps, especially for those belonging to specific, homogeneous cartographic domains, also known as corpora. Creating high-quality training data suitable for machine learning often takes a significant amount of time and involves extensive manual effort. While synthetic training data can alleviate the scarcity of real-world samples, it often lacks the affinity (realism) and diversity (variation) necessary for effective learning. By transferring the cartographic style of an original historical map corpus onto vector data, we bootstrap an effectively unlimited number of synthetic historical maps suitable for tasks such as land-cover interpretation of a homogeneous historical map corpus. We propose an automatic deep generative approach and a alternative manual stochastic degradation technique to emulate the visual uncertainty and noise, also known as data-dependent uncertainty, commonly observed in historical map scans. To quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness and applicability of our approach, the generated training datasets were employed for domain-adaptive semantic segmentation on a homogeneous map corpus using a Self-Constructing Graph Convolutional Network, enabling a comprehensive assessment of the impact of our data bootstrapping methods.

### [5] [Box6D : Zero-shot Category-level 6D Pose Estimation of Warehouse Boxes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15884)
*Yintao Ma,Sajjad Pakdamansavoji,Amir Rasouli,Tongtong Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Box6D is a category-level 6D pose estimation method for warehouse boxes that uses binary search for dimension inference and category CAD templates, achieving competitive accuracy with 76% faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods have limitations: model-based approaches require exact CAD models and transfer poorly, model-free methods struggle in challenging conditions, and category-level methods often ignore environmental priors, limiting industrial practicality.

Method: Uses single RGB-D observation to infer box dimensions via fast binary search, estimates poses using category CAD templates, and applies depth-based plausibility filter with early-stopping strategy to reject implausible hypotheses.

Result: Achieves competitive or superior 6D pose precision on real-world storage scenarios and public benchmarks while reducing inference time by approximately 76%.

Conclusion: Box6D provides an efficient and practical solution for warehouse box pose estimation that balances flexibility and accuracy while significantly reducing computational costs.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient 6D pose estimation of novel objects under clutter and occlusion is critical for robotic manipulation across warehouse automation, bin picking, logistics, and e-commerce fulfillment. There are three main approaches in this domain; Model-based methods assume an exact CAD model at inference but require high-resolution meshes and transfer poorly to new environments; Model-free methods that rely on a few reference images or videos are more flexible, however often fail under challenging conditions; Category-level approaches aim to balance flexibility and accuracy but many are overly general and ignore environment and object priors, limiting their practicality in industrial settings.
  To this end, we propose Box6d, a category-level 6D pose estimation method tailored for storage boxes in the warehouse context. From a single RGB-D observation, Box6D infers the dimensions of the boxes via a fast binary search and estimates poses using a category CAD template rather than instance-specific models. Suing a depth-based plausibility filter and early-stopping strategy, Box6D then rejects implausible hypotheses, lowering computational cost. We conduct evaluations on real-world storage scenarios and public benchmarks, and show that our approach delivers competitive or superior 6D pose precision while reducing inference time by approximately 76%.

### [6] [RB-FT: Rationale-Bootstrapped Fine-Tuning for Video Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15923)
*Meilong Xu,Di Fu,Jiaxing Zhang,Gong Yu,Jiayu Zheng,Xiaoling Hu,Dongdi Zhao,Feiyang Li,Chao Chen,Yong Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage self-improvement method that uses VLM-generated rationales as intermediate supervision to bridge the rationale gap in domain-specific video classification, achieving better performance than direct fine-tuning without new annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs struggle with domain-specific video classification due to a 'rationale gap' - sparse domain data cannot bridge the semantic distance between complex spatio-temporal content and abstract classification labels.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Prompt VLMs to generate detailed textual rationales for videos, then fine-tune on these self-generated rationales; 2) Perform conventional supervised fine-tuning on task labels after the model has acquired domain reasoning.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method significantly outperforms direct supervised fine-tuning, validating self-generated rationales as an effective paradigm for adapting VLMs to domain-specific video analysis.

Conclusion: Self-generated rationales provide an annotation-efficient way to bridge the rationale gap and improve VLM performance on domain-specific video classification tasks.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are becoming increasingly integral to multimedia understanding; however, they often struggle with domain-specific video classification tasks, particularly in cases with limited data. This stems from a critical \textit{rationale gap}, where sparse domain data is insufficient to bridge the semantic distance between complex spatio-temporal content and abstract classification labels. We propose a two-stage self-improvement paradigm to bridge this gap without new annotations. First, we prompt the VLMs to generate detailed textual rationales for each video, compelling them to articulate the domain-specific logic. The VLM is then fine-tuned on these self-generated rationales, utilizing this intermediate supervision to align its representations with the nuances of the target domain. Second, conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is performed on the task labels, achieving markedly higher effectiveness as a result of the model's pre-acquired domain reasoning. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms direct SFT, validating self-generated rationale as an effective, annotation-efficient paradigm for adapting VLMs to domain-specific video analysis.

### [7] [Boosting Medical Visual Understanding From Multi-Granular Language Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15943)
*Zihan Li,Yiqing Wang,Sina Farsiu,Paul Kinahan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MGLL is a contrastive learning framework that improves multi-label and cross-granularity alignment in vision-language models, addressing limitations of CLIP in complex domains like medical imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP's focus on single-label, single-granularity alignment limits effectiveness in domains like medical imaging where images have multiple high-level labels across different annotation granularities.

Method: MGLL uses structured multi-label supervision, integrates textual descriptions across granularities, introduces soft-label supervision with point-wise constraints, and employs smooth KL divergence for cross-granularity consistency.

Result: MGLL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in downstream tasks when pretrained on large-scale multi-granular datasets.

Conclusion: MGLL effectively addresses multi-label and cross-granularity alignment challenges in vision-language models, particularly benefiting complex domains like medical imaging.

Abstract: Recent advances in image-text pretraining have significantly enhanced visual understanding by aligning visual and textual representations. Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has played a pivotal role in multimodal learning. However, its focus on single-label, single-granularity alignment limits its effectiveness in complex domains such as medical imaging, where images often correspond to multiple high-level labels (e.g., disease categories) across different annotation granularities (e.g., diagnostic description, clinical explanation). To address this, we propose Multi-Granular Language Learning (MGLL), a contrastive learning framework designed to improve both multi-label and cross-granularity alignment. MGLL leverages structured multi-label supervision, integrates textual descriptions across granularities, and introduces soft-label supervision with point-wise constraints to enhance alignment. MGLL employs smooth Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to ensure cross-granularity consistency while maintaining computational efficiency as a plug-and-play module for vision-language models. Pretrained on our constructed large-scale multi-granular datasets and evaluated across multiple datasets, MGLL outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in downstream tasks.

*Milos Vukadinovic,Hirotaka Ieki,Yuki Sahasi,David Ouyang,Bryan He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Automated method to extract standard 2D echocardiography views from 3D cardiac ultrasound volumes using deep learning and anatomical heuristics, validated with 96% accuracy by cardiologists.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D echocardiography offers better image quality but physicians are accustomed to interpreting 2D views. This bridges the gap by allowing clinicians to use their familiar 2D format while benefiting from 3D scanning advantages.

Method: Combines deep learning view classifier with downstream heuristics based on anatomical landmarks and cardiologist-provided rules to reconstruct standard 2D echocardiography views from 3D volumes.

Result: Validated with 96% accuracy by three cardiologists on 1,600 videos from 2 hospitals. Extracted 2D videos preserve spatial calibration and diagnostic features, enabling accurate cardiac abnormality detection and clinical-grade measurements.

Conclusion: The method successfully allows clinicians to obtain accurate real-world interpretations from 3D volumes while maintaining their familiar 2D workflow, with code and dataset released publicly.

Abstract: Although the heart has complex three-dimensional (3D) anatomy, conventional medical imaging with cardiac ultrasound relies on a series of 2D videos showing individual cardiac structures. 3D echocardiography is a developing modality that now offers adequate image quality for clinical use, with potential to streamline acquisition and improve assessment of off-axis features. We propose an automated method to select standard 2D views from 3D cardiac ultrasound volumes, allowing physicians to interpret the data in their usual format while benefiting from the speed and usability of 3D scanning. Applying a deep learning view classifier and downstream heuristics based on anatomical landmarks together with heuristics provided by cardiologists, we reconstruct standard echocardiography views. This approach was validated by three cardiologists in blinded evaluation (96\% accuracy in 1,600 videos from 2 hospitals). The downstream 2D videos were also validated in their ability to detect cardiac abnormalities using AI echocardiography models (EchoPrime and PanEcho) as well as ability to generate clinical-grade measurements of cardiac anatomy (EchoNet-Measurement). We demonstrated that the extracted 2D videos preserve spatial calibration and diagnostic features, allowing clinicians to obtain accurate real-world interpretations from 3D volumes. We release the code and a dataset of 29 3D echocardiography videos https://github.com/echonet/3d-echo .

### [9] [Click2Graph: Interactive Panoptic Video Scene Graphs from a Single Click](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15948)
*Raphael Ruschel,Hardikkumar Prajapati,Awsafur Rahman,B. S. Manjunath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Click2Graph is the first interactive framework for Panoptic Video Scene Graph Generation that combines visual prompting with spatial, temporal, and semantic understanding to enable human-guided video scene understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VSGG systems are closed, feed-forward pipelines that cannot incorporate human guidance, while promptable segmentation models lack semantic or relational reasoning capabilities.

Method: The framework uses a Dynamic Interaction Discovery Module to generate subject-conditioned object prompts from user cues, and a Semantic Classification Head for joint entity and predicate reasoning, enabling segmentation, tracking, and relationship prediction.

Result: Experiments on OpenPVSG benchmark show Click2Graph establishes a strong foundation for user-guided PVSG, demonstrating effective combination of human prompting with panoptic grounding and relational inference.

Conclusion: Click2Graph enables controllable and interpretable video scene understanding by unifying visual prompting with comprehensive spatial, temporal, and semantic reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: State-of-the-art Video Scene Graph Generation (VSGG) systems provide structured visual understanding but operate as closed, feed-forward pipelines with no ability to incorporate human guidance. In contrast, promptable segmentation models such as SAM2 enable precise user interaction but lack semantic or relational reasoning. We introduce Click2Graph, the first interactive framework for Panoptic Video Scene Graph Generation (PVSG) that unifies visual prompting with spatial, temporal, and semantic understanding. From a single user cue, such as a click or bounding box, Click2Graph segments and tracks the subject across time, autonomously discovers interacting objects, and predicts <subject, object, predicate> triplets to form a temporally consistent scene graph. Our framework introduces two key components: a Dynamic Interaction Discovery Module that generates subject-conditioned object prompts, and a Semantic Classification Head that performs joint entity and predicate reasoning. Experiments on the OpenPVSG benchmark demonstrate that Click2Graph establishes a strong foundation for user-guided PVSG, showing how human prompting can be combined with panoptic grounding and relational inference to enable controllable and interpretable video scene understanding.

### [10] [InfoCLIP: Bridging Vision-Language Pretraining and Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation via Information-Theoretic Alignment Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15967)
*Muyao Yuan,Yuanhong Zhang,Weizhan Zhang,Lan Ma,Yuan Gao,Jiangyong Ying,Yudeng Xin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfoCLIP improves CLIP fine-tuning for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation by using information-theoretic objectives to transfer alignment knowledge while preventing overfitting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods that fine-tune CLIP for segmentation on limited seen categories often lead to overfitting and degrade the pretrained vision-language alignment.

Method: Proposes InfoCLIP with two novel mutual information objectives: compressing pixel-text modality alignment from pretrained CLIP to reduce noise, and maximizing mutual information between pretrained and fine-tuned models to transfer compact local semantic relations.

Result: Extensive evaluations across various benchmarks validate the effectiveness of InfoCLIP in enhancing CLIP fine-tuning for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: InfoCLIP demonstrates adaptability and superiority in asymmetric transfer for stabilizing modality alignment during fine-tuning.

Abstract: Recently, the strong generalization ability of CLIP has facilitated open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, which labels pixels using arbitrary text. However, existing methods that fine-tune CLIP for segmentation on limited seen categories often lead to overfitting and degrade the pretrained vision-language alignment. To stabilize modality alignment during fine-tuning, we propose InfoCLIP, which leverages an information-theoretic perspective to transfer alignment knowledge from pretrained CLIP to the segmentation task. Specifically, this transfer is guided by two novel objectives grounded in mutual information. First, we compress the pixel-text modality alignment from pretrained CLIP to reduce noise arising from its coarse-grained local semantic representations learned under image-text supervision. Second, we maximize the mutual information between the alignment knowledge of pretrained CLIP and the fine-tuned model to transfer compact local semantic relations suited for the segmentation task. Extensive evaluations across various benchmarks validate the effectiveness of InfoCLIP in enhancing CLIP fine-tuning for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, demonstrating its adaptability and superiority in asymmetric transfer.

*Jingru Zhang,Saed Moradi,Ashirbani Saha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel consistency regularization using BI-RADS-inspired morphological features improves breast ultrasound tumor segmentation generalization in multi-task learning by reducing destructive task interference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-task learning often suffers from destructive task interference where joint training underperforms single-task baselines, limiting generalization in breast ultrasound tumor segmentation.

Method: Proposed consistency regularization approach with differentiable BI-RADS-inspired morphological features to mitigate interference between segmentation and classification tasks.

Result: Statistically significant improvements (p<0.001) in segmentation generalization across three external datasets: UDIAT (Dice=0.81 vs 0.59), BUSI (0.66 vs 0.56), BUS-UCLM (0.69 vs 0.49), achieving state-of-the-art on UDIAT.

Conclusion: The consistency regularization approach effectively reduces destructive task interference in multi-task learning, significantly improving generalization performance for breast ultrasound tumor segmentation across diverse external datasets.

Abstract: Multi-task learning can suffer from destructive task interference, where jointly trained models underperform single-task baselines and limit generalization. To improve generalization performance in breast ultrasound-based tumor segmentation via multi-task learning, we propose a novel consistency regularization approach that mitigates destructive interference between segmentation and classification. The consistency regularization approach is composed of differentiable BI-RADS-inspired morphological features. We validated this approach by training all models on the BrEaST dataset (Poland) and evaluating them on three external datasets: UDIAT (Spain), BUSI (Egypt), and BUS-UCLM (Spain). Our comprehensive analysis demonstrates statistically significant (p<0.001) improvements in generalization for segmentation task of the proposed multi-task approach vs. the baseline one: UDIAT, BUSI, BUS-UCLM (Dice coefficient=0.81 vs 0.59, 0.66 vs 0.56, 0.69 vs 0.49, resp.). The proposed approach also achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance under rigorous external validation on the UDIAT dataset.

TL;DR: A detection-guided generative framework for unified visual semantic understanding that predicts hierarchical category and attribute tokens using BART-based generation, outperforming similarity-based and multi-stage approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches relying on global similarity struggle with fine-grained category distinctions and category-specific attribute diversity, especially in large-scale e-commerce scenarios where unified object detection, category prediction, and attribute recognition are needed.

Method: Detection-guided generative framework that extracts refined ROI-level features for detected objects and uses a BART-based generator to produce semantic tokens in coarse-to-fine sequences covering category hierarchies and property-value pairs, supporting property-conditioned attribute recognition.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing similarity-based pipelines and multi-stage classification systems on both large-scale proprietary e-commerce datasets and open-source datasets, achieving stronger fine-grained recognition and more coherent unified inference.

Conclusion: The proposed detection-guided generative framework effectively addresses limitations of current approaches by providing unified visual semantic understanding with improved fine-grained recognition capabilities and coherent inference across object detection, category prediction, and attribute recognition tasks.

Abstract: Achieving visual semantic understanding requires a unified framework that simultaneously handles object detection, category prediction, and attribute recognition. However, current advanced approaches rely on global similarity and struggle to capture fine-grained category distinctions and category-specific attribute diversity, especially in large-scale e-commerce scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a detection-guided generative framework that predicts hierarchical category and attribute tokens. For each detected object, we extract refined ROI-level features and employ a BART-based generator to produce semantic tokens in a coarse-to-fine sequence covering category hierarchies and property-value pairs, with support for property-conditioned attribute recognition. Experiments on both large-scale proprietary e-commerce datasets and open-source datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing similarity-based pipelines and multi-stage classification systems, achieving stronger fine-grained recognition and more coherent unified inference.

*Dawei Li,Zijian Gu,Peng Wang,Chuhan Song,Zhen Tan,Mohan Zhang,Tianlong Chen,Yu Tian,Song Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FADS is a fairness-aware demonstration selection method for in-context learning that reduces demographic disparities in medical image reasoning by creating demographically balanced exemplars through clustering-based sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal LLMs show promise for medical image reasoning but face fairness issues across demographic groups, while existing debiasing methods require large labeled datasets or fine-tuning that are impractical for foundation-scale models.

Method: Proposed Fairness-Aware Demonstration Selection (FADS) using clustering-based sampling to build demographically balanced and semantically relevant demonstrations for in-context learning, avoiding the need for fine-tuning.

Result: Experiments on multiple medical imaging benchmarks show FADS consistently reduces gender-, race-, and ethnicity-related disparities while maintaining strong accuracy.

Conclusion: Fairness-aware in-context learning offers a scalable and data-efficient solution for equitable medical image reasoning, with FADS providing an efficient path toward fair medical AI systems.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong potential for medical image reasoning, yet fairness across demographic groups remains a major concern. Existing debiasing methods often rely on large labeled datasets or fine-tuning, which are impractical for foundation-scale models. We explore In-Context Learning (ICL) as a lightweight, tuning-free alternative for improving fairness. Through systematic analysis, we find that conventional demonstration selection (DS) strategies fail to ensure fairness due to demographic imbalance in selected exemplars. To address this, we propose Fairness-Aware Demonstration Selection (FADS), which builds demographically balanced and semantically relevant demonstrations via clustering-based sampling. Experiments on multiple medical imaging benchmarks show that FADS consistently reduces gender-, race-, and ethnicity-related disparities while maintaining strong accuracy, offering an efficient and scalable path toward fair medical image reasoning. These results highlight the potential of fairness-aware in-context learning as a scalable and data-efficient solution for equitable medical image reasoning.

### [14] [Exploiting Inter-Sample Information for Long-tailed Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16015)
*Nimeshika Udayangani,Hadi M. Dolatabadi,Sarah Erfani,Christopher Leckie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Graph-based approach using GCNs and Gaussianization improves OOD detection in long-tailed vision datasets by enhancing inter-sample relationships and addressing tail-class performance issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OOD detection is challenging in long-tailed datasets due to high false positive rates and poor tail-class classification accuracy in existing methods.

Method: Uses pre-trained model features to initialize graph structure, applies Gaussianization to normalize activations, and refines representation with GCNs for better feature space.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT, and ImageNet-LT benchmarks with significant improvements in FPR and tail-class accuracy.

Conclusion: Graph-based representation with GCNs and Gaussianization effectively addresses long-tailed OOD detection challenges and improves both OOD detection and tail-class classification.

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) data is essential for safe deployment of deep neural networks (DNNs). This problem becomes particularly challenging in the presence of long-tailed in-distribution (ID) datasets, often leading to high false positive rates (FPR) and low tail-class ID classification accuracy. In this paper, we demonstrate that exploiting inter-sample relationships using a graph-based representation can significantly improve OOD detection in long-tailed recognition of vision datasets. To this end, we use the feature space of a pre-trained model to initialize our graph structure. We account for the differences between the activation layer distribution of the pre-training vs. training data, and actively introduce Gaussianization to alleviate any deviations from a standard normal distribution in the activation layers of the pre-trained model. We then refine this initial graph representation using graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to arrive at a feature space suitable for long-tailed OOD detection. This leads us to address the inferior performance observed in ID tail-classes within existing OOD detection methods. Experiments over three benchmarks CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT, and ImageNet-LT demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin in terms of FPR and tail-class ID classification accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing wearable adversarial attacks fail to maintain concealment across long video sequences due to motion, pose changes, and garment deformation, creating safety and privacy risks in surveillance environments.

Method: Maps product images to UV space with compact palette and control-point parameterization, uses physically based human-garment simulation for motion and cloth dynamics, and employs expectation-over-transformation objective with temporal weighting to optimize control points.

Result: Achieves strong and stable concealment, high robustness to viewpoint changes, superior cross-model transferability, and reliable suppression in physical garments under indoor and outdoor recordings.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates real-world feasibility for generating natural, printable adversarial textures that remain effective throughout entire video sequences, addressing limitations of frame-by-frame optimization approaches.

Abstract: Deep neural networks used for human detection are highly vulnerable to adversarial manipulation, creating safety and privacy risks in real surveillance environments. Wearable attacks offer a realistic threat model, yet existing approaches usually optimize textures frame by frame and therefore fail to maintain concealment across long video sequences with motion, pose changes, and garment deformation. In this work, a sequence-level optimization framework is introduced to generate natural, printable adversarial textures for shirts, trousers, and hats that remain effective throughout entire walking videos in both digital and physical settings. Product images are first mapped to UV space and converted into a compact palette and control-point parameterization, with ICC locking to keep all colors printable. A physically based human-garment pipeline is then employed to simulate motion, multi-angle camera viewpoints, cloth dynamics, and illumination variation. An expectation-over-transformation objective with temporal weighting is used to optimize the control points so that detection confidence is minimized across whole sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate strong and stable concealment, high robustness to viewpoint changes, and superior cross-model transferability. Physical garments produced with sublimation printing achieve reliable suppression under indoor and outdoor recordings, confirming real-world feasibility.

### [16] [Mixture of Ranks with Degradation-Aware Routing for One-Step Real-World Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16024)
*Xiao He,Zhijun Tu,Kun Cheng,Mingrui Zhu,Jie Hu,Nannan Wang,Xinbo Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Mixture-of-Ranks (MoR) architecture for single-step image super-resolution, integrating sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with LoRA modules to adaptively handle complex real-world image degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dense Real-ISR models using LoRA fine-tuning cannot adaptively capture heterogeneous degradation characteristics or enable efficient knowledge sharing under computational constraints.

Method: Introduces MoR architecture with fine-grained expert partitioning (treating each LoRA rank as expert), degradation estimation module using CLIP embeddings, zero-expert slots, and degradation-aware load-balancing loss.

Result: Comprehensive experiments validate the framework's effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance in real-world image super-resolution.

Conclusion: The proposed MoR architecture successfully addresses limitations of dense models by enabling adaptive knowledge recombination and dynamic computational resource allocation based on degradation severity.

Abstract: The demonstrated success of sparsely-gated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures, exemplified by models such as DeepSeek and Grok, has motivated researchers to investigate their adaptation to diverse domains. In real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR), existing approaches mainly rely on fine-tuning pre-trained diffusion models through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) module to reconstruct high-resolution (HR) images. However, these dense Real-ISR models are limited in their ability to adaptively capture the heterogeneous characteristics of complex real-world degraded samples or enable knowledge sharing between inputs under equivalent computational budgets. To address this, we investigate the integration of sparse MoE into Real-ISR and propose a Mixture-of-Ranks (MoR) architecture for single-step image super-resolution. We introduce a fine-grained expert partitioning strategy that treats each rank in LoRA as an independent expert. This design enables flexible knowledge recombination while isolating fixed-position ranks as shared experts to preserve common-sense features and minimize routing redundancy. Furthermore, we develop a degradation estimation module leveraging CLIP embeddings and predefined positive-negative text pairs to compute relative degradation scores, dynamically guiding expert activation. To better accommodate varying sample complexities, we incorporate zero-expert slots and propose a degradation-aware load-balancing loss, which dynamically adjusts the number of active experts based on degradation severity, ensuring optimal computational resource allocation. Comprehensive experiments validate our framework's effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Laser cutting generates hazardous dust and smoke, requiring real-time monitoring. Speckle sensing can identify materials but faces challenges when laser color changes.

Method: Training a convolutional neural network (CNN) on laser speckle pattern datasets to classify different material types for safe laser cutting.

Result: Achieved 98.30% training accuracy, 96.88% validation accuracy, and 0.9643 F1-score on 3000 images across 30 materials, robust to laser color changes.

Conclusion: The proposed CNN-based speckle pattern analysis provides a robust and accurate solution for material-aware laser cutting systems.

Abstract: Laser cutting is a widely adopted technology in material processing across various industries, but it generates a significant amount of dust, smoke, and aerosols during operation, posing a risk to both the environment and workers' health. Speckle sensing has emerged as a promising method to monitor the cutting process and identify material types in real-time. This paper proposes a material classification technique using a speckle pattern of the material's surface based on deep learning to monitor and control the laser cutting process. The proposed method involves training a convolutional neural network (CNN) on a dataset of laser speckle patterns to recognize distinct material types for safe and efficient cutting. Previous methods for material classification using speckle sensing may face issues when the color of the laser used to produce the speckle pattern is changed. Experiments conducted in this study demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high accuracy in material classification, even when the laser color is changed. The model achieved an accuracy of 98.30 % on the training set and 96.88% on the validation set. Furthermore, the model was evaluated on a set of 3000 new images for 30 different materials, achieving an F1-score of 0.9643. The proposed method provides a robust and accurate solution for material-aware laser cutting using speckle sensing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CuriGS is a curriculum-guided framework that improves 3D Gaussian Splatting for sparse-view reconstruction by generating pseudo-views (students) around ground-truth poses and gradually introducing them with increasing perturbation levels during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending 3D Gaussian Splatting to sparse-view settings is challenging due to supervision scarcity and overfitting from limited viewpoint coverage, which CuriGS aims to address.

Method: Generates student views (pseudo-views) around ground-truth teacher poses with different perturbation levels, uses curriculum learning to gradually increase perturbation, applies depth-correlation and co-regularization, and retains best-performing students based on multi-signal quality metrics.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both rendering fidelity and geometric consistency across various synthetic and real sparse-view scenes.

Conclusion: CuriGS effectively addresses sparse-view 3D reconstruction challenges by curriculum-guided student view generation and quality-based selection, achieving superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as an efficient, high-fidelity representation for real-time scene reconstruction and rendering. However, extending 3DGS to sparse-view settings remains challenging because of supervision scarcity and overfitting caused by limited viewpoint coverage. In this paper, we present CuriGS, a curriculum-guided framework for sparse-view 3D reconstruction using 3DGS. CuriGS addresses the core challenge of sparse-view synthesis by introducing student views: pseudo-views sampled around ground-truth poses (teacher). For each teacher, we generate multiple groups of student views with different perturbation levels. During training, we follow a curriculum schedule that gradually unlocks higher perturbation level, randomly sampling candidate students from the active level to assist training. Each sampled student is regularized via depth-correlation and co-regularization, and evaluated using a multi-signal metric that combines SSIM, LPIPS, and an image-quality measure. For every teacher and perturbation level, we periodically retain the best-performing students and promote those that satisfy a predefined quality threshold to the training set, resulting in a stable augmentation of sparse training views. Experimental results show that CuriGS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both rendering fidelity and geometric consistency across various synthetic and real sparse-view scenes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cross-modal learning enriches high-resolution satellite imagery with UAV-level detail for crop canopy trait estimation, improving performance on agricultural monitoring tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Satellite missions are limited by spatial resolution for micro-plot management, while UAVs provide high-resolution data but have different operational constraints. There's a need to bridge the gap between these sensing modalities.

Method: A cross-modal learning strategy that learns fine-grained spectral-spatial correspondences between co-registered satellite-UAV image pairs from 84 hybrid maize varieties across five locations in the U.S. Corn Belt.

Result: Generated UAV-like representations from satellite inputs consistently outperform real satellite imagery on downstream tasks including yield and nitrogen prediction.

Conclusion: Cross-modal correspondence learning effectively bridges the gap between satellite and UAV sensing, enhancing agricultural monitoring capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in plant phenotyping have driven widespread adoption of multi sensor platforms for collecting crop canopy reflectance data. This includes the collection of heterogeneous data across multiple platforms, with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) seeing significant usage due to their high performance in crop monitoring, forecasting, and prediction tasks. Similarly, satellite missions have been shown to be effective for agriculturally relevant tasks. In contrast to UAVs, such missions are bound to the limitation of spatial resolution, which hinders their effectiveness for modern farming systems focused on micro-plot management. In this work, we propose a cross modal learning strategy that enriches high-resolution satellite imagery with UAV level visual detail for crop canopy trait estimation. Using a dataset of approximately co registered satellite UAV image pairs collected from replicated plots of 84 hybrid maize varieties across five distinct locations in the U.S. Corn Belt, we train a model that learns fine grained spectral spatial correspondences between sensing modalities. Results show that the generated UAV-like representations from satellite inputs consistently outperform real satellite imagery on multiple downstream tasks, including yield and nitrogen prediction, demonstrating the potential of cross-modal correspondence learning to bridge the gap between satellite and UAV sensing in agricultural monitoring.

*Qing Wang,Chong-Wah Ngo,Ee-Peng Lim,Qianru Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework using large language models (LLMs) to improve food recognition by generating food titles/ingredients from images, aligning text and image features in a shared space, and outperforming specialized methods on domain-shift, long-tailed, and fine-grained challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Food recognition faces domain-shift issues (training vs. real-world images), long-tailed data distributions, and subtle visual differences between similar dishes that make classification difficult.

Method: Use LLMs to parse food images and generate descriptive texts (titles/ingredients), then project both text and images to a shared embedding space to maximize pair similarities, and use aligned multimodal features for recognition.

Result: Outperforms existing approaches specifically designed for long-tailed distribution, domain adaptation, and fine-grained classification on two food datasets.

Conclusion: The simple LLM-powered framework effectively addresses multiple challenges in food recognition simultaneously through multimodal alignment of generated text and image features.

Abstract: Training a model for food recognition is challenging because the training samples, which are typically crawled from the Internet, are visually different from the pictures captured by users in the free-living environment. In addition to this domain-shift problem, the real-world food datasets tend to be long-tailed distributed and some dishes of different categories exhibit subtle variations that are difficult to distinguish visually. In this paper, we present a framework empowered with large language models (LLMs) to address these challenges in food recognition. We first leverage LLMs to parse food images to generate food titles and ingredients. Then, we project the generated texts and food images from different domains to a shared embedding space to maximize the pair similarities. Finally, we take the aligned features of both modalities for recognition. With this simple framework, we show that our proposed approach can outperform the existing approaches tailored for long-tailed data distribution, domain adaptation, and fine-grained classification, respectively, on two food datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AMS-KV is a scale-adaptive KV caching policy for visual autoregressive models that reduces KV cache usage by 84.83% and self-attention latency by 60.48% while maintaining generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV caching in next-scale prediction VAR models faces excessive memory growth with increasing scales, severely limiting scalability. Existing KV caching designs for this paradigm remain unexplored.

Method: AMS-KV prioritizes storing KVs from condensed and local scales based on observations that local scales contribute to quality and condensed scales stabilize generation. It identifies cache-demanding layers through inter-scale similarity analysis.

Result: Reduces KV cache usage by 84.83%, self-attention latency by 60.48%, and enables scaling to batch size 256 where baseline fails at 128 with improved throughput.

Conclusion: AMS-KV provides an effective KV caching policy for VAR models that significantly improves efficiency and scalability while preserving generation quality.

Abstract: Visual autoregressive modeling (VAR) via next-scale prediction has emerged as a scalable image generation paradigm. While Key and Value (KV) caching in large language models (LLMs) has been extensively studied, next-scale prediction presents unique challenges, and KV caching design for next-scale based VAR transformers remains largely unexplored. A major bottleneck is the excessive KV memory growth with the increasing number of scales-severely limiting scalability. Our systematic investigation reveals that: (1) Attending to tokens from local scales significantly contributes to generation quality (2) Allocating a small amount of memory for the coarsest scales, termed as condensed scales, stabilizes multi-scale image generation (3) Strong KV similarity across finer scales is predominantly observed in cache-efficient layers, whereas cache-demanding layers exhibit weaker inter-scale similarity. Based on the observations, we introduce AMS-KV, a scale-adaptive KV caching policy for next-scale prediction in VAR models. AMS-KV prioritizes storing KVs from condensed and local scales, preserving the most relevant tokens to maintain generation quality. It further optimizes KV cache utilization and computational efficiency identifying cache-demanding layers through inter-scale similarity analysis. Compared to the vanilla next-scale prediction-based VAR models, AMS-KV reduces KV cache usage by up to 84.83% and self-attention latency by 60.48%. Moreover, when the baseline VAR-d30 model encounters out-of-memory failures at a batch size of 128, AMS-KV enables stable scaling to a batch size of 256 with improved throughput.

Conclusion: LiSTAR provides a powerful foundation for creating realistic and controllable autonomous systems simulations through efficient, high-resolution compositional generation of 4D LiDAR data.

Abstract: Synthesizing high-fidelity and controllable 4D LiDAR data is crucial for creating scalable simulation environments for autonomous driving. This task is inherently challenging due to the sensor's unique spherical geometry, the temporal sparsity of point clouds, and the complexity of dynamic scenes. To address these challenges, we present LiSTAR, a novel generative world model that operates directly on the sensor's native geometry. LiSTAR introduces a Hybrid-Cylindrical-Spherical (HCS) representation to preserve data fidelity by mitigating quantization artifacts common in Cartesian grids. To capture complex dynamics from sparse temporal data, it utilizes a Spatio-Temporal Attention with Ray-Centric Transformer (START) that explicitly models feature evolution along individual sensor rays for robust temporal coherence. Furthermore, for controllable synthesis, we propose a novel 4D point cloud-aligned voxel layout for conditioning and a corresponding discrete Masked Generative START (MaskSTART) framework, which learns a compact, tokenized representation of the scene, enabling efficient, high-resolution, and layout-guided compositional generation. Comprehensive experiments validate LiSTAR's state-of-the-art performance across 4D LiDAR reconstruction, prediction, and conditional generation, with substantial quantitative gains: reducing generation MMD by a massive 76%, improving reconstruction IoU by 32%, and lowering prediction L1 Med by 50%. This level of performance provides a powerful new foundation for creating realistic and controllable autonomous systems simulations. Project link: https://ocean-luna.github.io/LiSTAR.gitub.io.

Conclusion: Training strategy optimization serves as an effective complement to architectural design in HSI models, with potential applications in climate-related remote sensing.

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification typically involves large-scale data and computationally intensive training, which limits the practical deployment of deep learning models in real-world remote sensing tasks. This study introduces SpectralTrain, a universal, architecture-agnostic training framework that enhances learning efficiency by integrating curriculum learning (CL) with principal component analysis (PCA)-based spectral downsampling. By gradually introducing spectral complexity while preserving essential information, SpectralTrain enables efficient learning of spectral -- spatial patterns at significantly reduced computational costs. The framework is independent of specific architectures, optimizers, or loss functions and is compatible with both classical and state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets -- Indian Pines, Salinas-A, and the newly introduced CloudPatch-7 -- demonstrate strong generalization across spatial scales, spectral characteristics, and application domains. The results indicate consistent reductions in training time by 2-7x speedups with small-to-moderate accuracy deltas depending on backbone. Its application to cloud classification further reveals potential in climate-related remote sensing, emphasizing training strategy optimization as an effective complement to architectural design in HSI models.

Conclusion: The approach successfully unlocks cross-task visual in-context learning boundaries within vision-language models, showing VLMs can perform VICL across different visual tasks.

Abstract: In large language models (LLM), in-context learning (ICL) refers to performing new tasks by conditioning on small demonstrations provided in the input context. Recent advances in visual in-context learning (VICL) demonstrate promising capabilities for solving downstream tasks by unified vision-language models (VLMs). When the visual prompt and the target images originate from different visual tasks, can VLMs still enable VICL? In the paper, we propose a fully collaborative pipeline, i.e. T2T-VICL, for VLMs to investigate the potential of cross-task VICL. Fundamentally, we design a mechanism to generate and select text prompts that best implicitly describe the differences between two distinct low-level vision tasks, and construct the first cross-task VICL dataset. Building upon this, we propose a novel inference framework that combines perceptual score-based reasoning with traditional evaluation metrics to perform cross-task VICL. Our approach achieves top-tier results across nine cross-task scenarios and second-tier performance in ten additional scenarios, unlocking the boundaries of cross-task VICL within VLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing latent diffusion models couple scale with content complexity, using more tokens for higher-resolution/frame-rate content. However, latent capacity should primarily depend on content complexity, with scale as an upper bound.

Supports decoding to arbitrary resolutions/frame rates within fixed latent representation and enables progressive coarse-to-fine generation by decomposing structural and detailed information.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while offering flexible generation across diverse scales and visual qualities.

Conclusion: DCS-LDM provides a novel paradigm for visual generation that decouples information complexity from scale, enabling flexible computation-quality tradeoffs and progressive generation.

Abstract: Existing latent diffusion models typically couple scale with content complexity, using more latent tokens to represent higher-resolution images or higher-frame rate videos. However, the latent capacity required to represent visual data primarily depends on content complexity, with scale serving only as an upper bound. Motivated by this observation, we propose DCS-LDM, a novel paradigm for visual generation that decouples information complexity from scale. DCS-LDM constructs a hierarchical, scale-independent latent space that models sample complexity through multi-level tokens and supports decoding to arbitrary resolutions and frame rates within a fixed latent representation. This latent space enables DCS-LDM to achieve a flexible computation-quality tradeoff. Furthermore, by decomposing structural and detailed information across levels, DCS-LDM supports a progressive coarse-to-fine generation paradigm. Experimental results show that DCS-LDM delivers performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while offering flexible generation across diverse scales and visual qualities.

### [29] [VTinker: Guided Flow Upsampling and Texture Mapping for High-Resolution Video Frame Interpolation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16124)
*Chenyang Wu,Jiayi Fu,Chun-Le Guo,Shuhao Han,Chongyi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VTinker is a novel Video Frame Interpolation pipeline that uses guided flow upsampling and texture mapping to address blurring and ghosting issues in high-resolution motion estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VFI methods struggle with blur/mosaic artifacts from bilinear upsampling of low-resolution flows and fail to capture fine pixel motion, leading to ghosting and discontinuities in interpolated frames.

Method: Proposes two components: 1) Guided Flow Upsampling (GFU) that uses input frames as guidance to refine flow edges, and 2) Texture Mapping that creates an intermediate proxy frame and maps clear texture blocks from input frames for final reconstruction.

Result: Extensive experiments show VTinker achieves state-of-the-art performance in Video Frame Interpolation, with code publicly available.

Conclusion: VTinker effectively addresses flow upsampling artifacts and texture misalignment through guided refinement and block-based texture mapping, producing high-quality interpolated frames.

Abstract: Due to large pixel movement and high computational cost, estimating the motion of high-resolution frames is challenging. Thus, most flow-based Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) methods first predict bidirectional flows at low resolution and then use high-magnification upsampling (e.g., bilinear) to obtain the high-resolution ones. However, this kind of upsampling strategy may cause blur or mosaic at the flows' edges. Additionally, the motion of fine pixels at high resolution cannot be adequately captured in motion estimation at low resolution, which leads to the misalignment of task-oriented flows. With such inaccurate flows, input frames are warped and combined pixel-by-pixel, resulting in ghosting and discontinuities in the interpolated frame. In this study, we propose a novel VFI pipeline, VTinker, which consists of two core components: guided flow upsampling (GFU) and Texture Mapping. After motion estimation at low resolution, GFU introduces input frames as guidance to alleviate the blurring details in bilinear upsampling flows, which makes flows' edges clearer. Subsequently, to avoid pixel-level ghosting and discontinuities, Texture Mapping generates an initial interpolated frame, referred to as the intermediate proxy. The proxy serves as a cue for selecting clear texture blocks from the input frames, which are then mapped onto the proxy to facilitate producing the final interpolated frame via a reconstruction module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VTinker achieves state-of-the-art performance in VFI. Codes are available at: https://github.com/Wucy0519/VTinker.

TL;DR: PiN-CLIP improves AI-generated image detection by injecting positive-incentive noise to suppress spurious shortcuts and amplify robust forensic cues, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the out-of-distribution generalization challenge in AI-generated image detection caused by spurious shortcuts exploited during training.

Method: Jointly train a noise generator and detection network using variational positive-incentive principle, injecting cross-attention fused noise into feature space to fine-tune visual encoder.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art performance with 5.4% average accuracy improvement over existing methods on dataset with 42 generative models.

Conclusion: PiN-CLIP effectively suppresses shortcut-sensitive directions while amplifying stable forensic cues, enabling more robust and generalized artifact representations for AI-generated image detection.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has made real and synthetic images increasingly indistinguishable. Although extensive efforts have been devoted to detecting AI-generated images, out-of-distribution generalization remains a persistent challenge. We trace this weakness to spurious shortcuts exploited during training and we also observe that small feature-space perturbations can mitigate shortcut dominance. To address this problem in a more controllable manner, we propose the Positive-Incentive Noise for CLIP (PiN-CLIP), which jointly trains a noise generator and a detection network under a variational positive-incentive principle. Specifically, we construct positive-incentive noise in the feature space via cross-attention fusion of visual and categorical semantic features. During optimization, the noise is injected into the feature space to fine-tune the visual encoder, suppressing shortcut-sensitive directions while amplifying stable forensic cues, thereby enabling the extraction of more robust and generalized artifact representations. Comparative experiments are conducted on an open-world dataset comprising synthetic images generated by 42 distinct generative models. Our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance, with notable improvements of 5.4 in average accuracy over existing approaches.

*Li Yu,Yingbo Zhao,Shiyu Wu,Siyue Yu,Moncef Gabbouj,Qingshan Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a blind video quality enhancement method with pretrained degradation representation learning and hierarchical termination mechanism to handle unknown QPs and varying computational demands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world scenarios often have unknown QPs, limiting non-blind methods. Current blind methods lack spatial degradation details and uniform architectures overlook varying computational needs across QPs.

Method: Pretrained DRL module extracts high-dimensional multiscale degradation representations, plus hierarchical termination mechanism that dynamically adjusts artifact reduction stages based on compression level.

Result: Achieves 110% PSNR improvement (0.31 dB to 0.65 dB) over state-of-the-art blind method at QP=22, and reduces average inference time by half at QP=22 vs QP=42.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively handles unknown QPs with improved performance and computational efficiency through degradation representation learning and adaptive termination.

Abstract: Existing studies on Quality Enhancement for Compressed Video (QECV) predominantly rely on known Quantization Parameters (QPs), employing distinct enhancement models per QP setting, termed non-blind methods. However, in real-world scenarios involving transcoding or transmission, QPs may be partially or entirely unknown, limiting the applicability of such approaches and motivating the development of blind QECV techniques. Current blind methods generate degradation vectors via classification models with cross-entropy loss, using them as channel attention to guide artifact removal. However, these vectors capture only global degradation information and lack spatial details, hindering adaptation to varying artifact patterns at different spatial positions. To address these limitations, we propose a pretrained Degradation Representation Learning (DRL) module that decouples and extracts high-dimensional, multiscale degradation representations from video content to guide the artifact removal. Additionally, both blind and non-blind methods typically employ uniform architectures across QPs, hence, overlooking the varying computational demands inherent to different compression levels. We thus introduce a hierarchical termination mechanism that dynamically adjusts the number of artifact reduction stages based on the compression level. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly enhances performance, achieving a PSNR improvement of 110% (from 0.31 dB to 0.65 dB) over a competing state-of-the-art blind method at QP = 22. Furthermore, the proposed hierarchical termination mechanism reduces the average inference time at QP = 22 by half compared to QP = 42.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There exists a gap between how 3D object detectors are trained and evaluated, stemming from lack of spatial reliability and ranking awareness during training, which conflicts with ranking-based prediction selection used during inference.

Method: Two main components: 1) Spatial-prioritized optimal transport assignment that dynamically emphasizes well-located and spatially reliable samples, 2) Rank-aware adaptive self-distillation scheme that adaptively injects ranking perception via self-distillation.

Result: Extensive experiments on ScanNet V2 and SUN RGB-D show SR3D significantly outperforms prior methods in accuracy while maintaining real-time speed.

Conclusion: SR3D effectively bridges the training-inference gap in 3D object detection and achieves superior performance for indoor point cloud analysis.

Abstract: Real-time 3D object detection from point clouds is essential for dynamic scene understanding in applications such as augmented reality, robotics and navigation. We introduce a novel Spatial-prioritized and Rank-aware 3D object detection (SR3D) framework for indoor point clouds, to bridge the gap between how detectors are trained and how they are evaluated. This gap stems from the lack of spatial reliability and ranking awareness during training, which conflicts with the ranking-based prediction selection used as inference. Such a training-inference gap hampers the model's ability to learn representations aligned with inference-time behavior. To address the limitation, SR3D consists of two components tailored to the spatial nature of point clouds during training: a novel spatial-prioritized optimal transport assignment that dynamically emphasizes well-located and spatially reliable samples, and a rank-aware adaptive self-distillation scheme that adaptively injects ranking perception via a self-distillation paradigm. Extensive experiments on ScanNet V2 and SUN RGB-D show that SR3D effectively bridges the training-inference gap and significantly outperforms prior methods in accuracy while maintaining real-time speed.

TL;DR: Proposes HSRW-CD dataset for high-resolution water body change detection and SSCP attention module to better exploit spatial semantics and structural information in deep features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address scarcity of high spatial resolution datasets for water body change detection and limitations of previous deep learning methods in exploiting spatial semantic and structural information.

Method: Introduces HSRW-CD dataset with >3m spatial resolution and SSCP attention module with three components: Multi-Semantic spatial Attention, Structural Relation-aware Global Attention, and Channel-wise Self-Attention.

Result: Experiments on HSRW-CD and Water-CD datasets validate effectiveness and generalization of SSCP module, significantly improving water body discrimination capability.

Conclusion: The proposed SSCP module effectively enhances spatial semantics and structure exploitation in water body change detection networks and can be integrated as plug-and-play module into existing models.

Abstract: Remote sensing Water Body Change Detection (WBCD) aims to detect water body surface changes from bi-temporal images of the same geographic area. Recently, the scarcity of high spatial resolution datasets for WBCD restricts its application in urban and rural regions, which require more accurate positioning. Meanwhile, previous deep learning-based methods fail to comprehensively exploit the spatial semantic and structural information in deep features in the change detection networks. To resolve these concerns, we first propose a new dataset, HSRW-CD, with a spatial resolution higher than 3 meters for WBCD. Specifically, it contains a large number of image pairs, widely covering various water body types. Besides, a Spatial Semantics and Continuity Perception (SSCP) attention module is designed to fully leverage both the spatial semantics and structure of deep features in the WBCD networks, significantly improving the discrimination capability for water body. The proposed SSCP has three components: the Multi-Semantic spatial Attention (MSA), the Structural Relation-aware Global Attention (SRGA), and the Channel-wise Self-Attention (CSA). The MSA enhances the spatial semantics of water body features and provides precise spatial semantic priors for the CSA. Then, the SRGA further extracts spatial structure to learn the spatial continuity of the water body. Finally, the CSA utilizes the spatial semantic and structural priors from the MSA and SRGA to compute the similarity across channels. Specifically designed as a plug-and-play module for water body deep features, the proposed SSCP allows integration into existing WBCD models. Numerous experiments conducted on the proposed HSRW-CD and Water-CD datasets validate the effectiveness and generalization of the SSCP. The code of this work and the HSRW-CD dataset will be accessed at https://github.com/QingMa1/SSCP.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LEGO-SLAM is the first real-time open-vocabulary SLAM system using 3D Gaussian Splatting that integrates language features through a scene-adaptive encoder-decoder, enabling semantic mapping while reducing memory usage and maintaining 15 FPS performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3DGS-based SLAM systems lack semantic understanding for robotic interaction, and existing language integration methods suffer from excessive memory demands and lack adaptability to novel environments.

Method: Uses a scene-adaptive encoder-decoder to distill high-dimensional language embeddings into compact 16D features, enabling language-guided pruning and language-based loop detection without separate models.

Result: Achieves competitive mapping quality and tracking accuracy while reducing Gaussian count by over 60% and maintaining real-time performance at 15 FPS.

Conclusion: LEGO-SLAM successfully integrates open-vocabulary semantic capabilities into real-time 3DGS SLAM while optimizing memory usage and maintaining performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems to build photorealistic maps. However, these maps lack the open-vocabulary semantic understanding required for advanced robotic interaction. Integrating language features into SLAM remains a significant challenge, as storing high-dimensional features demands excessive memory and rendering overhead, while existing methods with static models lack adaptability for novel environments. To address these limitations, we propose LEGO-SLAM (Language-Embedded Gaussian Optimization SLAM), the first framework to achieve real-time, open-vocabulary mapping within a 3DGS-based SLAM system. At the core of our method is a scene-adaptive encoder-decoder that distills high-dimensional language embeddings into a compact 16-dimensional feature space. This design reduces the memory per Gaussian and accelerates rendering, enabling real-time performance. Unlike static approaches, our encoder adapts online to unseen scenes. These compact features also enable a language-guided pruning strategy that identifies semantic redundancy, reducing the map's Gaussian count by over 60\% while maintaining rendering quality. Furthermore, we introduce a language-based loop detection approach that reuses these mapping features, eliminating the need for a separate detection model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LEGO-SLAM achieves competitive mapping quality and tracking accuracy, all while providing open-vocabulary capabilities at 15 FPS.

TL;DR: RGE enhances multimodal embeddings by incorporating explicit reasoning from MLLMs through structured rationale generation and contrastive training, improving multimodal retrieval by 4.9%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches treat embedding extraction as direct encoding, overlooking MLLMs' generative reasoning capability that could enhance representation quality.

Method: Proposes Reasoning Guided Embeddings (RGE) that preserves generative rationale process and couples it with contrastive training, enabling structured rationale generation before representation extraction.

Result: Experiments on MMEB benchmark show 4.9% improvement in multimodal retrieval performance over non-reasoning baseline.

Conclusion: Explicit reasoning can effectively enhance embedding quality in multimodal representation learning.

Abstract: Multimodal embeddings are widely used in downstream tasks such as multimodal retrieval, enabling alignment of interleaved modalities in a shared representation space. While recent studies show that Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can serve as strong embedding extractors, existing approaches treat embedding extraction as a direct encoding step, overlooking the fact that MLLMs possess the generative capability for reasoning that could be leveraged to enhance representation quality. In this work, we explore how to explicitly incorporate reasoning into the embedding process. To this end, we propose Reasoning Guided Embeddings (RGE), which preserves the generative rationale process of MLLMs and couples it with contrastive training. Our method first enables the model to perform structured rationale generation conditioned on the instruction, and then extracts representations after reasoning has unfolded. This simple design enhances the context-conditional inference signals within the embedding, leading to improved multimodal representation quality. Experiments on the MMEB benchmark show that reasoning-guided conditioning improves multimodal retrieval performance by 4.9% over the non-reasoning baseline, confirming that explicit reasoning can effectively enhance embedding quality.

TL;DR: PPCL is a pluggable pruning framework for Diffusion Transformers that reduces parameters by 50% with minimal performance degradation using layer distillation and flexible pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Transformers have high computational costs due to large parameter counts, limiting deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Method: Uses linear probing and similarity trend analysis to identify redundant layers, then applies plug-and-play teacher-student alternating distillation for depth-wise and width-wise pruning.

Result: Achieves 50% parameter reduction with less than 3% degradation in key metrics while maintaining high-quality image generation.

Conclusion: PPCL enables efficient DiT deployment in resource-constrained settings through flexible pruning without per-configuration retraining.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have shown exceptional performance in image generation, yet their large parameter counts incur high computational costs, impeding deployment in resource-constrained settings. To address this, we propose Pluggable Pruning with Contiguous Layer Distillation (PPCL), a flexible structured pruning framework specifically designed for DiT architectures. First, we identify redundant layer intervals through a linear probing mechanism combined with the first-order differential trend analysis of similarity metrics. Subsequently, we propose a plug-and-play teacher-student alternating distillation scheme tailored to integrate depth-wise and width-wise pruning within a single training phase. This distillation framework enables flexible knowledge transfer across diverse pruning ratios, eliminating the need for per-configuration retraining. Extensive experiments on multiple Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer architecture models demonstrate that PPCL achieves a 50\% reduction in parameter count compared to the full model, with less than 3\% degradation in key objective metrics. Notably, our method maintains high-quality image generation capabilities while achieving higher compression ratios, rendering it well-suited for resource-constrained environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current grid-based cognitive map methods rely on discretized raster representations that limit fine-grained spatial reasoning capabilities in MLLMs. There's a need to overcome this limitation to enable more precise spatial understanding.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Supervised fine-tuning using high-quality dataset from AI2THOR simulator to learn mapping from visual inputs to precise boundary coordinates. 2) Reinforcement fine-tuning to enhance real-world generalization. Also introduces QVS-Bench benchmark for evaluation.

Result: V2LO-7B model achieves average improvement of 4.92% over grid map-trained models on QVS-Bench and mainstream spatial reasoning benchmarks, validating the superiority of the continuous coordinate approach.

Conclusion: Using continuous object boundary coordinates instead of discretized grid representations significantly improves spatial reasoning capabilities in MLLMs, enabling quantitative spatial computation and reducing ambiguity in spatial relationship descriptions.

Abstract: Spatial intelligence is a critical frontier for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), empowering them to comprehend the physical world. Drawing inspiration from human perception mechanisms, existing studies attempt to construct a coherent spatial understanding via grid-based cognitive maps from multi-frame visual inputs. However, current grid-based map methods rely on discretized raster representations, which limit the model's ability in fine-grained spatial reasoning. To overcome this limitation, we propose Video2Layout, a framework for reconstructing metric-grounded spatial layouts from video. The framework employs continuous object boundary coordinates to quantify inter-object physical distances and object size. This empowers the model with quantitative spatial computation capabilities, effectively alleviating the inherent ambiguity when describing spatial relationships in natural language. Specifically, our method comprises two core stages. First, in supervised fine-tuning stage, we construct a high-quality dataset from the AI2THOR simulator, which enables the model to learn the mapping from visual inputs to precise boundary coordinates. Subsequently, a reinforcement fine-tuning stage further enhances the model's real-world generalization capabilities. To systematically evaluate the correlation between cognitive map accuracy and image quantity, as well as how the quantity of image inputs affects spatial reasoning accuracy, we introduce QVS-Bench, a diagnostic benchmark designed to analyze the relevant mechanisms. Evaluated on QVS-Bench and mainstream spatial reasoning benchmarks, our model, V2LO-7B achieves an average improvement of 4.92% over the model trained on grid maps, validating the superiority of our method.

TL;DR: Simba: A novel point cloud completion framework that reformulates transformation regression as distribution learning using diffusion models and hierarchical Mamba architecture to address overfitting and noise sensitivity issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of regression-based methods that overfit to instance-specific transformations and are sensitive to input noise, while preserving fine-grained details and global structural integrity in point cloud completion.

Method: Reformulates point-wise transformation regression as distribution learning, integrates symmetry priors with diffusion models for robust geometric structures, and uses hierarchical Mamba-based architecture for high-fidelity upsampling.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across PCN, ShapeNet, and KITTI benchmarks, demonstrating superior completion quality and robustness.

Conclusion: Simba effectively addresses overfitting and noise sensitivity in point cloud completion by combining distribution learning with diffusion models and hierarchical Mamba architecture, setting new SOTA performance.

Abstract: Point cloud completion is a fundamental task in 3D vision. A persistent challenge in this field is simultaneously preserving fine-grained details present in the input while ensuring the global structural integrity of the completed shape. While recent works leveraging local symmetry transformations via direct regression have significantly improved the preservation of geometric structure details, these methods suffer from two major limitations: (1) These regression-based methods are prone to overfitting which tend to memorize instant-specific transformations instead of learning a generalizable geometric prior. (2) Their reliance on point-wise transformation regression lead to high sensitivity to input noise, severely degrading their robustness and generalization. To address these challenges, we introduce Simba, a novel framework that reformulates point-wise transformation regression as a distribution learning problem. Our approach integrates symmetry priors with the powerful generative capabilities of diffusion models, avoiding instance-specific memorization while capturing robust geometric structures. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical Mamba-based architecture to achieve high-fidelity upsampling. Extensive experiments across the PCN, ShapeNet, and KITTI benchmarks validate our method's state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current adversarial training methods for robust segmentation suffer from clean-robustness trade-offs and high training costs, limiting scalability in medical imaging applications.

Method: Inject small zero-mean noise at multiple layers to learn frequency-bias priors, then apply selective wavelet reconstruction to suppress noise-sensitive frequency bands while enhancing structural cues and maintaining spectral consistency.

Result: On CT and ultrasound datasets, LNG-SWR consistently improves clean Dice/IoU and significantly reduces performance drops under strong attacks (PGD-L∞/L₂ and SSAH), with additive gains when combined with adversarial training.

Conclusion: LNG-SWR provides a simple, effective, and engineering-friendly path to robust medical image segmentation that works in both adversarial and standard training regimes without sacrificing clean accuracy.

Abstract: Clinical deployment requires segmentation models to stay stable under distribution shifts and perturbations. The mainstream solution is adversarial training (AT) to improve robustness; however, AT often brings a clean--robustness trade-off and high training/tuning cost, which limits scalability and maintainability in medical imaging. We propose \emph{Layer-wise Noise-Guided Selective Wavelet Reconstruction (LNG-SWR)}. During training, we inject small, zero-mean noise at multiple layers to learn a frequency-bias prior that steers representations away from noise-sensitive directions. We then apply prior-guided selective wavelet reconstruction on the input/feature branch to achieve frequency adaptation: suppress noise-sensitive bands, enhance directional structures and shape cues, and stabilize boundary responses while maintaining spectral consistency. The framework is backbone-agnostic and adds low additional inference overhead. It can serve as a plug-in enhancement to AT and also improves robustness without AT. On CT and ultrasound datasets, under a unified protocol with PGD-$L_{\infty}/L_{2}$ and SSAH, LNG-SWR delivers consistent gains on clean Dice/IoU and significantly reduces the performance drop under strong attacks; combining LNG-SWR with AT yields additive gains. When combined with adversarial training, robustness improves further without sacrificing clean accuracy, indicating an engineering-friendly and scalable path to robust segmentation. These results indicate that LNG-SWR provides a simple, effective, and engineering-friendly path to robust medical image segmentation in both adversarial and standard training regimes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing methods that only delay EOS token implicitly, lacking explicit optimization for maximizing output token length with stability and controllability.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Adversarial prompt search using reinforcement learning to find prompts inducing verbose outputs, 2) Vision-aligned perturbation optimization to craft adversarial images that match the adversarial prompt embeddings.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on four popular VLMs show significant advantages in effectiveness, efficiency, and generalization capability compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: VTIA successfully demonstrates the vulnerability of VLMs to verbose-text induction attacks, highlighting security concerns in practical deployment scenarios.

Abstract: With the remarkable success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on multimodal tasks, concerns regarding their deployment efficiency have become increasingly prominent. In particular, the number of tokens consumed during the generation process has emerged as a key evaluation metric.Prior studies have shown that specific inputs can induce VLMs to generate lengthy outputs with low information density, which significantly increases energy consumption, latency, and token costs. However, existing methods simply delay the occurrence of the EOS token to implicitly prolong output, and fail to directly maximize the output token length as an explicit optimization objective, lacking stability and controllability.To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel verbose-text induction attack (VTIA) to inject imperceptible adversarial perturbations into benign images via a two-stage framework, which identifies the most malicious prompt embeddings for optimizing and maximizing the output token of the perturbed images.Specifically, we first perform adversarial prompt search, employing reinforcement learning strategies to automatically identify adversarial prompts capable of inducing the LLM component within VLMs to produce verbose outputs. We then conduct vision-aligned perturbation optimization to craft adversarial examples on input images, maximizing the similarity between the perturbed image's visual embeddings and those of the adversarial prompt, thereby constructing malicious images that trigger verbose text generation. Comprehensive experiments on four popular VLMs demonstrate that our method achieves significant advantages in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and generalization capability.

Conclusion: EvoVLA effectively addresses stage hallucination in long-horizon manipulation, demonstrates strong sim-to-real transfer and generalization, making significant advances in VLA model performance for complex robotic tasks.

Abstract: Long-horizon robotic manipulation remains challenging for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models despite recent progress in zero-shot generalization and simulation-to-real-world transfer. Current VLA models suffer from stage hallucination, where agents exploit coarse evaluation signals to shortcut multi-step tasks, reporting high progress without truly completing them. We present EvoVLA, a self-supervised VLA framework that addresses this issue through three complementary components: Stage-Aligned Reward (SAR), which uses triplet contrastive learning with Gemini-generated hard negatives to prevent visual shortcuts; Pose-Based Object Exploration (POE), which grounds curiosity in relative object-gripper pose instead of raw pixels; and Long-Horizon Memory, which uses selective context retention and gated fusion to stabilize intrinsic shaping during extended rollouts. Extensive evaluations on Discoverse-L, a long-horizon manipulation benchmark with three multi-stage tasks, show that EvoVLA improves average task success by 10.2 percentage points over the strongest baseline (OpenVLA-OFT), reaching 69.2 percent. EvoVLA also achieves one-and-a-half times better sample efficiency and reduces stage hallucination from 38.5 percent to 14.8 percent. Real-world deployment on physical robots reaches an average success rate of 54.6 percent across four manipulation tasks, outperforming OpenVLA-OFT by 11 points, demonstrating effective sim-to-real transfer and strong generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods don't fully explore CLIP's performance boundaries for dense prediction from an interpretability perspective, particularly addressing how CLIP diverts attention to irrelevant tokens.

Method: Training-free approach that identifies and filters dimension-specific over-activated distraction tokens, then refocuses attention back to target regions to enhance multimodal alignment granularity.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on eight benchmarks while maintaining high inference efficiency.

Conclusion: RF-CLIP successfully addresses CLIP's attention distraction problem and significantly improves dense prediction performance through interpretability-driven refinement.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) employs pixel-level vision-language alignment to associate category-related prompts with corresponding pixels. A key challenge is enhancing the multimodal dense prediction capability, specifically this pixel-level multimodal alignment. Although existing methods achieve promising results by leveraging CLIP's vision-language alignment, they rarely investigate the performance boundaries of CLIP for dense prediction from an interpretability mechanisms perspective. In this work, we systematically investigate CLIP's internal mechanisms and identify a critical phenomenon: analogous to human distraction, CLIP diverts significant attention resources from target regions to irrelevant tokens. Our analysis reveals that these tokens arise from dimension-specific over-activation; filtering them enhances CLIP's dense prediction performance. Consequently, we propose ReFocusing CLIP (RF-CLIP), a training-free approach that emulates human distraction-refocusing behavior to redirect attention from distraction tokens back to target regions, thereby refining CLIP's multimodal alignment granularity. Our method achieves SOTA performance on eight benchmarks while maintaining high inference efficiency.

Current visual state is provided to DiT via residual connection, enabling meta queries to capture latent actions that boost explicit action learning.

Result: Achieves 96.7% success rate on LIBERO benchmark after fine-tuning, surpassing baselines with high convergence speed. Real-world evaluations show Mantis outperforms π₀.₅ in instruction-following, generalization to unseen instructions, and reasoning ability.

Conclusion: The disentanglement approach reduces VLA backbone burden, enabling maintenance of comprehension and reasoning capabilities through language supervision. The framework demonstrates superior performance in robotics manipulation tasks while preserving language understanding.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models demonstrate that visual signals can effectively complement sparse action supervisions. However, letting VLA directly predict high-dimensional visual states can distribute model capacity and incur prohibitive training cost, while compressing visual states into more compact supervisory signals inevitably incurs information bottlenecks. Moreover, existing methods often suffer from poor comprehension and reasoning capabilities due to the neglect of language supervision. This paper introduces Mantis, a novel framework featuring a Disentangled Visual Foresight (DVF) to tackle these issues. Specifically, Mantis decouples visual foresight prediction from the backbone with the combination of meta queries and a diffusion Transformer (DiT) head. With the current visual state provided to the DiT via a residual connection, a simple next-state prediction objective enables the meta queries to automatically capture the latent actions that delineate the visual trajectory, and hence boost the learning of explicit actions. The disentanglement reduces the burden of the VLA backbone, enabling it to maintain comprehension and reasoning capabilities through language supervision. Empirically, pretrained on human manipulation videos, robot demonstrations, and image-text pairs, Mantis achieves a 96.7% success rate on LIBERO benchmark after fine-tuning, surpassing powerful baselines while exhibiting high convergence speed. Real-world evaluations show that Mantis outperforms $π_{0.5}$, a leading open-source VLA model, particularly in instruction-following capability, generalization to unseen instructions, and reasoning ability. Code and weights are released to support the open-source community.

*Nianchang Huang,Yi Xu,Ruida Xi,Ruida Xi,Qiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a two-stage unsupervised domain adaptation method (DSLGA) for Visible-Infrared person Re-Identification to handle modality discrepancies between public datasets and real-world data without requiring new annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VI-ReID algorithms perform well on public datasets but struggle in real-world applications due to discrepancies between public and real-world data. The paper aims to enable knowledge transfer from labeled public data to unlabeled real-world data without accuracy loss.

Method: Proposes DSLGA with two stages: 1) Pre-training stage uses Domain-Shared Learning Strategy (DSLS) to mitigate inter-domain modality discrepancies by exploiting shared information between source and target domains. 2) Fine-tuning stage uses Gradual Alignment Strategy (GAS) to handle intra-domain modality discrepancies through cluster-to-holistic alignment. Also introduces CMDA-XD testing method.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method significantly outperforms existing domain adaptation methods for VI-ReID and even some supervised methods under various settings.

Conclusion: The proposed DSLGA framework effectively addresses both inter-domain and intra-domain modality discrepancies in UDA-VI-ReID, achieving superior performance compared to existing methods and demonstrating practical applicability for real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Recently, Visible-Infrared person Re-Identification (VI-ReID) has achieved remarkable performance on public datasets. However, due to the discrepancies between public datasets and real-world data, most existing VI-ReID algorithms struggle in real-life applications. To address this, we take the initiative to investigate Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Visible-Infrared person Re-Identification (UDA-VI-ReID), aiming to transfer the knowledge learned from the public data to real-world data without compromising accuracy and requiring the annotation of new samples. Specifically, we first analyze two basic challenges in UDA-VI-ReID, i.e., inter-domain modality discrepancies and intra-domain modality discrepancies. Then, we design a novel two-stage model, i.e., Domain-Shared Learning and Gradual Alignment (DSLGA), to handle these discrepancies. In the first pre-training stage, DSLGA introduces a Domain-Shared Learning Strategy (DSLS) to mitigate ineffective pre-training caused by inter-domain modality discrepancies via exploiting shared information between the source and target domains. While, in the second fine-tuning stage, DSLGA designs a Gradual Alignment Strategy (GAS) to handle the cross-modality alignment challenges between visible and infrared data caused by the large intra-domain modality discrepancies through a cluster-to-holistic alignment way. Finally, a new UDA-VI-ReID testing method i.e., CMDA-XD, is constructed for training and testing different UDA-VI-ReID models. A large amount of experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing domain adaptation methods for VI-ReID and even some supervised methods under various settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep-learning methods treat organ substructures independently, leading to anatomically implausible reconstructions that don't respect the interconnected nature of human organs.

Method: Uses a connected template and jointly deforms all substructures to match patient-specific anatomy while preserving internal boundaries and enforcing smooth surfaces.

Result: Achieves high geometric accuracy, correct topology, and robust performance on heart, hippocampus, and lungs, even with limited or noisy training data.

Conclusion: PrIntMesh outperforms voxel- and surface-based methods by better reconstructing shared interfaces, maintaining structural consistency, and providing a data-efficient solution for clinical use.

Abstract: Human organs are composed of interconnected substructures whose geometry and spatial relationships constrain one another. Yet, most deep-learning approaches treat these parts independently, producing anatomically implausible reconstructions. We introduce PrIntMesh, a template-based, topology-preserving framework that reconstructs organs as unified systems. Starting from a connected template, PrIntMesh jointly deforms all substructures to match patient-specific anatomy, while explicitly preserving internal boundaries and enforcing smooth, artifact-free surfaces. We demonstrate its effectiveness on the heart, hippocampus, and lungs, achieving high geometric accuracy, correct topology, and robust performance even with limited or noisy training data. Compared to voxel- and surface-based methods, PrIntMesh better reconstructs shared interfaces, maintains structural consistency, and provides a data-efficient solution suitable for clinical use.

TL;DR: VLA-Fool is a comprehensive study of multimodal adversarial robustness in Vision-Language-Action models, introducing three levels of attacks and revealing that even minor multimodal perturbations cause significant behavioral deviations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The adversarial robustness of Vision-Language-Action models remains largely unexplored, especially under realistic multimodal and black-box conditions, with existing studies overlooking cross-modal misalignment that affects embodied reasoning.

Method: VLA-Fool unifies three levels of multimodal adversarial attacks: textual perturbations (gradient-based and prompt-based), visual perturbations (patch and noise distortions), and cross-modal misalignment attacks. It also incorporates a VLA-aware semantic space into linguistic prompts.

Result: Experiments on the LIBERO benchmark using a fine-tuned OpenVLA model reveal that even minor multimodal perturbations can cause significant behavioral deviations, demonstrating the fragility of embodied multimodal alignment.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the vulnerability of embodied VLA models to multimodal adversarial attacks and highlights the importance of addressing cross-modal misalignment for robust embodied AI systems.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) have recently demonstrated remarkable progress in embodied environments, enabling robots to perceive, reason, and act through unified multimodal understanding. Despite their impressive capabilities, the adversarial robustness of these systems remains largely unexplored, especially under realistic multimodal and black-box conditions. Existing studies mainly focus on single-modality perturbations and overlook the cross-modal misalignment that fundamentally affects embodied reasoning and decision-making. In this paper, we introduce VLA-Fool, a comprehensive study of multimodal adversarial robustness in embodied VLA models under both white-box and black-box settings. VLA-Fool unifies three levels of multimodal adversarial attacks: (1) textual perturbations through gradient-based and prompt-based manipulations, (2) visual perturbations via patch and noise distortions, and (3) cross-modal misalignment attacks that intentionally disrupt the semantic correspondence between perception and instruction. We further incorporate a VLA-aware semantic space into linguistic prompts, developing the first automatically crafted and semantically guided prompting framework. Experiments on the LIBERO benchmark using a fine-tuned OpenVLA model reveal that even minor multimodal perturbations can cause significant behavioral deviations, demonstrating the fragility of embodied multimodal alignment.

*Melih Baydar,Emre Akbas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ICCE introduces adaptive nearest neighbor selection and cluster ensembling to improve unsupervised image classification, achieving state-of-the-art performance including 70.4% accuracy on ImageNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the performance gap between unsupervised and supervised image classification by enhancing clustering methods without representation learning, leveraging foundational models.

Method: Multi-head clustering on frozen backbone, adaptive nearest neighbor selection, cluster ensembling to create consensus clustering, then training classifier with pseudo-labels.

Result: Achieved 99.3% accuracy on CIFAR10, 89% on CIFAR100, and 70.4% on ImageNet - first unsupervised method to exceed 70% on ImageNet.

Conclusion: ICCE demonstrates that cluster ensembling with adaptive neighbor selection can significantly improve unsupervised image classification performance, narrowing the gap with supervised methods.

Abstract: Unsupervised image classification, or image clustering, aims to group unlabeled images into semantically meaningful categories. Early methods integrated representation learning and clustering within an iterative framework. However, the rise of foundational models have recently shifted focus solely to clustering, bypassing the representation learning step. In this work, we build upon a recent multi-head clustering approach by introducing adaptive nearest neighbor selection and cluster ensembling strategies to improve clustering performance. Our method, "Image Clustering through Cluster Ensembles" (ICCE), begins with a clustering stage, where we train multiple clustering heads on a frozen backbone, producing diverse image clusterings. We then employ a cluster ensembling technique to consolidate these potentially conflicting results into a unified consensus clustering. Finally, we train an image classifier using the consensus clustering result as pseudo-labels. ICCE achieves state-of-the-art performance on ten image classification benchmarks, achieving 99.3% accuracy on CIFAR10, 89% on CIFAR100, and 70.4% on ImageNet datasets, narrowing the performance gap with supervised methods. To the best of our knowledge, ICCE is the first fully unsupervised image classification method to exceed 70% accuracy on ImageNet.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art MLLMs lack the ability to 'read the room' and assess deception in social interactions, which is a core component of human intelligence.

Method: Introduced Multimodal Interactive Deception Assessment (MIDA) task with synchronized video-text dataset. Evaluated 12 MLLMs and proposed Social Chain-of-Thought (SoCoT) reasoning pipeline with Dynamic Social Epistemic Memory (DSEM) module.

Result: Significant performance gap found - even powerful models like GPT-4o struggle to distinguish truth from falsehood reliably. Models fail to ground language in multimodal social cues and lack ability to model others' knowledge, beliefs, or intentions.

Conclusion: The proposed SoCoT and DSEM framework yields performance improvement, demonstrating a promising path toward building MLLMs capable of genuine human-like social reasoning.

Abstract: Despite their advanced reasoning capabilities, state-of-the-art Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrably lack a core component of human intelligence: the ability to `read the room' and assess deception in complex social interactions. To rigorously quantify this failure, we introduce a new task, Multimodal Interactive Deception Assessment (MIDA), and present a novel multimodal dataset providing synchronized video and text with verifiable ground-truth labels for every statement. We establish a comprehensive benchmark evaluating 12 state-of-the-art open- and closed-source MLLMs, revealing a significant performance gap: even powerful models like GPT-4o struggle to distinguish truth from falsehood reliably. Our analysis of failure modes indicates that these models fail to effectively ground language in multimodal social cues and lack the ability to model what others know, believe, or intend, highlighting the urgent need for novel approaches to building more perceptive and trustworthy AI systems. To take a step forward, we design a Social Chain-of-Thought (SoCoT) reasoning pipeline and a Dynamic Social Epistemic Memory (DSEM) module. Our framework yields performance improvement on this challenging task, demonstrating a promising new path toward building MLLMs capable of genuine human-like social reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SwiTrack is a novel state-switching framework for cross-modal object tracking (RGB-NIR) that uses three specialized streams to handle different modalities and invalid inputs, achieving state-of-the-art performance with real-time tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for cross-modal object tracking use parallel RGB and NIR branches connected to a shared backbone, which limits extraction of modality-specific features and fails to address object drift with unreliable inputs.

Method: Proposes three specialized streams: visual encoder for RGB frames, NIR gated adapter with visual encoder for NIR frames, and consistency trajectory prediction module for invalid modalities. Also uses dynamic template reconstruction and similarity alignment loss.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 7.2% precision rate gain and 4.3% success rate gain, while maintaining real-time tracking at 65 frames per second.

Conclusion: SwiTrack effectively addresses cross-modal object tracking challenges by handling different modalities and unreliable inputs through specialized streams, demonstrating superior performance and real-time capability.

Abstract: Cross-modal object tracking (CMOT) is an emerging task that maintains target consistency while the video stream switches between different modalities, with only one modality available in each frame, mostly focusing on RGB-Near Infrared (RGB-NIR) tracking. Existing methods typically connect parallel RGB and NIR branches to a shared backbone, which limits the comprehensive extraction of distinctive modality-specific features and fails to address the issue of object drift, especially in the presence of unreliable inputs. In this paper, we propose SwiTrack, a novel state-switching framework that redefines CMOT through the deployment of three specialized streams. Specifically, RGB frames are processed by the visual encoder, while NIR frames undergo refinement via a NIR gated adapter coupled with the visual encoder to progressively calibrate shared latent space features, thereby yielding more robust cross-modal representations. For invalid modalities, a consistency trajectory prediction module leverages spatio-temporal cues to estimate target movement, ensuring robust tracking and mitigating drift. Additionally, we incorporate dynamic template reconstruction to iteratively update template features and employ a similarity alignment loss to reinforce feature consistency. Experimental results on the latest benchmarks demonstrate that our tracker achieves state-of-the-art performance, boosting precision rate and success rate gains by 7.2\% and 4.3\%, respectively, while maintaining real-time tracking at 65 frames per second.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AR/VR systems only track head and hands via HMDs and controllers, leaving full-body reconstruction incomplete. There's a need to generate realistic full-body motions from limited sensor inputs.

Method: Multi-layer perceptron backbone enhanced with residual connections and Memory-Block component that represents missing sensor data with trainable code-vectors, combined with sparse signals from previous time instances for temporal consistency. Formulated as multi-task learning.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by substantially reducing prediction errors. Achieves 72 FPS on mobile HMDs, improving accuracy-running time tradeoff.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses the challenge of incomplete full-body tracking in AR/VR by generating realistic motions from sparse inputs with improved accuracy and real-time performance.

Abstract: Realistic and smooth full-body tracking is crucial for immersive AR/VR applications. Existing systems primarily track head and hands via Head Mounted Devices (HMDs) and controllers, making the 3D full-body reconstruction in-complete. One potential approach is to generate the full-body motions from sparse inputs collected from limited sensors using a Neural Network (NN) model. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) backbone that is enhanced with residual connections and a novel NN-component called Memory-Block. In particular, Memory-Block represents missing sensor data with trainable code-vectors, which are combined with the sparse signals from previous time instances to improve the temporal consistency. Furthermore, we formulate our solution as a multi-task learning problem, allowing our MLP-backbone to learn robust representations that boost accuracy. Our experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by substantially reducing prediction errors. Moreover, it achieves 72 FPS on mobile HMDs that ultimately improves the accuracy-running time tradeoff.

TL;DR: TetraSDF is a precise analytic meshing framework for neural SDFs that uses tetrahedral positional encoding to enable exact mesh extraction matching the zero-level set, overcoming discretization errors and ReLU MLP limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for extracting meshes from neural SDFs have limitations: sampling-based approaches introduce discretization error, while analytic methods only work with plain ReLU MLPs without positional encoders.

Method: Uses ReLU MLP composed with multi-resolution tetrahedral positional encoder, with barycentric interpolation preserving global CPWA structure to track ReLU linear regions within encoder-induced polyhedral complex, plus fixed analytic input preconditioner to reduce directional bias.

Result: Matches or surpasses existing grid-based encoders in SDF reconstruction accuracy, produces highly self-consistent meshes faithful to learned isosurfaces with practical runtime and memory efficiency.

Conclusion: TetraSDF enables precise analytic meshing for SDFs with positional encoders, providing exact mesh extraction that overcomes limitations of previous methods.

Abstract: Extracting meshes that exactly match the zero-level set of neural signed distance functions (SDFs) remains challenging. Sampling-based methods introduce discretization error, while continuous piecewise affine (CPWA) analytic approaches apply only to plain ReLU MLPs. We present TetraSDF, a precise analytic meshing framework for SDFs represented by a ReLU MLP composed with a multi-resolution tetrahedral positional encoder. The encoder's barycentric interpolation preserves global CPWA structure, enabling us to track ReLU linear regions within an encoder-induced polyhedral complex. A fixed analytic input preconditioner derived from the encoder's metric further reduces directional bias and stabilizes training. Across multiple benchmarks, TetraSDF matches or surpasses existing grid-based encoders in SDF reconstruction accuracy, and its analytic extractor produces highly self-consistent meshes that remain faithful to the learned isosurfaces, all with practical runtime and memory efficiency.

A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based augmentation method was imposed to balance class distributions and better generalize the model. Further, a self-supervised contrastive pre-training method helps to learn more features from limited annotated data. Experimental results yield superior results with 99.33% accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on multi-benchmark datasets. The proposed model architecture enables local, global, and relational feature representations and offers high interpretability and adaptability.

TL;DR: Texture3dgs optimizes 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for mobile GPUs by developing a novel sorting algorithm optimized for 2D texture cache and improving memory layout, achieving up to 4.1× sorting speedup and 1.7× overall reconstruction speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient 3D scene reconstruction on mobile devices for benefits like data privacy, offline operation, and faster responses, while addressing the challenge of optimizing for mobile GPU's 2D texture cache.

Method: Developed a novel sorting algorithm optimized for 2D memory texture cache, improved variable layout design, and other optimizations specifically for mobile GPU deployment of 3DGS.

Result: Achieved up to 4.1× speedup for sorting operations, 1.7× overall speedup for 3D scene reconstruction, and reduced memory usage by up to 1.6× compared to baseline implementations.

Conclusion: Texture3dgs effectively optimizes 3DGS for mobile deployment through texture cache-aware algorithms and memory optimizations, demonstrating significant performance improvements for mobile 3D scene reconstruction.

Abstract: Image-based 3D scene reconstruction, which transforms multi-view images into a structured 3D representation of the surrounding environment, is a common task across many modern applications. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a new paradigm to address this problem and offers considerable efficiency as compared to the previous methods. Motivated by this, and considering various benefits of mobile device deployment (data privacy, operating without internet connectivity, and potentially faster responses), this paper develops Texture3dgs, an optimized mapping of 3DGS for a mobile GPU. A critical challenge in this area turns out to be optimizing for the two-dimensional (2D) texture cache, which needs to be exploited for faster executions on mobile GPUs. As a sorting method dominates the computations in 3DGS on mobile platforms, the core of Texture3dgs is a novel sorting algorithm where the processing, data movement, and placement are highly optimized for 2D memory. The properties of this algorithm are analyzed in view of a cost model for the texture cache. In addition, we accelerate other steps of the 3DGS algorithm through improved variable layout design and other optimizations. End-to-end evaluation shows that Texture3dgs delivers up to 4.1$\times$ and 1.7$\times$ speedup for the sorting and overall 3D scene reconstruction, respectively -- while also reducing memory usage by up to 1.6$\times$ -- demonstrating the effectiveness of our design for efficient mobile 3D scene reconstruction.

TL;DR: Upsample Anything is a test-time optimization framework that upsamples low-resolution features from Vision Foundation Models to high-resolution outputs using a learned anisotropic Gaussian kernel, without requiring training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Foundation Models have strong generalization but their representations are heavily downsampled (14x/16x), limiting pixel-level applications. Existing upsampling methods require dataset-specific retraining or heavy optimization, reducing scalability.

Method: Per-image optimization learns an anisotropic Gaussian kernel combining spatial and range cues, bridging Gaussian Splatting and Joint Bilateral Upsampling. The kernel acts as a universal, edge-aware operator for cross-architecture and cross-modality transfer.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on semantic segmentation, depth estimation, and depth/probability map upsampling. Runs in ≈0.419s per 224x224 image.

Conclusion: The framework enables precise high-resolution reconstruction of features, depth, or probability maps from low-resolution Vision Foundation Model outputs, offering efficient and scalable upsampling without training.

Abstract: We present \textbf{Upsample Anything}, a lightweight test-time optimization (TTO) framework that restores low-resolution features to high-resolution, pixel-wise outputs without any training. Although Vision Foundation Models demonstrate strong generalization across diverse downstream tasks, their representations are typically downsampled by 14x/16x (e.g., ViT), which limits their direct use in pixel-level applications. Existing feature upsampling approaches depend on dataset-specific retraining or heavy implicit optimization, restricting scalability and generalization. Upsample Anything addresses these issues through a simple per-image optimization that learns an anisotropic Gaussian kernel combining spatial and range cues, effectively bridging Gaussian Splatting and Joint Bilateral Upsampling. The learned kernel acts as a universal, edge-aware operator that transfers seamlessly across architectures and modalities, enabling precise high-resolution reconstruction of features, depth, or probability maps. It runs in only $\approx0.419 \text{s}$ per 224x224 image and achieves state-of-the-art performance on semantic segmentation, depth estimation, and both depth and probability map upsampling.

TL;DR: SAEs are reinterpreted as topic models, leading to SAE-TM framework that learns reusable topic atoms for coherent thematic analysis across text and image datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the role and practical value of sparse autoencoders by showing they can be naturally understood as topic models rather than just steerable directions.

Method: Extend Latent Dirichlet Allocation to embedding spaces, derive SAE objective as MAP estimator, and introduce SAE-TM framework that trains SAEs to learn reusable topic atoms interpretable as word distributions.

Result: SAE-TM produces more coherent topics than strong baselines on text and image datasets while maintaining diversity, and enables analysis of thematic structure in images and topic evolution over time.

Conclusion: SAEs are positioned as effective tools for large-scale thematic analysis across modalities through their reinterpretation as topic models.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are used to analyze embeddings, but their role and practical value are debated. We propose a new perspective on SAEs by demonstrating that they can be naturally understood as topic models. We extend Latent Dirichlet Allocation to embedding spaces and derive the SAE objective as a maximum a posteriori estimator under this model. This view implies SAE features are thematic components rather than steerable directions. Based on this, we introduce SAE-TM, a topic modeling framework that: (1) trains an SAE to learn reusable topic atoms, (2) interprets them as word distributions on downstream data, and (3) merges them into any number of topics without retraining. SAE-TM yields more coherent topics than strong baselines on text and image datasets while maintaining diversity. Finally, we analyze thematic structure in image datasets and trace topic changes over time in Japanese woodblock prints. Our work positions SAEs as effective tools for large-scale thematic analysis across modalities. Code and data will be released upon publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NaTex is a native 3D texture generation framework that directly predicts texture colors in 3D space, avoiding limitations of traditional multi-view diffusion approaches by treating texture as a dense color point cloud.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of previous MVD-based approaches that struggle with occluded regions, mesh-texture alignment, and cross-view consistency in both content and color intensity.

Method: Proposes latent color diffusion with geometry-aware color point cloud VAE and multi-control diffusion transformer (DiT), trained from scratch using 3D data. Uses native geometry control via positional embeddings and geometry latents for precise alignment.

Result: NaTex significantly outperforms previous methods in texture coherence and alignment, and demonstrates strong generalization capabilities for various downstream applications.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses key challenges in 3D texture generation and shows promising performance and versatility for practical applications.

Abstract: We present NaTex, a native texture generation framework that predicts texture color directly in 3D space. In contrast to previous approaches that rely on baking 2D multi-view images synthesized by geometry-conditioned Multi-View Diffusion models (MVDs), NaTex avoids several inherent limitations of the MVD pipeline. These include difficulties in handling occluded regions that require inpainting, achieving precise mesh-texture alignment along boundaries, and maintaining cross-view consistency and coherence in both content and color intensity. NaTex features a novel paradigm that addresses the aforementioned issues by viewing texture as a dense color point cloud. Driven by this idea, we propose latent color diffusion, which comprises a geometry-awared color point cloud VAE and a multi-control diffusion transformer (DiT), entirely trained from scratch using 3D data, for texture reconstruction and generation. To enable precise alignment, we introduce native geometry control that conditions the DiT on direct 3D spatial information via positional embeddings and geometry latents. We co-design the VAE-DiT architecture, where the geometry latents are extracted via a dedicated geometry branch tightly coupled with the color VAE, providing fine-grained surface guidance that maintains strong correspondence with the texture. With these designs, NaTex demonstrates strong performance, significantly outperforming previous methods in texture coherence and alignment. Moreover, NaTex also exhibits strong generalization capabilities, either training-free or with simple tuning, for various downstream applications, e.g., material generation, texture refinement, and part segmentation and texturing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WWE-UIE is a compact underwater image enhancement network that integrates adaptive white balance, wavelet-based enhancement, and gradient-aware modules to achieve efficient real-time restoration with competitive quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hybrid UIE approaches achieve strong performance but incur high computational costs, limiting their practicality in real-time scenarios on resource-limited platforms.

Method: Integrates three interpretable priors: adaptive white balance for color correction, wavelet-based enhancement block for multi-band decomposition, and gradient-aware module with Sobel operators for edge preservation.

Result: Achieves competitive restoration quality with substantially fewer parameters and FLOPs, enabling real-time inference on resource-limited platforms.

Conclusion: WWE-UIE provides an efficient solution for underwater image enhancement that balances performance and computational efficiency, making it suitable for real-time applications.

Abstract: Underwater Image Enhancement (UIE) aims to restore visibility and correct color distortions caused by wavelength-dependent absorption and scattering. Recent hybrid approaches, which couple domain priors with modern deep neural architectures, have achieved strong performance but incur high computational cost, limiting their practicality in real-time scenarios. In this work, we propose WWE-UIE, a compact and efficient enhancement network that integrates three interpretable priors. First, adaptive white balance alleviates the strong wavelength-dependent color attenuation, particularly the dominance of blue-green tones. Second, a wavelet-based enhancement block (WEB) performs multi-band decomposition, enabling the network to capture both global structures and fine textures, which are critical for underwater restoration. Third, a gradient-aware module (SGFB) leverages Sobel operators with learnable gating to explicitly preserve edge structures degraded by scattering. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that WWE-UIE achieves competitive restoration quality with substantially fewer parameters and FLOPs, enabling real-time inference on resource-limited platforms. Ablation studies and visualizations further validate the contribution of each component. The source code is available at https://github.com/chingheng0808/WWE-UIE.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ChangeDINO is a Siamese framework for building change detection that combines lightweight backbones with frozen DINOv3 features, uses spatial-spectral transformers to highlight true changes, and includes learnable morphology for boundary refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for remote sensing change detection rely too much on change-map annotations and underuse semantic information from non-changing regions, limiting robustness under illumination variation, off-nadir views, and scarce labels.

Method: End-to-end multiscale Siamese framework with: 1) Lightweight backbone fused with frozen DINOv3 features for semantic-rich pyramids, 2) Spatial-spectral differential transformer decoder using multi-scale absolute differences as change priors, 3) Learnable morphology module for boundary refinement.

Result: Experiments on four public benchmarks show ChangeDINO consistently outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods in IoU and F1 scores. Ablation studies confirm each component's effectiveness.

Conclusion: ChangeDINO provides robust building change detection by effectively leveraging semantic information and multi-scale features, with superior performance demonstrated across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection (RSCD) aims to identify surface changes from co-registered bi-temporal images. However, many deep learning-based RSCD methods rely solely on change-map annotations and underuse the semantic information in non-changing regions, which limits robustness under illumination variation, off-nadir views, and scarce labels. This article introduces ChangeDINO, an end-to-end multiscale Siamese framework for optical building change detection. The model fuses a lightweight backbone stream with features transferred from a frozen DINOv3, yielding semantic- and context-rich pyramids even on small datasets. A spatial-spectral differential transformer decoder then exploits multi-scale absolute differences as change priors to highlight true building changes and suppress irrelevant responses. Finally, a learnable morphology module refines the upsampled logits to recover clean boundaries. Experiments on four public benchmarks show that ChangeDINO consistently outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods in IoU and F1, and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component.

TL;DR: ARASFSR enables arbitrary-resolution and arbitrary-scale face super-resolution using implicit representation networks with local frequency estimation and global coordinate modulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing face super-resolution methods are limited by fixed up-sampling scales and sensitivity to input size variations, restricting their practical applications.

Method: Uses 2D deep features, local relative coordinates, and up-sampling scale ratios to predict RGB values; incorporates local frequency estimation module to capture high-frequency textures; employs global coordinate modulation module for facial structure guidance.

Result: Quantitative and qualitative evaluations show ARASFSR outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various input sizes and up-sampling scales.

Conclusion: ARASFSR provides a robust solution for arbitrary-scale face super-resolution with improved performance and flexibility compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Face super-resolution (FSR) is a critical technique for enhancing low-resolution facial images and has significant implications for face-related tasks. However, existing FSR methods are limited by fixed up-sampling scales and sensitivity to input size variations. To address these limitations, this paper introduces an Arbitrary-Resolution and Arbitrary-Scale FSR method with implicit representation networks (ARASFSR), featuring three novel designs. First, ARASFSR employs 2D deep features, local relative coordinates, and up-sampling scale ratios to predict RGB values for each target pixel, allowing super-resolution at any up-sampling scale. Second, a local frequency estimation module captures high-frequency facial texture information to reduce the spectral bias effect. Lastly, a global coordinate modulation module guides FSR to leverage prior facial structure knowledge and achieve resolution adaptation effectively. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the robustness of ARASFSR over existing state-of-the-art methods while super-resolving facial images across various input sizes and up-sampling scales.

TL;DR: Proposes a teacher-student framework with key frame selection for weakly supervised terrain classification in UAV remote sensing, achieving improved mIoU and temporal consistency using only 30% labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses challenges in UAV terrain classification including data annotation complexity, temporal consistency requirements, data scarcity, and technology range limitations that differ from ground vehicle tasks.

Method: Teacher-student architecture with key frame selection and updating algorithms for weakly supervised learning and temporal consistency knowledge distillation.

Result: Method using only 30% labeled data simultaneously improves mIoU and temporal consistency, enabling stable terrain object localization in aerial positioning tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively overcomes traditional temporal consistency training deficiencies in aerial tasks and demonstrates that fully labeled data is not optimal for these applications.

Abstract: The study of terrain and landform classification through UAV remote sensing diverges significantly from ground vehicle patrol tasks. Besides grappling with the complexity of data annotation and ensuring temporal consistency, it also confronts the scarcity of relevant data and the limitations imposed by the effective range of many technologies. This research substantiates that, in aerial positioning tasks, both the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and temporal consistency (TC) metrics are of paramount importance. It is demonstrated that fully labeled data is not the optimal choice, as selecting only key data lacks the enhancement in TC, leading to failures. Hence, a teacher-student architecture, coupled with key frame selection and key frame updating algorithms, is proposed. This framework successfully performs weakly supervised learning and TC knowledge distillation, overcoming the deficiencies of traditional TC training in aerial tasks. The experimental results reveal that our method utilizing merely 30\% of labeled data, concurrently elevates mIoU and temporal consistency ensuring stable localization of terrain objects.

Conclusion: The method provides reliable, drift-free camera localization with accurate metric scale by leveraging pre-captured LiDAR data and neural rendering techniques.

Abstract: Accurate camera localization is crucial for robotics and Extended Reality (XR), enabling reliable navigation and alignment of virtual and real content. Existing visual methods often suffer from drift, scale ambiguity, and depend on fiducials or loop closure. This work introduces a real-time method for localizing a camera within a pre-captured, highly accurate colored LiDAR point cloud. By rendering synthetic views from this cloud, 2D-3D correspondences are established between live frames and the point cloud. A neural rendering technique narrows the domain gap between synthetic and real images, reducing occlusion and background artifacts to improve feature matching. The result is drift-free camera tracking with correct metric scale in the global LiDAR coordinate system. Two real-time variants are presented: Online Render and Match, and Prebuild and Localize. We demonstrate improved results on the ScanNet++ dataset and outperform existing SLAM pipelines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MOMNet is an alignment-free framework for depth super-resolution that handles misaligned RGB-D data through multi-order matching and aggregation, achieving state-of-the-art performance without requiring spatial alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing depth super-resolution methods assume strict spatial alignment between depth and RGB, but real-world scenarios often have misaligned RGB-D data due to hardware limitations and calibration drift, causing performance degradation.

Method: Proposes Multi-Order Matching Network with multi-order matching mechanism (zero-order, first-order, second-order) to identify relevant RGB information, and multi-order aggregation with structure detectors to selectively transfer features from RGB to depth.

Result: Extensive experiments show MOMNet achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits outstanding robustness in handling misaligned RGB-D data.

Conclusion: MOMNet provides an effective alignment-free solution for depth super-resolution that overcomes the limitations of existing methods in real-world misaligned scenarios.

Abstract: Recent guided depth super-resolution methods are premised on the assumption of strictly spatial alignment between depth and RGB, achieving high-quality depth reconstruction. However, in real-world scenarios, the acquisition of strictly aligned RGB-D is hindered by inherent hardware limitations (e.g., physically separate RGB-D sensors) and unavoidable calibration drift induced by mechanical vibrations or temperature variations. Consequently, existing approaches often suffer inevitable performance degradation when applied to misaligned real-world scenes. In this paper, we propose the Multi-Order Matching Network (MOMNet), a novel alignment-free framework that adaptively retrieves and selects the most relevant information from misaligned RGB. Specifically, our method begins with a multi-order matching mechanism, which jointly performs zero-order, first-order, and second-order matching to comprehensively identify RGB information consistent with depth across multi-order feature spaces. To effectively integrate the retrieved RGB and depth, we further introduce a multi-order aggregation composed of multiple structure detectors. This strategy uses multi-order priors as prompts to facilitate the selective feature transfer from RGB to depth. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MOMNet achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits outstanding robustness.

Motivation: Previous methods rely on holistic features for pair comparisons, which may not capture fine-grained differences needed for robust signature verification. Transformer-based backbones can naturally obscure local details, adversely affecting performance.

Method: Proposes DetailSemNet with local structure matching between signature images and a Detail Semantics Integrator using feature disentanglement and re-entanglement to enhance intricate details while expanding discriminative semantics.

Result: Outperforms recent methods on leading benchmarks with clear margins, achieves state-of-the-art results, and demonstrates remarkable generalization in cross-dataset testing scenarios.

Conclusion: The emphasis on local structure matching improves performance and interpretability, while the combination of generalizability and interpretability enhances DetailSemNet's potential for real-world applications.

Abstract: Offline signature verification (OSV) is a frequently utilized technology in forensics. This paper proposes a new model, DetailSemNet, for OSV. Unlike previous methods that rely on holistic features for pair comparisons, our approach underscores the significance of fine-grained differences for robust OSV. We propose to match local structures between two signature images, significantly boosting verification accuracy. Furthermore, we observe that without specific architectural modifications, transformer-based backbones might naturally obscure local details, adversely impacting OSV performance. To address this, we introduce a Detail Semantics Integrator, leveraging feature disentanglement and re-entanglement. This integrator is specifically designed to enhance intricate details while simultaneously expanding discriminative semantics, thereby augmenting the efficacy of local structural matching. We evaluate our method against leading benchmarks in offline signature verification. Our model consistently outperforms recent methods, achieving state-of-the-art results with clear margins. The emphasis on local structure matching not only improves performance but also enhances the model's interpretability, supporting our findings. Additionally, our model demonstrates remarkable generalization capabilities in cross-dataset testing scenarios. The combination of generalizability and interpretability significantly bolsters the potential of DetailSemNet for real-world applications.

TL;DR: CAMS proposes a CLIP-based compositional zero-shot learning method that uses gated cross-attention to extract fine-grained semantic features and multi-space disentanglement to separate attribute and object semantics, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CLIP-based CZSL methods rely on global semantic representations that have limited capacity for complete disentanglement of attributes and objects, hindering generalization to unseen compositions.

Method: Uses Gated Cross-Attention to capture fine-grained semantic features from CLIP's image encoder blocks through latent units while suppressing irrelevant information, followed by Multi-Space Disentanglement to separate attribute and object semantics.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on MIT-States, UT-Zappos, and C-GQA benchmarks in both closed-world and open-world settings.

Conclusion: CAMS effectively improves generalization over unseen attribute-object compositions by extracting semantic features and performing disentanglement in multidimensional spaces.

Abstract: Compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) aims to learn the concepts of attributes and objects in seen compositions and to recognize their unseen compositions. Most Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)-based CZSL methods focus on disentangling attributes and objects by leveraging the global semantic representation obtained from the image encoder. However, this representation has limited representational capacity and do not allow for complete disentanglement of the two. To this end, we propose CAMS, which aims to extract semantic features from visual features and perform semantic disentanglement in multidimensional spaces, thereby improving generalization over unseen attribute-object compositions. Specifically, CAMS designs a Gated Cross-Attention that captures fine-grained semantic features from the high-level image encoding blocks of CLIP through a set of latent units, while adaptively suppressing background and other irrelevant information. Subsequently, it conducts Multi-Space Disentanglement to achieve disentanglement of attribute and object semantics. Experiments on three popular benchmarks (MIT-States, UT-Zappos, and C-GQA) demonstrate that CAMS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both closed-world and open-world settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional marker-based MoCap systems require dense marker configurations that are time-consuming to set up and suffer from marker identification ambiguity, limiting scalability and practical deployment.

Method: Introduces Rigid Body Markers (RBMs) as fundamental units providing unambiguous 6-DoF data, combined with a deep-learning regression model that directly estimates SMPL parameters using a geodesic loss function on synthesized AMASS dataset data.

Result: The end-to-end approach matches optimization-based method performance while requiring over 10x less computation, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy in body pose estimation and demonstrating practical viability with real-world Vicon system data.

Conclusion: Combining sparse 6-DoF RBMs with manifold-aware geodesic loss provides a practical, high-fidelity solution for real-time motion capture in graphics, VR, and biomechanics applications.

Abstract: Marker-based optical motion capture (MoCap), while long regarded as the gold standard for accuracy, faces practical challenges, such as time-consuming preparation and marker identification ambiguity, due to its reliance on dense marker configurations, which fundamentally limit its scalability. To address this, we introduce a novel fundamental unit for MoCap, the Rigid Body Marker (RBM), which provides unambiguous 6-DoF data and drastically simplifies setup. Leveraging this new data modality, we develop a deep-learning-based regression model that directly estimates SMPL parameters under a geodesic loss. This end-to-end approach matches the performance of optimization-based methods while requiring over an order of magnitude less computation. Trained on synthesized data from the AMASS dataset, our end-to-end model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in body pose estimation. Real-world data captured using a Vicon optical tracking system further demonstrates the practical viability of our approach. Overall, the results show that combining sparse 6-DoF RBM with a manifold-aware geodesic loss yields a practical and high-fidelity solution for real-time MoCap in graphics, virtual reality, and biomechanics.

TL;DR: A geometry-guided self-supervised method for consistent surround-view depth estimation using multi-camera rigs that projects 3D points onto a shared cylinder to enable cross-view feature aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing self-supervised surround-view depth estimation methods suffer from inconsistent depth estimates between overlapping images, limiting their practical utility for 360° perception.

Method: Predict initial depth maps per image, project 3D points onto shared unit cylinder to establish cross-view neighborhood relations, then use explicit spatial attention to aggregate features across images based on cylinder distances for final depth prediction.

Result: Improved consistency of depth estimates across images and better overall depth quality compared to state-of-the-art methods on DDAD and nuScenes datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed geometry-guided approach effectively addresses cross-view consistency in surround-view depth estimation by leveraging cylindrical projection and explicit spatial attention.

Abstract: Self-supervised surround-view depth estimation enables dense, low-cost 3D perception with a 360° field of view from multiple minimally overlapping images. Yet, most existing methods suffer from depth estimates that are inconsistent between overlapping images. Addressing this limitation, we propose a novel geometry-guided method for calibrated, time-synchronized multi-camera rigs that predicts dense, metric, and cross-view-consistent depth. Given the intrinsic and relative orientation parameters, a first depth map is predicted per image and the so-derived 3D points from all images are projected onto a shared unit cylinder, establishing neighborhood relations across different images. This produces a 2D position map for every image, where each pixel is assigned its projected position on the cylinder. Based on these position maps, we apply an explicit, non-learned spatial attention that aggregates features among pixels across images according to their distances on the cylinder, to predict a final depth map per image. Evaluated on the DDAD and nuScenes datasets, our approach improves the consistency of depth estimates across images and the overall depth compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Result: Achieved 7-8% improvement in mIoU and 6% improvement in mDice scores over state-of-the-art baselines, with particularly strong performance on thin, rare, and safety-critical anatomical structures.

Conclusion: Graph-based segmentation methods enhance both performance and anatomical consistency in surgical scene segmentation, improving interpretability and reliability for safer laparoscopic and robot-assisted surgery through precise identification of critical anatomical features.

Abstract: Purpose: Accurate identification of hepatocystic anatomy is critical to preventing surgical complications during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Deep learning models often struggle with occlusions, long-range dependencies, and capturing the fine-scale geometry of rare structures. This work addresses these challenges by introducing graph-based segmentation approaches that enhance spatial and semantic understanding in surgical scene analyses.
  Methods: We propose two segmentation models integrating Vision Transformer (ViT) feature encoders with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to explicitly model spatial relationships between anatomical regions. (1) A static k Nearest Neighbours (k-NN) graph with a Graph Convolutional Network with Initial Residual and Identity Mapping (GCNII) enables stable long-range information propagation. (2) A dynamic Differentiable Graph Generator (DGG) with a Graph Attention Network (GAT) supports adaptive topology learning. Both models are evaluated on the Endoscapes-Seg50 and CholecSeg8k benchmarks.
  Results: The proposed approaches achieve up to 7-8% improvement in Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and 6% improvement in Mean Dice (mDice) scores over state-of-the-art baselines. It produces anatomically coherent predictions, particularly on thin, rare and safety-critical structures.
  Conclusion: The proposed graph-based segmentation methods enhance both performance and anatomical consistency in surgical scene segmentation. By combining ViT-based global context with graph-based relational reasoning, the models improve interpretability and reliability, paving the way for safer laparoscopic and robot-assisted surgery through a precise identification of critical anatomical features.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes LDAG architecture using language descriptions for few-shot segmentation, replacing traditional support image references with LLM-generated attribute descriptions and cross-modal alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FSS methods rely on support images for meta guidance, but intra-class variations make this guidance inaccurate for untrained classes. The key insight is that support should provide unbiased meta guidance rather than visual references.

Method: Uses LLMs to generate multiple detailed attribute descriptions of target classes (Multi-attribute Enhancement module), then aligns these with visual features through Multi-modal Attribute Alignment for cross-modal interaction.

Result: Outperforms existing approaches by a clear margin and achieves new state-of-the-art performance in few-shot segmentation.

Conclusion: Language-driven attribute generalization provides more robust support strategy than visual references from support images, enabling better segmentation of novel classes through unbiased meta guidance.

Abstract: Few-shot segmentation (FSS) aims to segment novel classes under the guidance of limited support samples by a meta-learning paradigm. Existing methods mainly mine references from support images as meta guidance. However, due to intra-class variations among visual representations, the meta information extracted from support images cannot produce accurate guidance to segment untrained classes. In this paper, we argue that the references from support images may not be essential, the key to the support role is to provide unbiased meta guidance for both trained and untrained classes. We then introduce a Language-Driven Attribute Generalization (LDAG) architecture to utilize inherent target property language descriptions to build robust support strategy. Specifically, to obtain an unbiased support representation, we design a Multi-attribute Enhancement (MaE) module, which produces multiple detailed attribute descriptions of the target class through Large Language Models (LLMs), and then builds refined visual-text prior guidance utilizing multi-modal matching. Meanwhile, due to text-vision modal shift, attribute text struggles to promote visual feature representation, we design a Multi-modal Attribute Alignment (MaA) to achieve cross-modal interaction between attribute texts and visual feature. Experiments show that our proposed method outperforms existing approaches by a clear margin and achieves the new state-of-the art performance. The code will be released.

TL;DR: StreetView-Waste dataset addresses urban waste management by providing annotated images for waste container detection, tracking, and overflow segmentation, with enhanced baselines using geometric priors and heuristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing litter detection datasets lack annotations for container tracking and are captured in static environments, limiting utility for real-world logistics in smart cities.

Method: Created StreetView-Waste dataset with three evaluation tasks; benchmarked SOTA models and proposed heuristic-based tracking and geometry-aware segmentation framework.

Result: Fine-tuned detectors perform well for detection; proposed heuristics reduce counting error by 79.6%; geometry-aware strategy improves segmentation mAP@0.5 by 27% on lightweight models.

Conclusion: StreetView-Waste provides a challenging benchmark for real-world perception systems in urban waste management, demonstrating value of multimodal inputs and specialized strategies.

Abstract: Urban waste management remains a critical challenge for the development of smart cities. Despite the growing number of litter detection datasets, the problem of monitoring overflowing waste containers, particularly from images captured by garbage trucks, has received little attention. While existing datasets are valuable, they often lack annotations for specific container tracking or are captured in static, decontextualized environments, limiting their utility for real-world logistics. To address this gap, we present StreetView-Waste, a comprehensive dataset of urban scenes featuring litter and waste containers. The dataset supports three key evaluation tasks: (1) waste container detection, (2) waste container tracking, and (3) waste overflow segmentation. Alongside the dataset, we provide baselines for each task by benchmarking state-of-the-art models in object detection, tracking, and segmentation. Additionally, we enhance baseline performance by proposing two complementary strategies: a heuristic-based method for improved waste container tracking and a model-agnostic framework that leverages geometric priors to refine litter segmentation. Our experimental results show that while fine-tuned object detectors achieve reasonable performance in detecting waste containers, baseline tracking methods struggle to accurately estimate their number; however, our proposed heuristics reduce the mean absolute counting error by 79.6%. Similarly, while segmenting amorphous litter is challenging, our geometry-aware strategy improves segmentation mAP@0.5 by 27% on lightweight models, demonstrating the value of multimodal inputs for this task. Ultimately, StreetView-Waste provides a challenging benchmark to encourage research into real-world perception systems for urban waste management.

*Ziyan Liu,Yeqiu Chen,Hongyi Cai,Tao Lin,Shuo Yang,Zheng Liu,Bo Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLA-Pruner is a token pruning method for Vision-Language-Action models that addresses the limitations of existing VLM pruning methods by considering both semantic understanding and action execution needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing token pruning methods for Vision-Language Models focus only on semantic salience, ignoring the dual-system nature of VLA models that require both high-level understanding and low-level action execution, leading to degraded performance.

Method: VLA-Pruner uses a dual-level importance criterion: vision-language prefill attention for semantic relevance and action decode attention (estimated via temporal smoothing) for action importance, with adaptive token selection under compute constraints.

Result: VLA-Pruner achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple VLA architectures and diverse robotic tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed dual-level token pruning approach effectively addresses the specific requirements of VLA models by preserving tokens critical for both semantic understanding and action execution.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown great promise for embodied AI, yet the heavy computational cost of processing continuous visual streams severely limits their real-time deployment. Token pruning (keeping salient visual tokens and dropping redundant ones) has emerged as an effective approach for accelerating Vision-Language Models (VLMs), offering a solution for efficient VLA. However, these VLM-specific token pruning methods select tokens based solely on semantic salience metrics (e.g., prefill attention), while overlooking the VLA's intrinsic dual-system nature of high-level semantic understanding and low-level action execution. Consequently, these methods bias token retention toward semantic cues, discard critical information for action generation, and significantly degrade VLA performance. To bridge this gap, we propose VLA-Pruner, a versatile plug-and-play VLA-specific token prune method that aligns with the dual-system nature of VLA models and exploits the temporal continuity in robot manipulation. Specifically, VLA-Pruner adopts a dual-level importance criterion for visual token retention: vision-language prefill attention for semantic-level relevance and action decode attention, estimated via temporal smoothing, for action-level importance. Based on this criterion, VLA-Pruner proposes a novel dual-level token selection strategy that adaptively preserves a compact, informative set of visual tokens for both semantic understanding and action execution under given compute budget. Experiments show that VLA-Pruner achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple VLA architectures and diverse robotic tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLaVA^3 improves 3D scene understanding in VLMs using multi-view 2D images without fine-tuning, inspired by Cubist art to create omnidirectional object representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of limited 3D training data for multi-modal language models by leveraging abundant 2D datasets instead.

Method: Generate omnidirectional visual representations of 3D objects from multi-view 2D images using intermediate 3D reconstruction, inspired by Cubist painting techniques.

Result: Outperforms previous 2D-based VLM solutions on 3D VQA and 3D language grounding tasks.

Conclusion: Multi-view 2D images can effectively enhance 3D scene understanding in VLMs without requiring 3D training data or fine-tuning.

Abstract: Developing a multi-modal language model capable of understanding 3D scenes remains challenging due to the limited availability of 3D training data, in contrast to the abundance of 2D datasets used for vision-language models (VLM). As an alternative, we introduce LLaVA$^3$ (pronounced LLaVA-Cube), a novel method that improves the 3D scene understanding capabilities of VLM using only multi-view 2D images and without any fine-tuning. Inspired by Cubist painters, who represented multiple viewpoints of a 3D object within a single picture, we propose to describe the 3D scene for the VLM through omnidirectional visual representations of each object. These representations are derived from an intermediate multi-view 3D reconstruction of the scene. Extensive experiments on 3D VQA and 3D language grounding show that our approach outperforms previous 2D-based VLM solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The corpus callosum is crucial for aging and neurological disease research but lacks comprehensive automated analysis tools.

Method: Automatically identifies mid-sagittal slices, segments corpus callosum and fornix, localizes commissures, generates thickness profiles and subdivisions, and extracts shape metrics.

Result: Outperforms existing specialized tools and reveals statistically significant differences between Huntington's disease patients and healthy controls not detected by current methods.

Conclusion: FastSurfer-CC provides an efficient, fully automated solution for corpus callosum analysis that advances neurological research capabilities.

Abstract: The corpus callosum, the largest commissural structure in the human brain, is a central focus in research on aging and neurological diseases. It is also a critical target for interventions such as deep brain stimulation and serves as an important biomarker in clinical trials, including those investigating remyelination therapies. Despite extensive research on corpus callosum segmentation, few publicly available tools provide a comprehensive and automated analysis pipeline. To address this gap, we present FastSurfer-CC, an efficient and fully automated framework for corpus callosum morphometry. FastSurfer-CC automatically identifies mid-sagittal slices, segments the corpus callosum and fornix, localizes the anterior and posterior commissures to standardize head positioning, generates thickness profiles and subdivisions, and extracts eight shape metrics for statistical analysis. We demonstrate that FastSurfer-CC outperforms existing specialized tools across the individual tasks. Moreover, our method reveals statistically significant differences between Huntington's disease patients and healthy controls that are not detected by the current state-of-the-art.

*Eliyas Suleyman,Paul Henderson,Eksan Firkat,Nicolas Pugeault*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a systematic study on occluded video prediction, showing that incorporating point-flow (motion) and depth-maps (geometry) improves prediction performance in occluded scenarios and background motion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Occlusion remains a fundamental challenge in video prediction despite general models performing well in standard scenarios. The authors hypothesize that explicit motion and geometric structure information can help models handle occlusion better.

Method: Used a standard multi-object latent transformer architecture for video prediction, modified to incorporate depth and point-flow information. Evaluated in controlled settings on synthetic and real-world datasets using appearance metrics and Wasserstein distances on object masks.

Result: Models assisted with point-flow and depth performed better in occluded scenarios and predicted more accurate background motion compared to models without these modalities.

Conclusion: Explicit motion and geometric structure information (via point-flow and depth-maps) significantly improves video prediction performance in challenging occluded scenarios.

Abstract: Video prediction is a fundamental task for various downstream applications, including robotics and world modeling. Although general video prediction models have achieved remarkable performance in standard scenarios, occlusion is still an inherent challenge in video prediction. We hypothesize that providing explicit information about motion (via point-flow) and geometric structure (via depth-maps) will enable video prediction models to perform better in situations with occlusion and the background motion. To investigate this, we present the first systematic study dedicated to occluded video prediction. We use a standard multi-object latent transformer architecture to predict future frames, but modify this to incorporate information from depth and point-flow. We evaluate this model in a controlled setting on both synthetic and real-world datasets with not only appearance-based metrics but also Wasserstein distances on object masks, which can effectively measure the motion distribution of the prediction. We find that when the prediction model is assisted with point flow and depth, it performs better in occluded scenarios and predicts more accurate background motion compared to models without the help of these modalities.

TL;DR: A physics-informed GAN framework that integrates wave optics rendering to synthesize high-fidelity microscope images for microrobot pose estimation, achieving near-real-data performance without expensive real data collection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current microrobot pose estimation methods require large, costly microscope image datasets that are difficult to acquire due to complex fabrication and labor-intensive labeling. Digital twin systems struggle to replicate optical microscopy phenomena like diffraction artifacts.

Method: Proposes a physics-informed deep generative learning framework that integrates wave optics-based physical rendering and depth alignment into a GAN to synthesize high-fidelity microscope images efficiently.

Result: Improves SSIM by 35.6% compared to purely AI-driven methods while maintaining real-time rendering (0.022 s/frame). Pose estimator trained on synthetic data achieves 93.9%/91.9% (pitch/roll) accuracy, only 5.0%/5.4% below real-data training.

Conclusion: The framework enables robust pose estimation for novel microrobot configurations without additional training data, demonstrating effective sim-to-real transfer and data augmentation capabilities.

Abstract: Precise pose estimation of optical microrobots is essential for enabling high-precision object tracking and autonomous biological studies. However, current methods rely heavily on large, high-quality microscope image datasets, which are difficult and costly to acquire due to the complexity of microrobot fabrication and the labour-intensive labelling. Digital twin systems offer a promising path for sim-to-real data augmentation, yet existing techniques struggle to replicate complex optical microscopy phenomena, such as diffraction artifacts and depth-dependent imaging.This work proposes a novel physics-informed deep generative learning framework that, for the first time, integrates wave optics-based physical rendering and depth alignment into a generative adversarial network (GAN), to synthesise high-fidelity microscope images for microrobot pose estimation efficiently. Our method improves the structural similarity index (SSIM) by 35.6% compared to purely AI-driven methods, while maintaining real-time rendering speeds (0.022 s/frame).The pose estimator (CNN backbone) trained on our synthetic data achieves 93.9%/91.9% (pitch/roll) accuracy, just 5.0%/5.4% (pitch/roll) below that of an estimator trained exclusively on real data. Furthermore, our framework generalises to unseen poses, enabling data augmentation and robust pose estimation for novel microrobot configurations without additional training data.

*Rui Wang,Yuexi Du,John Lewin,R. Todd Constable,Nicha C. Dvornek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a time-modulated tumor segmentation method for breast DCE-MRI that uses acquisition time information via FiLM layers to improve segmentation accuracy and generalization across varying protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Varying acquisition protocols and individual factors in DCE-MRI cause large appearance variations in tissues, making automated tumor segmentation challenging despite the importance of DCE-MRI in breast cancer screening and treatment.

Method: Incorporates acquisition times using feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) layers to modulate model features according to specific acquisition sequences, allowing use of variable numbers of images per study.

Result: Time-modulated models showed improved tumor segmentation performance and better generalization on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets compared to baseline models.

Conclusion: Incorporating knowledge of phase acquisition time through FiLM layers effectively improves breast tumor segmentation in DCE-MRI and enhances model generalization across different imaging protocols.

Abstract: Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) plays an important role in breast cancer screening, tumor assessment, and treatment planning and monitoring. The dynamic changes in contrast in different tissues help to highlight the tumor in post-contrast images. However, varying acquisition protocols and individual factors result in large variation in the appearance of tissues, even for images acquired in the same phase (e.g., first post-contrast phase), making automated tumor segmentation challenging. Here, we propose a tumor segmentation method that leverages knowledge of the image acquisition time to modulate model features according to the specific acquisition sequence. We incorporate the acquisition times using feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) layers, a lightweight method for incorporating temporal information that also allows for capitalizing on the full, variables number of images acquired per imaging study. We trained baseline and different configurations for the time-modulated models with varying backbone architectures on a large public multisite breast DCE-MRI dataset. Evaluation on in-domain images and a public out-of-domain dataset showed that incorporating knowledge of phase acquisition time improved tumor segmentation performance and model generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a unified framework for joint indoor scene mapping and ceiling-mounted camera registration using a mobile agent with RGB-D camera and synchronized CMC captures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual CMC registration is inefficient and costly, while automatic visual localization performs poorly with visual ambiguity. Need a reliable solution for position-aware applications.

Method: Uses mobile agent with head-mounted RGB-D camera to traverse scene, synchronizes CMCs to capture agent. Correlates trajectories via timestamps, then applies factor graph optimization for joint optimization of ego-camera poses, scene layout, and CMC poses.

Result: Method effectively accomplishes both scene mapping and CMC registration in unified framework, jointly enhancing performance. Created new benchmark dataset for collaborative scene mapping and CMC registration.

Conclusion: Provides reliable tool to facilitate downstream position-aware applications by solving two challenging tasks simultaneously with improved performance.

Abstract: Using ceiling-mounted cameras (CMCs) for indoor visual capturing opens up a wide range of applications. However, registering CMCs to the target scene layout presents a challenging task. While manual registration with specialized tools is inefficient and costly, automatic registration with visual localization may yield poor results when visual ambiguity exists. To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel solution for jointly mapping an indoor scene and registering CMCs to the scene layout. Our approach involves equipping a mobile agent with a head-mounted RGB-D camera to traverse the entire scene once and synchronize CMCs to capture this mobile agent. The egocentric videos generate world-coordinate agent trajectories and the scene layout, while the videos of CMCs provide pseudo-scale agent trajectories and CMC relative poses. By correlating all the trajectories with their corresponding timestamps, the CMC relative poses can be aligned to the world-coordinate scene layout. Based on this initialization, a factor graph is customized to enable the joint optimization of ego-camera poses, scene layout, and CMC poses. We also develop a new dataset, setting the first benchmark for collaborative scene mapping and CMC registration (https://sites.google.com/view/yowo/home). Experimental results indicate that our method not only effectively accomplishes two tasks within a unified framework, but also jointly enhances their performance. We thus provide a reliable tool to facilitate downstream position-aware applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SemCLIP improves CLIP's robustness to semantic transformations by using a new contrastive loss and LLM-generated training triples (original, paraphrased, negated captions), achieving better performance on negation handling and downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CLIP models struggle with negation and paraphrasing - negation radically changes meaning with minimal lexical changes, while paraphrasing creates different expressions with same meaning, posing challenges for vision-language alignment.

Method: Proposes SemCLIP with: 1) new CLIP contrastive loss accounting for both paraphrasing and negation, 2) LLM-generated training triples (original, paraphrased, negated captions) for CLIP-like training.

Result: Improves CC-Neg benchmark accuracy from 68.1% to 78.1%; generally outperforms CLIP on Sugarcrepe++ benchmark; shows better zero-shot classification performance on downstream tasks; moves paraphrased captions closer and negated captions further away in embedding space.

Conclusion: SemCLIP achieves significant robustness to semantic transformations while preserving CLIP's original performance, demonstrating improved handling of negation and paraphrasing in vision-language models.

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models continue to be the dominant approach for image and text retrieval. Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) trains two neural networks in contrastive manner to align their image and text embeddings in a shared latent space. Recent results evaluating CLIP on negated or paraphrased text have shown mixed performance because negation changes meaning radically with minimal lexical changes, while paraphrasing can create very different textual expressions with the same intended meaning. This poses a significant challenge for improving the evaluation results and alignment of vision-language models. To address this challenge, this paper evaluates the combination of paraphrasing and negation, proposes a new CLIP contrastive loss function accounting for both paraphrasing and negation, and applies LLM-generated training triples consisting of original, paraphrased and negated textual captions to CLIP-like training models. The approach, called SemCLIP, is shown to move paraphrased captions towards the original image embeddings while pushing negated captions further away in embedding space. Empirically, SemCLIP is shown to be capable of preserving CLIP's performance while increasing considerably the distances to negated captions. On the CC-Neg benchmark using an original over negation image-retrieval accuracy metric, SemCLIP improves accuracy from 68.1% to 78.1%. Although results are mixed when compared with CLIP on the Sugarcrepe++ benchmark, SemCLIP's performance is generally better than the models trained with negated captions. This robustness to negation extends to downstream zero-shot classification tasks where SemCLIP pre-trained on Sugarcrepe++ performs better than CLIP on all tested downstream tasks. These results indicate that SemCLIP can achieve significant robustness to semantic transformations.

TL;DR: Robust multi-camera gymnast tracking system that combines traditional triangulation with ray-plane intersection using gymnastics domain knowledge to handle limited camera views and challenging conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Track gymnasts in international competitions where limited cameras and challenging conditions (lighting variations, occlusions, uniforms) make conventional multi-camera triangulation unreliable, often providing valid detections from only two opposing views.

Method: Novel cascaded data association paradigm: uses triangulation when cross-view detections are sufficient, and ray-plane intersection when insufficient, leveraging domain knowledge that gymnasts' 3D centers typically lie within predefined vertical planes during performance.

Result: Method demonstrates superiority over existing approaches in challenging scenarios and has been successfully deployed at Gymnastics World Championships, earning recognition from the International Gymnastics Federation.

Conclusion: Incorporating gymnastics domain knowledge through ray-plane intersection effectively compensates for uncertain trajectories and minimizes tracking failures in limited-camera scenarios, enabling robust performance in real-world competition settings.

Abstract: We present a robust multi-camera gymnast tracking, which has been applied at international gymnastics championships for gymnastics judging. Despite considerable progress in multi-camera tracking algorithms, tracking gymnasts presents unique challenges: (i) due to space restrictions, only a limited number of cameras can be installed in the gymnastics stadium; and (ii) due to variations in lighting, background, uniforms, and occlusions, multi-camera gymnast detection may fail in certain views and only provide valid detections from two opposing views. These factors complicate the accurate determination of a gymnast's 3D trajectory using conventional multi-camera triangulation. To alleviate this issue, we incorporate gymnastics domain knowledge into our tracking solution. Given that a gymnast's 3D center typically lies within a predefined vertical plane during \revised{much of their} performance, we can apply a ray-plane intersection to generate coplanar 3D trajectory candidates for opposing-view detections. More specifically, we propose a novel cascaded data association (DA) paradigm that employs triangulation to generate 3D trajectory candidates when cross-view detections are sufficient, and resort to the ray-plane intersection when they are insufficient. Consequently, coplanar candidates are used to compensate for uncertain trajectories, thereby minimizing tracking failures. The robustness of our method is validated through extensive experimentation, demonstrating its superiority over existing methods in challenging scenarios. Furthermore, our gymnastics judging system, equipped with this tracking method, has been successfully applied to recent Gymnastics World Championships, earning significant recognition from the International Gymnastics Federation.

TL;DR: A two-stage framework for synthetic image detection using supervised contrastive learning and k-NN classification achieves 91.3% accuracy with minimal training data, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of detecting synthetic images from rapidly evolving generative AI models, where traditional detection methods requiring frequent retraining are impractical.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Vision model trained via supervised contrastive learning on subset of generators, 2) k-NN classifier with few-shot learning using limited samples from unseen generators.

Result: 91.3% average detection accuracy with only 150 images per class, 5.2% improvement over existing methods; 14.70% AUC and 4.27% OSCR improvements for source attribution.

Conclusion: The framework provides robust, scalable forensic attribution that adapts to evolving generative AI without exhaustive retraining, marking significant advancement in synthetic image detection.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence has enabled the creation of synthetic images that are increasingly indistinguishable from authentic content, posing significant challenges for digital media integrity. This problem is compounded by the accelerated release cycle of novel generative models, which renders traditional detection approaches (reliant on periodic retraining) computationally infeasible and operationally impractical.
  This work proposes a novel two-stage detection framework designed to address the generalization challenge inherent in synthetic image detection. The first stage employs a vision deep learning model trained via supervised contrastive learning to extract discriminative embeddings from input imagery. Critically, this model was trained on a strategically partitioned subset of available generators, with specific architectures withheld from training to rigorously ablate cross-generator generalization capabilities. The second stage utilizes a k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) classifier operating on the learned embedding space, trained in a few-shot learning paradigm incorporating limited samples from previously unseen test generators.
  With merely 150 images per class in the few-shot learning regime, which are easily obtainable from current generation models, the proposed framework achieves an average detection accuracy of 91.3\%, representing a 5.2 percentage point improvement over existing approaches . For the source attribution task, the proposed approach obtains improvements of of 14.70\% and 4.27\% in AUC and OSCR respectively on an open set classification context, marking a significant advancement toward robust, scalable forensic attribution systems capable of adapting to the evolving generative AI landscape without requiring exhaustive retraining protocols.

Conclusion: EOGS++ demonstrates superior reconstruction quality and geometric accuracy for satellite imagery while preserving the computational advantages of Gaussian Splatting over NeRF-based methods.

Abstract: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting has been introduced as a compelling alternative to NeRF for Earth observation, offering com- petitive reconstruction quality with significantly reduced training times. In this work, we extend the Earth Observation Gaussian Splatting (EOGS) framework to propose EOGS++, a novel method tailored for satellite imagery that directly operates on raw high-resolution panchromatic data without requiring external preprocessing. Furthermore, leveraging optical flow techniques we embed bundle adjustment directly within the training process, avoiding reliance on external optimization tools while improving camera pose estimation. We also introduce several improvements to the original implementation, including early stopping and TSDF post-processing, all contributing to sharper reconstructions and better geometric accuracy. Experiments on the IARPA 2016 and DFC2019 datasets demonstrate that EOGS++ achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of reconstruction quality and effi- ciency, outperforming the original EOGS method and other NeRF-based methods while maintaining the computational advantages of Gaussian Splatting. Our model demonstrates an improvement from 1.33 to 1.19 mean MAE errors on buildings compared to the original EOGS models

TL;DR: VARiant introduces a flexible depth adjustment method for Visual Auto-Regressive models by using weight-shared subnets, reducing memory usage by 40-80% while maintaining comparable generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Progressive multi-scale generation in VAR models incurs substantial memory overhead due to cumulative KV caching, limiting practical deployment despite their step reduction benefits.

Method: Proposes VARiant with equidistant sampling to create subnets (16 to 2 layers) from original 30-layer network. Early scales use full network, later scales use subnets with weight sharing, plus progressive training strategy to resolve optimization conflicts.

Result: VARiant-d16 and VARiant-d8 achieve nearly equivalent quality (FID 2.05/2.12 vs 1.95) with 40-65% memory reduction. VARiant-d2 achieves 3.5x speedup and 80% memory reduction at moderate quality cost (FID 2.97).

Conclusion: VARiant's single-model architecture supports zero-cost runtime depth switching and provides flexible deployment options from high quality to extreme efficiency, catering to diverse application scenarios.

Abstract: Visual Auto-Regressive (VAR) models significantly reduce inference steps through the "next-scale" prediction paradigm. However, progressive multi-scale generation incurs substantial memory overhead due to cumulative KV caching, limiting practical deployment.
  We observe a scale-depth asymmetric dependency in VAR: early scales exhibit extreme sensitivity to network depth, while later scales remain robust to depth reduction. Inspired by this, we propose VARiant: by equidistant sampling, we select multiple subnets ranging from 16 to 2 layers from the original 30-layer VAR-d30 network. Early scales are processed by the full network, while later scales utilize subnet. Subnet and the full network share weights, enabling flexible depth adjustment within a single model.
  However, weight sharing between subnet and the entire network can lead to optimization conflicts. To address this, we propose a progressive training strategy that breaks through the Pareto frontier of generation quality for both subnets and the full network under fixed-ratio training, achieving joint optimality.
  Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that, compared to the pretrained VAR-d30 (FID 1.95), VARiant-d16 and VARiant-d8 achieve nearly equivalent quality (FID 2.05/2.12) while reducing memory consumption by 40-65%. VARiant-d2 achieves 3.5 times speedup and 80% memory reduction at moderate quality cost (FID 2.97). In terms of deployment, VARiant's single-model architecture supports zero-cost runtime depth switching and provides flexible deployment options from high quality to extreme efficiency, catering to diverse application scenarios.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that ultra-light models can deliver strong generalization, setting a new standard for efficient stereo matching.

Abstract: Recent advances in stereo matching have focused on accuracy, often at the cost of significantly increased model size. Traditionally, the community has regarded efficient models as incapable of zero-shot ability due to their limited capacity. In this paper, we introduce Lite Any Stereo, a stereo depth estimation framework that achieves strong zero-shot generalization while remaining highly efficient. To this end, we design a compact yet expressive backbone to ensure scalability, along with a carefully crafted hybrid cost aggregation module. We further propose a three-stage training strategy on million-scale data to effectively bridge the sim-to-real gap. Together, these components demonstrate that an ultra-light model can deliver strong generalization, ranking 1st across four widely used real-world benchmarks. Remarkably, our model attains accuracy comparable to or exceeding state-of-the-art non-prior-based accurate methods while requiring less than 1% computational cost, setting a new standard for efficient stereo matching.

Method: Uses point maps on structured 2D grids, view-to-scene alignment strategy, and POMA-JEPA architecture for geometrically consistent features across multiple views. Pretrained on ScenePoint dataset from 6.5K room-level RGB-D scenes and 1M 2D image scenes.

Result: POMA-3D serves as strong backbone for specialist and generalist 3D understanding, benefiting tasks including 3D question answering, embodied navigation, scene retrieval, and embodied localization using only geometric inputs.

Conclusion: POMA-3D explores point map approach to 3D scene understanding, successfully addressing data scarcity and pretraining limitations in 3D representation learning.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce POMA-3D, the first self-supervised 3D representation model learned from point maps. Point maps encode explicit 3D coordinates on a structured 2D grid, preserving global 3D geometry while remaining compatible with the input format of 2D foundation models. To transfer rich 2D priors into POMA-3D, a view-to-scene alignment strategy is designed. Moreover, as point maps are view-dependent with respect to a canonical space, we introduce POMA-JEPA, a joint embedding-predictive architecture that enforces geometrically consistent point map features across multiple views. Additionally, we introduce ScenePoint, a point map dataset constructed from 6.5K room-level RGB-D scenes and 1M 2D image scenes to facilitate large-scale POMA-3D pretraining. Experiments show that POMA-3D serves as a strong backbone for both specialist and generalist 3D understanding. It benefits diverse tasks, including 3D question answering, embodied navigation, scene retrieval, and embodied localization, all achieved using only geometric inputs (i.e., 3D coordinates). Overall, our POMA-3D explores a point map way to 3D scene understanding, addressing the scarcity of pretrained priors and limited data in 3D representation learning.

TL;DR: Erase to Retain is a controllable unlearning framework for medical image segmentation that uses teacher-student distillation with LoRA to selectively remove knowledge while preserving overall performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for selective knowledge removal in medical segmentation networks for privacy compliance, ethical deployment, and dataset revision without full retraining.

Method: Teacher-student distillation paradigm with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) constrained subspace updates, featuring strong unlearning phase with adversarial optimization followed by gentle restoration phase with head-only supervised refinement.

Result: On ISIC segmentation: forget-set IoU reduced from 0.875 to 0.509 while maintaining performance on retain/validation splits (0.647 to 0.677 IoU). On ISIC classification: forget accuracy decreased from 87.0% to 64.1% while retain accuracy improved from 83.9% to 90.6%.

Conclusion: LoRA-based subspace unlearning provides a practical pathway for responsible, controllable, and reversible unlearning in medical image analysis, enabling targeted forgetting while preserving utility.

Abstract: The ability to selectively remove knowledge from medical segmentation networks is increasingly important for privacy compliance, ethical deployment, and continual dataset revision. We introduce Erase to Retain, a controllable unlearning framework for medical image segmentation that achieves targeted forgetting without full retraining. Our method uses a teacher-student distillation paradigm with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) constrained subspace updates, enabling the student network to erase lesion-specific or class-specific representations in low-rank decoder spaces while preserving global anatomical understanding. During the strong unlearning phase, LoRA modules are adversarially optimized to contradict the teacher's confident predictions on a designated forget subset, enforcing semantic removal. This is followed by a gentle restoration phase that recovers generalization on retained data through head-only supervised refinement.
  For ISIC segmentation, the student reduces forget-set IoU from 0.875 to 0.509 while maintaining competitive performance on the retain and validation splits (0.647 to 0.677 IoU). On the cross-domain CHASE dataset, Erase to Retain consistently lowers forget-set IoU while preserving utility on retain and validation sets. For ISIC classification, our method decreases accuracy on the forget subset from 87.0 percent to 64.1 percent while improving retain accuracy from 83.9 percent to 90.6 percent.
  These results demonstrate that LoRA-based subspace unlearning provides a practical pathway toward responsible, controllable, and reversible unlearning in medical image analysis, enabling models to forget sensitive samples or structures while preserving performance where it matters most.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in long video understanding requiring both efficient architecture and effective handling of extended temporal contexts, while dealing with vision token redundancy discovered in hybrid models.

Method: Uses hybrid Mamba-Transformer backbone combining state-space model efficiency with attention expressivity, plus TransV module that transfers and compresses vision tokens into instruction tokens.

Result: Achieves processing of hour-long videos exceeding 10,000 frames and competes with state-of-the-art models across multiple benchmarks while extending frame processing capabilities.

Conclusion: Represents initial step in developing, interpreting, and compressing hybrid Mamba-Transformer architectures for long video understanding.

Abstract: We introduce TimeViper, a hybrid vision-language model designed to tackle challenges of long video understanding. Processing long videos demands both an efficient model architecture and an effective mechanism for handling extended temporal contexts. To this end, TimeViper adopts a hybrid Mamba-Transformer backbone that combines the efficiency of state-space models with the expressivity of attention mechanisms. Through this hybrid design, we reveal the vision-to-text information aggregation phenomenon, where information progressively flows from vision tokens to text tokens across increasing LLM depth, resulting in severe vision token redundancy. Motivated by this observation, we propose TransV, a token information transfer module that transfers and compresses vision tokens into instruction tokens while maintaining multimodal understanding capabilities. This design enables TimeViper to process hour-long videos exceeding 10,000 frames. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that TimeViper competes with state-of-the-art models while extending frame numbers. We further analyze attention behaviors of both Mamba and Transformer layers, offering new insights into hybrid model interpretability. This work represents an initial step towards developing, interpreting, and compressing hybrid Mamba-Transformer architectures.

Method: Generate synthetic smoke datasets using generative AI, apply unsupervised domain adaptation, and refine with style transfer, GANs, and image matting to bridge synthetic-real data gap.

Result: Developed methods to create realistic synthetic smoke data and adapt models to real-world scenarios, improving detection accuracy.

Conclusion: Generative AI and domain adaptation techniques effectively address data scarcity in wildfire smoke detection, enabling more accurate and scalable models.

Abstract: The early detection of wildfires is a critical environmental challenge, with timely identification of smoke plumes being key to mitigating large-scale damage. While deep neural networks have proven highly effective for localization tasks, the scarcity of large, annotated datasets for smoke detection limits their potential. In response, we leverage generative AI techniques to address this data limitation by synthesizing a comprehensive, annotated smoke dataset. We then explore unsupervised domain adaptation methods for smoke plume segmentation, analyzing their effectiveness in closing the gap between synthetic and real-world data. To further refine performance, we integrate advanced generative approaches such as style transfer, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and image matting. These methods aim to enhance the realism of synthetic data and bridge the domain disparity, paving the way for more accurate and scalable wildfire detection models.

Motivation: Surgical video segmentation is crucial for computer-assisted surgery, but existing iVOS models like SAM2 face challenges in surgical scenarios due to domain gap and limited long-term tracking.

Method: Proposed SAM2S with three key components: (1) DiveMem for robust long-term tracking, (2) temporal semantic learning for instrument understanding, and (3) ambiguity-resilient learning to mitigate annotation inconsistencies.

Result: SAM2S achieves 80.42 average J&F, surpassing vanilla SAM2 by 17.10 points and fine-tuned SAM2 by 4.11 points, while maintaining 68 FPS real-time inference and strong zero-shot generalization.

Conclusion: SAM2S effectively addresses surgical video segmentation challenges through specialized architectural improvements and achieves state-of-the-art performance with real-time capabilities.

Abstract: Surgical video segmentation is crucial for computer-assisted surgery, enabling precise localization and tracking of instruments and tissues. Interactive Video Object Segmentation (iVOS) models such as Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) provide prompt-based flexibility beyond methods with predefined categories, but face challenges in surgical scenarios due to the domain gap and limited long-term tracking. To address these limitations, we construct SA-SV, the largest surgical iVOS benchmark with instance-level spatio-temporal annotations (masklets) spanning eight procedure types (61k frames, 1.6k masklets), enabling comprehensive development and evaluation for long-term tracking and zero-shot generalization. Building on SA-SV, we propose SAM2S, a foundation model enhancing \textbf{SAM2} for \textbf{S}urgical iVOS through: (1) DiveMem, a trainable diverse memory mechanism for robust long-term tracking; (2) temporal semantic learning for instrument understanding; and (3) ambiguity-resilient learning to mitigate annotation inconsistencies across multi-source datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning on SA-SV enables substantial performance gains, with SAM2 improving by 12.99 average $\mathcal{J}$\&$\mathcal{F}$ over vanilla SAM2. SAM2S further advances performance to 80.42 average $\mathcal{J}$\&$\mathcal{F}$, surpassing vanilla and fine-tuned SAM2 by 17.10 and 4.11 points respectively, while maintaining 68 FPS real-time inference and strong zero-shot generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses long-tailed object detection using LVISv1 dataset, achieving state-of-the-art 24.5% mAP through enhanced Balanced Group Softmax and metric learning with k-NN classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world object detection faces class imbalance where rare categories have few instances, biasing models toward frequent classes and degrading rare category performance.

Method: Two-stage Faster R-CNN with enhanced Balanced Group Softmax framework, plus metric learning to create well-separated feature embeddings and k-NN classification for rare classes.

Result: Achieved new state-of-the-art performance with 24.5% mAP on LVISv1 dataset, surpassing previous benchmark of 24.0%.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively mitigate class imbalance in long-tailed object detection, particularly improving rare class performance through better feature separation and classification.

Abstract: Object detection has been widely explored for class-balanced datasets such as COCO. However, real-world scenarios introduce the challenge of long-tailed distributions, where numerous categories contain only a few instances. This inherent class imbalance biases detection models towards the more frequent classes, degrading performance on rare categories. In this paper, we tackle the problem of long-tailed 2D object detection using the LVISv1 dataset, which consists of 1,203 categories and 164,000 images. We employ a two-stage Faster R-CNN architecture and propose enhancements to the Balanced Group Softmax (BAGS) framework to mitigate class imbalance. Our approach achieves a new state-of-the-art performance with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 24.5%, surpassing the previous benchmark of 24.0%.
  Additionally, we hypothesize that tail class features may form smaller, denser clusters within the feature space of head classes, making classification challenging for regression-based classifiers. To address this issue, we explore metric learning to produce feature embeddings that are both well-separated across classes and tightly clustered within each class. For inference, we utilize a k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) approach to improve classification performance, particularly for rare classes. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in advancing long-tailed object detection.

TL;DR: AGU is an efficient guided upsampling method that enhances low-light images by reducing noise and increasing sharpness through multi-parameter optimization, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in real-time processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing guided image methods fail with low-light images due to high noise and low brightness, resulting in suboptimal enhancement. There's a need for better methods that can effectively transfer characteristics from guidance images to noisy, dark target images.

Method: Uses guided image method with multi-parameter optimization to learn associations between low-light and bright image characteristics. A machine learning approach learns these characteristics from few sample image pairs, enabling real-time high-quality rendering from low-quality, low-resolution inputs.

Result: AGU demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in low-light image enhancement, producing high-quality images with reduced noise and increased sharpness in real time.

Conclusion: The proposed AGU method effectively solves the limitations of traditional guided methods for low-light images through multi-parameter optimization, achieving real-time high-quality upsampling that outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: We introduce Adaptive Guided Upsampling (AGU), an efficient method for upscaling low-light images capable of optimizing multiple image quality characteristics at the same time, such as reducing noise and increasing sharpness. It is based on a guided image method, which transfers image characteristics from a guidance image to the target image. Using state-of-the-art guided methods, low-light images lack sufficient characteristics for this purpose due to their high noise level and low brightness, rendering suboptimal/not significantly improved images in the process. We solve this problem with multi-parameter optimization, learning the association between multiple low-light and bright image characteristics. Our proposed machine learning method learns these characteristics from a few sample images-pairs. AGU can render high-quality images in real time using low-quality, low-resolution input; our experiments demonstrate that it is superior to state-of-the-art methods in the addressed low-light use case.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing survival analysis methods lack transparency for clinical adoption, and current pathology agents cannot integrate multimodal data, effectively explore regions of interest, or leverage historical case learning for survival prediction.

Method: Two-stage approach: (1) WSI-Gene CoT-Enhanced Case Bank Construction using hierarchical analysis of pathology images and gene-stratified analysis, generating structured reports with chain-of-thought reasoning; (2) Dichotomy-Based Multi-Expert Agent Inference that retrieves similar cases via RAG and integrates multimodal reports with progressive interval refinement.

Result: Extensive experiments on five TCGA cohorts demonstrate SurvAgent's superiority over conventional methods, proprietary MLLMs, and medical agents.

Conclusion: Establishes a new paradigm for explainable AI-driven survival prediction in precision oncology through hierarchical multi-agent reasoning and experiential learning.

Abstract: Survival analysis is critical for cancer prognosis and treatment planning, yet existing methods lack the transparency essential for clinical adoption. While recent pathology agents have demonstrated explainability in diagnostic tasks, they face three limitations for survival prediction: inability to integrate multimodal data, ineffective region-of-interest exploration, and failure to leverage experiential learning from historical cases. We introduce SurvAgent, the first hierarchical chain-of-thought (CoT)-enhanced multi-agent system for multimodal survival prediction. SurvAgent consists of two stages: (1) WSI-Gene CoT-Enhanced Case Bank Construction employs hierarchical analysis through Low-Magnification Screening, Cross-Modal Similarity-Aware Patch Mining, and Confidence-Aware Patch Mining for pathology images, while Gene-Stratified analysis processes six functional gene categories. Both generate structured reports with CoT reasoning, storing complete analytical processes for experiential learning. (2) Dichotomy-Based Multi-Expert Agent Inference retrieves similar cases via RAG and integrates multimodal reports with expert predictions through progressive interval refinement. Extensive experiments on five TCGA cohorts demonstrate SurvAgent's superority over conventional methods, proprietary MLLMs, and medical agents, establishing a new paradigm for explainable AI-driven survival prediction in precision oncology.

TL;DR: TRIM accelerates 3D Gaussian diffusion models by reducing denoising trajectories and pruning redundant Gaussian primitives, improving efficiency without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D Gaussian diffusion models are slow due to time-intensive denoising and processing of massive Gaussian primitives, limiting scalability.

Method: Uses temporal trimming (lightweight selector model for early trajectory reduction) and spatial trimming (instance mask denoising to prune redundant background primitives).

Result: Significantly improves both efficiency and quality of 3D generation while supporting inference-time scaling.

Conclusion: TRIM provides an effective post-training approach to accelerate 3D Gaussian diffusion models without compromising output quality.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian diffusion models suffer from time-intensive denoising and post-denoising processing due to the massive number of Gaussian primitives, resulting in slow generation and limited scalability along sampling trajectories. To improve the efficiency of 3D diffusion models, we propose $\textbf{TRIM}$ ($\textbf{T}$rajectory $\textbf{R}$eduction and $\textbf{I}$nstance $\textbf{M}$ask denoising), a post-training approach that incorporates both temporal and spatial trimming strategies, to accelerate inference without compromising output quality while supporting the inference-time scaling for Gaussian diffusion models. Instead of scaling denoising trajectories in a costly end-to-end manner, we develop a lightweight selector model to evaluate latent Gaussian primitives derived from multiple sampled noises, enabling early trajectory reduction by selecting candidates with high-quality potential. Furthermore, we introduce instance mask denoising to prune learnable Gaussian primitives by filtering out redundant background regions, reducing inference computation at each denoising step. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate that TRIM significantly improves both the efficiency and quality of 3D generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a novel 3D hierarchical semantic segmentation framework with late-decoupled architecture and bi-branch supervision to address multi-hierarchy conflicts and class imbalance issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous 3DHS methods overlook multi-hierarchy conflicts in cross-hierarchy optimization and class imbalance across multiple hierarchies, which dominate model performance.

Method: Uses a primary 3DHS branch with multiple decoders using coarse-to-fine hierarchical guidance, plus an auxiliary discrimination branch with semantic prototype-based bi-branch supervision for mutual learning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art 3DHS performance on multiple datasets and backbones, with core components serving as plug-and-play enhancements for previous methods.

Conclusion: The proposed late-decoupled framework effectively mitigates multi-hierarchy conflicts and class imbalance, providing robust 3D hierarchical semantic segmentation.

Abstract: 3D hierarchical semantic segmentation (3DHS) is crucial for embodied intelligence applications that demand a multi-grained and multi-hierarchy understanding of 3D scenes. Despite the progress, previous 3DHS methods have overlooked following two challenges: I) multi-label learning with a parameter-sharing model can lead to multi-hierarchy conflicts in cross-hierarchy optimization, and II) the class imbalance issue is inevitable across multiple hierarchies of 3D scenes, which makes the model performance become dominated by major classes. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework with a primary 3DHS branch and an auxiliary discrimination branch. Specifically, to alleviate the multi-hierarchy conflicts, we propose a late-decoupled 3DHS framework which employs multiple decoders with the coarse-to-fine hierarchical guidance and consistency. The late-decoupled architecture can mitigate the underfitting and overfitting conflicts among multiple hierarchies and can also constrain the class imbalance problem in each individual hierarchy. Moreover, we introduce a 3DHS-oriented semantic prototype based bi-branch supervision mechanism, which additionally learns class-wise discriminative point cloud features and performs mutual supervision between the auxiliary and 3DHS branches, to enhance the class-imbalance segmentation. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and backbones demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art 3DHS performance, and its core components can also be used as a plug-and-play enhancement to improve previous methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the computational overhead of iterative train-prune-retrain cycles in unstructured pruning by developing a more efficient one-shot pruning approach.

Method: Teacher-guided pruning framework that uses gradient signals from Knowledge Distillation during importance score calculation to identify critical parameters, followed by sparsity-aware retraining without reactivating pruned connections.

Result: Achieves high sparsity levels with minimal performance degradation across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet benchmarks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods like EPG and EPSD at high sparsity.

Conclusion: The framework provides a computation-efficient, performance-preserving solution suitable for resource-constrained environments, offering a superior alternative to iterative pruning schemes.

Abstract: Unstructured pruning remains a powerful strategy for compressing deep neural networks, yet it often demands iterative train-prune-retrain cycles, resulting in significant computational overhead. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel teacher-guided pruning framework that tightly integrates Knowledge Distillation (KD) with importance score estimation. Unlike prior approaches that apply KD as a post-pruning recovery step, our method leverages gradient signals informed by the teacher during importance score calculation to identify and retain parameters most critical for both task performance and knowledge transfer. Our method facilitates a one-shot global pruning strategy that efficiently eliminates redundant weights while preserving essential representations. After pruning, we employ sparsity-aware retraining with and without KD to recover accuracy without reactivating pruned connections. Comprehensive experiments across multiple image classification benchmarks, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet, demonstrate that our method consistently achieves high sparsity levels with minimal performance degradation. Notably, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as EPG and EPSD at high sparsity levels, while offering a more computationally efficient alternative to iterative pruning schemes like COLT. The proposed framework offers a computation-efficient, performance-preserving solution well suited for deployment in resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: The paper critically analyzes Cambrian-S's spatial supersensing benchmarks and methods, showing they can be nearly solved without spatial cognition and that the proposed inference methods exploit shortcuts rather than demonstrating robust spatial supersensing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether Cambrian-S's benchmarks and methods truly measure spatial supersensing capabilities, or if they can be solved through simpler approaches and shortcut exploitation.

Method: Introduced NoSense baseline using bag-of-words SigLIP model without temporal structure, and created VSC-Repeat sanity check by concatenating videos with themselves to test robustness.

Result: NoSense achieved 95% accuracy on VSR benchmark without spatial cognition, and VSC-Repeat collapsed Cambrian-S's accuracy from 42% to 0%, showing reliance on benchmark shortcuts rather than spatial supersensing.

Conclusion: Current VSI-Super benchmarks don't reliably measure spatial supersensing, and Cambrian-S's inference methods improve performance by exploiting shortcuts rather than through robust spatial supersensing.

Abstract: Cambrian-S aims to take the first steps towards improving video world models with spatial supersensing by introducing (i) two benchmarks, VSI-Super-Recall (VSR) and VSI-Super-Counting (VSC), and (ii) bespoke predictive sensing inference strategies tailored to each benchmark. In this work, we conduct a critical analysis of Cambrian-S across both these fronts. First, we introduce a simple baseline, NoSense, which discards almost all temporal structure and uses only a bag-of-words SigLIP model, yet near-perfectly solves VSR, achieving 95% accuracy even on 4-hour videos. This shows benchmarks like VSR can be nearly solved without spatial cognition, world modeling or spatial supersensing. Second, we hypothesize that the tailored inference methods proposed by Cambrian-S likely exploit shortcut heuristics in the benchmark. We illustrate this with a simple sanity check on the VSC benchmark, called VSC-Repeat: We concatenate each video with itself 1-5 times, which does not change the number of unique objects. However, this simple perturbation entirely collapses the mean relative accuracy of Cambrian-S from 42% to 0%. A system that performs spatial supersensing and integrates information across experiences should recognize views of the same scene and keep object-count predictions unchanged; instead, Cambrian-S inference algorithm relies largely on a shortcut in the VSC benchmark that rooms are never revisited. Taken together, our findings suggest that (i) current VSI-Super benchmarks do not yet reliably measure spatial supersensing, and (ii) predictive-sensing inference recipes used by Cambrian-S improve performance by inadvertently exploiting shortcuts rather than from robust spatial supersensing. We include the response from the Cambrian-S authors (in Appendix A) to provide a balanced perspective alongside our claims. We release our code at: https://github.com/bethgelab/supersanity

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UV unwrapping methods struggle with AI-generated meshes that are noisy, bumpy, and poorly conditioned, often producing fragmented charts and suboptimal boundaries that cause artifacts.

Method: Combines semantic part decomposition from PartField with geometric heuristics in a top-down recursive framework, ensuring distortion below threshold while minimizing chart count. Integrates parameterization and packing algorithms with dedicated handling for non-manifold/degenerate meshes.

Result: Outperforms existing tools and neural methods in chart count and seam length, achieves comparable distortion, high success rates on challenging meshes, and enables part-specific multi-tiles packing across four diverse datasets.

Conclusion: PartUV provides an effective solution for UV unwrapping challenging meshes with fewer charts and better alignment, enabling new applications in computer graphics and geometry processing.

Abstract: UV unwrapping flattens 3D surfaces to 2D with minimal distortion, often requiring the complex surface to be decomposed into multiple charts. Although extensively studied, existing UV unwrapping methods frequently struggle with AI-generated meshes, which are typically noisy, bumpy, and poorly conditioned. These methods often produce highly fragmented charts and suboptimal boundaries, introducing artifacts and hindering downstream tasks. We introduce PartUV, a part-based UV unwrapping pipeline that generates significantly fewer, part-aligned charts while maintaining low distortion. Built on top of a recent learning-based part decomposition method PartField, PartUV combines high-level semantic part decomposition with novel geometric heuristics in a top-down recursive framework. It ensures each chart's distortion remains below a user-specified threshold while minimizing the total number of charts. The pipeline integrates and extends parameterization and packing algorithms, incorporates dedicated handling of non-manifold and degenerate meshes, and is extensively parallelized for efficiency. Evaluated across four diverse datasets, including man-made, CAD, AI-generated, and Common Shapes, PartUV outperforms existing tools and recent neural methods in chart count and seam length, achieves comparable distortion, exhibits high success rates on challenging meshes, and enables new applications like part-specific multi-tiles packing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TriDiff-4D is a novel diffusion-based pipeline for generating high-quality 4D avatars from text descriptions, using triplane re-posing and auto-regressive generation to achieve temporal consistency and motion accuracy while reducing generation time from hours to seconds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in existing 4D generative methods including temporal/geometric inconsistencies, perceptual artifacts, motion irregularities, high computational costs, and limited control over dynamics in 4D avatar generation.

Method: Uses diffusion-based triplane re-posing with auto-regressive strategy to generate arbitrary-length 4D sequences. First generates canonical 3D avatar and motion sequence from text, then animates avatar using second diffusion model. Learns 3D structure and motion priors from large datasets.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing methods, reduces generation time from hours to seconds by eliminating optimization process, improves generation of complex motions with high-fidelity appearance and accurate 3D geometry.

Conclusion: TriDiff-4D enables efficient, high-quality skeleton-driven 4D generation with superior temporal consistency, motion accuracy, and visual fidelity compared to previous approaches.

Abstract: With the increasing demand for 3D animation, generating high-fidelity, controllable 4D avatars from textual descriptions remains a significant challenge. Despite notable efforts in 4D generative modeling, existing methods exhibit fundamental limitations that impede their broader applicability, including temporal and geometric inconsistencies, perceptual artifacts, motion irregularities, high computational costs, and limited control over dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose TriDiff-4D, a novel 4D generative pipeline that employs diffusion-based triplane re-posing to produce high-quality, temporally coherent 4D avatars. Our model adopts an auto-regressive strategy to generate 4D sequences of arbitrary length, synthesizing each 3D frame with a single diffusion process. By explicitly learning 3D structure and motion priors from large-scale 3D and motion datasets, TriDiff-4D enables skeleton-driven 4D generation that excels in temporal consistency, motion accuracy, computational efficiency, and visual fidelity. Specifically, TriDiff-4D first generates a canonical 3D avatar and a corresponding motion sequence from a text prompt, then uses a second diffusion model to animate the avatar according to the motion sequence, supporting arbitrarily long 4D generation. Experimental results demonstrate that TriDiff-4D significantly outperforms existing methods, reducing generation time from hours to seconds by eliminating the optimization process, while substantially improving the generation of complex motions with high-fidelity appearance and accurate 3D geometry.

*Zhenyuan Qin,Xincheng Shuai,Henghui Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SceneDesigner enables precise 9D pose control (location, size, orientation) for multiple objects in image generation using a branched network, CNOCS map representation, and two-stage training with reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for controllable image generation lack comprehensive control over 9D poses of multiple objects simultaneously, suffering from limited controllability and degraded quality.

Method: Uses branched network with CNOCS map representation, two-stage training with reinforcement learning for data imbalance, and Disentangled Object Sampling for complex scenes. Integrates user-specific personalization for customized control.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing approaches in both controllability and quality, enabling accurate multi-object 9D pose manipulation with improved training efficiency and stability.

Conclusion: SceneDesigner provides a comprehensive solution for multi-object 9D pose control in image generation, addressing key limitations of existing methods through novel representations and training strategies.

Abstract: Controllable image generation has attracted increasing attention in recent years, enabling users to manipulate visual content such as identity and style. However, achieving simultaneous control over the 9D poses (location, size, and orientation) of multiple objects remains an open challenge. Despite recent progress, existing methods often suffer from limited controllability and degraded quality, falling short of comprehensive multi-object 9D pose control. To address these limitations, we propose SceneDesigner, a method for accurate and flexible multi-object 9-DoF pose manipulation. SceneDesigner incorporates a branched network to the pre-trained base model and leverages a new representation, CNOCS map, which encodes 9D pose information from the camera view. This representation exhibits strong geometric interpretation properties, leading to more efficient and stable training. To support training, we construct a new dataset, ObjectPose9D, which aggregates images from diverse sources along with 9D pose annotations. To further address data imbalance issues, particularly performance degradation on low-frequency poses, we introduce a two-stage training strategy with reinforcement learning, where the second stage fine-tunes the model using a reward-based objective on rebalanced data. At inference time, we propose Disentangled Object Sampling, a technique that mitigates insufficient object generation and concept confusion in complex multi-object scenes. Moreover, by integrating user-specific personalization weights, SceneDesigner enables customized pose control for reference subjects. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that SceneDesigner significantly outperforms existing approaches in both controllability and quality.

Abstract: Recent progress in generative video models, such as Veo-3, has shown surprising zero-shot reasoning abilities, creating a growing need for systematic and reliable evaluation. We introduce V-ReasonBench, a benchmark designed to assess video reasoning across four key dimensions: structured problem-solving, spatial cognition, pattern-based inference, and physical dynamics. The benchmark is built from both synthetic and real-world image sequences and provides a diverse set of answer-verifiable tasks that are reproducible, scalable, and unambiguous. Evaluations of six state-of-the-art video models reveal clear dimension-wise differences, with strong variation in structured, spatial, pattern-based, and physical reasoning. We further compare video models with strong image models, analyze common hallucination behaviors, and study how video duration affects Chain-of-Frames reasoning. Overall, V-ReasonBench offers a unified and reproducible framework for measuring video reasoning and aims to support the development of models with more reliable, human-aligned reasoning skills.

*Junhao Cheng,Liang Hou,Xin Tao,Jing Liao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VANS extends video generation beyond entertainment by introducing Video-Next-Event Prediction (VNEP), where models generate dynamic video responses instead of text for next-event prediction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video's capacity to demonstrate physical-world information that is difficult to convey through language alone, enabling more intuitive and customized answers for procedural learning and creative exploration.

Method: VANS uses reinforcement learning (Joint-GRPO) to align a Vision-Language Model with a Video Diffusion Model, optimizing both to produce accurate captions and faithful video generation while maintaining visual and semantic consistency.

Result: VANS achieves state-of-the-art performance on procedural and predictive benchmarks for both video event prediction and visualization tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed VNEP task and VANS model successfully bridge the gap between text-based and video-based next-event prediction, demonstrating the potential of video as a new answer modality for complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: While language models have become impactful in many real-world applications, video generation remains largely confined to entertainment. Motivated by video's inherent capacity to demonstrate physical-world information that is difficult to convey through language alone (e.g., imagine teaching someone to tie a tie using only text), we identify an underutilized opportunity to extend video as a new answer modality for Next-Event Prediction (NEP), formalized as Video-Next-Event Prediction (VNEP). While the established NEP task takes a video with a procedural or predictive question as input to predict the next event in text, VNEP requires dynamic video responses. This shift from telling to showing unlocks more intuitive and customized answers for procedural learning and creative exploration. However, this task remains challenging for existing models, as it demands an understanding of multimodal input, instruction-conditioned reasoning, and the generation of video with visual and semantic consistency. To address this, we introduce VANS, a model that leverages reinforcement learning to align a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with a Video Diffusion Model (VDM) for VNEP. The core of VANS is our proposed Joint-GRPO that orchestrates the VLM and VDM to function as a unit. Driven by a shared reward on their respective output, it optimizes the VLM to produce captions that are both accurate and friendly to visualize, while guiding the VDM to generate videos that are faithful to these captions and the input visual context. To enable this learning, we craft VANS-Data-100K, a dedicated dataset for the VNEP task. Experiments on procedural and predictive benchmarks demonstrate that VANS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both video event prediction and visualization. Codes are released in https://github.com/KlingTeam/VANS.

*Chenyu Lin,Cheng Chi,Jinlin Wu,Sharon Li,Kaiyang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes DualMindVLM, a visual language model that automatically switches between fast and slow thinking modes based on task difficulty, improving computational efficiency while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs pursue lengthy reasoning chains for all tasks, leading to excessive computational costs, unlike human two-system thinking that efficiently allocates cognitive resources based on problem complexity.

Method: A two-stage RL approach: first labels data as fast/slow thinking based on model output length, then trains model using GRPO with thinking mode labels to develop dual-mode thinking capabilities.

Result: DualMindVLM significantly outperforms the base model and achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art visual reasoning models while maintaining exceptionally high token efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed simple RL approach enables VLMs to automatically adapt their reasoning depth, achieving both high performance and computational efficiency by mimicking human-like two-system thinking.

Abstract: When confronted with complex problems, we tend to think slowly; conversely, for simple questions, we think quickly. Such a two-system thinking mechanism allows us to efficiently allocate cognitive resources, enabling quick decision-making for straightforward issues while reserving deeper analytical thinking for more intricate challenges. However, existing reasoning-oriented visual language models (VLMs), whether trained with explicit chain-of-thought annotations or rule-based RL rewards, mainly pursue lengthy, detailed reasoning chains, which often lead to excessive computational costs. In this work, we propose a simple RL approach, which enables VLMs to automatically switch between fast and slow thinking modes depending on task difficulty. The approach consists of two stages: in the first stage, we label data as either requiring fast thinking or slow thinking based on the model output length, which is inspired by the observation that pre-trained VLMs typically produce answers of varying lengths for different types of questions; in the second stage, we train the model using GRPO along with the thinking mode labels to develop dual-mode thinking. Despite its simplicity, our model, named DualMindVLM, significantly outperforms the base model and achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art visual reasoning models, while maintaining exceptionally high token efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TwiG is the first framework that interleaves textual reasoning throughout visual generation, enabling co-evolution of reasoning and visual content for more context-aware outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual generation methods only use reasoning before or after generation, lacking real-time multimodal interaction during the generation process itself.

Method: Three strategies: zero-shot prompting, supervised fine-tuning on TwiG-50K dataset, and reinforcement learning via customized TwiG-GRPO strategy.

Result: The framework produces more context-aware and semantically rich visual outputs through dynamic interplay between reasoning and generation.

Conclusion: This work inspires further research into interleaving textual reasoning for enhanced visual generation.

Abstract: Recent advances in visual generation have increasingly explored the integration of reasoning capabilities. They incorporate textual reasoning, i.e., think, either before (as pre-planning) or after (as post-refinement) the generation process, yet they lack on-the-fly multimodal interaction during the generation itself. In this preliminary study, we introduce Thinking-while-Generating (TwiG), the first interleaved framework that enables co-evolving textual reasoning throughout the visual generation process. As visual content is progressively generating, textual reasoning is interleaved to both guide upcoming local regions and reflect on previously synthesized ones. This dynamic interplay produces more context-aware and semantically rich visual outputs. To unveil the potential of this framework, we investigate three candidate strategies, zero-shot prompting, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on our curated TwiG-50K dataset, and reinforcement learning (RL) via a customized TwiG-GRPO strategy, each offering unique insights into the dynamics of interleaved reasoning. We hope this work inspires further research into interleaving textual reasoning for enhanced visual generation. Code will be released at: https://github.com/ZiyuGuo99/Thinking-while-Generating.

TL;DR: EvoLMM is a self-evolving framework that improves large multimodal models' reasoning capabilities through unsupervised learning using two cooperative agents (Proposer and Solver) that generate and solve image-grounded questions without human annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of existing training pipelines that depend on human-curated data or external reward models, enabling more autonomous and scalable improvement of LMM reasoning capabilities.

Method: Uses two cooperative agents from a single backbone model: a Proposer generates diverse image-grounded questions, and a Solver solves them through internal consistency, with continuous self-rewarding learning.

Result: Achieves consistent gains up to ~3% on multimodal math-reasoning benchmarks (ChartQA, MathVista, MathVision) using only raw training images, with Qwen2.5-VL as base model.

Conclusion: EvoLMM provides a simple yet effective baseline for self-improving LMMs in fully-unsupervised fashion, demonstrating promising results without human annotations or reward models.

Abstract: Recent advances in large multimodal models (LMMs) have enabled impressive reasoning and perception abilities, yet most existing training pipelines still depend on human-curated data or externally verified reward models, limiting their autonomy and scalability. In this work, we strive to improve LMM reasoning capabilities in a purely unsupervised fashion (without any annotated data or reward distillation). To this end, we propose a self-evolving framework, named EvoLMM, that instantiates two cooperative agents from a single backbone model: a Proposer, which generates diverse, image-grounded questions, and a Solver, which solves them through internal consistency, where learning proceeds through a continuous self-rewarding process. This dynamic feedback encourages both the generation of informative queries and the refinement of structured reasoning without relying on ground-truth or human judgments. When using the popular Qwen2.5-VL as the base model, our EvoLMM yields consistent gains upto $\sim$3\% on multimodal math-reasoning benchmarks, including ChartQA, MathVista, and MathVision, using only raw training images. We hope our simple yet effective approach will serve as a solid baseline easing future research in self-improving LMMs in a fully-unsupervised fashion.

*Jing Wen,Alexander G. Schwing,Shenlong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NoPo-Avatar reconstructs animatable 3D human avatars from single/sparse images without requiring pose inputs, overcoming limitations of pose-dependent methods that degrade with noisy pose estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods rely on accurate ground-truth camera and human poses for reconstruction, but performance degrades significantly when pose estimates are noisy. This limits practical applicability.

Method: NoPo-Avatar reconstructs avatars solely from images without any pose input, eliminating dependence on potentially noisy human pose estimates during test-time reconstruction.

Result: Experiments on THuman2.0, XHuman, and HuGe100K datasets show NoPo-Avatar outperforms existing baselines in practical settings (without ground-truth poses) and achieves comparable results in lab settings (with ground-truth poses).

Conclusion: By removing pose dependence, NoPo-Avatar provides more robust and widely applicable 3D human avatar reconstruction that works effectively even with noisy or unavailable pose information.

Abstract: We tackle the task of recovering an animatable 3D human avatar from a single or a sparse set of images. For this task, beyond a set of images, many prior state-of-the-art methods use accurate "ground-truth" camera poses and human poses as input to guide reconstruction at test-time. We show that pose-dependent reconstruction degrades results significantly if pose estimates are noisy. To overcome this, we introduce NoPo-Avatar, which reconstructs avatars solely from images, without any pose input. By removing the dependence of test-time reconstruction on human poses, NoPo-Avatar is not affected by noisy human pose estimates, making it more widely applicable. Experiments on challenging THuman2.0, XHuman, and HuGe100K data show that NoPo-Avatar outperforms existing baselines in practical settings (without ground-truth poses) and delivers comparable results in lab settings (with ground-truth poses).

*George Cazenavette,Antonio Torralba,Vincent Sitzmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dataset distillation method that optimizes synthetic images to match gradients in linear classifiers when using pre-trained vision models, enabling efficient training of linear probes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dataset distillation methods focus on training from scratch, but modern vision approaches use pre-trained models. Need distillation methods that work with pre-trained feature extractors.

Method: Linear Gradient Matching - optimizes synthetic images so they produce similar gradients in linear classifiers as real data when passed through pre-trained feature extractors.

Result: Synthetic data outperforms real-image baselines, generalizes across pre-trained models (e.g., CLIP probe trained with DINO-distilled data), effective for fine-grained classification and model interpretability.

Conclusion: Proposed method enables efficient dataset distillation for pre-trained models, providing valuable tools for model analysis and interpretability across different vision architectures.

Abstract: The task of dataset distillation aims to find a small set of synthetic images such that training a model on them reproduces the performance of the same model trained on a much larger dataset of real samples. Existing distillation methods focus on synthesizing datasets that enable training randomly initialized models. In contrast, state-of-the-art vision approaches are increasingly building on large, pre-trained self-supervised models rather than training from scratch. In this paper, we investigate the problem of distilling datasets that enable us to optimally train linear probes on top of such large, pre-trained vision models. We introduce a method of dataset distillation for this task called Linear Gradient Matching that optimizes the synthetic images such that, when passed through a pre-trained feature extractor, they induce gradients in the linear classifier similar to those produced by the real data. Our method yields synthetic data that outperform all real-image baselines and, remarkably, generalize across pre-trained vision models, enabling us, for instance, to train a linear CLIP probe that performs competitively using a dataset distilled via a DINO backbone. Further, we show that our distilled datasets are exceptionally effective for fine-grained classification and provide a valuable tool for model interpretability, predicting, among other things, how similar two models' embedding spaces are under the platonic representation hypothesis or whether a model is sensitive to spurious correlations in adversarial datasets.
