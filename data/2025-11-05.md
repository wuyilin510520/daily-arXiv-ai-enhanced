### [1] [iFlyBot-VLA Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01914)
*Yuan Zhang,Chenyu Xue,Wenjie Xu,Chao Ji,Jiajia wu,Jia Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: iFlyBot-VLA is a large-scale Vision-Language-Action model with a dual-level action representation framework that combines latent actions from cross-embodiment manipulation data and structured discrete action tokens, achieving competitive performance on robotic manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a comprehensive VLA model that can effectively bridge vision, language, and action for robotic manipulation by aligning their representation spaces and enhancing 3D perceptual capabilities.

Method: Uses a dual-level action representation framework with latent actions (from cross-embodiment manipulation data) and structured discrete action tokens (from frequency-domain transformations of control signals), combined with mixed training on robot trajectory data and QA datasets.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance on LIBERO Franka benchmark and achieves competitive success rates in real-world diverse manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively aligns language, vision, and action representations, enabling direct contribution of VLM to action generation, with plans to open-source portions of the dataset for community research.

Abstract: We introduce iFlyBot-VLA, a large-scale Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model
trained under a novel framework. The main contributions are listed as follows:
(1) a latent action model thoroughly trained on large-scale human and robotic
manipulation videos; (2) a dual-level action representation framework that
jointly supervises both the Vision-Language Model (VLM) and the action expert
during training; (3) a mixed training strategy that combines robot trajectory
data with general QA and spatial QA datasets, effectively enhancing the 3D
perceptual and reasoning capabilities of the VLM backbone. Specifically, the
VLM is trained to predict two complementary forms of actions: latent actions,
derived from our latent action model pretrained on cross-embodiment
manipulation data, which capture implicit high-level intentions; and structured
discrete action tokens, obtained through frequency-domain transformations of
continuous control signals, which encode explicit low-level dynamics. This dual
supervision aligns the representation spaces of language, vision, and action,
enabling the VLM to directly contribute to action generation. Experimental
results on the LIBERO Franka benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our
frame-work, while real-world evaluations further show that iFlyBot-VLA achieves
competitive success rates across diverse and challenging manipulation tasks.
Furthermore, we plan to open-source a portion of our self-constructed dataset
to support future research in the community

### [2] [Challenging DINOv3 Foundation Model under Low Inter-Class Variability: A Case Study on Fetal Brain Ultrasound](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01915)
*Edoardo Conti,Riccardo Rosati,Lorenzo Federici,Adriano Mancini,Maria Chiara Fiorentin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First comprehensive evaluation of foundation models in fetal ultrasound imaging under low inter-class variability, showing domain-specific pretraining is essential for distinguishing anatomically similar fetal brain planes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While vision foundation models like DINOv3 show strong transferability in medical domains, their ability to discriminate anatomically similar structures with low inter-class variability hasn't been systematically investigated, particularly for fetal brain ultrasound planes.

Method: Created FetalUS-188K benchmark with 188K+ annotated fetal ultrasound images, evaluated DINOv3 through self-supervised pretraining on ultrasound data and natural images, using linear probing and full fine-tuning with standardized adaptation protocols.

Result: Models pretrained on fetal ultrasound data consistently outperformed natural-image initialized models by up to 20% in weighted F1-score, better preserving subtle echogenic and structural cues for distinguishing intermediate planes.

Conclusion: Generic foundation models fail to generalize under low inter-class variability, while domain-specific pretraining is essential for achieving robust and clinically reliable representations in fetal brain ultrasound imaging.

Abstract: Purpose: This study provides the first comprehensive evaluation of foundation
models in fetal ultrasound (US) imaging under low inter-class variability
conditions. While recent vision foundation models such as DINOv3 have shown
remarkable transferability across medical domains, their ability to
discriminate anatomically similar structures has not been systematically
investigated. We address this gap by focusing on fetal brain standard
planes--transthalamic (TT), transventricular (TV), and transcerebellar
(TC)--which exhibit highly overlapping anatomical features and pose a critical
challenge for reliable biometric assessment.
  Methods: To ensure a fair and reproducible evaluation, all publicly available
fetal ultrasound datasets were curated and aggregated into a unified
multicenter benchmark, FetalUS-188K, comprising more than 188,000 annotated
images from heterogeneous acquisition settings. DINOv3 was pretrained in a
self-supervised manner to learn ultrasound-aware representations. The learned
features were then evaluated through standardized adaptation protocols,
including linear probing with frozen backbone and full fine-tuning, under two
initialization schemes: (i) pretraining on FetalUS-188K and (ii) initialization
from natural-image DINOv3 weights.
  Results: Models pretrained on fetal ultrasound data consistently outperformed
those initialized on natural images, with weighted F1-score improvements of up
to 20 percent. Domain-adaptive pretraining enabled the network to preserve
subtle echogenic and structural cues crucial for distinguishing intermediate
planes such as TV.
  Conclusion: Results demonstrate that generic foundation models fail to
generalize under low inter-class variability, whereas domain-specific
pretraining is essential to achieve robust and clinically reliable
representations in fetal brain ultrasound imaging.

### [3] [Assessing the value of Geo-Foundational Models for Flood Inundation Mapping: Benchmarking models for Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Planetscope for end-users](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01990)
*Saurabh Kaushik,Lalit Maurya,Elizabeth Tellman,ZhiJie Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Geo-Foundational Models (GFMs) show competitive performance for flood inundation mapping across different satellite sensors, with Clay emerging as the best overall performer due to better accuracy, computational efficiency, and few-shot learning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of systematic comparison between GFMs and traditional models like U-Net for flood mapping across different sensors and data scenarios, making it difficult for end-users to choose appropriate models.

Method: Evaluated three GFMs (Prithvi 2.0, Clay V1.5, DOFA) and UViT against TransNorm, U-Net, and Attention U-Net using PlanetScope, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2 data with leave-one-region-out cross-validation across five regions and 19 sites.

Result: Clay performed best overall with 0.72-0.51 mIoU across sensors, showing 4% improvement over U-Net. Clay achieved 0.64 mIoU with just 5 training images, outperforming other GFMs. Clay is 3x faster than Prithvi and 2x faster than DOFA due to smaller model size (26M parameters).

Conclusion: GFMs offer small to moderate improvements in flood mapping accuracy at lower computational cost and labeling effort compared to traditional U-Net, with Clay being the most practical choice due to its balanced performance, efficiency, and few-shot learning capabilities.

Abstract: Geo-Foundational Models (GFMs) enable fast and reliable extraction of
spatiotemporal information from satellite imagery, improving flood inundation
mapping by leveraging location and time embeddings. Despite their potential, it
remains unclear whether GFMs outperform traditional models like U-Net. A
systematic comparison across sensors and data availability scenarios is still
lacking, which is an essential step to guide end-users in model selection. To
address this, we evaluate three GFMs, Prithvi 2.0, Clay V1.5, DOFA, and UViT (a
Prithvi variant), against TransNorm, U-Net, and Attention U-Net using
PlanetScope, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2. We observe competitive performance
among all GFMs, with only 2-5% variation between the best and worst models
across sensors. Clay outperforms others on PlanetScope (0.79 mIoU) and
Sentinel-2 (0.70), while Prithvi leads on Sentinel-1 (0.57). In
leave-one-region-out cross-validation across five regions, Clay shows slightly
better performance across all sensors (mIoU: 0.72(0.04), 0.66(0.07),
0.51(0.08)) compared to Prithvi (0.70(0.05), 0.64(0.09), 0.49(0.13)) and DOFA
(0.67(0.07), 0.64(0.04), 0.49(0.09)) for PlanetScope, Sentinel-2, and
Sentinel-1, respectively. Across all 19 sites, leave-one-region-out
cross-validation reveals a 4% improvement by Clay compared to U-Net. Visual
inspection highlights Clay's superior ability to retain fine details. Few-shot
experiments show Clay achieves 0.64 mIoU on PlanetScope with just five training
images, outperforming Prithvi (0.24) and DOFA (0.35). In terms of computational
time, Clay is a better choice due to its smaller model size (26M parameters),
making it ~3x faster than Prithvi (650M) and 2x faster than DOFA (410M).
Contrary to previous findings, our results suggest GFMs offer small to moderate
improvements in flood mapping accuracy at lower computational cost and labeling
effort compared to traditional U-Net.

### [4] [Locally-Supervised Global Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01998)
*Benjamin Walder,Daniel Toader,Robert Nuster,Günther Paltauf,Peter Burgholzer,Gregor Langer,Lukas Krainer,Markus Haltmeier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A learning-based method for image reconstruction from incomplete measurements using multiple invariances to achieve supervised performance with less ground truth data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address image reconstruction from fixed, deterministic sampling patterns with incomplete coverage, overcoming limitations of conventional supervised and self-supervised methods.

Method: Exploit multiple invariances of the underlying image distribution to theoretically achieve the same performance as fully supervised approaches with incomplete ground truth.

Result: Validated on optical-resolution image upsampling in photoacoustic microscopy, showing competitive or superior results with substantially less ground truth data.

Conclusion: The method enables high-quality image reconstruction from incomplete measurements while reducing ground truth data requirements.

Abstract: We address the problem of image reconstruction from incomplete measurements,
encompassing both upsampling and inpainting, within a learning-based framework.
Conventional supervised approaches require fully sampled ground truth data,
while self-supervised methods allow incomplete ground truth but typically rely
on random sampling that, in expectation, covers the entire image. In contrast,
we consider fixed, deterministic sampling patterns with inherently incomplete
coverage, even in expectation. To overcome this limitation, we exploit multiple
invariances of the underlying image distribution, which theoretically allows us
to achieve the same reconstruction performance as fully supervised approaches.
We validate our method on optical-resolution image upsampling in photoacoustic
microscopy (PAM), demonstrating competitive or superior results while requiring
substantially less ground truth data.

### [5] [Towards Selection of Large Multimodal Models as Engines for Burned-in Protected Health Information Detection in Medical Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02014)
*Tuan Truong,Guillermo Jimenez Perez,Pedro Osorio,Matthias Lenga*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LMMs outperform traditional OCR for text extraction but don't consistently improve PHI detection accuracy. Best gains are seen with complex imprint patterns, while readable text regions show similar performance across pipeline configurations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate Large Multimodal Models for PHI detection in medical imaging, addressing privacy concerns and regulatory compliance, as traditional methods rely on OCR with named entity recognition.

Method: Benchmarked GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Qwen 2.5 7B using two pipeline configurations: text analysis only, and OCR with semantic analysis. Compared with traditional OCR models like EasyOCR.

Result: LMMs show superior OCR performance (WER: 0.03-0.05, CER: 0.02-0.03) but OCR improvement doesn't consistently translate to better PHI detection. Strongest gains on complex imprint patterns.

Conclusion: LMMs offer enhanced OCR capabilities but careful pipeline design is needed for PHI detection. Provided recommendations for LMM selection and deployment strategies for scalable infrastructure.

Abstract: The detection of Protected Health Information (PHI) in medical imaging is
critical for safeguarding patient privacy and ensuring compliance with
regulatory frameworks. Traditional detection methodologies predominantly
utilize Optical Character Recognition (OCR) models in conjunction with named
entity recognition. However, recent advancements in Large Multimodal Model
(LMM) present new opportunities for enhanced text extraction and semantic
analysis. In this study, we systematically benchmark three prominent closed and
open-sourced LMMs, namely GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Qwen 2.5 7B, utilizing
two distinct pipeline configurations: one dedicated to text analysis alone and
another integrating both OCR and semantic analysis. Our results indicate that
LMM exhibits superior OCR efficacy (WER: 0.03-0.05, CER: 0.02-0.03) compared to
conventional models like EasyOCR. However, this improvement in OCR performance
does not consistently correlate with enhanced overall PHI detection accuracy.
The strongest performance gains are observed on test cases with complex imprint
patterns. In scenarios where text regions are well readable with sufficient
contrast, and strong LMMs are employed for text analysis after OCR, different
pipeline configurations yield similar results. Furthermore, we provide
empirically grounded recommendations for LMM selection tailored to specific
operational constraints and propose a deployment strategy that leverages
scalable and modular infrastructure.

### [6] [StrengthSense: A Dataset of IMU Signals Capturing Everyday Strength-Demanding Activities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02027)
*Zeyu Yang,Clayton Souza Leite,Yu Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StrengthSense is an open IMU dataset capturing 11 strength-demanding activities and 2 non-strength activities from 29 subjects using 10 body-worn sensors, with video-validated joint angle accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of comprehensive datasets capturing strength-demanding activities using wearable IMU sensors, which are crucial for monitoring muscular strength, endurance, and power.

Method: Collected data from 29 healthy subjects using 10 IMUs placed on limbs and torso, annotated using video recordings as references, with comparative analysis between IMU-estimated joint angles and video-extracted angles.

Result: Created a comprehensive open dataset with technical validation showing accurate and reliable sensor data through joint angle comparison between IMU and video measurements.

Conclusion: StrengthSense enables researchers and developers to advance human activity recognition algorithms and create fitness/health monitoring applications for strength-demanding activities.

Abstract: Tracking strength-demanding activities with wearable sensors like IMUs is
crucial for monitoring muscular strength, endurance, and power. However, there
is a lack of comprehensive datasets capturing these activities. To fill this
gap, we introduce \textit{StrengthSense}, an open dataset that encompasses IMU
signals capturing 11 strength-demanding activities, such as sit-to-stand,
climbing stairs, and mopping. For comparative purposes, the dataset also
includes 2 non-strength demanding activities. The dataset was collected from 29
healthy subjects utilizing 10 IMUs placed on limbs and the torso, and was
annotated using video recordings as references. This paper provides a
comprehensive overview of the data collection, pre-processing, and technical
validation. We conducted a comparative analysis between the joint angles
estimated by IMUs and those directly extracted from video to verify the
accuracy and reliability of the sensor data. Researchers and developers can
utilize \textit{StrengthSense} to advance the development of human activity
recognition algorithms, create fitness and health monitoring applications, and
more.

### [7] [Text-VQA Aug: Pipelined Harnessing of Large Multimodal Models for Automated Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02046)
*Soham Joshi,Shwet Kamal Mishra,Viswanath Gopalakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed an automated pipeline for synthesizing text-VQA datasets using OCR, ROI detection, caption generation, and question generation to create 72K QA pairs from 44K images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual annotation for text-VQA datasets is tedious and challenging, while foundation models and mature OCR systems enable automated synthesis of faithful QA pairs that scale with scene text data.

Method: End-to-end pipeline combining OCR detection/recognition (text spotting), ROI detection, caption generation, and question generation, streamlined for automated synthesis and validation of QA pairs.

Result: Successfully created the first large-scale text-VQA dataset with approximately 72K QA pairs based on around 44K images through automated synthesis.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline demonstrates the feasibility of automated text-VQA dataset creation at scale, reducing reliance on manual annotation while maintaining faithfulness of QA pairs.

Abstract: Creation of large-scale databases for Visual Question Answering tasks
pertaining to the text data in a scene (text-VQA) involves skilful human
annotation, which is tedious and challenging. With the advent of foundation
models that handle vision and language modalities, and with the maturity of OCR
systems, it is the need of the hour to establish an end-to-end pipeline that
can synthesize Question-Answer (QA) pairs based on scene-text from a given
image. We propose a pipeline for automated synthesis for text-VQA dataset that
can produce faithful QA pairs, and which scales up with the availability of
scene text data. Our proposed method harnesses the capabilities of multiple
models and algorithms involving OCR detection and recognition (text spotting),
region of interest (ROI) detection, caption generation, and question
generation. These components are streamlined into a cohesive pipeline to
automate the synthesis and validation of QA pairs. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first pipeline proposed to automatically synthesize and
validate a large-scale text-VQA dataset comprising around 72K QA pairs based on
around 44K images.

### [8] [Markerless Augmented Reality Registration for Surgical Guidance: A Multi-Anatomy Clinical Accuracy Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02086)
*Yue Yang,Fabian Necker,Christoph Leuze,Michelle Chen,Andrey Finegersh,Jake Lee,Vasu Divi,Bruce Daniel,Brian Hargreaves,Jie Ying Wu,Fred M Baik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Developed and clinically evaluated a depth-only, markerless AR registration pipeline on HoloLens 2 for surgical guidance, achieving ~3-4 mm median error across various anatomies without fiducials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable accurate augmented reality guidance in surgery without requiring fiducial markers, particularly for challenging small or low-curvature anatomical targets.

Method: Used HoloLens 2 with AHAT depth tracking aligned to CT-derived skin meshes via depth-bias correction, human-in-the-loop initialization, and global+local registration. Validated on leg/foot models and performed 7 intraoperative trials.

Result: Preclinical validation showed tight agreement (median |Δd| 0.78-0.80 mm). Clinical trials achieved median errors: 3.2 mm (feet), 4.3 mm (ear), 5.3 mm (lower leg), with 5 mm coverage rates of 92-95%, 84-90%, and 72-86% respectively.

Conclusion: Depth-only markerless AR pipeline achieved clinically relevant accuracy (~3-4 mm median error) for moderate-risk surgical tasks, demonstrating improved clinical readiness of markerless AR guidance through human-guided initialization and global-to-local registration.

Abstract: Purpose: In this paper, we develop and clinically evaluate a depth-only,
markerless augmented reality (AR) registration pipeline on a head-mounted
display, and assess accuracy across small or low-curvature anatomies in
real-life operative settings. Methods: On HoloLens 2, we align Articulated HAnd
Tracking (AHAT) depth to Computed Tomography (CT)-derived skin meshes via (i)
depth-bias correction, (ii) brief human-in-the-loop initialization, (iii)
global and local registration. We validated the surface-tracing error metric by
comparing "skin-to-bone" relative distances to CT ground truth on leg and foot
models, using an AR-tracked tool. We then performed seven intraoperative target
trials (feet x2, ear x3, leg x2) during the initial stage of fibula free-flap
harvest and mandibular reconstruction surgery, and collected 500+ data per
trial. Results: Preclinical validation showed tight agreement between AR-traced
and CT distances (leg: median |Delta d| 0.78 mm, RMSE 0.97 mm; feet: 0.80 mm,
1.20 mm). Clinically, per-point error had a median of 3.9 mm. Median errors by
anatomy were 3.2 mm (feet), 4.3 mm (ear), and 5.3 mm (lower leg), with 5 mm
coverage 92-95%, 84-90%, and 72-86%, respectively. Feet vs. lower leg differed
significantly (Delta median ~1.1 mm; p < 0.001). Conclusion: A depth-only,
markerless AR pipeline on HMDs achieved ~3-4 mm median error across feet, ear,
and lower leg in live surgical settings without fiducials, approaching typical
clinical error thresholds for moderate-risk tasks. Human-guided initialization
plus global-to-local registration enabled accurate alignment on small or
low-curvature targets, improving the clinical readiness of markerless AR
guidance.

### [9] [From Instance Segmentation to 3D Growth Trajectory Reconstruction in Planktonic Foraminifera](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02142)
*Huahua Lin,Xiaohao Cai,Mark Nixon,James M. Mulqueeney,Thomas H. G. Ezard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An automated pipeline combining instance segmentation and chamber ordering algorithms to reconstruct 3D growth trajectories of planktonic foraminifera from CT scans, reducing manual effort while maintaining biological accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual segmentation of foraminifera chambers is time-consuming and subjective, limiting large-scale ecological studies. Automated tracing of chamber growth from imaging data remains largely unexplored despite its importance for understanding organismal development and environmental adaptation.

Method: End-to-end pipeline integrating instance segmentation (computer vision technique) with dedicated chamber ordering algorithm to automatically reconstruct 3D growth trajectories from high-resolution CT scans. Multiple instance segmentation methods optimized for distinct chamber features are evaluated.

Result: The pipeline substantially reduces manual effort while maintaining biologically meaningful accuracy. Chamber-ordering algorithm remains robust even with under-segmentation in smaller chambers, achieving consistent reconstruction of developmental trajectories under partial segmentation.

Conclusion: This work provides the first fully automated and reproducible pipeline for digital foraminiferal growth analysis, establishing a foundation for large-scale, data-driven ecological studies.

Abstract: Planktonic foraminifera, marine protists characterized by their intricate
chambered shells, serve as valuable indicators of past and present
environmental conditions. Understanding their chamber growth trajectory
provides crucial insights into organismal development and ecological adaptation
under changing environments. However, automated tracing of chamber growth from
imaging data remains largely unexplored, with existing approaches relying
heavily on manual segmentation of each chamber, which is time-consuming and
subjective. In this study, we propose an end-to-end pipeline that integrates
instance segmentation, a computer vision technique not extensively explored in
foraminifera, with a dedicated chamber ordering algorithm to automatically
reconstruct three-dimensional growth trajectories from high-resolution computed
tomography scans. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate multiple
instance segmentation methods, each optimized for distinct spatial features of
the chambers, and examine their downstream influence on growth-order
reconstruction accuracy. Experimental results on expert-annotated datasets
demonstrate that the proposed pipeline substantially reduces manual effort
while maintaining biologically meaningful accuracy. Although segmentation
models exhibit under-segmentation in smaller chambers due to reduced voxel
fidelity and subtle inter-chamber connectivity, the chamber-ordering algorithm
remains robust, achieving consistent reconstruction of developmental
trajectories even under partial segmentation. This work provides the first
fully automated and reproducible pipeline for digital foraminiferal growth
analysis, establishing a foundation for large-scale, data-driven ecological
studies.

### [10] [Fast Measuring Pavement Crack Width by Cascading Principal Component Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02144)
*Zhicheng Wang,Junbiao Pang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A cascaded PCA and Robust PCA framework for accurate crack width measurement from pavement images, overcoming challenges of complex crack morphology and enabling rapid measurements from arbitrary locations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise crack width quantification is crucial for pavement structural assessment but faces challenges from complex crack boundaries and need for rapid measurement capabilities from arbitrary pixel locations.

Method: Three-stage framework: (1) initial crack segmentation using detection algorithms, (2) PCA for primary orientation axis of quasi-parallel cracks, (3) RPCA for Main Propagation Axis extraction of irregular cracks.

Result: Superior performance in computational efficiency and measurement accuracy compared to state-of-the-art techniques across three public datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed cascaded PCA-RPCA framework effectively addresses crack width measurement challenges and outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: Accurate quantification of pavement crack width plays a pivotal role in
assessing structural integrity and guiding maintenance interventions. However,
achieving precise crack width measurements presents significant challenges due
to: (1) the complex, non-uniform morphology of crack boundaries, which limits
the efficacy of conventional approaches, and (2) the demand for rapid
measurement capabilities from arbitrary pixel locations to facilitate
comprehensive pavement condition evaluation. To overcome these limitations,
this study introduces a cascaded framework integrating Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) and Robust PCA (RPCA) for efficient crack width extraction from
digital images. The proposed methodology comprises three sequential stages: (1)
initial crack segmentation using established detection algorithms to generate a
binary representation, (2) determination of the primary orientation axis for
quasi-parallel cracks through PCA, and (3) extraction of the Main Propagation
Axis (MPA) for irregular crack geometries using RPCA. Comprehensive evaluations
were conducted across three publicly available datasets, demonstrating that the
proposed approach achieves superior performance in both computational
efficiency and measurement accuracy compared to existing state-of-the-art
techniques.

### [11] [Autobiasing Event Cameras for Flickering Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02180)
*Mehdi Sefidgar Dilmaghani,Waseem Shariff,Cian Ryan,Joe Lemley,Peter Corcoran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Autonomous bias tuning mechanism for event cameras that reduces flicker effects across 25-500 Hz range using CNN-based detection and dynamic bias adjustment, improving face detection performance in various lighting conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address flicker effects caused by rapid light intensity variations in event cameras, which degrade performance in diverse environments, without relying on additional hardware or software filters.

Method: Uses CNN to detect flicker in spatial space and dynamically adjusts event camera bias settings to minimize flicker impact, tested with face detector framework under various lighting conditions and frequencies.

Result: Significant improvements: enhanced YOLO confidence for face detection, increased percentage of frames with detected faces, and 38.2% (well-lit) to 53.6% (low-light) reduction in average gradient indicating flicker presence.

Conclusion: The autobiasing system effectively improves event camera functionality in adverse lighting scenarios by leveraging inherent bias settings rather than external filtering methods.

Abstract: Understanding and mitigating flicker effects caused by rapid variations in
light intensity is critical for enhancing the performance of event cameras in
diverse environments. This paper introduces an innovative autonomous mechanism
for tuning the biases of event cameras, effectively addressing flicker across a
wide frequency range -25 Hz to 500 Hz. Unlike traditional methods that rely on
additional hardware or software for flicker filtering, our approach leverages
the event cameras inherent bias settings. Utilizing a simple Convolutional
Neural Networks -CNNs, the system identifies instances of flicker in a spatial
space and dynamically adjusts specific biases to minimize its impact. The
efficacy of this autobiasing system was robustly tested using a face detector
framework under both well-lit and low-light conditions, as well as across
various frequencies. The results demonstrated significant improvements:
enhanced YOLO confidence metrics for face detection, and an increased
percentage of frames capturing detected faces. Moreover, the average gradient,
which serves as an indicator of flicker presence through edge detection,
decreased by 38.2 percent in well-lit conditions and by 53.6 percent in
low-light conditions. These findings underscore the potential of our approach
to significantly improve the functionality of event cameras in a range of
adverse lighting scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework for Grounded Video Question Answering that decomposes the task into video reasoning, spatio-temporal grounding, and tracking stages, using a trigger moment concept to significantly improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The GVQA task requires multimodal models capable of complex reasoning over video content, visual grounding of answers, and temporal tracking of referenced objects.

Method: Three-stage pipeline: (1) Video Reasoning & QA, (2) Spatio-temporal Grounding, (3) Tracking. Introduces trigger moment concept using CORTEX prompt to identify the most visible frame of target objects.

Result: Achieved HOTA score of 0.4968, representing significant improvement over previous year's winning score of 0.2704 on GVQA task.

Conclusion: The proposed framework with trigger moment concept effectively addresses GVQA challenges and substantially outperforms previous approaches.

Abstract: In this technical report, we introduce a framework to address Grounded Video
Question Answering (GVQA) task for the ICCV 2025 Perception Test Challenge. The
GVQA task demands robust multimodal models capable of complex reasoning over
video content, grounding the resulting answers visually, and tracking the
referenced objects temporally. To achieve this capability, our proposed
approach decomposes the GVQA task into a three-stage pipeline: (1) Video
Reasoning \& QA, (2) Spatio-temporal Grounding and (3) Tracking. Our key
contribution is the introduction of a trigger moment, derived from our proposed
CORTEX prompt, which pinpoints the single most visible frame of a target object
to serve as a robust anchor for grounding and tracking. To this end, we achieve
the HOTA score of 0.4968, which marks a significant improvement over the
previous year's winning score of 0.2704 on GVQA task.

### [13] [MM-UNet: Morph Mamba U-shaped Convolutional Networks for Retinal Vessel Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02193)
*Jiawen Liu,Yuanbo Zeng,Jiaming Liang,Yizhen Yang,Yiheng Zhang,Enhui Cai,Xiaoqi Sheng,Hongmin Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MM-UNet is a novel deep learning architecture for retinal vessel segmentation that uses Morph Mamba Convolution layers and Reverse Selective State Guidance modules to improve segmentation accuracy of thin, branching vascular structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Retinal vessel segmentation is crucial for clinical diagnosis but challenging due to the extremely thin and branching nature of retinal vasculature, which differs significantly from conventional segmentation targets and requires improved precision and robustness.

Method: Proposes MM-UNet with two key components: Morph Mamba Convolution layers that replace pointwise convolutions to enhance branching topological perception, and Reverse Selective State Guidance modules that integrate reverse guidance theory with state-space modeling to improve geometric boundary awareness.

Result: Achieves superior performance on two public datasets with F1-score gains of 1.64% on DRIVE and 1.25% on STARE compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: MM-UNet demonstrates effectiveness and advancement in retinal vessel segmentation through its novel architecture components that specifically address the challenges of thin, branching vascular structures.

Abstract: Accurate detection of retinal vessels plays a critical role in reflecting a
wide range of health status indicators in the clinical diagnosis of ocular
diseases. Recently, advances in deep learning have led to a surge in retinal
vessel segmentation methods, which have significantly contributed to the
quantitative analysis of vascular morphology. However, retinal vasculature
differs significantly from conventional segmentation targets in that it
consists of extremely thin and branching structures, whose global morphology
varies greatly across images. These characteristics continue to pose challenges
to segmentation precision and robustness. To address these issues, we propose
MM-UNet, a novel architecture tailored for efficient retinal vessel
segmentation. The model incorporates Morph Mamba Convolution layers, which
replace pointwise convolutions to enhance branching topological perception
through morph, state-aware feature sampling. Additionally, Reverse Selective
State Guidance modules integrate reverse guidance theory with state-space
modeling to improve geometric boundary awareness and decoding efficiency.
Extensive experiments conducted on two public retinal vessel segmentation

TL;DR: A language-enhanced generative model synthesizes amyloid-beta PET images from blood biomarkers and MRI, achieving high similarity to real PET scans and improving Alzheimer's disease diagnosis accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Alzheimer's disease diagnosis relies on expensive and inaccessible amyloid-beta PET imaging. This study aims to predict PET spatial patterns from more accessible blood biomarkers and MRI scans.

Method: Collected data from 566 participants including Abeta-PET, T1-weighted MRI, and blood biomarkers. Developed a language-enhanced generative model using LLM and multimodal fusion to synthesize PET images, evaluated through automated diagnostic pipeline.

Result: Synthetic PET images closely resemble real scans (SSIM=0.920, Pearson's r=0.955). Diagnostic accuracy with synthetic PET reached 0.80. Synthetic PET-based model (AUC=0.78) outperformed T1-based (0.68) and BBM-based (0.73) models, with combined approach reaching AUC=0.79.

Conclusion: The language-enhanced generative model successfully synthesizes realistic PET images, enhancing the utility of MRI and blood biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis and improving clinical workflow.

Abstract: Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis heavily relies on amyloid-beta
positron emission tomography (Abeta-PET), which is limited by high cost and
limited accessibility. This study explores whether Abeta-PET spatial patterns
can be predicted from blood-based biomarkers (BBMs) and MRI scans. Methods: We
collected Abeta-PET images, T1-weighted MRI scans, and BBMs from 566
participants. A language-enhanced generative model, driven by a large language
model (LLM) and multimodal information fusion, was developed to synthesize PET
images. Synthesized images were evaluated for image quality, diagnostic
consistency, and clinical applicability within a fully automated diagnostic
pipeline. Findings: The synthetic PET images closely resemble real PET scans in
both structural details (SSIM = 0.920 +/- 0.003) and regional patterns
(Pearson's r = 0.955 +/- 0.007). Diagnostic outcomes using synthetic PET show
high agreement with real PET-based diagnoses (accuracy = 0.80). Using synthetic
PET, we developed a fully automatic AD diagnostic pipeline integrating PET
synthesis and classification. The synthetic PET-based model (AUC = 0.78)
outperforms T1-based (AUC = 0.68) and BBM-based (AUC = 0.73) models, while
combining synthetic PET and BBMs further improved performance (AUC = 0.79).
Ablation analysis supports the advantages of LLM integration and prompt
engineering. Interpretation: Our language-enhanced generative model synthesizes
realistic PET images, enhancing the utility of MRI and BBMs for Abeta spatial
pattern assessment and improving the diagnostic workflow for Alzheimer's
disease.

*Jiajia Li,Keyi Zhu,Qianwen Zhang,Dong Chen,Qi Sun,Zhaojian Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel object-centric 3D reconstruction framework using SAM-2 segmentation and alpha masking for clean strawberry plant reconstructions, enabling automatic plant trait estimation with improved accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional plant phenotyping methods are time-consuming and destructive, while current 3DGS applications reconstruct entire scenes including background noise, complicating trait analysis and increasing computational costs.

Method: Proposed object-centric 3D reconstruction with preprocessing pipeline using Segment Anything Model v2 (SAM-2) and alpha channel background masking, combined with DBSCAN clustering and PCA for automatic plant trait estimation.

Result: The method produces more accurate geometric representations with substantial computational time reduction, outperforming conventional pipelines in both accuracy and efficiency for strawberry plant phenotyping.

Conclusion: The framework offers a scalable and non-destructive solution for strawberry plant phenotyping, enabling automatic estimation of important plant traits like height and canopy width.

Abstract: Strawberries are among the most economically significant fruits in the United
States, generating over $2 billion in annual farm-gate sales and accounting for
approximately 13% of the total fruit production value. Plant phenotyping plays
a vital role in selecting superior cultivars by characterizing plant traits
such as morphology, canopy structure, and growth dynamics. However, traditional
plant phenotyping methods are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often
destructive. Recently, neural rendering techniques, notably Neural Radiance
Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have emerged as powerful
frameworks for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction. By capturing a sequence of
multi-view images or videos around a target plant, these methods enable
non-destructive reconstruction of complex plant architectures. Despite their
promise, most current applications of 3DGS in agricultural domains reconstruct
the entire scene, including background elements, which introduces noise,
increases computational costs, and complicates downstream trait analysis. To
address this limitation, we propose a novel object-centric 3D reconstruction
framework incorporating a preprocessing pipeline that leverages the Segment
Anything Model v2 (SAM-2) and alpha channel background masking to achieve clean
strawberry plant reconstructions. This approach produces more accurate
geometric representations while substantially reducing computational time. With
a background-free reconstruction, our algorithm can automatically estimate
important plant traits, such as plant height and canopy width, using DBSCAN
clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Experimental results show
that our method outperforms conventional pipelines in both accuracy and
efficiency, offering a scalable and non-destructive solution for strawberry
plant phenotyping.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces autoStrain, the first automated pipeline for segmental longitudinal strain estimation in transesophageal echocardiography using deep learning methods, achieving clinical validation with good agreement to references.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current techniques for strain estimation require significant manual intervention and expertise, limiting efficiency and making them too resource-intensive for monitoring purposes in cardiac function assessment.

Method: Developed two DL approaches: TeeFlow (based on RAFT optical flow for dense frame-to-frame predictions) and TeeTracker (based on CoTracker for sparse long-sequence predictions), trained on a synthetic TEE dataset generated using SIMUS simulation pipeline with ground truth myocardial motion.

Result: TeeTracker outperformed TeeFlow with mean distance error of 0.65 mm on synthetic test data. Clinical validation on 16 patients showed mean difference of 1.09% (-8.90% to 11.09%) compared to clinical references. Incorporation of simulated ischemia improved accuracy in quantifying abnormal deformation.

Conclusion: Integrating AI-driven motion estimation with TEE can significantly enhance the precision and efficiency of cardiac function assessment in clinical settings.

Abstract: Segmental longitudinal strain (SLS) of the left ventricle (LV) is an
important prognostic indicator for evaluating regional LV dysfunction, in
particular for diagnosing and managing myocardial ischemia. Current techniques
for strain estimation require significant manual intervention and expertise,
limiting their efficiency and making them too resource-intensive for monitoring
purposes. This study introduces the first automated pipeline, autoStrain, for
SLS estimation in transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) using deep learning
(DL) methods for motion estimation. We present a comparative analysis of two DL
approaches: TeeFlow, based on the RAFT optical flow model for dense
frame-to-frame predictions, and TeeTracker, based on the CoTracker point
trajectory model for sparse long-sequence predictions.
  As ground truth motion data from real echocardiographic sequences are hardly
accessible, we took advantage of a unique simulation pipeline (SIMUS) to
generate a highly realistic synthetic TEE (synTEE) dataset of 80 patients with
ground truth myocardial motion to train and evaluate both models. Our
evaluation shows that TeeTracker outperforms TeeFlow in accuracy, achieving a
mean distance error in motion estimation of 0.65 mm on a synTEE test dataset.
  Clinical validation on 16 patients further demonstrated that SLS estimation
with our autoStrain pipeline aligned with clinical references, achieving a mean
difference (95\% limits of agreement) of 1.09% (-8.90% to 11.09%).
Incorporation of simulated ischemia in the synTEE data improved the accuracy of
the models in quantifying abnormal deformation. Our findings indicate that
integrating AI-driven motion estimation with TEE can significantly enhance the
precision and efficiency of cardiac function assessment in clinical settings.

### [17] [Can Foundation Models Revolutionize Mobile AR Sparse Sensing?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02215)
*Yiqin Zhao,Tian Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Foundation models can significantly improve mobile sparse sensing by enabling more accurate geometry-aware image warping and leading performance in 3D scene reconstruction, though integration challenges remain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile sensing systems face a fundamental trade-off between sensing quality and efficiency due to computation and power constraints. Sparse sensing helps maintain performance but existing methods suffer from reduced accuracy due to missing information across space and time.

Method: Investigates whether foundation models can improve mobile sparse sensing using real-world mobile AR data. Evaluates foundation models for geometry-aware image warping and their scalability in sparse sensing applications.

Result: Foundation models offer significant improvements in geometry-aware image warping and demonstrate leading performance in 3D scene reconstruction. The study shows the scalability of foundation model-based sparse sensing.

Conclusion: Foundation models show promise for transforming mobile sparse sensing by improving accuracy and performance, but there are still open challenges in integrating them into mobile sensing systems.

Abstract: Mobile sensing systems have long faced a fundamental trade-off between
sensing quality and efficiency due to constraints in computation, power, and
other limitations. Sparse sensing, which aims to acquire and process only a
subset of sensor data, has been a key strategy for maintaining performance
under such constraints. However, existing sparse sensing methods often suffer
from reduced accuracy, as missing information across space and time introduces
uncertainty into many sensing systems. In this work, we investigate whether
foundation models can change the landscape of mobile sparse sensing. Using
real-world mobile AR data, our evaluations demonstrate that foundation models
offer significant improvements in geometry-aware image warping, a central
technique for enabling accurate reuse of cross-frame information. Furthermore,
our study demonstrates the scalability of foundation model-based sparse sensing
and shows its leading performance in 3D scene reconstruction. Collectively, our
study reveals critical aspects of the promises and the open challenges of
integrating foundation models into mobile sparse sensing systems.

### [18] [Collaborative Attention and Consistent-Guided Fusion of MRI and PET for Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02228)
*Delin Ma,Menghui Zhou,Jun Qi,Yun Yang,Po Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A collaborative attention and consistency-guided fusion framework for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis using MRI and PET neuroimaging that addresses modality-specific feature importance and distributional differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is crucial, and multimodal neuroimaging fusion shows promise but existing methods overlook modality-specific features and suffer from distributional differences between MRI and PET data.

Method: Proposes a framework with learnable parameter representation block to handle missing modality data, shared and modality-independent encoders to preserve both shared and specific features, and consistency-guided mechanism to align latent distributions across modalities.

Result: Experimental results on ADNI dataset show superior diagnostic performance compared to existing fusion strategies.

Conclusion: The proposed collaborative attention and consistency-guided fusion framework effectively addresses limitations in multimodal neuroimaging fusion for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia, and its
early diagnosis is essential for slowing disease progression. Recent studies on
multimodal neuroimaging fusion using MRI and PET have achieved promising
results by integrating multi-scale complementary features. However, most
existing approaches primarily emphasize cross-modal complementarity while
overlooking the diagnostic importance of modality-specific features. In
addition, the inherent distributional differences between modalities often lead
to biased and noisy representations, degrading classification performance. To
address these challenges, we propose a Collaborative Attention and
Consistent-Guided Fusion framework for MRI and PET based AD diagnosis. The
proposed model introduces a learnable parameter representation (LPR) block to
compensate for missing modality information, followed by a shared encoder and
modality-independent encoders to preserve both shared and specific
representations. Furthermore, a consistency-guided mechanism is employed to
explicitly align the latent distributions across modalities. Experimental
results on the ADNI dataset demonstrate that our method achieves superior
diagnostic performance compared with existing fusion strategies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A latent feature alignment method for monocular depth estimation in endoscopic videos that reduces domain gap between synthetic and real images using adversarial learning and feature consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unsupervised domain adaptation methods for monocular depth estimation in medical endoscopy still leave a domain gap between translated synthetic images and real endoscopic frames, limiting absolute depth estimation accuracy.

Method: Proposes latent feature alignment via adversarial learning and directional feature consistency, where depth networks learn domain-invariant features from both translated synthetic and real endoscopic frames.

Result: Achieves superior performance on both absolute and relative depth metrics compared to state-of-the-art methods, with consistent improvements across various backbones and pretrained weights.

Conclusion: The proposed latent feature alignment method effectively reduces domain gap in endoscopic depth estimation and improves performance without relying on the image translation process.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation (MDE) is a critical task to guide autonomous
medical robots. However, obtaining absolute (metric) depth from an endoscopy
camera in surgical scenes is difficult, which limits supervised learning of
depth on real endoscopic images. Current image-level unsupervised domain
adaptation methods translate synthetic images with known depth maps into the
style of real endoscopic frames and train depth networks using these translated
images with their corresponding depth maps. However a domain gap often remains
between real and translated synthetic images. In this paper, we present a
latent feature alignment method to improve absolute depth estimation by
reducing this domain gap in the context of endoscopic videos of the central
airway. Our methods are agnostic to the image translation process and focus on
the depth estimation itself. Specifically, the depth network takes translated
synthetic and real endoscopic frames as input and learns latent
domain-invariant features via adversarial learning and directional feature
consistency. The evaluation is conducted on endoscopic videos of central airway
phantoms with manually aligned absolute depth maps. Compared to
state-of-the-art MDE methods, our approach achieves superior performance on
both absolute and relative depth metrics, and consistently improves results
across various backbones and pretrained weights. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HTSC-CIF framework addresses three key challenges in Medical Report Generation through hierarchical task decomposition: low-level entity alignment, mid-level cross-modal alignment, and high-level causal intervention to reduce biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MRG models face three main challenges: insufficient domain knowledge understanding, poor text-visual entity alignment, and spurious correlations from cross-modal biases. Previous work only addressed single challenges, while this paper aims to tackle all three simultaneously.

Method: Proposes HTSC-CIF framework with hierarchical task decomposition: 1) Low-level: align medical entity features with spatial locations; 2) Mid-level: use Prefix Language Modeling and Masked Image Modeling for cross-modal alignment; 3) High-level: cross-modal causal intervention via front-door intervention to reduce confounders.

Result: Extensive experiments confirm HTSC-CIF's effectiveness, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art MRG methods.

Conclusion: The hierarchical task decomposition approach successfully addresses all three key challenges in MRG, providing a comprehensive solution that improves both performance and interpretability.

Abstract: Medical Report Generation (MRG) is a key part of modern medical diagnostics,
as it automatically generates reports from radiological images to reduce
radiologists' burden. However, reliable MRG models for lesion description face
three main challenges: insufficient domain knowledge understanding, poor
text-visual entity embedding alignment, and spurious correlations from
cross-modal biases. Previous work only addresses single challenges, while this
paper tackles all three via a novel hierarchical task decomposition approach,
proposing the HTSC-CIF framework. HTSC-CIF classifies the three challenges into
low-, mid-, and high-level tasks: 1) Low-level: align medical entity features
with spatial locations to enhance domain knowledge for visual encoders; 2)
Mid-level: use Prefix Language Modeling (text) and Masked Image Modeling
(images) to boost cross-modal alignment via mutual guidance; 3) High-level: a
cross-modal causal intervention module (via front-door intervention) to reduce
confounders and improve interpretability. Extensive experiments confirm
HTSC-CIF's effectiveness, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA)
MRG methods. Code will be made public upon paper acceptance.

*Giorgos Sfikas,Konstantina Nikolaidou,Foteini Papadopoulou,George Retsinas,Anastasios L. Kesidis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Exploring the use of Euler angles parameterization for Normalizing Flows models in probabilistic 3D object pose estimation, despite their known limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Probabilistic pose estimation is beneficial when pose is ambiguous due to sensor constraints, projection limitations, or object symmetries. Euler angles, while having shortcomings, may provide useful models compared to more complex parameterizations.

Method: Using Euler angles parameterization as a basis for Normalizing Flows model for pose estimation, comparing it against more complex parameterization approaches.

Result: The paper explores whether Euler angles can lead to useful models despite their known limitations in the context of probabilistic pose estimation.

Conclusion: Euler angles parameterization may be a viable approach for building Normalizing Flows models for probabilistic 3D object pose estimation, offering potential benefits over more complex parameterizations.

Abstract: Object pose estimation is a task that is of central importance in 3D Computer
Vision. Given a target image and a canonical pose, a single point estimate may
very often be sufficient; however, a probabilistic pose output is related to a
number of benefits when pose is not unambiguous due to sensor and projection
constraints or inherent object symmetries. With this paper, we explore the
usefulness of using the well-known Euler angles parameterisation as a basis for
a Normalizing Flows model for pose estimation. Isomorphic to spatial rotation,
3D pose has been parameterized in a number of ways, either in or out of the
context of parameter estimation. We explore the idea that Euler angles, despite
their shortcomings, may lead to useful models in a number of aspects, compared
to a model built on a more complex parameterisation.

TL;DR: SAIL-RL is a reinforcement learning framework that teaches multimodal LLMs when and how to think using dual rewards for reasoning quality and adaptive thinking strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches suffer from outcome-only supervision (rewarding correct answers without ensuring sound reasoning) and uniform thinking strategies (leading to overthinking on simple tasks and underthinking on complex ones).

Method: Uses a dual reward system: Thinking Reward evaluates reasoning quality through factual grounding, logical coherence, and answer consistency; Judging Reward adaptively determines whether deep reasoning or direct answering is appropriate.

Result: SAIL-RL improves reasoning and multimodal understanding benchmarks at both 4B and 8B scales, achieves competitive performance against GPT-4o, and substantially reduces hallucinations.

Conclusion: SAIL-RL establishes a principled framework for building more reliable and adaptive multimodal large language models.

Abstract: We introduce SAIL-RL, a reinforcement learning (RL) post-training framework
that enhances the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) by teaching them when and how to think. Existing approaches are limited
by outcome-only supervision, which rewards correct answers without ensuring
sound reasoning, and by uniform thinking strategies, which often lead to
overthinking on simple tasks and underthinking on complex ones. SAIL-RL
addresses these challenges with a dual reward system: the Thinking Reward,
which evaluates reasoning quality through factual grounding, logical coherence,
and answer consistency, and the Judging Reward, which adaptively determines
whether deep reasoning or direct answering is appropriate. Experiments on the
state-of-the-art SAIL-VL2 show that SAIL-RL improves reasoning and multimodal
understanding benchmarks at both 4B and 8B scales, achieving competitive
performance against commercial closed-source models such as GPT-4o, and
substantially reduces hallucinations, establishing it as a principled framework
for building more reliable and adaptive MLLMs. The code will be available at

Motivation: To improve handwritten mathematical expression recognition by effectively modeling spatial relationships between symbols using graph neural networks.

Method: Use deep BLSTM for symbol segmentation/recognition, 2D-CFG parser for spatial relations, and GNN link prediction to refine graph structure by removing unnecessary connections.

Result: Experimental results show promising performance in HME structure recognition, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: The GNN-based approach successfully recognizes handwritten mathematical expressions by modeling them as graphs and refining spatial relationships through link prediction.

Abstract: We propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based approach for Handwritten
Mathematical Expression (HME) recognition by modeling HMEs as graphs, where
nodes represent symbols and edges capture spatial dependencies. A deep BLSTM
network is used for symbol segmentation, recognition, and spatial relation
classification, forming an initial primitive graph. A 2D-CFG parser then
generates all possible spatial relations, while the GNN-based link prediction
model refines the structure by removing unnecessary connections, ultimately
forming the Symbol Label Graph. Experimental results demonstrate the

TL;DR: Cycle-Sync is a robust global framework for camera pose estimation that uses modified message-passing least squares with cycle consistency and robust loss functions, achieving state-of-the-art performance without bundle adjustment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a robust and global camera pose estimation framework that leverages cycle consistency and avoids the need for computationally expensive bundle adjustment while achieving strong theoretical guarantees.

Method: Adapts message-passing least squares (MPLS) for camera location estimation with cycle consistency, redefines cycle consistencies using estimated distances, incorporates Welsch-type robust loss, and adds outlier rejection module inspired by robust subspace recovery.

Result: Establishes strongest known deterministic exact-recovery guarantee for camera location estimation, achieves lowest known sample complexity, and consistently outperforms leading pose estimators including full structure-from-motion pipelines with bundle adjustment on synthetic and real datasets.

Conclusion: Cycle-Sync provides a robust global framework for camera pose estimation that demonstrates cycle consistency alone suffices for optimal performance, eliminating the need for bundle adjustment while achieving state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: We introduce Cycle-Sync, a robust and global framework for estimating camera
poses (both rotations and locations). Our core innovation is a location solver
that adapts message-passing least squares (MPLS) -- originally developed for
group synchronization -- to camera location estimation. We modify MPLS to
emphasize cycle-consistent information, redefine cycle consistencies using
estimated distances from previous iterations, and incorporate a Welsch-type
robust loss. We establish the strongest known deterministic exact-recovery
guarantee for camera location estimation, showing that cycle consistency alone
-- without access to inter-camera distances -- suffices to achieve the lowest
sample complexity currently known. To further enhance robustness, we introduce
a plug-and-play outlier rejection module inspired by robust subspace recovery,
and we fully integrate cycle consistency into MPLS for rotation
synchronization. Our global approach avoids the need for bundle adjustment.
Experiments on synthetic and real datasets show that Cycle-Sync consistently
outperforms leading pose estimators, including full structure-from-motion
pipelines with bundle adjustment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GAFD-CC is a novel post-hoc OOD detection method that leverages global-aware feature decoupling and confidence calibration to improve detection performance by refining decision boundaries and increasing discriminative power.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing post-hoc OOD detection methods overlook the inherent correlation between features and logits, which is crucial for effective OOD detection in real-world applications where model reliability and robustness are paramount.

Method: GAFD-CC performs global-aware feature decoupling guided by classification weights to extract positively correlated features (for ID/OOD boundary refinement) and negatively correlated features (to suppress false positives). It then adaptively fuses these decoupled features with multi-scale logit-based confidence.

Result: Extensive experiments on large-scale benchmarks demonstrate GAFD-CC's competitive performance and strong generalization ability compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: GAFD-CC effectively addresses the limitation of existing methods by leveraging feature-logit correlation through global-aware decoupling and confidence fusion, achieving superior OOD detection performance.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is paramount to ensuring the reliability
and robustness of learning models in real-world applications. Existing post-hoc
OOD detection methods detect OOD samples by leveraging their features and
logits information without retraining. However, they often overlook the
inherent correlation between features and logits, which is crucial for
effective OOD detection. To address this limitation, we propose Global-Aware
Feature Decoupling with Confidence Calibration (GAFD-CC). GAFD-CC aims to
refine decision boundaries and increase discriminative performance. Firstly, it
performs global-aware feature decoupling guided by classification weights. This
involves aligning features with the direction of global classification weights
to decouple them. From this, GAFD-CC extracts two types of critical
information: positively correlated features that promote in-distribution
(ID)/OOD boundary refinement and negatively correlated features that suppress
false positives and tighten these boundaries. Secondly, it adaptively fuses
these decoupled features with multi-scale logit-based confidence for
comprehensive and robust OOD detection. Extensive experiments on large-scale
benchmarks demonstrate GAFD-CC's competitive performance and strong
generalization ability compared to those of state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current portable physiological monitoring methods have limitations in accessibility and reliability. Video-based photoplethysmography on smartphones faces challenges with motion artifacts, lighting variations, and single-view constraints, with few reliable applications for cardiovascular patients and no open datasets for cross-device accuracy.

Method: Created M3PD dataset with synchronized dual-view videos (facial and fingertip) captured via front and rear smartphone cameras. Proposed F3Mamba model that fuses facial and fingertip views using Mamba-based temporal modeling.

Result: F3Mamba reduces heart-rate error by 21.9 to 30.2 percent compared to existing single-view baselines and improves robustness in challenging real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: The dual-view approach with Mamba-based temporal modeling significantly enhances the reliability and accuracy of video-based photoplethysmography for cardiovascular monitoring, addressing key limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Portable physiological monitoring is essential for early detection and
management of cardiovascular disease, but current methods often require
specialized equipment that limits accessibility or impose impractical postures
that patients cannot maintain. Video-based photoplethysmography on smartphones
offers a convenient noninvasive alternative, yet it still faces reliability
challenges caused by motion artifacts, lighting variations, and single-view
constraints. Few studies have demonstrated reliable application to
cardiovascular patients, and no widely used open datasets exist for
cross-device accuracy. To address these limitations, we introduce the M3PD
dataset, the first publicly available dual-view mobile photoplethysmography
dataset, comprising synchronized facial and fingertip videos captured
simultaneously via front and rear smartphone cameras from 60 participants
(including 47 cardiovascular patients). Building on this dual-view setting, we
further propose F3Mamba, which fuses the facial and fingertip views through
Mamba-based temporal modeling. The model reduces heart-rate error by 21.9 to

*Jizheng Ma,Xiaofei Zhou,Yanlong Song,Han Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoCoVa introduces continuous cross-modal reasoning for VLMs using latent thought vectors and iterative refinement, outperforming larger models on vision-language tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs are constrained to discrete linguistic tokens, which limits their ability to capture the rich, continuous nature of visual perception and human cognition.

Method: Uses iterative reasoning with Latent Q-Former (LQ-Former) to refine latent thought vectors, dynamic token selection for visual attention, and multi-task training with contrastive learning and diffusion-based reconstruction.

Result: CoCoVa improves accuracy and token efficiency, with 1.5B backbone competing with 7B-9B models, and 7B backbone remaining competitive with state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges the gap between discrete language processing and continuous visual understanding, with latent space capturing interpretable reasoning patterns.

Abstract: In human cognition, there exist numerous thought processes that are tacit and
beyond verbal expression, enabling us to understand and interact with the world
in multiple ways. However, contemporary Vision-Language Models (VLMs) remain
constrained to reasoning within the discrete and rigid space of linguistic
tokens, thereby bottlenecking the rich, high-dimensional nature of visual
perception. To bridge this gap, we propose CoCoVa (Chain of Continuous
Vision-Language Thought), a novel framework for vision-language model that
leverages continuous cross-modal reasoning for diverse vision-language tasks.
The core of CoCoVa is an iterative reasoning cycle, where a novel Latent
Q-Former (LQ-Former) acts as a dynamic reasoning engine, iteratively refining a
chain of latent thought vectors through cross-modal fusion. To focus this
process, a token selection mechanism dynamically identifies salient visual
regions, mimicking attentional focus. To ensure these latent thoughts remain
grounded, we train the model with a multi-task objective that combines
contrastive learning and diffusion-based reconstruction, enforcing alignment
between latent representations and both visual and textual modalities.
Evaluations show CoCoVa improves accuracy and token efficiency over strong
baselines. With a 1.5B backbone, it competes with or surpasses larger 7B-9B
models on almost all benchmarks. When scaled to 7B LLM backbones, it remains
competitive with state-of-the-art models. Qualitative analysis validates that
learned latent space captures interpretable and structured reasoning patterns,
highlighting the potential of CoCoVa to bridge the representational gap between
discrete language processing and the continuous nature of visual understanding.

TL;DR: RxnCaption converts chemical reaction diagram parsing into an image captioning task using Large Vision-Language Models, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a novel visual prompting strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chemical reaction data in papers exist as images, making them not machine-readable and unusable for training machine learning models, which limits AI research in chemistry.

Method: Reformulates reaction diagram parsing as image captioning using LVLMs, introduces BIVP strategy with MolYOLO detector to pre-draw molecular bounding boxes and indices on input images.

Result: RxnCaption-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple metrics, with BIVP strategy significantly improving structural extraction quality while simplifying model design.

Conclusion: The method, dataset (RxnCaption-11k), and models will advance structured information extraction from chemical literature and catalyze broader AI applications in chemistry.

Abstract: Large-scale chemical reaction datasets are crucial for AI research in
chemistry. However, existing chemical reaction data often exist as images
within papers, making them not machine-readable and unusable for training
machine learning models. In response to this challenge, we propose the
RxnCaption framework for the task of chemical Reaction Diagram Parsing (RxnDP).
Our framework reformulates the traditional coordinate prediction driven parsing
process into an image captioning problem, which Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) handle naturally. We introduce a strategy termed "BBox and Index as
Visual Prompt" (BIVP), which uses our state-of-the-art molecular detector,
MolYOLO, to pre-draw molecular bounding boxes and indices directly onto the
input image. This turns the downstream parsing into a natural-language
description problem. Extensive experiments show that the BIVP strategy
significantly improves structural extraction quality while simplifying model
design. We further construct the RxnCaption-11k dataset, an order of magnitude
larger than prior real-world literature benchmarks, with a balanced test subset
across four layout archetypes. Experiments demonstrate that RxnCaption-VL
achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple metrics. We believe our
method, dataset, and models will advance structured information extraction from
chemical literature and catalyze broader AI applications in chemistry. We will
release data, models, and code on GitHub.

*Leon Schwarzer,Matthias Zeller,Daniel Casado Herraez,Simon Dierl,Michael Heidingsfeld,Cyrill Stachniss*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Self-supervised moving object segmentation for radar point clouds using contrastive learning with cluster refinement to reduce annotation costs while improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radar sensors provide direct Doppler velocity measurements for single-scan moving object segmentation, but radar point clouds are sparse and noisy, making supervised learning annotation tedious and expensive.

Method: Two-step approach: contrastive self-supervised representation learning with novel clustering-based loss and dynamic points removal for cluster refinement, followed by supervised fine-tuning with limited annotated data.

Result: Method improves label efficiency after fine-tuning and effectively boosts state-of-the-art performance through self-supervised pretraining.

Conclusion: Self-supervised pretraining enables efficient moving object segmentation from sparse radar data with reduced annotation requirements while enhancing performance.

Abstract: Moving object segmentation is a crucial task for safe and reliable autonomous
mobile systems like self-driving cars, improving the reliability and robustness
of subsequent tasks like SLAM or path planning. While the segmentation of
camera or LiDAR data is widely researched and achieves great results, it often
introduces an increased latency by requiring the accumulation of temporal
sequences to gain the necessary temporal context. Radar sensors overcome this
problem with their ability to provide a direct measurement of a point's Doppler
velocity, which can be exploited for single-scan moving object segmentation.
However, radar point clouds are often sparse and noisy, making data annotation
for use in supervised learning very tedious, time-consuming, and
cost-intensive. To overcome this problem, we address the task of
self-supervised moving object segmentation of sparse and noisy radar point
clouds. We follow a two-step approach of contrastive self-supervised
representation learning with subsequent supervised fine-tuning using limited
amounts of annotated data. We propose a novel clustering-based contrastive loss
function with cluster refinement based on dynamic points removal to pretrain
the network to produce motion-aware representations of the radar data. Our
method improves label efficiency after fine-tuning, effectively boosting
state-of-the-art performance by self-supervised pretraining.

### [30] [A Novel Grouping-Based Hybrid Color Correction Algorithm for Color Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02397)
*Kuo-Liang Chung,Ting-Chung Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A grouping-based hybrid color correction algorithm for color point clouds that adaptively partitions points into proximity groups and applies different correction methods (KBI, JKHE, HE) based on overlapping rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Color consistency correction is fundamental for 3D rendering and compression, but most existing methods focus on color images rather than point clouds.

Method: Estimates overlapping rate between source and target point clouds, partitions target points into proximity groups (Gcl, Gmod, Gdist), and applies KBI for close proximity, JKHE for moderate proximity, and HE for distant proximity points.

Result: Tested on 1086 color point cloud pairs and demonstrated superior color consistency correction compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed grouping-based hybrid approach effectively handles color consistency correction for point clouds with adaptive strategies based on proximity relationships.

Abstract: Color consistency correction for color point clouds is a fundamental yet
important task in 3D rendering and compression applications. In the past, most
previous color correction methods aimed at correcting color for color images.
The purpose of this paper is to propose a grouping-based hybrid color
correction algorithm for color point clouds. Our algorithm begins by estimating
the overlapping rate between the aligned source and target point clouds, and
then adaptively partitions the target points into two groups, namely the close
proximity group Gcl and the moderate proximity group Gmod, or three groups,
namely Gcl, Gmod, and the distant proximity group Gdist, when the estimated
overlapping rate is low or high, respectively. To correct color for target
points in Gcl, a K-nearest neighbors based bilateral interpolation (KBI) method
is proposed. To correct color for target points in Gmod, a joint KBI and the
histogram equalization (JKHE) method is proposed. For target points in Gdist, a
histogram equalization (HE) method is proposed for color correction. Finally,
we discuss the grouping-effect free property and the ablation study in our
algorithm. The desired color consistency correction benefit of our algorithm
has been justified through 1086 testing color point cloud pairs against the
state-of-the-art methods. The C++ source code of our algorithm can be accessed
from the website: https://github.com/ivpml84079/Point-cloud-color-correction.

### [31] [Purrturbed but Stable: Human-Cat Invariant Representations Across CNNs, ViTs and Self-Supervised ViTs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02404)
*Arya Shah,Vaibhav Tripathi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Self-supervised Vision Transformers (DINO) show the highest alignment between feline and human visual representations, outperforming supervised models and CNNs in cross-species visual system similarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how feline visual system specializations (like vertically elongated pupils for ambush predation) manifest in computational visual representations and identify models that best bridge species-specific visual statistics.

Method: Used a frozen-encoder benchmark with layer-wise Centered Kernel Alignment (linear and RBF) and Representational Similarity Analysis across multiple architectures (CNNs, supervised ViTs, windowed transformers, self-supervised ViTs) to quantify feline-human representational alignment.

Result: DINO ViT-B/16 achieved highest alignment (mean CKA-RBF ≈0.814, mean CKA-linear ≈0.745, mean RSA ≈0.698), peaking at early blocks. Supervised ViTs showed weaker geometric correspondence than DINO, and windowed transformers underperformed plain ViTs.

Conclusion: Self-supervision combined with ViT inductive biases produces representational geometries that better align feline and human visual systems than CNNs and windowed Transformers, offering neuroscientific insights into cross-species visual computation convergence.

Abstract: Cats and humans differ in ocular anatomy. Most notably, Felis Catus (domestic
cats) have vertically elongated pupils linked to ambush predation; yet, how
such specializations manifest in downstream visual representations remains
incompletely understood. We present a unified, frozen-encoder benchmark that
quantifies feline-human cross-species representational alignment in the wild,
across convolutional networks, supervised Vision Transformers, windowed
transformers, and self-supervised ViTs (DINO), using layer-wise Centered Kernel
Alignment (linear and RBF) and Representational Similarity Analysis, with
additional distributional and stability tests reported in the paper. Across
models, DINO ViT-B/16 attains the most substantial alignment (mean CKA-RBF
$\approx0.814$, mean CKA-linear $\approx0.745$, mean RSA $\approx0.698$),
peaking at early blocks, indicating that token-level self-supervision induces
early-stage features that bridge species-specific statistics. Supervised ViTs
are competitive on CKA yet show weaker geometric correspondence than DINO
(e.g., ViT-B/16 RSA $\approx0.53$ at block8; ViT-L/16 $\approx0.47$ at
block14), revealing depth-dependent divergences between similarity and
representational geometry. CNNs remain strong baselines but below plain ViTs on
alignment, and windowed transformers underperform plain ViTs, implicating
architectural inductive biases in cross-species alignment. Results indicate
that self-supervision coupled with ViT inductive biases yields representational
geometries that more closely align feline and human visual systems than widely
used CNNs and windowed Transformers, providing testable neuroscientific
hypotheses about where and how cross-species visual computations converge. We
release our code and dataset for reference and reproducibility.

*Wenyang Wei,Yang yang,Xixi Jia,Xiangchu Feng,Weiwei Wang,Renzhen Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IllumFlow is a novel framework combining conditional Rectified Flow with Retinex theory for low-light image enhancement, separating illumination and reflectance optimization to handle lighting variations and noise effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of low-light image enhancement, including wide dynamic range of illumination variations and complex noise in reflectance components, while preserving color fidelity and enabling customizable brightness enhancement.

Method: Decomposes input images into reflectance and illumination components using Retinex theory, uses conditional rectified flow for illumination modeling, and employs a denoising network with flow-derived data augmentation for reflectance noise removal.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate superior quantitative and qualitative performance over existing methods in low-light enhancement and exposure correction tasks.

Conclusion: IllumFlow effectively handles both lighting variations and noise through separate optimization of illumination and reflectance components, enabling precise illumination adaptation and customizable brightness enhancement.

Abstract: We present IllumFlow, a novel framework that synergizes conditional Rectified
Flow (CRF) with Retinex theory for low-light image enhancement (LLIE). Our
model addresses low-light enhancement through separate optimization of
illumination and reflectance components, effectively handling both lighting
variations and noise. Specifically, we first decompose an input image into
reflectance and illumination components following Retinex theory. To model the
wide dynamic range of illumination variations in low-light images, we propose a
conditional rectified flow framework that represents illumination changes as a
continuous flow field. While complex noise primarily resides in the reflectance
component, we introduce a denoising network, enhanced by flow-derived data
augmentation, to remove reflectance noise and chromatic aberration while
preserving color fidelity. IllumFlow enables precise illumination adaptation
across lighting conditions while naturally supporting customizable brightness
enhancement. Extensive experiments on low-light enhancement and exposure
correction demonstrate superior quantitative and qualitative performance over
existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs have limited coverage of complex chart scenarios and computation-intensive reasoning tasks in real-world applications.

Method: Multi-stage code-driven pipeline using RAG for chart templates and CoT strategies for reasoning codes, enabling chart rendering and statistical computations.

Result: Created ChartM^3 dataset with 38K charts, 142K Q&A pairs, and 2,871 evaluation samples; SFT and RL experiments show improved reasoning and cross-domain generalization.

Conclusion: The dataset enables smaller models to achieve performance comparable to larger models in complex chart comprehension through enhanced reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Complex chart understanding tasks demand advanced visual recognition and
reasoning capabilities from multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However,
current research provides limited coverage of complex chart scenarios and
computation-intensive reasoning tasks prevalent in real-world applications.
This study proposes an automated multi-stage code-driven pipeline for
systematically generating visual reasoning datasets to address these
limitations. The pipeline integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to
retrieve professional chart templates and employs chain-of-thought (CoT)
strategies to generate reasoning codes that simulate real data distributions,
thereby driving chart rendering and question-related statistical computations.
Through model-based evaluation, the pipeline enhances chart diversity and data
quality. Using this framework, we construct ChartM$^3$, a multi-dimensional and
multi-step dataset containing 38K charts and 142K Q&A pairs for training, along
with 2,871 high-quality evaluation samples for enabling practical performance
assessment. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL)
experiments demonstrate that our dataset significantly improves reasoning
capabilities and cross-domain generalization performance, enabling smaller
models to achieve performance comparable to larger-scale models in complex
chart comprehension.

TL;DR: A pipeline for generating synthetic crop-weed images using Blender reduces annotation costs for agricultural robots, achieving 10% sim-to-real gap and outperforming real data in cross-domain scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training deep learning models for crop-weed segmentation requires large annotated datasets, which are costly to obtain in real agricultural fields. Synthetic data can reduce this burden but faces challenges with the simulation-to-reality gap.

Method: Developed a procedural generation pipeline using Blender to create synthetic crop-weed images with diverse conditions (plant growth, weed density, lighting, camera angles), then benchmarked state-of-the-art segmentation models on both synthetic and real datasets.

Result: Training on synthetic images achieved a 10% sim-to-real gap, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods. Synthetic data demonstrated better generalization than real datasets in cross-domain scenarios.

Conclusion: Synthetic agricultural datasets show significant potential and support hybrid training strategies for more efficient model development in agricultural robotics.

Abstract: Precise semantic segmentation of crops and weeds is necessary for
agricultural weeding robots. However, training deep learning models requires
large annotated datasets, which are costly to obtain in real fields. Synthetic
data can reduce this burden, but the gap between simulated and real images
remains a challenge. In this paper, we present a pipeline for procedural
generation of synthetic crop-weed images using Blender, producing annotated
datasets under diverse conditions of plant growth, weed density, lighting, and
camera angle. We benchmark several state-of-the-art segmentation models on
synthetic and real datasets and analyze their cross-domain generalization. Our
results show that training on synthetic images leads to a sim-to-real gap of
10%, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, synthetic data
demonstrates good generalization properties, outperforming real datasets in
cross-domain scenarios. These findings highlight the potential of synthetic
agricultural datasets and support hybrid strategies for more efficient model
training.

Result: Experimental evaluation reveals challenges, weaknesses, inherent model biases, and discusses the potential of small models for edge device applications.

Conclusion: Small VLMs show promise for scene interpretation on edge devices in mobile robotics, though trade-offs between accuracy and inference time remain challenging.

Abstract: Video Understanding, Scene Interpretation and Commonsense Reasoning are
highly challenging tasks enabling the interpretation of visual information,
allowing agents to perceive, interact with and make rational decisions in its
environment. Large Language Models (LLMs) and Visual Language Models (VLMs)
have shown remarkable advancements in these areas in recent years, enabling
domain-specific applications as well as zero-shot open vocabulary tasks,
combining multiple domains. However, the required computational complexity

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of satellite image inpainting for very high-resolution datasets, overcoming limitations of existing preconditioned models (requiring extensive retraining) and postconditioned models (with high computational overhead).

Method: Proposes Kernel-Adaptive Optimization with diffusion models, featuring Latent Space Conditioning for efficient optimization and Explicit Propagation for forward-backward fusion to improve stability and precision.

Result: KAO sets a new benchmark for VHR satellite image restoration, providing scalable high-performance solution that balances efficiency of preconditioned models with flexibility of postconditioned models.

Conclusion: KAO offers an effective framework for satellite image inpainting that addresses key challenges in VHR datasets through innovative latent space optimization and diffusion process enhancements.

Abstract: Satellite image inpainting is a crucial task in remote sensing, where
accurately restoring missing or occluded regions is essential for robust image
analysis. In this paper, we propose KAO, a novel framework that utilizes
Kernel-Adaptive Optimization within diffusion models for satellite image
inpainting. KAO is specifically designed to address the challenges posed by
very high-resolution (VHR) satellite datasets, such as DeepGlobe and the
Massachusetts Roads Dataset. Unlike existing methods that rely on
preconditioned models requiring extensive retraining or postconditioned models
with significant computational overhead, KAO introduces a Latent Space
Conditioning approach, optimizing a compact latent space to achieve efficient
and accurate inpainting. Furthermore, we incorporate Explicit Propagation into
the diffusion process, facilitating forward-backward fusion, which improves the
stability and precision of the method. Experimental results demonstrate that
KAO sets a new benchmark for VHR satellite image restoration, providing a
scalable, high-performance solution that balances the efficiency of
preconditioned models with the flexibility of postconditioned models.

*Taiga Yamane,Satoshi Suzuki,Ryo Masumura,Shotaro Tora*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MVAFormer is a multi-view action recognition method for spatio-temporal action recognition (STAR) that uses a transformer-based cooperation module to effectively combine feature maps from multiple camera views while preserving spatial information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous multi-view action recognition methods only work for single action recognition from entire videos and cannot handle the STAR setting where each person's action is recognized sequentially. Existing methods lose spatial information by using embedding vectors instead of feature maps.

Method: Proposes MVAFormer with a novel transformer-based cooperation module that uses feature maps (not embedding vectors) to preserve spatial information. The module divides self-attention into same-view and different-view attention to effectively model relationships between multiple views.

Result: MVAFormer outperforms comparison baselines by approximately 4.4 points on F-measure in experiments using a newly collected dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed MVAFormer successfully addresses multi-view action recognition in the STAR setting by preserving spatial information through feature map cooperation and effective view relationship modeling.

Abstract: Multi-view action recognition aims to recognize human actions using multiple
camera views and deals with occlusion caused by obstacles or crowds. In this
task, cooperation among views, which generates a joint representation by
combining multiple views, is vital. Previous studies have explored promising
cooperation methods for improving performance. However, since their methods
focus only on the task setting of recognizing a single action from an entire
video, they are not applicable to the recently popular spatio-temporal action
recognition~(STAR) setting, in which each person's action is recognized
sequentially. To address this problem, this paper proposes a multi-view action
recognition method for the STAR setting, called MVAFormer. In MVAFormer, we
introduce a novel transformer-based cooperation module among views. In contrast
to previous studies, which utilize embedding vectors with lost spatial
information, our module utilizes the feature map for effective cooperation in
the STAR setting, which preserves the spatial information. Furthermore, in our
module, we divide the self-attention for the same and different views to model
the relationship between multiple views effectively. The results of experiments
using a newly collected dataset demonstrate that MVAFormer outperforms the
comparison baselines by approximately $4.4$ points on the F-measure.

Motivation: To address the limitation of existing methods that rely heavily on synthetic datasets and small-scale real-world data, which restricts realism and generalization in object-centric inverse rendering and relighting.

Method: Captured 765 real-world objects using 35 DSLR cameras and 331 individually controlled light sources, providing well-calibrated camera parameters, object masks, photometric surface normals, and diffuse albedo.

Result: Created a comprehensive real-world object-centric benchmark with extensive evaluation set for inverse rendering and normal estimation, offering high-fidelity appearance under diverse illumination conditions.

Conclusion: OLATverse represents a pivotal step toward integrating next-generation inverse rendering and relighting methods with real-world data, bridging the gap between synthetic training and real-world application.

Abstract: We introduce OLATverse, a large-scale dataset comprising around 9M images of
765 real-world objects, captured from multiple viewpoints under a diverse set
of precisely controlled lighting conditions. While recent advances in
object-centric inverse rendering, novel view synthesis and relighting have
shown promising results, most techniques still heavily rely on the synthetic
datasets for training and small-scale real-world datasets for benchmarking,
which limits their realism and generalization. To address this gap, OLATverse
offers two key advantages over existing datasets: large-scale coverage of real
objects and high-fidelity appearance under precisely controlled illuminations.
Specifically, OLATverse contains 765 common and uncommon real-world objects,
spanning a wide range of material categories. Each object is captured using 35
DSLR cameras and 331 individually controlled light sources, enabling the
simulation of diverse illumination conditions. In addition, for each object, we
provide well-calibrated camera parameters, accurate object masks, photometric
surface normals, and diffuse albedo as auxiliary resources. We also construct
an extensive evaluation set, establishing the first comprehensive real-world
object-centric benchmark for inverse rendering and normal estimation. We
believe that OLATverse represents a pivotal step toward integrating the next
generation of inverse rendering and relighting methods with real-world data.

TL;DR: A cross-view UAV localization framework using object detection and graph neural networks for accurate map matching in GNSS-denied environments, addressing heterogeneous aerial image matching challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve UAV localization problems in GNSS-denied areas where satellite-based methods fail, particularly addressing cross-temporal, cross-view, and heterogeneous aerial image matching challenges.

Method: Leverages modern object detection to extract salient instances from UAV and satellite images, integrates graph neural network to reason about inter-image and intra-image node relationships, and uses fine-grained graph-based node-similarity metric for retrieval and localization.

Result: Achieves strong retrieval and localization performance on public and real-world datasets, effectively handles heterogeneous appearance differences, and generalizes well to scenarios with larger modality gaps like infrared-visible image matching.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides an effective solution for cross-view UAV localization in challenging environments, with demonstrated robustness and generalization capabilities across different modalities.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of the low-altitude economy, UAVs have become crucial
for measurement and tracking in patrol systems. However, in GNSS-denied areas,
satellite-based localization methods are prone to failure. This paper presents
a cross-view UAV localization framework that performs map matching via object
detection, aimed at effectively addressing cross-temporal, cross-view,
heterogeneous aerial image matching. In typical pipelines, UAV visual
localization is formulated as an image-retrieval problem: features are
extracted to build a localization map, and the pose of a query image is
estimated by matching it to a reference database with known poses. Because
publicly available UAV localization datasets are limited, many approaches
recast localization as a classification task and rely on scene labels in these
datasets to ensure accuracy. Other methods seek to reduce cross-domain
differences using polar-coordinate reprojection, perspective transformations,
or generative adversarial networks; however, they can suffer from misalignment,
content loss, and limited realism. In contrast, we leverage modern object
detection to accurately extract salient instances from UAV and satellite
images, and integrate a graph neural network to reason about inter-image and
intra-image node relationships. Using a fine-grained, graph-based
node-similarity metric, our method achieves strong retrieval and localization
performance. Extensive experiments on public and real-world datasets show that
our approach handles heterogeneous appearance differences effectively and
generalizes well, making it applicable to scenarios with larger modality gaps,
such as infrared-visible image matching. Our dataset will be publicly available

Motivation: To determine optimal domain adaptation strategies for foundation models (LLMs/VLMs) in specialized scientific microscopy workflows, as general-purpose models need effective specialization for scientific tasks.

Method: Created PtychoBench multi-modal benchmark to systematically compare Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and In-Context Learning (ICL) strategies on visual artifact detection (VLMs) and textual parameter recommendation (LLMs) tasks in data-scarce conditions.

Result: For visual tasks: SFT+ICL achieved best performance (Micro-F1 0.728). For textual tasks: ICL on large base model was superior (Micro-F1 0.847), outperforming SFT models. Context-aware prompting was consistently effective.

Conclusion: Optimal specialization strategy depends on task modality, providing a framework for developing effective science-based AI agentic systems.

Abstract: The automation of workflows in advanced microscopy is a key goal where
foundation models like Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
show great potential. However, adapting these general-purpose models for
specialized scientific tasks is critical, and the optimal domain adaptation
strategy is often unclear. To address this, we introduce PtychoBench, a new
multi-modal, multi-task benchmark for ptychographic analysis. Using this
benchmark, we systematically compare two specialization strategies: Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) and In-Context Learning (ICL). We evaluate these strategies
on a visual artifact detection task with VLMs and a textual parameter
recommendation task with LLMs in a data-scarce regime. Our findings reveal that
the optimal specialization pathway is task-dependent. For the visual task, SFT
and ICL are highly complementary, with a fine-tuned model guided by
context-aware examples achieving the highest mean performance (Micro-F1 of
0.728). Conversely, for the textual task, ICL on a large base model is the
superior strategy, reaching a peak Micro-F1 of 0.847 and outperforming a
powerful "super-expert" SFT model (0-shot Micro-F1 of 0.839). We also confirm
the superiority of context-aware prompting and identify a consistent contextual
interference phenomenon in fine-tuned models. These results, benchmarked
against strong baselines including GPT-4o and a DINOv3-based classifier, offer
key observations for AI in science: the optimal specialization path in our
benchmark is dependent on the task modality, offering a clear framework for
developing more effective science-based agentic systems.

### [42] [ESA: Energy-Based Shot Assembly Optimization for Automatic Video Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02505)
*Yaosen Chen,Wei Wang,Xuming Wen,Han Yang,Yanru Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An energy-based optimization method for video shot assembly that learns from reference videos to automate shot sequencing while preserving artistic expression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current intelligent video editing technologies fail to capture creators' unique artistic expression in shot assembly, requiring manual work by experienced editors.

Method: Visual-semantic matching between LLM-generated scripts and video library, shot segmentation and attribute extraction, energy-based models for style learning, and optimization combining multiple syntax rules.

Result: Automated shot arrangement that aligns with reference video styles, enabling users without editing experience to create visually compelling videos.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully automates shot assembly while learning and preserving artistic styles from reference videos, democratizing video editing capabilities.

Abstract: Shot assembly is a crucial step in film production and video editing,
involving the sequencing and arrangement of shots to construct a narrative,
convey information, or evoke emotions. Traditionally, this process has been
manually executed by experienced editors. While current intelligent video
editing technologies can handle some automated video editing tasks, they often
fail to capture the creator's unique artistic expression in shot assembly.To
address this challenge, we propose an energy-based optimization method for
video shot assembly. Specifically, we first perform visual-semantic matching
between the script generated by a large language model and a video library to
obtain subsets of candidate shots aligned with the script semantics. Next, we
segment and label the shots from reference videos, extracting attributes such
as shot size, camera motion, and semantics. We then employ energy-based models
to learn from these attributes, scoring candidate shot sequences based on their
alignment with reference styles. Finally, we achieve shot assembly optimization
by combining multiple syntax rules, producing videos that align with the
assembly style of the reference videos. Our method not only automates the
arrangement and combination of independent shots according to specific logic,
narrative requirements, or artistic styles but also learns the assembly style
of reference videos, creating a coherent visual sequence or holistic visual
expression. With our system, even users with no prior video editing experience
can create visually compelling videos. Project page:

TL;DR: Proposes a privacy-preserving automated report generation pipeline for mobile robotics using local multi-modal sensors and edge computing, eliminating need for external services.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need to evaluate large amounts of heterogeneous data from AI-enabled mechatronic systems in critical applications like autonomous driving and service robotics, requiring automated reporting to facilitate system evaluation and acceptance.

Method: Developed a pipeline that uses various multi-modal sensors to generate natural language reports, relying solely on local models deployable on edge computing devices to preserve privacy and avoid external services.

Result: Evaluated implementation on diverse dataset spanning indoor, outdoor and urban environments, providing both quantitative and qualitative evaluation results with example reports available in public repository.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline enables automated report generation for mobile robotics while maintaining privacy through local processing, supporting evaluation of AI-enabled systems in critical applications across various domains.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Deep Learning enable hardware-based cognitive systems,
that is, mechatronic systems in general and robotics in particular with
integrated Artificial Intelligence, to interact with dynamic and unstructured
environments. While the results are impressive, the application of such systems
to critical tasks like autonomous driving as well as service and care robotics
necessitate the evaluation of large amount of heterogeneous data. Automated
report generation for Mobile Robotics can play a crucial role in facilitating
the evaluation and acceptance of such systems in various domains. In this
paper, we propose a pipeline for generating automated reports in natural
language utilizing various multi-modal sensors that solely relies on local
models capable of being deployed on edge computing devices, thus preserving the
privacy of all actors involved and eliminating the need for external services.
In particular, we evaluate our implementation on a diverse dataset spanning
multiple domains including indoor, outdoor and urban environments, providing
quantitative as well as qualitative evaluation results. Various generated
example reports and other supplementary materials are available via a public

### [44] [LiteVoxel: Low-memory Intelligent Thresholding for Efficient Voxel Rasterization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02510)
*Jee Won Lee,Jongseong Brad Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LiteVoxel is a self-tuning training pipeline for sparse-voxel rasterization that improves low-frequency content reconstruction, stabilizes training, and reduces VRAM usage by 40-60% while maintaining comparable quality metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse-voxel rasterization tends to underfit low-frequency content, depends on brittle pruning heuristics, and can overgrow in ways that inflate VRAM usage, making training unpredictable and memory-intensive.

Method: Uses inverse-Sobel reweighting with mid-training gamma-ramp for low-frequency awareness, depth-quantile pruning on maximum blending weight stabilized by EMA-hysteresis guards, and ray-footprint-based priority-driven subdivision under explicit growth budget.

Result: Mitigates errors in low-frequency regions and boundary instability while maintaining comparable PSNR/SSIM, training time, and FPS. Reduces peak VRAM by 40-60% and preserves low-frequency detail that prior methods miss.

Conclusion: LiteVoxel enables more predictable, memory-efficient training without sacrificing perceptual quality, making sparse-voxel rasterization both steadier and lighter.

Abstract: Sparse-voxel rasterization is a fast, differentiable alternative for
optimization-based scene reconstruction, but it tends to underfit low-frequency
content, depends on brittle pruning heuristics, and can overgrow in ways that
inflate VRAM. We introduce LiteVoxel, a self-tuning training pipeline that
makes SV rasterization both steadier and lighter. Our loss is made
low-frequency aware via an inverse-Sobel reweighting with a mid-training
gamma-ramp, shifting gradient budget to flat regions only after geometry
stabilize. Adaptation replaces fixed thresholds with a depth-quantile pruning
logic on maximum blending weight, stabilized by EMA-hysteresis guards and
refines structure through ray-footprint-based, priority-driven subdivision
under an explicit growth budget. Ablations and full-system results across
Mip-NeRF 360 (6scenes) and Tanks & Temples (3scenes) datasets show mitigation
of errors in low-frequency regions and boundary instability while keeping
PSNR/SSIM, training time, and FPS comparable to a strong SVRaster pipeline.
Crucially, LiteVoxel reduces peak VRAM by ~40%-60% and preserves low-frequency
detail that prior setups miss, enabling more predictable, memory-efficient
training without sacrificing perceptual quality.

*Jessica Plassmann,Nicolas Schuler,Georg von Freymann,Michael Schuth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study explores unsupervised learning methods for automated anomaly detection in shearographic images, evaluating three architectures trained on defect-free data to reduce reliance on expert interpretation and labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shearography's industrial adoption is limited by the need for expert interpretation. The research aims to reduce reliance on labeled data and manual evaluation through unsupervised learning for automated anomaly detection.

Method: Three unsupervised architectures were evaluated: fully connected autoencoder, convolutional autoencoder, and student-teacher feature matching model. Models were trained on defect-free data using a controlled dataset with reproducible defect patterns under both ideal and realistic deformation conditions.

Result: The student-teacher approach achieved superior classification robustness and enabled precise localization, showing improved separability of feature representations compared to autoencoder-based models. It was benchmarked against a YOLOv8 model trained on labeled data.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of unsupervised deep learning for scalable, label-efficient shearographic inspection in industrial environments, with the student-teacher model showing particular promise.

Abstract: Shearography is a non-destructive testing method for detecting subsurface
defects, offering high sensitivity and full-field inspection capabilities.
However, its industrial adoption remains limited due to the need for expert
interpretation. To reduce reliance on labeled data and manual evaluation, this
study explores unsupervised learning methods for automated anomaly detection in
shearographic images. Three architectures are evaluated: a fully connected
autoencoder, a convolutional autoencoder, and a student-teacher feature
matching model. All models are trained solely on defect-free data. A controlled
dataset was developed using a custom specimen with reproducible defect
patterns, enabling systematic acquisition of shearographic measurements under
both ideal and realistic deformation conditions. Two training subsets were
defined: one containing only undistorted, defect-free samples, and one
additionally including globally deformed, yet defect-free, data. The latter
simulates practical inspection conditions by incorporating deformation-induced
fringe patterns that may obscure localized anomalies. The models are evaluated
in terms of binary classification and, for the student-teacher model, spatial
defect localization. Results show that the student-teacher approach achieves
superior classification robustness and enables precise localization. Compared
to the autoencoder-based models, it demonstrates improved separability of
feature representations, as visualized through t-SNE embeddings. Additionally,
a YOLOv8 model trained on labeled defect data serves as a reference to
benchmark localization quality. This study underscores the potential of
unsupervised deep learning for scalable, label-efficient shearographic
inspection in industrial environments.

TL;DR: Deep learning models can predict future brain MRI scans from baseline images with high fidelity, enabling personalized prognosis for neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To predict future brain states from baseline MRI scans, which is crucial for studying neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease, by forecasting entire brain MRI images rather than just cognitive scores or clinical outcomes.

Method: Implemented and evaluated five deep learning architectures (UNet, U2-Net, UNETR, Time-Embedding UNet, and ODE-UNet) on two longitudinal cohorts (ADNI and AIBL) for MRI image-to-image prediction several years into the future.

Result: Best performing models achieved high-fidelity predictions, with all models generalizing well to an independent external dataset, demonstrating robust cross-cohort performance.

Conclusion: Deep learning can reliably predict participant-specific brain MRI at the voxel level, offering new opportunities for individualized prognosis in neurodegenerative diseases.

Abstract: Predicting future brain state from a baseline magnetic resonance image (MRI)
is a central challenge in neuroimaging and has important implications for
studying neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Most
existing approaches predict future cognitive scores or clinical outcomes, such
as conversion from mild cognitive impairment to dementia. Instead, here we
investigate longitudinal MRI image-to-image prediction that forecasts a
participant's entire brain MRI several years into the future, intrinsically
modeling complex, spatially distributed neurodegenerative patterns. We
implement and evaluate five deep learning architectures (UNet, U2-Net, UNETR,
Time-Embedding UNet, and ODE-UNet) on two longitudinal cohorts (ADNI and AIBL).
Predicted follow-up MRIs are directly compared with the actual follow-up scans
using metrics that capture global similarity and local differences. The best
performing models achieve high-fidelity predictions, and all models generalize
well to an independent external dataset, demonstrating robust cross-cohort
performance. Our results indicate that deep learning can reliably predict
participant-specific brain MRI at the voxel level, offering new opportunities
for individualized prognosis.

TL;DR: UVH-26 is the first large-scale Indian traffic dataset with 26,646 images and 1.8M bounding boxes across 14 vehicle classes, showing 8.4-31.5% improvement over COCO-trained models for Indian traffic scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the critical gap in existing global benchmarks for Indian traffic conditions by creating domain-specific training data that captures the heterogeneity of Indian urban mobility from operational traffic-camera streams.

Method: Collected 26,646 high-resolution images from 2800 Bengaluru CCTV cameras over 4 weeks, annotated through crowdsourced hackathon with 565 students, and derived consensus ground truth using Majority Voting and STAPLE algorithms. Trained multiple detectors including YOLO11, RT-DETR, and DAMO-YOLO.

Result: Models trained on UVH-26 achieved 8.4-31.5% improvements in mAP50:95 over COCO-trained baselines, with RT-DETR-X performing best at 0.67 mAP50:95 compared to 0.40 for COCO-trained models on common classes.

Conclusion: UVH-26 demonstrates significant benefits of domain-specific training data for Indian traffic scenarios and provides a foundation for advancing intelligent transportation systems in emerging nations with complex traffic conditions.

Abstract: This report describes the UVH-26 dataset, the first public release by
AIM@IISc of a large-scale dataset of annotated traffic-camera images from
India. The dataset comprises 26,646 high-resolution (1080p) images sampled from
2800 Bengaluru's Safe-City CCTV cameras over a 4-week period, and subsequently
annotated through a crowdsourced hackathon involving 565 college students from
across India. In total, 1.8 million bounding boxes were labeled across 14
vehicle classes specific to India: Cycle, 2-Wheeler (Motorcycle), 3-Wheeler
(Auto-rickshaw), LCV (Light Commercial Vehicles), Van, Tempo-traveller,
Hatchback, Sedan, SUV, MUV, Mini-bus, Bus, Truck and Other. Of these, 283k-316k
consensus ground truth bounding boxes and labels were derived for distinct
objects in the 26k images using Majority Voting and STAPLE algorithms. Further,
we train multiple contemporary detectors, including YOLO11-S/X, RT-DETR-S/X,
and DAMO-YOLO-T/L using these datasets, and report accuracy based on mAP50,
mAP75 and mAP50:95. Models trained on UVH-26 achieve 8.4-31.5% improvements in
mAP50:95 over equivalent baseline models trained on COCO dataset, with
RT-DETR-X showing the best performance at 0.67 (mAP50:95) as compared to 0.40
for COCO-trained weights for common classes (Car, Bus, and Truck). This
demonstrates the benefits of domain-specific training data for Indian traffic
scenarios. The release package provides the 26k images with consensus
annotations based on Majority Voting (UVH-26-MV) and STAPLE (UVH-26-ST) and the
6 fine-tuned YOLO and DETR models on each of these datasets. By capturing the
heterogeneity of Indian urban mobility directly from operational traffic-camera
streams, UVH-26 addresses a critical gap in existing global benchmarks, and
offers a foundation for advancing detection, classification, and deployment of
intelligent transportation systems in emerging nations with complex traffic
conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MTF-CVReID is a parameter-efficient framework for cross-view video person ReID that introduces 7 complementary modules over ViT-B/16 backbone to address extreme viewpoint shifts, scale disparities, and temporal inconsistencies, achieving SOTA performance with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in cross-view video person ReID including extreme viewpoint shifts, scale disparities, and temporal inconsistencies in aerial-ground surveillance scenarios.

Method: Proposes 7 modules: Cross-Stream Feature Normalization, Multi-Resolution Feature Harmonization, Identity-Aware Memory Module, Temporal Dynamics Modeling, Inter-View Feature Alignment, Hierarchical Temporal Pattern Learning, and Multi-View Identity Consistency Learning over ViT-B/16 backbone.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on AG-VPReID benchmark across all altitude levels, with strong cross-dataset generalization to G2A-VReID and MARS datasets. Adds only 2M parameters and 0.7 GFLOPs while maintaining 189 FPS real-time efficiency.

Conclusion: Carefully designed adapter-based modules can substantially enhance cross-view robustness and temporal consistency without compromising computational efficiency.

Abstract: Video-based person re-identification (ReID) in cross-view domains (for
example, aerial-ground surveillance) remains an open problem because of extreme
viewpoint shifts, scale disparities, and temporal inconsistencies. To address
these challenges, we propose MTF-CVReID, a parameter-efficient framework that
introduces seven complementary modules over a ViT-B/16 backbone. Specifically,
we include: (1) Cross-Stream Feature Normalization (CSFN) to correct camera and
view biases; (2) Multi-Resolution Feature Harmonization (MRFH) for scale
stabilization across altitudes; (3) Identity-Aware Memory Module (IAMM) to
reinforce persistent identity traits; (4) Temporal Dynamics Modeling (TDM) for
motion-aware short-term temporal encoding; (5) Inter-View Feature Alignment
(IVFA) for perspective-invariant representation alignment; (6) Hierarchical
Temporal Pattern Learning (HTPL) to capture multi-scale temporal regularities;
and (7) Multi-View Identity Consistency Learning (MVICL) that enforces
cross-view identity coherence using a contrastive learning paradigm. Despite
adding only about 2 million parameters and 0.7 GFLOPs over the baseline,
MTF-CVReID maintains real-time efficiency (189 FPS) and achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the AG-VPReID benchmark across all altitude
levels, with strong cross-dataset generalization to G2A-VReID and MARS
datasets. These results show that carefully designed adapter-based modules can
substantially enhance cross-view robustness and temporal consistency without
compromising computational efficiency. The source code is available at

*Jingyu Lu,Haonan Wang,Qixiang Zhang,Xiaomeng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VCFlow is a subject-agnostic brain decoding framework that reconstructs visual experiences from fMRI by modeling the visual cortex hierarchy, achieving fast reconstruction without subject-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable clinical applications by overcoming challenges in cross-subject generalization and complex brain signal processing for visual reconstruction from fMRI.

Method: Hierarchical framework modeling ventral-dorsal visual system architecture with feature-level contrastive learning to extract subject-invariant semantic representations.

Result: Achieves only 7% accuracy loss compared to conventional methods while generating reconstructed videos in 10 seconds without retraining, using significantly less data.

Conclusion: VCFlow provides a fast, clinically scalable solution for subject-agnostic brain decoding that bridges the gap between research and practical applications.

Abstract: Subject-agnostic brain decoding, which aims to reconstruct continuous visual
experiences from fMRI without subject-specific training, holds great potential
for clinical applications. However, this direction remains underexplored due to
challenges in cross-subject generalization and the complex nature of brain
signals. In this work, we propose Visual Cortex Flow Architecture (VCFlow), a
novel hierarchical decoding framework that explicitly models the ventral-dorsal
architecture of the human visual system to learn multi-dimensional
representations. By disentangling and leveraging features from early visual
cortex, ventral, and dorsal streams, VCFlow captures diverse and complementary
cognitive information essential for visual reconstruction. Furthermore, we
introduce a feature-level contrastive learning strategy to enhance the
extraction of subject-invariant semantic representations, thereby enhancing
subject-agnostic applicability to previously unseen subjects. Unlike
conventional pipelines that need more than 12 hours of per-subject data and
heavy computation, VCFlow sacrifices only 7\% accuracy on average yet generates
each reconstructed video in 10 seconds without any retraining, offering a fast
and clinically scalable solution. The source code will be released upon
acceptance of the paper.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TAUE is a training-free diffusion model framework that enables zero-shot, layer-wise image generation through noise transplantation and cultivation, achieving coherent multi-layered outputs without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image diffusion models only output flattened images, lacking layer-wise control needed for professional applications. Existing solutions require fine-tuning with large datasets or produce only isolated foreground elements without complete scenes.

Method: Noise Transplantation and Cultivation (NTC) extracts intermediate latent representations from foreground and composite generation processes and transplants them into initial noise for subsequent layers to ensure semantic and structural coherence.

Result: Extensive experiments show TAUE achieves performance comparable to fine-tuned methods, enhancing layer-wise consistency while maintaining high image quality and fidelity without training or auxiliary datasets.

Conclusion: TAUE eliminates costly training requirements and enables novel downstream applications like complex compositional editing, making generative workflows more accessible and controllable.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of text-to-image diffusion models, their
output of a single, flattened image remains a critical bottleneck for
professional applications requiring layer-wise control. Existing solutions
either rely on fine-tuning with large, inaccessible datasets or are
training-free yet limited to generating isolated foreground elements, failing
to produce a complete and coherent scene. To address this, we introduce the
Training-free Noise Transplantation and Cultivation Diffusion Model (TAUE), a
novel framework for zero-shot, layer-wise image generation. Our core technique,
Noise Transplantation and Cultivation (NTC), extracts intermediate latent
representations from both foreground and composite generation processes,
transplanting them into the initial noise for subsequent layers. This ensures
semantic and structural coherence across foreground, background, and composite
layers, enabling consistent, multi-layered outputs without requiring
fine-tuning or auxiliary datasets. Extensive experiments show that our
training-free method achieves performance comparable to fine-tuned methods,
enhancing layer-wise consistency while maintaining high image quality and
fidelity. TAUE not only eliminates costly training and dataset requirements but
also unlocks novel downstream applications, such as complex compositional
editing, paving the way for more accessible and controllable generative
workflows.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multi-animal tracking requires extensive model fine-tuning and heuristic design for each scenario, which is time-consuming and impractical for diverse applications.

Method: Combines Grounding Dino object detector with Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) tracker and carefully designed heuristics for zero-shot tracking across different datasets.

Result: Strong and consistent performance demonstrated on ChimpAct, Bird Flock Tracking, AnimalTrack, and GMOT-40 datasets across diverse species and environments.

Conclusion: Vision foundation models enable effective zero-shot multi-animal tracking, eliminating the need for dataset-specific retraining or hyperparameter adaptation.

Abstract: Multi-animal tracking is crucial for understanding animal ecology and
behavior. However, it remains a challenging task due to variations in habitat,
motion patterns, and species appearance. Traditional approaches typically
require extensive model fine-tuning and heuristic design for each application
scenario. In this work, we explore the potential of recent vision foundation
models for zero-shot multi-animal tracking. By combining a Grounding Dino
object detector with the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) tracker and carefully
designed heuristics, we develop a tracking framework that can be applied to new
datasets without any retraining or hyperparameter adaptation. Evaluations on
ChimpAct, Bird Flock Tracking, AnimalTrack, and a subset of GMOT-40 demonstrate
strong and consistent performance across diverse species and environments. The

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniChange is the first MLLM-based unified change detection model that integrates both binary change detection (BCD) and semantic change detection (SCD) tasks using special tokens and text prompts, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current change detection models have limited knowledge acquisition from single-type annotated data and cannot leverage diverse BCD and SCD datasets simultaneously, leading to poor generalization and limited versatility.

Method: Leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with language priors, introduces three special tokens [T1], [T2], [CHANGE], and uses text prompts to guide change category identification without predefined classification heads.

Result: Achieved SOTA performance on four benchmarks: WHU-CD (90.41 IoU), S2Looking (53.04 IoU), LEVIR-CD+ (78.87 IoU), and SECOND (57.62 IoU), surpassing all previous methods.

Conclusion: UniChange successfully unifies BCD and SCD tasks, enables knowledge acquisition from multi-source datasets with conflicting class definitions, and demonstrates superior generalization capabilities through MLLM integration.

Abstract: Change detection (CD) is a fundamental task for monitoring and analyzing land
cover dynamics. While recent high performance models and high quality datasets
have significantly advanced the field, a critical limitation persists. Current
models typically acquire limited knowledge from single-type annotated data and
cannot concurrently leverage diverse binary change detection (BCD) and semantic
change detection (SCD) datasets. This constraint leads to poor generalization
and limited versatility. The recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) introduce new possibilities for a unified CD framework. We
leverage the language priors and unification capabilities of MLLMs to develop
UniChange, the first MLLM-based unified change detection model. UniChange
integrates generative language abilities with specialized CD functionalities.
Our model successfully unifies both BCD and SCD tasks through the introduction
of three special tokens: [T1], [T2], and [CHANGE]. Furthermore, UniChange
utilizes text prompts to guide the identification of change categories,
eliminating the reliance on predefined classification heads. This design allows
UniChange to effectively acquire knowledge from multi-source datasets, even
when their class definitions conflict. Experiments on four public benchmarks
(WHU-CD, S2Looking, LEVIR-CD+, and SECOND) demonstrate SOTA performance,
achieving IoU scores of 90.41, 53.04, 78.87, and 57.62, respectively,
surpassing all previous methods. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face recognition systems are vulnerable to presentation attacks where malicious actors use spoofing techniques to gain illegitimate access to secure systems, highlighting the need for robust liveness detection.

Method: Proposes a novel lightweight CNN framework specifically designed to identify various types of presentation attacks including print/display, video and wrap attacks, with a newly created 2D spoof attack dataset of 500+ videos from 60 subjects.

Result: The architecture provides seamless liveness detection with faster biometric authentication (1-2 seconds on CPU) and includes a demonstration video showing successful detection of various attack types.

Conclusion: The proposed lightweight CNN framework effectively addresses presentation attack vulnerabilities in face recognition systems, offering fast and reliable liveness detection for enhanced security in biometric authentication.

Abstract: Biometric technologies are widely adopted in security, legal, and financial
systems. Face recognition can authenticate a person based on the unique facial
features such as shape and texture. However, recent works have demonstrated the
vulnerability of Face Recognition Systems (FRS) towards presentation attacks.
Using spoofing (aka.,presentation attacks), a malicious actor can get
illegitimate access to secure systems. This paper proposes a novel light-weight
CNN framework to identify print/display, video and wrap attacks. The proposed
robust architecture provides seamless liveness detection ensuring faster
biometric authentication (1-2 seconds on CPU). Further, this also presents a
newly created 2D spoof attack dataset consisting of more than 500 videos
collected from 60 subjects. To validate the effectiveness of this architecture,

Motivation: Large multimodal models suffer from inference inefficiency due to excessive visual tokens, and existing token compression methods lack standardized evaluation protocols.

Method: Developed UniPruneBench with standardized protocols across six ability dimensions and ten datasets, evaluating ten compression algorithms on three LMM families with both accuracy and system-level metrics.

Result: Key findings: random pruning is strong baseline, no single method dominates across scenarios, OCR tasks are most vulnerable to pruning, and pruning ratio is the main performance factor.

Conclusion: UniPruneBench provides a reliable foundation for future research on efficient multimodal modeling and token compression methods.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) often suffer from severe inference
inefficiency due to the large number of visual tokens introduced by image
encoders. While recent token compression methods, such as pruning and merging,
have shown promise in reducing redundancy, their evaluation remains fragmented
and inconsistent. In this work, we present UniPruneBench, a unified and
extensible benchmark for visual token pruning in multimodal LLMs. UniPruneBench
provides standardized protocols across six ability dimensions and ten datasets,
covering ten representative compression algorithms and three families of LMMs
(LLaVA-v1.5, Intern-VL3, and Qwen2.5-VL). Beyond task accuracy, it incorporates
system-level metrics such as runtime and prefilling latency to provide a
holistic view. Our experiments uncover several key findings: (1) random pruning
is a surprisingly strong baseline, (2) no single method consistently
outperforms others across scenarios, (3) pruning sensitivity varies
significantly across tasks, with OCR being most vulnerable, and (4) pruning
ratio is the dominant factor governing performance degradation. We believe
UniPruneBench will serve as a reliable foundation for future research on
efficient multimodal modeling.

*Marius Aasan,Martine Hjelkrem-Tan,Nico Catalano,Changkyu Choi,Adín Ramírez Rivera*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An end-to-end differentiable tokenizer that adapts to image content with pixel-level granularity while maintaining compatibility with existing Vision Transformer architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers use fixed patch tokens that ignore spatial and semantic structure of images, limiting their ability to adapt to image content.

Method: Uses hierarchical model selection with information criteria to create an adaptive tokenizer that works at pixel-level granularity while remaining backward-compatible with pretrained models.

Result: Provides competitive performance in both image-level classification and dense-prediction tasks, and supports out-of-the-box raster-to-vector conversion.

Conclusion: The proposed differentiable tokenizer successfully addresses limitations of fixed patch tokens in Vision Transformers while maintaining architectural compatibility and enabling new capabilities like raster-to-vector conversion.

Abstract: Vision Transformers rely on fixed patch tokens that ignore the spatial and
semantic structure of images. In this work, we introduce an end-to-end
differentiable tokenizer that adapts to image content with pixel-level
granularity while remaining backward-compatible with existing architectures for
retrofitting pretrained models. Our method uses hierarchical model selection
with information criteria to provide competitive performance in both
image-level classification and dense-prediction tasks, and even supports
out-of-the-box raster-to-vector conversion.

*Chao Yuan,Zanwu Liu,Guiwei Zhang,Haoxuan Xu,Yujian Zhao,Guanglin Niu,Bo Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes MTRL framework for VI-ReID using modality-transition representations without extra parameters, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VI-ReID methods have modality gaps and rely on intermediate representations that don't effectively utilize intermediate features, requiring more parameters or lacking interpretability.

Method: Uses modality-transition representation learning with middle generated images as transmitters between visible and infrared modalities, trained with modality-transition contrastive loss and modality-query regularization loss.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on three typical VI-ReID datasets without additional parameters or inference speed reduction.

Conclusion: MTRL framework effectively aligns cross-modal features through modality-transition representations, achieving superior VI-ReID performance while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Visible-infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID) technique could associate
the pedestrian images across visible and infrared modalities in the practical
scenarios of background illumination changes. However, a substantial gap
inherently exists between these two modalities. Besides, existing methods
primarily rely on intermediate representations to align cross-modal features of
the same person. The intermediate feature representations are usually create by
generating intermediate images (kind of data enhancement), or fusing
intermediate features (more parameters, lack of interpretability), and they do
not make good use of the intermediate features. Thus, we propose a novel
VI-ReID framework via Modality-Transition Representation Learning (MTRL) with a
middle generated image as a transmitter from visible to infrared modals, which
are fully aligned with the original visible images and similar to the infrared
modality. After that, using a modality-transition contrastive loss and a
modality-query regularization loss for training, which could align the
cross-modal features more effectively. Notably, our proposed framework does not
need any additional parameters, which achieves the same inference speed to the
backbone while improving its performance on VI-ReID task. Extensive
experimental results illustrate that our model significantly and consistently
outperforms existing SOTAs on three typical VI-ReID datasets.

*Zhicheng Zhang,Weicheng Wang,Yongjie Zhu,Wenyu Qin,Pengfei Wan,Di Zhang,Jufeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a novel affective cues-guided reasoning framework for video emotion analysis using video emotion foundation models (VidEmo) with two-stage tuning and a large emotion-centric dataset (Emo-CFG).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emotions are dynamic and cues-dependent, making it challenging to understand complex emotional states with reasonable rationale in videos. Current methods struggle with these intrinsic properties of emotions.

Method: Affective cues-guided reasoning framework that unifies attribute perception, expression analysis, and emotional understanding. Uses VidEmo models with two-stage tuning: curriculum emotion learning followed by affective-tree reinforcement learning. Built on Emo-CFG dataset with 2.1M instruction-based samples.

Result: Achieves competitive performance and sets new milestones across 15 face perception tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses challenges in video emotion analysis through specialized foundation models and comprehensive data infrastructure.

Abstract: Understanding and predicting emotion from videos has gathered significant
attention in recent studies, driven by advancements in video large language
models (VideoLLMs). While advanced methods have made progress in video emotion
analysis, the intrinsic nature of emotions poses significant challenges.
Emotions are characterized by dynamic and cues-dependent properties, making it
difficult to understand complex and evolving emotional states with reasonable
rationale. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel affective cues-guided
reasoning framework that unifies fundamental attribute perception, expression
analysis, and high-level emotional understanding in a stage-wise manner. At the
core of our approach is a family of video emotion foundation models (VidEmo),
specifically designed for emotion reasoning and instruction-following. These
models undergo a two-stage tuning process: first, curriculum emotion learning
for injecting emotion knowledge, followed by affective-tree reinforcement
learning for emotion reasoning. Moreover, we establish a foundational data
infrastructure and introduce a emotion-centric fine-grained dataset (Emo-CFG)
consisting of 2.1M diverse instruction-based samples. Emo-CFG includes
explainable emotional question-answering, fine-grained captions, and associated
rationales, providing essential resources for advancing emotion understanding
tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive
performance, setting a new milestone across 15 face perception tasks.

*Vojtěch Kůr,Adam Bajger,Adam Kukučka,Marek Hradil,Vít Musil,Tomáš Brázdil*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLEXICORP automates concept naming and explanation generation in CNNs by combining concept relevance propagation with multimodal large language models, making AI explanations more accessible and scalable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current concept relevance propagation workflows require manual inspection and explanation synthesis by experts, limiting accessibility and scalability of interpretability methods for deep neural networks.

Method: A modular pipeline that couples concept relevance propagation with a multimodal large language model to automatically assign descriptive names to concept prototypes and generate natural-language explanations from relevance distributions.

Result: The method successfully generates tailored explanations for different audiences and qualitatively works well on ImageNet images with VGG16 model, lowering the barrier to interpreting deep neural networks.

Conclusion: Integrating concept-based attribution methods with large language models can significantly improve AI transparency and make neural network interpretations more accessible to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) underpin many modern computer vision
systems. With applications ranging from common to critical areas, a need to
explain and understand the model and its decisions (XAI) emerged. Prior works
suggest that in the top layers of CNNs, the individual channels can be
attributed to classifying human-understandable concepts. Concept relevance
propagation (CRP) methods can backtrack predictions to these channels and find
images that most activate these channels. However, current CRP workflows are
largely manual: experts must inspect activation images to name the discovered
concepts and must synthesize verbose explanations from relevance maps, limiting
the accessibility of the explanations and their scalability.
  To address these issues, we introduce Large Language model EXplaIns COncept
Relevance Propagation (LLEXICORP), a modular pipeline that couples CRP with a
multimodal large language model. Our approach automatically assigns descriptive
names to concept prototypes and generates natural-language explanations that
translate quantitative relevance distributions into intuitive narratives. To
ensure faithfulness, we craft prompts that teach the language model the
semantics of CRP through examples and enforce a separation between naming and
explanation tasks. The resulting text can be tailored to different audiences,
offering low-level technical descriptions for experts and high-level summaries
for non-technical stakeholders.
  We qualitatively evaluate our method on various images from ImageNet on a
VGG16 model. Our findings suggest that integrating concept-based attribution
methods with large language models can significantly lower the barrier to
interpreting deep neural networks, paving the way for more transparent AI
systems.

*Tyler Zhu,Tengda Han,Leonidas Guibas,Viorica Pătrăucean,Maks Ovsjanikov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents the first comprehensive study of video-text representation alignment, examining how modern video and language encoders align across modalities and proposing test-time scaling laws to predict alignment performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While image-text alignment has been well studied, the temporal nature of video data remains largely unexplored in cross-modal representation alignment research.

Method: The study probes video and language encoders' capabilities, investigates cross-modal alignment dependencies on data richness, proposes parametric test-time scaling laws, and correlates alignment with downstream task performance and temporal reasoning.

Result: Findings show cross-modal alignment highly depends on visual and text data richness at test time, with proposed scaling laws demonstrating strong predictive power. Strong alignment correlates with general-purpose video representation and understanding.

Conclusion: Video-text alignment serves as an informative zero-shot method to probe representation power of encoders for spatio-temporal data, providing insights into structural similarities and downstream capabilities.

Abstract: The alignment of representations from different modalities has recently been
shown to provide insights on the structural similarities and downstream
capabilities of different encoders across diverse data types. While significant
progress has been made in aligning images with text, the temporal nature of
video data remains largely unexplored in this context. In this work, we conduct
the first comprehensive study of video-text representation alignment, probing
the capabilities of modern video and language encoders. Our findings reveal
several key insights. First, we demonstrate that cross-modal alignment highly
depends on the richness of both visual (static images vs. multi-frame videos)
and text (single caption vs. a collection) data provided at test time,
especially when using state-of-the-art video encoders. We propose parametric
test-time scaling laws that capture this behavior and show remarkable
predictive power against empirical observations. Secondly, we investigate the
correlation between semantic alignment and performance on both semantic and
non-semantic downstream tasks, providing initial evidence that strong alignment
against text encoders may be linked to general-purpose video representation and
understanding. Finally, we correlate temporal reasoning with cross-modal
alignment providing a challenging test-bed for vision and language models.
Overall, our work introduces video-text alignment as an informative zero-shot
way to probe the representation power of different encoders for spatio-temporal
data. Project page can be found at https://video-prh.github.io/

### [60] [PercHead: Perceptual Head Model for Single-Image 3D Head Reconstruction & Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02777)
*Antonio Oroz,Matthias Nießner,Tobias Kirschstein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PercHead is a method for single-image 3D head reconstruction and semantic 3D editing using perceptual supervision from DINOv2 and SAM2.1, achieving state-of-the-art novel-view synthesis with robustness to extreme angles, and enabling intuitive geometry/appearance editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in single-image 3D head reconstruction including severe view occlusions, weak perceptual supervision, and ambiguity of 3D editing by developing a unified approach with strong perceptual guidance.

Method: Uses dual-branch encoder with ViT-based decoder that lifts 2D features to 3D via iterative cross-attention, rendered with Gaussian Splatting. Employs perceptual supervision from DINOv2 and SAM2.1. For editing, swaps encoder and disentangles geometry (segmentation maps) from style (text/image prompts).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in novel-view synthesis with exceptional robustness to extreme viewing angles. Enables semantic 3D editing through lightweight GUI for intuitive geometry sculpting and appearance stylization.

Conclusion: PercHead provides a unified solution for high-quality 3D head reconstruction and semantic editing, demonstrating the effectiveness of perceptual supervision and showing promise for interactive 3D content creation.

Abstract: We present PercHead, a method for single-image 3D head reconstruction and
semantic 3D editing - two tasks that are inherently challenging due to severe
view occlusions, weak perceptual supervision, and the ambiguity of editing in
3D space. We develop a unified base model for reconstructing view-consistent 3D
heads from a single input image. The model employs a dual-branch encoder
followed by a ViT-based decoder that lifts 2D features into 3D space through
iterative cross-attention. Rendering is performed using Gaussian Splatting. At
the heart of our approach is a novel perceptual supervision strategy based on
DINOv2 and SAM2.1, which provides rich, generalized signals for both geometric
and appearance fidelity. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in
novel-view synthesis and, furthermore, exhibits exceptional robustness to
extreme viewing angles compared to established baselines. Furthermore, this
base model can be seamlessly extended for semantic 3D editing by swapping the
encoder and finetuning the network. In this variant, we disentangle geometry
and style through two distinct input modalities: a segmentation map to control
geometry and either a text prompt or a reference image to specify appearance.
We highlight the intuitive and powerful 3D editing capabilities of our model
through a lightweight, interactive GUI, where users can effortlessly sculpt
geometry by drawing segmentation maps and stylize appearance via natural
language or image prompts.

### [61] [VCode: a Multimodal Coding Benchmark with SVG as Symbolic Visual Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02778)
*Kevin Qinghong Lin,Yuhao Zheng,Hangyu Ran,Dantong Zhu,Dongxing Mao,Linjie Li,Philip Torr,Alex Jinpeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VCode introduces SVG code generation as a benchmark for visual-centric coding, proposing CodeVQA for evaluation and VCoder framework to improve VLM performance through iterative revision and visual tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current progress in AI has focused on language-centric coding tasks, leaving visual-centric coding underexplored. The paper advocates for SVG code as a compact, interpretable visual representation inspired by human sketch reasoning.

Method: VCode benchmark reframes multimodal understanding as SVG code generation across three domains. CodeVQA evaluates symbolic fidelity through question answering on rendered SVGs. VCoder framework enhances VLMs with iterative revision thinking and visual tools integration.

Result: Frontier VLMs struggle with faithful SVG generation, showing a gap between language and visual coding. VCoder achieves 12.3-point overall gain over Claude-4-Opus. Both humans and VLMs perform worse on rendered SVGs but show consistency.

Conclusion: SVG code shows promise as symbolic visual representation. The gap between language and visual coding persists, but VCoder's agentic framework demonstrates significant improvement through iterative refinement and visual tool integration.

Abstract: Code has emerged as a precise and executable medium for reasoning and action
in the agent era. Yet, progress has largely focused on language-centric tasks
such as program synthesis and debugging, leaving visual-centric coding
underexplored. Inspired by how humans reason over sketches, we advocate SVG
code as a compact, interpretable, and executable visual representation. We
introduce VCode, a benchmark that reframes multimodal understanding as code
generation: given an image, a model must produce SVG that preserves symbolic
meaning for downstream reasoning. VCode covers three domains - general
commonsense (MM-Vet), professional disciplines (MMMU), and visual-centric
perception (CV-Bench). To assess symbolic fidelity, we propose CodeVQA, a novel
evaluation protocol in which a policy model answers questions over rendered
SVGs; correct answers indicate faithful symbolic preservation. Empirically,
frontier VLMs struggle to generate faithful SVGs, revealing a persistent gap
between language-centric and visual-centric coding. To close this gap, we
introduce VCoder, an agentic framework that augments VLMs along two axes: (i)
Thinking with Revision, which iteratively analyzes discrepancies and refines
SVG code; and (ii) Acting with Visual Tools, where detectors and parsers supply
structured cues such as objects, shapes, and text beyond the model's intrinsic
capacity. Across benchmarks, frontier VLMs with strong reasoning capabilities
score well overall yet remain limited in professional knowledge and 3D
reasoning. VCoder delivers a 12.3-point overall gain over the top-performing
Claude-4-Opus. Human studies show that both humans and VLMs perform worse on
rendered SVGs, their consistency reveals the promise of symbolic visual
representation. The benchmark and code are available at

### [62] [When Visualizing is the First Step to Reasoning: MIRA, a Benchmark for Visual Chain-of-Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02779)
*Yiyang Zhou,Haoqin Tu,Zijun Wang,Zeyu Wang,Niklas Muennighoff,Fan Nie,Yejin Choi,James Zou,Chaorui Deng,Shen Yan,Haoqi Fan,Cihang Xie,Huaxiu Yao,Qinghao Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MIRA is a new benchmark that evaluates models' ability to generate and use intermediate visual images (like sketches and diagrams) for reasoning, mimicking human 'drawing to think' processes. It contains 546 multimodal problems and shows that current models struggle with text-only prompts but improve significantly when visual cues are provided.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional chain-of-thought methods rely solely on text, but many complex problems require visual reasoning through intermediate images like sketches and diagrams, similar to how humans solve problems by 'drawing to think'.

Method: Created MIRA benchmark with 546 multimodal problems requiring intermediate visual image generation. Proposed unified evaluation protocol with three input levels: direct input, text-only CoT, and Visual-CoT with annotated image clues and thinking prompts. Used pass@k and majority voting accuracies for evaluation.

Result: Existing multimodal LLMs perform poorly with text-only prompts but show 33.7% average relative improvement when intermediate visual cues are provided. Expanding search space or designing textual prompts aligned with Visual-CoT yielded only limited improvements compared to Visual-CoT.

Conclusion: Intermediate visual information is critical for successful reasoning on complex multimodal tasks, and current models heavily depend on visual cues rather than pure text-based reasoning.

Abstract: We propose MIRA, a new benchmark designed to evaluate models in scenarios
where generating intermediate visual images is essential for successful
reasoning. Unlike traditional CoT methods that rely solely on text, tasks in
MIRA require models to generate and utilize intermediate images - such as
sketches, structural diagrams, or path drawings - to guide their reasoning
process. This setup closely mirrors how humans solve complex problems through
"drawing to think". To solve this, MIRA focuses on tasks that are intrinsically
challenging and involve complex structures, spatial relationships, or reasoning
steps that are difficult to express through language alone. To ensure that our
evaluation data is of high-quality, we include 546 multimodal problems,
annotated with intermediate visual images and final answers. We also propose a
unified evaluation protocol for MIRA that spans three levels of evaluation
input: direct input with image and question only, text-only CoT input with
image and thinking prompts, and Visual-CoT input with both annotated image
clues and textual thinking prompts. To probe the upper bound of model capacity
on our benchmark, we also report pass@k and majority voting accuracies under
different k settings. Experimental results show that existing multimodal large
language models, including strongest private models as well as strong
open-weight models, perform poorly when relying solely on textual prompts.
However, when intermediate visual cues are provided, model performance improves
consistently, yielding an average relative gain of 33.7% across all models and
tasks. We also probe the upper bound by expanding the search space and
designing textual prompts aligned with Visual-CoT, but both yield only limited
improvements compared to our Visual-CoT setting. These results underscore the
critical role of imagined visual information in enabling successful reasoning
on MIRA.

*Nusrat Tasnim,Kutub Uddin,Khalid Mahmood Malik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a unified benchmarking framework to systematically evaluate AI-generated media detection methods, addressing critical gaps in current forensic approaches through standardized testing across multiple models and datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of AI-generated media like deepfakes poses significant threats to multimedia forensics, misinformation detection, and biometric systems, leading to erosion of public trust, increased fraud, and social engineering attacks. Current forensic methods suffer from non-standardized benchmarks, inconsistent training protocols, and limited evaluation metrics.

Method: The paper proposes a unified benchmarking framework that evaluates ten state-of-the-art forensic methods (using scratch, frozen, and fine-tuned approaches) across seven publicly available datasets containing both GAN- and diffusion-generated images. The evaluation uses multiple metrics including accuracy, average precision, ROC-AUC, error rate, and class-wise sensitivity, with additional interpretability analysis using confidence curves and Grad-CAM heatmaps.

Result: The evaluations reveal substantial variability in generalization performance, with some methods showing strong in-distribution performance but degraded cross-model transferability. The systematic benchmarking provides fair comparisons and reveals true robustness limitations of current approaches.

Conclusion: This study provides guidance for the research community to better understand the strengths and limitations of current forensic methods, and aims to inspire the development of more robust, generalizable, and explainable solutions for AI-generated media detection.

Abstract: The threats posed by AI-generated media, particularly deepfakes, are now
raising significant challenges for multimedia forensics, misinformation
detection, and biometric system resulting in erosion of public trust in the
legal system, significant increase in frauds, and social engineering attacks.
Although several forensic methods have been proposed, they suffer from three
critical gaps: (i) use of non-standardized benchmarks with GAN- or
diffusion-generated images, (ii) inconsistent training protocols (e.g.,
scratch, frozen, fine-tuning), and (iii) limited evaluation metrics that fail
to capture generalization and explainability. These limitations hinder fair
comparison, obscure true robustness, and restrict deployment in
security-critical applications. This paper introduces a unified benchmarking
framework for systematic evaluation of forensic methods under controlled and
reproducible conditions. We benchmark ten SoTA forensic methods (scratch,
frozen, and fine-tuned) and seven publicly available datasets (GAN and
diffusion) to perform extensive and systematic evaluations. We evaluate
performance using multiple metrics, including accuracy, average precision,
ROC-AUC, error rate, and class-wise sensitivity. We also further analyze model
interpretability using confidence curves and Grad-CAM heatmaps. Our evaluations
demonstrate substantial variability in generalization, with certain methods
exhibiting strong in-distribution performance but degraded cross-model
transferability. This study aims to guide the research community toward a
deeper understanding of the strengths and limitations of current forensic
approaches, and to inspire the development of more robust, generalizable, and
explainable solutions.

Comprehensive evaluation across public and internal benchmarks demonstrates
that PLUTO-4 achieves state-of-the-art performance on tasks requiring varying
spatial and biological context, including patch-level classification,
segmentation, and slide-level diagnosis. The compact PLUTO-4S provides
high-throughput and robust performance for practical deployment, while PLUTO-4G
establishes new performance frontiers across multiple pathology benchmarks,
including an 11% improvement in dermatopathology diagnosis. These diverse
improvements underscore PLUTO-4's potential to transform real-world
applications as a backbone for translational research and diagnostic use cases.

*Dmitrii Pozdeev,Alexey Artemov,Ananta R. Bhattarai,Artem Sevastopolsky*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DenseMarks is a learned representation for human heads that enables high-quality dense correspondences by mapping 2D head images to a 3D canonical unit cube using Vision Transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create robust dense correspondences for human head images that work across diverse poses, cover the entire head including hair, and provide consistent representations across different individuals.

Method: Uses Vision Transformer to predict 3D embeddings for each pixel, trained with contrastive loss on pairwise point matches from talking head videos, plus multi-task learning with face landmarks, segmentation, and spatial continuity constraints.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results in geometry-aware point matching and monocular head tracking with 3D Morphable Models, robust to pose variations and covering entire head.

Conclusion: DenseMarks provides an interpretable canonical space representation that enables various applications including semantic part matching, face/head tracking, and stereo reconstruction with consistent cross-pose and cross-individual performance.

Abstract: We propose DenseMarks - a new learned representation for human heads,
enabling high-quality dense correspondences of human head images. For a 2D
image of a human head, a Vision Transformer network predicts a 3D embedding for
each pixel, which corresponds to a location in a 3D canonical unit cube. In
order to train our network, we collect a dataset of pairwise point matches,
estimated by a state-of-the-art point tracker over a collection of diverse
in-the-wild talking heads videos, and guide the mapping via a contrastive loss,
encouraging matched points to have close embeddings. We further employ
multi-task learning with face landmarks and segmentation constraints, as well
as imposing spatial continuity of embeddings through latent cube features,
which results in an interpretable and queryable canonical space. The
representation can be used for finding common semantic parts, face/head
tracking, and stereo reconstruction. Due to the strong supervision, our method
is robust to pose variations and covers the entire head, including hair.
Additionally, the canonical space bottleneck makes sure the obtained
representations are consistent across diverse poses and individuals. We
demonstrate state-of-the-art results in geometry-aware point matching and
monocular head tracking with 3D Morphable Models. The code and the model
checkpoint will be made available to the public.
