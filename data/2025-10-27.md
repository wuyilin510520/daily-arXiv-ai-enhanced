### [1] [Preventing Shortcuts in Adapter Training via Providing the Shortcuts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20887)
*Anujraaj Argo Goyal,Guocheng Gordon Qian,Huseyin Coskun,Aarush Gupta,Himmy Tam,Daniil Ostashev,Ju Hu,Dhritiman Sagar,Sergey Tulyakov,Kfir Aberman,Kuan-Chieh Jackson Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Shortcut-Rerouted Adapter Training improves adapter-based image generation by routing confounding factors through auxiliary modules during training, then removing them during inference, leading to better disentanglement and prompt adherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard adapter training for image generators suffers from entanglement of target attributes with incidental factors like pose and lighting, limiting generalization and prompt adherence.

Method: Route confounding factors through auxiliary modules (ControlNet or LoRA) during adapter training to eliminate incentive for the adapter to internalize them, then remove auxiliary modules during inference.

Result: Improves generation quality, diversity, and prompt adherence for facial and full-body identity injection tasks.

Conclusion: Establishing shortcuts for what should NOT be learned is an effective design principle for achieving disentangled representations in large models.

Abstract: Adapter-based training has emerged as a key mechanism for extending the
capabilities of powerful foundation image generators, enabling personalized and
stylized text-to-image synthesis. These adapters are typically trained to
capture a specific target attribute, such as subject identity, using
single-image reconstruction objectives. However, because the input image
inevitably contains a mixture of visual factors, adapters are prone to entangle
the target attribute with incidental ones, such as pose, expression, and
lighting. This spurious correlation problem limits generalization and obstructs
the model's ability to adhere to the input text prompt. In this work, we
uncover a simple yet effective solution: provide the very shortcuts we wish to
eliminate during adapter training. In Shortcut-Rerouted Adapter Training,
confounding factors are routed through auxiliary modules, such as ControlNet or
LoRA, eliminating the incentive for the adapter to internalize them. The
auxiliary modules are then removed during inference. When applied to tasks like
facial and full-body identity injection, our approach improves generation
quality, diversity, and prompt adherence. These results point to a general
design principle in the era of large models: when seeking disentangled
representations, the most effective path may be to establish shortcuts for what
should NOT be learned.

### [2] [Video-As-Prompt: Unified Semantic Control for Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20888)
*Yuxuan Bian,Xin Chen,Zenan Li,Tiancheng Zhi,Shen Sang,Linjie Luo,Qiang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video-As-Prompt (VAP) introduces a new paradigm for semantic video control using reference videos as prompts with a Mixture-of-Transformers expert, achieving state-of-the-art performance without task-specific finetuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing methods that either introduce artifacts through pixel-wise priors or require non-generalizable condition-specific finetuning for semantic video control.

Method: Uses reference videos as semantic prompts with a plug-and-play Mixture-of-Transformers expert on a frozen Video Diffusion Transformer, guided by temporally biased position embedding to eliminate spurious mapping priors.

Result: Achieves 38.7% user preference rate, rivaling leading condition-specific commercial models, with strong zero-shot generalization across various applications.

Conclusion: VAP represents a significant advance toward general-purpose, controllable video generation through its unified approach and strong generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Unified, generalizable semantic control in video generation remains a
critical open challenge. Existing methods either introduce artifacts by
enforcing inappropriate pixel-wise priors from structure-based controls, or
rely on non-generalizable, condition-specific finetuning or task-specific
architectures. We introduce Video-As-Prompt (VAP), a new paradigm that reframes
this problem as in-context generation. VAP leverages a reference video as a
direct semantic prompt, guiding a frozen Video Diffusion Transformer (DiT) via
a plug-and-play Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) expert. This architecture
prevents catastrophic forgetting and is guided by a temporally biased position
embedding that eliminates spurious mapping priors for robust context retrieval.
To power this approach and catalyze future research, we built VAP-Data, the
largest dataset for semantic-controlled video generation with over 100K paired
videos across 100 semantic conditions. As a single unified model, VAP sets a
new state-of-the-art for open-source methods, achieving a 38.7% user preference
rate that rivals leading condition-specific commercial models. VAP's strong
zero-shot generalization and support for various downstream applications mark a
significant advance toward general-purpose, controllable video generation.

### [3] [Focal Modulation and Bidirectional Feature Fusion Network for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20933)
*Moin Safdar,Shahzaib Iqbal,Mehwish Mehmood,Mubeen Ghafoor,Tariq M. Khan,Imran Razzak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FM-BFF-Net combines CNNs and transformers with focal modulation attention and bidirectional feature fusion to improve medical image segmentation by enhancing global context capture and boundary precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image segmentation is crucial for clinical applications but faces challenges in capturing global contextual information and long-range dependencies with traditional CNNs, especially for structures with complex borders and varying sizes.

Method: Proposes FM-BFF-Net that integrates convolutional and transformer components, uses focal modulation attention mechanism for context awareness, and introduces bidirectional feature fusion module for efficient encoder-decoder interaction across scales.

Result: Extensive experiments on eight public datasets (polyp detection, skin lesion segmentation, ultrasound imaging) show FM-BFF-Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in Jaccard index and Dice coefficient.

Conclusion: FM-BFF-Net effectively addresses limitations of CNNs by combining transformers, demonstrating enhanced boundary precision and robustness to lesion variations, making it adaptable for diverse medical imaging scenarios.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is essential for clinical applications such as
disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease development monitoring
because it provides precise morphological and spatial information on anatomical
structures that directly influence treatment decisions. Convolutional neural
networks significantly impact image segmentation; however, since convolution
operations are local, capturing global contextual information and long-range
dependencies is still challenging. Their capacity to precisely segment
structures with complicated borders and a variety of sizes is impacted by this
restriction. Since transformers use self-attention methods to capture global
context and long-range dependencies efficiently, integrating transformer-based
architecture with CNNs is a feasible approach to overcoming these challenges.
To address these challenges, we propose the Focal Modulation and Bidirectional
Feature Fusion Network for Medical Image Segmentation, referred to as
FM-BFF-Net in the remainder of this paper. The network combines convolutional
and transformer components, employs a focal modulation attention mechanism to
refine context awareness, and introduces a bidirectional feature fusion module
that enables efficient interaction between encoder and decoder representations
across scales. Through this design, FM-BFF-Net enhances boundary precision and
robustness to variations in lesion size, shape, and contrast. Extensive
experiments on eight publicly available datasets, including polyp detection,
skin lesion segmentation, and ultrasound imaging, show that FM-BFF-Net
consistently surpasses recent state-of-the-art methods in Jaccard index and
Dice coefficient, confirming its effectiveness and adaptability for diverse
medical imaging scenarios.

### [4] [Generative Point Tracking with Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20951)
*Mattie Tesfaldet,Adam W. Harley,Konstantinos G. Derpanis,Derek Nowrouzezahrai,Christopher Pal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GenPT introduces a generative framework for multi-modal point trajectory tracking that captures uncertainty from visual obfuscations like occlusions, outperforming discriminative models on occluded points while maintaining competitive performance on visible points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current discriminative point tracking models are limited to regressing to mean/mode estimates and fail to capture multi-modality in trajectories, especially under uncertainty from visual obfuscations like appearance changes and occlusions.

Method: GenPT uses a generative framework with flow matching formulation that combines iterative refinement, window-dependent prior for cross-window consistency, and variance schedule tuned for point coordinates. Inference uses best-first search on generated samples guided by model confidence.

Result: State-of-the-art tracking accuracy on occluded points in PointOdyssey, Dynamic Replica, and TAP-Vid benchmarks, while maintaining competitive accuracy on visible points compared to discriminative trackers.

Conclusion: GenPT successfully captures multi-modality in point trajectories through its generative approach, significantly improving occluded point tracking performance while maintaining strong visible point tracking capabilities.

Abstract: Tracking a point through a video can be a challenging task due to uncertainty
arising from visual obfuscations, such as appearance changes and occlusions.
Although current state-of-the-art discriminative models excel in regressing
long-term point trajectory estimates -- even through occlusions -- they are
limited to regressing to a mean (or mode) in the presence of uncertainty, and
fail to capture multi-modality. To overcome this limitation, we introduce
Generative Point Tracker (GenPT), a generative framework for modelling
multi-modal trajectories. GenPT is trained with a novel flow matching
formulation that combines the iterative refinement of discriminative trackers,
a window-dependent prior for cross-window consistency, and a variance schedule
tuned specifically for point coordinates. We show how our model's generative
capabilities can be leveraged to improve point trajectory estimates by
utilizing a best-first search strategy on generated samples during inference,
guided by the model's own confidence of its predictions. Empirically, we
evaluate GenPT against the current state of the art on the standard
PointOdyssey, Dynamic Replica, and TAP-Vid benchmarks. Further, we introduce a
TAP-Vid variant with additional occlusions to assess occluded point tracking
performance and highlight our model's ability to capture multi-modality. GenPT
is capable of capturing the multi-modality in point trajectories, which
translates to state-of-the-art tracking accuracy on occluded points, while
maintaining competitive tracking accuracy on visible points compared to extant
discriminative point trackers.

*Sraavya Sambara,Sung Eun Kim,Xiaoman Zhang,Luyang Luo,Shreya Johri,Mohammed Baharoon,Du Hyun Ro,Pranav Rajpurkar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3DReasonKnee is the first 3D grounded reasoning dataset for medical images, providing 494k expert-annotated quintuples from 7,970 knee MRI volumes to enable VLMs to localize anatomical regions and perform step-by-step diagnostic reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle with grounding anatomical regions in 3D medical images and step-by-step reasoning, which is essential for aligning with clinical diagnostic workflows and enabling trustworthy clinician-AI collaboration.

Method: Created 3DReasonKnee dataset with 494k quintuples from 7,970 3D knee MRI volumes, each containing: 3D MRI volume, diagnostic question, 3D bounding box localization, clinician-generated reasoning steps, and structured severity assessments. Involved 450+ hours of expert clinician time for manual segmentation and reasoning chain generation.

Result: Established ReasonKnee-Bench benchmark showing baseline performance of five state-of-the-art VLMs on localization and diagnostic accuracy across anatomical regions and diagnostic inquiries.

Conclusion: 3DReasonKnee serves as a repository of orthopedic surgeons' diagnostic expertise and provides a vital testbed for advancing multimodal medical AI systems towards 3D, clinically aligned, localized decision-making capabilities.

Abstract: Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle to ground anatomical regions
in 3D medical images and reason about them in a step-by-step manner, a key
requirement of real-world diagnostic assessment. This ability is essential for
aligning model outputs with the diagnostic workflows clinicians use in
practice, enabling trustworthy clinician-AI collaboration. Existing 3D datasets
provide localization labels, but none support this "grounded reasoning"
ability. To address this gap, we introduce 3DReasonKnee, the first 3D grounded
reasoning dataset for medical images, which provides 494k high-quality
quintuples derived from 7,970 3D knee MRI volumes. Each quintuple includes: (1)
the 3D MRI volume, (2) a diagnostic question targeting a specific anatomical
region (3) a 3D bounding box localizing the relevant anatomical structures, (4)
clinician-generated diagnostic reasoning steps that explicitly detail the 3D
reasoning process, and (5) structured severity assessments for the relevant
anatomical region. The creation and validation of 3DReasonKnee, involving over
450 hours of expert clinician time for manually segmenting MRIs and generating
reasoning chains, ensures its superior quality and clinical relevance. We
establish ReasonKnee-Bench to evaluate localization and diagnostic accuracy,
providing insight into VLM ability to perform grounding and severity assessment
across anatomical regions and diagnostic inquiries. We benchmark five
state-of-the-art VLMs, providing baseline performance for ReasonKnee-Bench. By
providing this unique resource of expert-annotated 3D reasoning pathways,
3DReasonKnee serves as a repository of orthopedic surgeons' diagnostic
expertise and offers a vital testbed for advancing multimodal medical AI
systems towards 3D, clinically aligned, localized decision-making capabilities.

*Takahiro Kushida,Kenichiro Tanaka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel 3D shape reconstruction method using thermal polarization cues, independent of illumination and material properties, overcoming ambiguities in visible polarization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D reconstruction methods depend on illumination and material properties, limiting their effectiveness with transparent, translucent, and heterogeneous objects.

Method: Formulated general polarization theory using LWIR polarimetric imaging to avoid ambiguities, and developed multi-view thermal polarimetric imaging for 3D shape recovery.

Result: Successfully reconstructed fine details in transparent, translucent, and heterogeneous objects, outperforming existing techniques.

Conclusion: Thermal polarization-based 3D reconstruction provides illumination- and material-independent solution for detailed shape recovery across various object types.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for detailed 3D shape reconstruction
utilizing thermal polarization cues. Unlike state-of-the-art methods, the
proposed approach is independent of illumination and material properties. In
this paper, we formulate a general theory of polarization observation and show
that long-wave infrared (LWIR) polarimetric imaging is free from the
ambiguities that affect visible polarization analyses. Subsequently, we propose
a method for recovering detailed 3D shapes using multi-view thermal
polarimetric images. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
effectively reconstructs fine details in transparent, translucent, and
heterogeneous objects, outperforming existing techniques.

### [7] [VESSA: Video-based objEct-centric Self-Supervised Adaptation for Visual Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20994)
*Jesimon Barreto,Carlos Caetano,André Araujo,William Robson Schwartz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VESSA is a self-supervised adaptation method for vision foundation models that uses multi-view object-centric videos to adapt models to new domains without requiring annotations, preventing catastrophic forgetting while improving performance on downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision foundation models often underperform in domains with distribution shifts and scarce labels, where supervised fine-tuning is infeasible. Current self-supervised learning approaches have not been effective for vision encoder models, creating a need for annotation-free adaptation methods.

Method: Uses self-distillation paradigm with multi-view object-centric videos. Carefully tunes prediction heads and deploys parameter-efficient adaptation techniques to prevent forgetting pretrained knowledge. Leverages object observations from different frames in videos to learn robustness to varied capture conditions.

Result: Comprehensive experiments with 3 vision foundation models on 2 datasets show consistent improvements in downstream classification tasks compared to base models and previous adaptation methods.

Conclusion: VESSA successfully enables self-supervised adaptation of vision foundation models to new domains without annotations, demonstrating effective performance improvements while preventing catastrophic forgetting of pretrained knowledge.

Abstract: Foundation models have advanced computer vision by enabling strong
performance across diverse tasks through large-scale pretraining and supervised
fine-tuning. However, they may underperform in domains with distribution shifts
and scarce labels, where supervised fine-tuning may be infeasible. While
continued self-supervised learning for model adaptation is common for
generative language models, this strategy has not proven effective for
vision-centric encoder models. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel
formulation of self-supervised fine-tuning for vision foundation models, where
the model is adapted to a new domain without requiring annotations, leveraging
only short multi-view object-centric videos. Our method is referred to as
VESSA: Video-based objEct-centric Self-Supervised Adaptation for visual
foundation models. VESSA's training technique is based on a self-distillation
paradigm, where it is critical to carefully tune prediction heads and deploy
parameter-efficient adaptation techniques - otherwise, the model may quickly
forget its pretrained knowledge and reach a degraded state. VESSA benefits
significantly from multi-view object observations sourced from different frames
in an object-centric video, efficiently learning robustness to varied capture
conditions, without the need of annotations. Through comprehensive experiments
with 3 vision foundation models on 2 datasets, VESSA demonstrates consistent
improvements in downstream classification tasks, compared to the base models
and previous adaptation methods. Code is publicly available at
https://github.com/jesimonbarreto/VESSA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A plug-in pipeline for 2D detection of unseen objects in industrial settings that enhances detection accuracy through low-light image enhancement and background removal guided by foundation models, reducing domain shift and false positives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 6D pose estimation pipelines degrade under challenging industrial conditions like clutter, poor lighting, and complex backgrounds, making detection the critical bottleneck that needs improvement.

Method: Standardized pipeline using low-light image enhancement and background removal guided by open-vocabulary detection with foundation models, building on current SOTA baselines to reduce domain shift and background artifacts.

Result: Significantly boosts detection accuracy on real-world industrial bin-picking benchmarks from BOP with negligible inference overhead, suppressing false positives prevalent in raw SAM outputs.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates effectiveness and practicality for improving 2D detection of unseen objects in industrial environments, providing more reliable detections for downstream pose estimation tasks.

Abstract: Accurate 6D pose estimation is essential for robotic manipulation in
industrial environments. Existing pipelines typically rely on off-the-shelf
object detectors followed by cropping and pose refinement, but their
performance degrades under challenging conditions such as clutter, poor
lighting, and complex backgrounds, making detection the critical bottleneck. In
this work, we introduce a standardized and plug-in pipeline for 2D detection of
unseen objects in industrial settings. Based on current SOTA baselines, our
approach reduces domain shift and background artifacts through low-light image
enhancement and background removal guided by open-vocabulary detection with
foundation models. This design suppresses the false positives prevalent in raw
SAM outputs, yielding more reliable detections for downstream pose estimation.
Extensive experiments on real-world industrial bin-picking benchmarks from BOP
demonstrate that our method significantly boosts detection accuracy while
incurring negligible inference overhead, showing the effectiveness and
practicality of the proposed method.

### [9] [Deep learning-based automated damage detection in concrete structures using images from earthquake events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21063)
*Abdullah Turer,Yongsheng Bai,Halil Sezen,Alper Yilmaz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning-based automated detection of exposed steel reinforcement in concrete structures after earthquakes using YOLOv11 models to assess structural damage levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Timely assessment of structural integrity after seismic events is crucial for public safety and emergency response, requiring automated methods to detect damage indicators like exposed steel reinforcement.

Method: Developed a hybrid deep learning framework using YOLOv11 models with fine-tuning, data augmentation, and classification. Includes models for detecting cracking/spalling damage, exposed bars, and distinguishing structural damage levels from images collected after 2023 Turkey Earthquakes.

Result: Created an automated classification framework that can identify building locations and structural components, then detect damage features and determine damage levels reliably from input images.

Conclusion: Rapid and automated damage detection following disasters is achievable across diverse damage contexts through image data collection, annotation, and deep learning approaches.

Abstract: Timely assessment of integrity of structures after seismic events is crucial
for public safety and emergency response. This study focuses on assessing the
structural damage conditions using deep learning methods to detect exposed
steel reinforcement in concrete buildings and bridges after large earthquakes.
Steel bars are typically exposed after concrete spalling or large flexural or
shear cracks. The amount and distribution of exposed steel reinforcement is an
indication of structural damage and degradation. To automatically detect
exposed steel bars, new datasets of images collected after the 2023 Turkey
Earthquakes were labeled to represent a wide variety of damaged concrete
structures. The proposed method builds upon a deep learning framework, enhanced
with fine-tuning, data augmentation, and testing on public datasets. An
automated classification framework is developed that can be used to identify
inside/outside buildings and structural components. Then, a YOLOv11 (You Only
Look Once) model is trained to detect cracking and spalling damage and exposed
bars. Another YOLO model is finetuned to distinguish different categories of
structural damage levels. All these trained models are used to create a hybrid
framework to automatically and reliably determine the damage levels from input
images. This research demonstrates that rapid and automated damage detection
following disasters is achievable across diverse damage contexts by utilizing
image data collection, annotation, and deep learning approaches.

### [10] [ZING-3D: Zero-shot Incremental 3D Scene Graphs via Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21069)
*Pranav Saxena,Jimmy Chiun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ZING-3D is a zero-shot framework that generates 3D scene graphs using pretrained foundation models, enabling open-vocabulary recognition, incremental updates, and geometric grounding without task-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D scene graph generation methods are limited to single-view settings, lack incremental update capability, and have no explicit geometric grounding, which are essential for embodied AI and robotics applications.

Method: Leverages VLM reasoning to generate rich 2D scene graphs, then grounds them in 3D using depth information. Creates nodes with open-vocabulary objects, features, 3D locations, and semantic context, with edges capturing spatial/semantic relations and inter-object distances.

Result: Experiments on Replica and HM3D datasets show ZING-3D effectively captures spatial and relational knowledge without task-specific training, demonstrating its capability for open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding.

Conclusion: ZING-3D provides a practical solution for generating geometrically grounded 3D scene graphs suitable for robotics applications, overcoming limitations of previous methods by enabling incremental updates and open-vocabulary recognition in a zero-shot manner.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning about complex 3D environments requires structured
scene representations that capture not only objects but also their semantic and
spatial relationships. While recent works on 3D scene graph generation have
leveraged pretrained VLMs without task-specific fine-tuning, they are largely
confined to single-view settings, fail to support incremental updates as new
observations arrive and lack explicit geometric grounding in 3D space, all of
which are essential for embodied scenarios. In this paper, we propose, ZING-3D,
a framework that leverages the vast knowledge of pretrained foundation models
to enable open-vocabulary recognition and generate a rich semantic
representation of the scene in a zero-shot manner while also enabling
incremental updates and geometric grounding in 3D space, making it suitable for
downstream robotics applications. Our approach leverages VLM reasoning to
generate a rich 2D scene graph, which is grounded in 3D using depth
information. Nodes represent open-vocabulary objects with features, 3D
locations, and semantic context, while edges capture spatial and semantic
relations with inter-object distances. Our experiments on scenes from the
Replica and HM3D dataset show that ZING-3D is effective at capturing spatial
and relational knowledge without the need of task-specific training.

### [11] [WaveSeg: Enhancing Segmentation Precision via High-Frequency Prior and Mamba-Driven Spectrum Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21079)
*Guoan Xu,Yang Xiao,Wenjing Jia,Guangwei Gao,Guo-Jun Qi,Chia-Wen Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WaveSeg is a novel decoder architecture for semantic segmentation that jointly optimizes feature refinement in spatial and wavelet domains using wavelet frequency priors and Mamba-based attention to enhance boundary details while preserving semantic context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most semantic segmentation networks rely on powerful pretrained encoders but use simplistic decoders, resulting in suboptimal trade-offs between semantic context and fine-grained detail preservation.

Method: Proposes WaveSeg decoder with: 1) Learning high-frequency components as explicit priors for boundary details, 2) Dual Domain Operation (DDO) for multi-scale fusion, 3) Spectrum Decomposition Attention (SDA) block using Mamba's linear-complexity long-range modeling, 4) Reparameterized convolutions to preserve low-frequency semantics, 5) Residual-guided fusion for multi-scale feature integration.

Result: Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show WaveSeg consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches both quantitatively and qualitatively, achieving efficient and precise segmentation.

Conclusion: WaveSeg demonstrates that leveraging wavelet-domain frequency priors with Mamba-based attention enables superior segmentation performance by effectively balancing semantic context and fine-grained detail preservation.

Abstract: While recent semantic segmentation networks heavily rely on powerful
pretrained encoders, most employ simplistic decoders, leading to suboptimal
trade-offs between semantic context and fine-grained detail preservation. To
address this, we propose a novel decoder architecture, WaveSeg, which jointly
optimizes feature refinement in spatial and wavelet domains. Specifically,
high-frequency components are first learned from input images as explicit
priors to reinforce boundary details at early stages. A multi-scale fusion
mechanism, Dual Domain Operation (DDO), is then applied, and the novel Spectrum
Decomposition Attention (SDA) block is proposed, which is developed to leverage
Mamba's linear-complexity long-range modeling to enhance high-frequency
structural details. Meanwhile, reparameterized convolutions are applied to
preserve low-frequency semantic integrity in the wavelet domain. Finally, a
residual-guided fusion integrates multi-scale features with boundary-aware
representations at native resolution, producing semantically and structurally
rich feature maps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate
that WaveSeg, leveraging wavelet-domain frequency prior with Mamba-based
attention, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches both
quantitatively and qualitatively, achieving efficient and precise segmentation.

### [12] [Knowledge-Driven Vision-Language Model for Plexus Detection in Hirschsprung's Disease](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21083)
*Youssef Megahed,Atallah Madi,Dina El Demellawy,Adrian D. C. Chan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel vision-language framework that integrates expert-derived textual concepts using CLIP to guide myenteric plexus classification in Hirschsprung's disease diagnosis, outperforming traditional CNN models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional deep learning approaches for Hirschsprung's disease diagnosis are black boxes that don't align with physician decision-making processes and lack interpretability.

Method: Integrates expert-derived textual concepts from medical sources into a CLIP-based vision-language model, using LLM-generated prompts reviewed by experts and encoded with QuiltNet to align clinical semantics with visual features.

Result: Achieved 83.9% accuracy, 86.6% precision, and 87.6% specificity, outperforming CNN models like VGG-19, ResNet-18, and ResNet-50.

Conclusion: Multi-modal learning with expert knowledge integration shows strong potential for clinically relevant histopathology analysis and more interpretable medical AI systems.

Abstract: Hirschsprung's disease is defined as the congenital absence of ganglion cells
in some segment(s) of the colon. The muscle cannot make coordinated movements
to propel stool in that section, most commonly leading to obstruction. The
diagnosis and treatment for this disease require a clear identification of
different region(s) of the myenteric plexus, where ganglion cells should be
present, on the microscopic view of the tissue slide. While deep learning
approaches, such as Convolutional Neural Networks, have performed very well in
this task, they are often treated as black boxes, with minimal understanding
gained from them, and may not conform to how a physician makes decisions. In
this study, we propose a novel framework that integrates expert-derived textual
concepts into a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training-based vision-language
model to guide plexus classification. Using prompts derived from expert sources
(e.g., medical textbooks and papers) generated by large language models and
reviewed by our team before being encoded with QuiltNet, our approach aligns
clinically relevant semantic cues with visual features. Experimental results
show that the proposed model demonstrated superior discriminative capability
across different classification metrics as it outperformed CNN-based models,
including VGG-19, ResNet-18, and ResNet-50; achieving an accuracy of 83.9%, a
precision of 86.6%, and a specificity of 87.6%. These findings highlight the
potential of multi-modal learning in histopathology and underscore the value of
incorporating expert knowledge for more clinically relevant model outputs.

### [13] [HistRetinex: Optimizing Retinex model in Histogram Domain for Efficient Low-Light Image Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21100)
*Jingtian Zhao,Xueli Xie,Jianxiang Xi,Xiaogang Yang,Haoxuan Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HistRetinex extends Retinex model to histogram domain for fast low-light image enhancement, achieving better results with significant speed improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Retinex-based methods are time-consuming for large-sized images, so the authors aim to develop a faster alternative while maintaining enhancement quality.

Method: Extends Retinex model to histogram domain using histogram location and count matrices, constructs two-level optimization model, and solves for illumination and reflectance histograms through iterative formulas.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in visibility and performance metrics, executes in 1.86 seconds on 1000*664 resolution images (6.67 seconds faster than alternatives).

Conclusion: HistRetinex provides an efficient and effective solution for low-light image enhancement with significant computational advantages over existing methods.

Abstract: Retinex-based low-light image enhancement methods are widely used due to
their excellent performance. However, most of them are time-consuming for
large-sized images. This paper extends the Retinex model from the spatial
domain to the histogram domain, and proposes a novel histogram-based Retinex
model for fast low-light image enhancement, named HistRetinex. Firstly, we
define the histogram location matrix and the histogram count matrix, which
establish the relationship among histograms of the illumination, reflectance
and the low-light image. Secondly, based on the prior information and the
histogram-based Retinex model, we construct a novel two-level optimization
model. Through solving the optimization model, we give the iterative formulas
of the illumination histogram and the reflectance histogram, respectively.
Finally, we enhance the low-light image through matching its histogram with the
one provided by HistRetinex. Experimental results demonstrate that the
HistRetinex outperforms existing enhancement methods in both visibility and
performance metrics, while executing 1.86 seconds on 1000*664 resolution
images, achieving a minimum time saving of 6.67 seconds.

*Weijie Zhou,Xuantang Xiong,Yi Peng,Manli Tao,Chaoyang Zhao,Honghui Dong,Ming Tang,Jinqiao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Active Visual Reasoning (AVR), extending visual reasoning to partially observable environments where agents must actively gather information through physical actions, integrate multi-step observations, and dynamically adjust decisions based on visual feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs are limited to static, fully observable settings, while real-world environments often have incomplete information due to occlusion or limited field of view. Humans actively explore environments through perception-reasoning-action loops, inspiring the need for similar capabilities in AI systems.

Method: Created CLEVR-AVR benchmark for multi-round interactive evaluation, developed AVR-152k dataset with Chain-of-Thought annotations for iterative reasoning, and built PhysVLM-AVR model that operates in higher-order Markov Decision Process for active information acquisition.

Result: PhysVLM-AVR achieves state-of-the-art performance on CLEVR-AVR, embodied reasoning benchmarks (OpenEQA, RoboVQA), and passive visual reasoning tasks (GeoMath, Geometry30K). Analysis shows current embodied MLLMs detect information incompleteness but struggle with active information acquisition and integration.

Conclusion: Active visual reasoning represents a fundamental capability gap in current MLLMs. The proposed AVR framework and PhysVLM-AVR model demonstrate significant advances in enabling agents to actively explore and reason in partially observable environments through closed-loop perception-reasoning-action processes.

Abstract: Visual reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has primarily
been studied in static, fully observable settings, limiting their effectiveness
in real-world environments where information is often incomplete due to
occlusion or limited field of view. Humans, in contrast, actively explore and
interact with their environment-moving, examining, and manipulating objects-to
gather information through a closed-loop process integrating perception,
reasoning, and action. Inspired by this human capability, we introduce the
Active Visual Reasoning (AVR) task, extending visual reasoning to partially
observable, interactive environments. AVR necessitates agents to: (1) actively
acquire information via sequential physical actions, (2) integrate observations
across multiple steps for coherent reasoning, and (3) dynamically adjust
decisions based on evolving visual feedback. To rigorously evaluate AVR, we
introduce CLEVR-AVR, a simulation benchmark featuring multi-round interactive
environments designed to assess both reasoning correctness and
information-gathering efficiency. We present AVR-152k, a large-scale dataset
that offers rich Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations detailing iterative
reasoning for uncertainty identification, action-conditioned information gain
prediction, and information-maximizing action selection, crucial for training
agents in a higher-order Markov Decision Process. Building on this, we develop
PhysVLM-AVR, an MLLM achieving state-of-the-art performance on CLEVR-AVR,
embodied reasoning (OpenEQA, RoboVQA), and passive visual reasoning (GeoMath,
Geometry30K). Our analysis also reveals that current embodied MLLMs, despite
detecting information incompleteness, struggle to actively acquire and
integrate new information through interaction, highlighting a fundamental gap
in active reasoning capabilities.

### [15] [Urban 3D Change Detection Using LiDAR Sensor for HD Map Maintenance and Smart Mobility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21112)
*Hezam Albagami,Haitian Wang,Xinyu Wang,Muhammad Ibrahim,Zainy M. Malakan,Abdullah M. Alqamdi,Mohammed H. Alghamdi,Ajmal Mian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An object-centric, uncertainty-aware pipeline for 3D city change detection using bi-temporal LiDAR data that handles registration errors, surface roughness, and object splits/merges while maintaining class consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D city change detection are sensitive to alignment errors, degrade thin structures, ignore uncertainty, and fail to handle object splits/merges properly, limiting their practical application in HD map maintenance and smart city applications.

Method: Multi-resolution NDT alignment followed by point-to-plane ICP, height normalization, uncertainty modeling from registration covariance and surface roughness, geometry-based cross-epoch associations refined by semantic/instance segmentation, and class-constrained bipartite assignment with dummy augmentation for splits/merges.

Result: Achieved 95.2% accuracy, 90.4% mF1, and 82.6% mIoU on 15 Subiaco blocks, outperforming Triplet KPConv with largest gains on 'Decreased' category where IoU improved by 7.6 points to 74.8%.

Conclusion: The proposed uncertainty-aware, object-centric approach effectively handles registration errors, sampling variations, and complex object relationships while maintaining high accuracy and robustness for city-scale LiDAR change detection.

Abstract: High-definition 3D city maps underpin smart transportation, digital twins,
and autonomous driving, where object level change detection across bi temporal
LiDAR enables HD map maintenance, construction monitoring, and reliable
localization. Classical DSM differencing and image based methods are sensitive
to small vertical bias, ground slope, and viewpoint mismatch and yield cellwise
outputs without object identity. Point based neural models and voxel encodings
demand large memory, assume near perfect pre alignment, degrade thin
structures, and seldom enforce class consistent association, which leaves split
or merge cases unresolved and ignores uncertainty. We propose an object
centric, uncertainty aware pipeline for city scale LiDAR that aligns epochs
with multi resolution NDT followed by point to plane ICP, normalizes height,
and derives a per location level of detection from registration covariance and
surface roughness to calibrate decisions and suppress spurious changes.
Geometry only proxies seed cross epoch associations that are refined by
semantic and instance segmentation and a class constrained bipartite assignment
with augmented dummies to handle splits and merges while preserving per class
counts. Tiled processing bounds memory without eroding narrow ground changes,
and instance level decisions combine 3D overlap, normal direction displacement,
and height and volume differences with a histogram distance, all gated by the
local level of detection to remain stable under partial overlap and sampling
variation. On 15 representative Subiaco blocks the method attains 95.2%
accuracy, 90.4% mF1, and 82.6% mIoU, exceeding Triplet KPConv by 0.2 percentage
points in accuracy, 0.2 in mF1, and 0.8 in mIoU, with the largest gain on
Decreased where IoU reaches 74.8% and improves by 7.6 points.

*Yanguang Sun,Jiawei Lian,Jian Yang,Lei Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Controllable-LPMoE is a novel fine-tuning paradigm that uses dynamic local priors to efficiently adapt large foundation models for object segmentation tasks with fewer trainable parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Full-parameter fine-tuning of large foundation models is computationally expensive, and existing prompt-based methods lack semantic priors, limiting model adaptability.

Method: Uses a lightweight dynamic mixed local priors extractor with heterogeneous convolutions and gating network, plus a bi-directional interaction adapter with cosine-aligned deformable attention and channel-oriented adaptive scale enhancement.

Result: Superior segmentation performance compared to 31 state-of-the-art methods, with adaptability to multiple binary object segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: Controllable-LPMoE provides an efficient fine-tuning approach that enhances fine-grained perception while significantly reducing computational overhead.

Abstract: Large-scale foundation models provide powerful feature representations for
downstream object segmentation tasks. However, when adapted to specific tasks
through the full-parameter fine-tuning, the enormous parameters being updated
often results in significant computational overhead, creating a bottleneck in
training efficiency. Although existing methods attempt to fine-tune frozen
models by directly embedding trainable prompts, these prompts lack inherent
semantic priors, limiting the adaptability of large-scale models. In this
paper, we propose a novel dynamic priors-based fine-tuning paradigm with fewer
trainable parameters, dubbed Controllable-LPMoE, which adaptively modulates
frozen foundation models by dynamically controlling local priors to enhance
fine-grained perception for specific segmentation tasks. More specifically, we
construct a lightweight dynamic mixed local priors extractor that captures
diverse local priors from input images through heterogeneous convolutions while
employing a gating network to dynamically output expert priors required for the
subsequent fine-tuning. Furthermore, we design a bi-directional interaction
adapter that employs cosine-aligned deformable attention and channel-oriented
adaptive scale enhancement to interact and restructure between frozen and
trainable features, achieving efficient fine-tuning. Extensive experiments
validate the superiority of our
\href{https://github.com/CSYSI/Controllable-LPMoE} {Controllable-LPMoE}
approach, demonstrating excellent segmentation performance compared to 31
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and adaptability to multiple binary object
segmentation tasks.

*Alec Helbling,Shruti Palaskar,Kundan Krishna,Polo Chau,Leon Gatys,Joseph Yitan Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SafetyPairs is a framework for generating counterfactual image pairs that differ only in safety-relevant features, enabling fine-grained analysis of image safety distinctions and improving model evaluation and training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image safety datasets are coarse and ambiguous, lacking isolation of specific features that determine safety. Subtle changes like gestures or symbols can drastically alter safety implications, but current approaches don't systematically address these fine-grained differences.

Method: Leverage image editing models to create counterfactual pairs of images that differ only in safety-relevant features while keeping safety-irrelevant details unchanged. This generates pairs where one image is safe and the other problematic, flipping safety labels based on targeted modifications.

Result: Created a benchmark with over 3,020 SafetyPair images across 9 safety categories. The framework serves as effective evaluation data that reveals weaknesses in vision-language models' ability to distinguish subtle safety differences, and improves sample efficiency for training lightweight guard models through data augmentation.

Conclusion: SafetyPairs provides the first systematic resource for studying fine-grained image safety distinctions, enabling better model evaluation and more efficient training of safety classifiers through targeted counterfactual data generation.

Abstract: What exactly makes a particular image unsafe? Systematically differentiating
between benign and problematic images is a challenging problem, as subtle
changes to an image, such as an insulting gesture or symbol, can drastically
alter its safety implications. However, existing image safety datasets are
coarse and ambiguous, offering only broad safety labels without isolating the
specific features that drive these differences. We introduce SafetyPairs, a
scalable framework for generating counterfactual pairs of images, that differ
only in the features relevant to the given safety policy, thus flipping their
safety label. By leveraging image editing models, we make targeted changes to
images that alter their safety labels while leaving safety-irrelevant details
unchanged. Using SafetyPairs, we construct a new safety benchmark, which serves
as a powerful source of evaluation data that highlights weaknesses in
vision-language models' abilities to distinguish between subtly different
images. Beyond evaluation, we find our pipeline serves as an effective data
augmentation strategy that improves the sample efficiency of training
lightweight guard models. We release a benchmark containing over 3,020
SafetyPair images spanning a diverse taxonomy of 9 safety categories, providing
the first systematic resource for studying fine-grained image safety
distinctions.

*Longtian Qiu,Shan Ning,Jiaxuan Sun,Xuming He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NoisyGRPO is a multimodal RL framework that improves Chain-of-Thought reasoning in MLLMs by injecting noise into visual inputs for better exploration and using Bayesian advantage estimation for more robust training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL frameworks for improving general CoT reasoning in MLLMs struggle with generalization beyond training distributions, limiting their effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

Method: Proposes NoisyGRPO with two key components: (1) Noise-Injected Exploration Policy that perturbs visual inputs with Gaussian noise, and (2) Bayesian Advantage Estimation that formulates advantage estimation as Bayesian inference using noise level as prior and trajectory reward as likelihood.

Result: Experiments show NoisyGRPO substantially improves generalization and robustness on CoT quality, general capability, and hallucination benchmarks, particularly effective with small-scale MLLMs like Qwen2.5-VL 3B.

Conclusion: NoisyGRPO provides a systematic multimodal RL framework that enhances MLLMs' CoT reasoning capabilities through controlled noise injection and principled Bayesian modeling, leading to better generalization and robustness.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in enhancing the general
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). However, when applied to improve general CoT reasoning,
existing RL frameworks often struggle to generalize beyond the training
distribution. To address this, we propose NoisyGRPO, a systematic multimodal RL
framework that introduces controllable noise into visual inputs for enhanced
exploration and explicitly models the advantage estimation process via a
Bayesian framework. Specifically, NoisyGRPO improves RL training by: (1)
\textbf{Noise-Injected Exploration Policy}: Perturbing visual inputs with
Gaussian noise to encourage exploration across a wider range of visual
scenarios; and (2) \textbf{Bayesian Advantage Estimation}: Formulating
advantage estimation as a principled Bayesian inference problem, where the
injected noise level serves as a prior and the observed trajectory reward as
the likelihood. This Bayesian modeling fuses both sources of information to
compute a robust posterior estimate of trajectory advantage, effectively
guiding MLLMs to prefer visually grounded trajectories over noisy ones.
Experiments on standard CoT quality, general capability, and hallucination
benchmarks demonstrate that NoisyGRPO substantially improves generalization and
robustness, especially in RL settings with small-scale MLLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL
3B. The project page is available at

*Ying Ming,Yue Lin,Longfei Zhao,Gengwan Li,Zuopeng Tan,Bing Li,Sheng Xie,Wei Song,Qiqi Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method to generate Digital Contrast CTPA from Non-Contrast CT scans using CycleGAN, reducing risks of contrast agents while maintaining diagnostic quality for pulmonary vascular diseases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CTPA requires iodinated contrast agents that pose nephrotoxicity and allergic reaction risks, especially in high-risk patients. Need for safer alternatives.

Method: Cascaded synthesizer based on Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Networks (CycleGAN) trained on 410 paired CTPA and NCCT scans from three centers.

Result: Achieved best performance with MAE: 165.12, PSNR: 20.27, SSIM: 0.98 on test set. Improved pulmonary vessel segmentation (Dice: 0.70) and vascular quantification (ICC: 0.81 vs 0.70).

Conclusion: The proposed DCCTPA method effectively enhances vascular structures without contrast agents, showing superior performance in downstream clinical tasks compared to NCCT.

Abstract: Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) is the reference standard
for diagnosing pulmonary vascular diseases such as Pulmonary Embolism (PE) and
Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension (CTEPH). However, its reliance on
iodinated contrast agents poses risks including nephrotoxicity and allergic
reactions, particularly in high-risk patients. This study proposes a method to
generate Digital Contrast CTPA (DCCTPA) from Non-Contrast CT (NCCT) scans using
a cascaded synthesizer based on Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial
Networks (CycleGAN). Totally retrospective 410 paired CTPA and NCCT scans were
obtained from three centers. The model was trained and validated internally on
249 paired images. Extra dataset that comprising 161 paired images was as test
set for model generalization evaluation and downstream clinical tasks
validation. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, the proposed method
achieved the best comprehensive performance by evaluating quantitative metrics
(For validation, MAE: 156.28, PSNR: 20.71 and SSIM: 0.98; For test, MAE:
165.12, PSNR: 20.27 and SSIM: 0.98) and qualitative visualization,
demonstrating valid vessel enhancement, superior image fidelity and structural
preservation. The approach was further applied to downstream tasks of pulmonary
vessel segmentation and vascular quantification. On the test set, the average
Dice, clDice, and clRecall of artery and vein pulmonary segmentation was 0.70,
0.71, 0.73 and 0.70, 0.72, 0.75 respectively, all markedly improved compared
with NCCT inputs.\@ Inter-class Correlation Coefficient (ICC) for vessel volume
between DCCTPA and CTPA was significantly better than that between NCCT and
CTPA (Average ICC : 0.81 vs 0.70), indicating effective vascular enhancement in
DCCTPA, especially for small vessels.

TL;DR: SIG (Spatial Intelligence Grid) is a grid-based schema that explicitly encodes spatial layouts and relations to better evaluate and enhance visual-spatial intelligence in foundation models, addressing limitations of text-only approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods proxy Visual-Spatial Intelligence (VSI) with text-only prompts and VQA-style scoring, which obscures geometry, invites linguistic shortcuts, and weakens attribution to genuinely spatial skills.

Method: Introduces SIG: a structured grid-based schema that encodes object layouts, inter-object relations, and physically grounded priors as a complementary channel to text. Also develops SIG-informed evaluation metrics and releases SIGBench benchmark with 1.4K driving frames.

Result: In few-shot learning with state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs, SIG yields consistently larger, more stable, and more comprehensive gains across all VSI metrics compared to VQA-only representations.

Conclusion: SIG shows promise as a data-labeling and training schema for learning VSI, providing a faithful, compositional representation of scene structure for foundation-model reasoning.

Abstract: How to integrate and verify spatial intelligence in foundation models remains
an open challenge. Current practice often proxies Visual-Spatial Intelligence
(VSI) with purely textual prompts and VQA-style scoring, which obscures
geometry, invites linguistic shortcuts, and weakens attribution to genuinely
spatial skills. We introduce Spatial Intelligence Grid (SIG): a structured,
grid-based schema that explicitly encodes object layouts, inter-object
relations, and physically grounded priors. As a complementary channel to text,
SIG provides a faithful, compositional representation of scene structure for
foundation-model reasoning. Building on SIG, we derive SIG-informed evaluation
metrics that quantify a model's intrinsic VSI, which separates spatial
capability from language priors. In few-shot in-context learning with
state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs (e.g. GPT- and Gemini-family models), SIG
yields consistently larger, more stable, and more comprehensive gains across
all VSI metrics compared to VQA-only representations, indicating its promise as
a data-labeling and training schema for learning VSI. We also release SIGBench,
a benchmark of 1.4K driving frames annotated with ground-truth SIG labels and
human gaze traces, supporting both grid-based machine VSI tasks and
attention-driven, human-like VSI tasks in autonomous-driving scenarios.

*Dogyun Park,Taehoon Lee,Minseok Joo,Hyunwoo J. Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Blockwise Flow Matching (BFM) partitions the generative trajectory into temporal segments with specialized velocity blocks, improving efficiency and quality through semantic feature guidance and feature residual approximation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Flow Matching models use a single large network for the entire generative trajectory, which struggles to capture distinct signal characteristics across timesteps and incurs high inference costs due to iterative evaluation.

Method: BFM divides the generative trajectory into multiple temporal segments, each handled by smaller specialized velocity blocks. It includes Semantic Feature Guidance to condition blocks on pretrained representations and Feature Residual Approximation to reduce inference cost while preserving quality.

Result: Extensive experiments on ImageNet 256x256 show BFM establishes a substantially improved Pareto frontier over existing Flow Matching methods, achieving 2.1x to 4.9x accelerations in inference complexity at comparable generation performance.

Conclusion: BFM provides an efficient and high-quality alternative to standard Flow Matching by leveraging specialized blocks and semantic guidance, significantly reducing inference costs while maintaining generation quality.

Abstract: Recently, Flow Matching models have pushed the boundaries of high-fidelity
data generation across a wide range of domains. It typically employs a single
large network to learn the entire generative trajectory from noise to data.
Despite their effectiveness, this design struggles to capture distinct signal
characteristics across timesteps simultaneously and incurs substantial
inference costs due to the iterative evaluation of the entire model. To address
these limitations, we propose Blockwise Flow Matching (BFM), a novel framework
that partitions the generative trajectory into multiple temporal segments, each
modeled by smaller but specialized velocity blocks. This blockwise design
enables each block to specialize effectively in its designated interval,
improving inference efficiency and sample quality. To further enhance
generation fidelity, we introduce a Semantic Feature Guidance module that
explicitly conditions velocity blocks on semantically rich features aligned
with pretrained representations. Additionally, we propose a lightweight Feature
Residual Approximation strategy that preserves semantic quality while
significantly reducing inference cost. Extensive experiments on ImageNet
256x256 demonstrate that BFM establishes a substantially improved Pareto
frontier over existing Flow Matching methods, achieving 2.1x to 4.9x
accelerations in inference complexity at comparable generation performance.

*Qihang Zhou,Binbin Gao,Guansong Pang,Xin Wang,Jiming Chen,Shibo He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TokenCLIP is a token-wise adaptation framework that enables dynamic alignment between visual and learnable textual spaces for fine-grained anomaly detection, addressing limitations of single textual space alignment in existing CLIP-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CLIP-based anomaly detection methods rely on a single textual space to align with visual semantics, which hinders accurate capture of varied anomaly semantics across diverse objects and domains.

Method: TokenCLIP expands token-agnostic textual space into orthogonal subspaces and dynamically assigns each visual token to subspace combinations based on semantic affinity via optimal transport, with top-k masking to sparsify the plan and specialize subspaces.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of TokenCLIP over existing methods for anomaly detection on unseen objects.

Conclusion: The proposed token-wise adaptation framework with dynamic alignment enables more accurate and fine-grained anomaly learning compared to single textual space approaches.

Abstract: Adapting CLIP for anomaly detection on unseen objects has shown strong
potential in a zero-shot manner. However, existing methods typically rely on a
single textual space to align with visual semantics across diverse objects and
domains. The indiscriminate alignment hinders the model from accurately
capturing varied anomaly semantics. We propose TokenCLIP, a token-wise
adaptation framework that enables dynamic alignment between visual and
learnable textual spaces for fine-grained anomaly learning. Rather than mapping
all visual tokens to a single, token-agnostic textual space, TokenCLIP aligns
each token with a customized textual subspace that represents its visual
characteristics. Explicitly assigning a unique learnable textual space to each
token is computationally intractable and prone to insufficient optimization. We
instead expand the token-agnostic textual space into a set of orthogonal
subspaces, and then dynamically assign each token to a subspace combination
guided by semantic affinity, which jointly supports customized and efficient
token-wise adaptation. To this end, we formulate dynamic alignment as an
optimal transport problem, where all visual tokens in an image are transported
to textual subspaces based on semantic similarity. The transport constraints of
OT ensure sufficient optimization across subspaces and encourage them to focus
on different semantics. Solving the problem yields a transport plan that
adaptively assigns each token to semantically relevant subspaces. A top-k
masking is then applied to sparsify the plan and specialize subspaces for
distinct visual regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
TokenCLIP.

TL;DR: KBE is a dynamic multimodal evaluation framework that transforms static VQA benchmarks into evolving versions using graph formulation and knowledge integration to address data contamination and saturation issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing static benchmarks for multimodal LLMs suffer from data contamination and saturation, leading to unreliable performance evaluations.

Method: Uses graph formulation to represent VQA samples, then expands static benchmarks by integrating multimodal knowledge through visual information re-selection and external textual knowledge expansion.

Result: KBE enables difficulty-controllable evaluation and provides more comprehensive assessment of MLLM capabilities while alleviating data contamination and saturation risks.

Conclusion: KBE offers a dynamic, evolving evaluation framework that better assesses multimodal LLM capabilities compared to static benchmarks.

Abstract: The rapid progress of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) calls for more
reliable evaluation protocols. Existing static benchmarks suffer from the
potential risk of data contamination and saturation, leading to inflated or
misleading performance evaluations. To address these issues, we first apply
Graph formulation to represent a static or dynamic VQA sample. With the
formulation, we propose Knowledge-enhanced Benchmark Evolution(KBE), a dynamic
multimodal evaluation framework. KBE first analyzes the original static
benchmark, then expands it by integrating multimodal knowledge, transforming
the static benchmark into a controllable, dynamic evolving version. Crucially,
KBE can both reconstruct questions by Re-selecting visual information in the
original image and expand existing questions with external textual knowledge.
It enables difficulty-controllable evaluation by adjusting the degree of
question exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KBE alleviates the
risk of data contamination, data saturation, and provides a more comprehensive
assessment of MLLM capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces iSM, a unified training framework that addresses five core limitations of shortcut models to improve their performance in generative modeling across one-step, few-step, and multi-step sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shortcut models have promising non-adversarial generative capabilities but face critical performance bottlenecks including compounding guidance artifacts, inflexible fixed guidance, frequency bias, divergent self-consistency, and curvy flow trajectories that hinder widespread adoption.

Method: The iSM framework includes four key improvements: Intrinsic Guidance for dynamic control over guidance strength, Multi-Level Wavelet Loss to mitigate frequency bias, Scaling Optimal Transport (sOT) to reduce training variance and learn straighter paths, and Twin EMA strategy to reconcile training stability with self-consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments on ImageNet 256×256 demonstrate substantial FID improvements over baseline shortcut models across all sampling modes (one-step, few-step, multi-step), making shortcut models viable and competitive.

Conclusion: The proposed iSM framework systematically resolves the core limitations of shortcut models, enabling them to become a practical and competitive class of generative models with improved performance across different sampling strategies.

Abstract: Shortcut models represent a promising, non-adversarial paradigm for
generative modeling, uniquely supporting one-step, few-step, and multi-step
sampling from a single trained network. However, their widespread adoption has
been stymied by critical performance bottlenecks. This paper tackles the five
core issues that held shortcut models back: (1) the hidden flaw of compounding
guidance, which we are the first to formalize, causing severe image artifacts;
(2) inflexible fixed guidance that restricts inference-time control; (3) a
pervasive frequency bias driven by a reliance on low-level distances in the
direct domain, which biases reconstructions toward low frequencies; (4)
divergent self-consistency arising from a conflict with EMA training; and (5)
curvy flow trajectories that impede convergence. To address these challenges,
we introduce iSM, a unified training framework that systematically resolves
each limitation. Our framework is built on four key improvements: Intrinsic
Guidance provides explicit, dynamic control over guidance strength, resolving
both compounding guidance and inflexibility. A Multi-Level Wavelet Loss
mitigates frequency bias to restore high-frequency details. Scaling Optimal
Transport (sOT) reduces training variance and learns straighter, more stable
generative paths. Finally, a Twin EMA strategy reconciles training stability
with self-consistency. Extensive experiments on ImageNet 256 x 256 demonstrate
that our approach yields substantial FID improvements over baseline shortcut
models across one-step, few-step, and multi-step generation, making shortcut
models a viable and competitive class of generative models.

Method: Three key innovations: 1) Decoupled Training and Hybrid Inference separating topology sculpting and shape refinement stages; 2) Improved Hourglass Architecture with bidirectional attention and rotational positional embeddings; 3) Novel Connection Loss for topological constraints.

Result: TSSR generates high-quality 3D artist-style meshes capable of achieving up to 10,000 faces at remarkable spatial resolution of 1024^3, demonstrating superior performance on complex datasets.

Conclusion: TSSR successfully enables parallel generation of high-quality 3D meshes through discrete diffusion models, with the code being publicly released for further research and application.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Topology Sculptor, Shape Refiner (TSSR), a novel
method for generating high-quality, artist-style 3D meshes based on Discrete
Diffusion Models (DDMs). Our primary motivation for TSSR is to achieve highly
accurate token prediction while enabling parallel generation, a significant
advantage over sequential autoregressive methods. By allowing TSSR to "see" all
mesh tokens concurrently, we unlock a new level of efficiency and control. We
leverage this parallel generation capability through three key innovations: 1)
Decoupled Training and Hybrid Inference, which distinctly separates the
DDM-based generation into a topology sculpting stage and a subsequent shape
refinement stage. This strategic decoupling enables TSSR to effectively capture
both intricate local topology and overarching global shape. 2) An Improved
Hourglass Architecture, featuring bidirectional attention enriched by
face-vertex-sequence level Rotational Positional Embeddings (RoPE), thereby
capturing richer contextual information across the mesh structure. 3) A novel
Connection Loss, which acts as a topological constraint to further enhance the
realism and fidelity of the generated meshes. Extensive experiments on complex
datasets demonstrate that TSSR generates high-quality 3D artist-style meshes,
capable of achieving up to 10,000 faces at a remarkable spatial resolution of
$1024^3$. The code will be released at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAGE-3D upgrades 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with object-level semantics and physics for Visual-Language Navigation, creating executable environments that improve VLN performance by 31% on unseen tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS provides photorealistic rendering but lacks fine-grained semantics and physical executability needed for Visual-Language Navigation, creating a gap between simulation and reality.

Method: Two components: (1) Object-Centric Semantic Grounding adds object-level annotations to 3DGS; (2) Physics-Aware Execution Jointing embeds collision objects and constructs physical interfaces. Also creates InteriorGS dataset and SAGE-Bench benchmark.

Result: 3DGS scene data is more difficult to converge but exhibits strong generalizability, improving baseline performance by 31% on VLN-CE Unseen task. Created 1K object-annotated 3DGS scenes and 2M VLN data benchmark.

Conclusion: SAGE-3D successfully bridges the sim-to-real gap by making 3DGS semantically and physically executable for VLN, demonstrating improved performance and generalizability while providing new datasets and benchmarks.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a 3D representation method with photorealistic
real-time rendering capabilities, is regarded as an effective tool for
narrowing the sim-to-real gap. However, it lacks fine-grained semantics and
physical executability for Visual-Language Navigation (VLN). To address this,
we propose SAGE-3D (Semantically and Physically Aligned Gaussian Environments
for 3D Navigation), a new paradigm that upgrades 3DGS into an executable,
semantically and physically aligned environment. It comprises two components:
(1) Object-Centric Semantic Grounding, which adds object-level fine-grained
annotations to 3DGS; and (2) Physics-Aware Execution Jointing, which embeds
collision objects into 3DGS and constructs rich physical interfaces. We release
InteriorGS, containing 1K object-annotated 3DGS indoor scene data, and
introduce SAGE-Bench, the first 3DGS-based VLN benchmark with 2M VLN data.
Experiments show that 3DGS scene data is more difficult to converge, while
exhibiting strong generalizability, improving baseline performance by 31% on
the VLN-CE Unseen task. The data and code will be available soon.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FineRS is a two-stage MLLM framework using reinforcement learning for joint reasoning and segmentation of extremely small objects in high-resolution images, addressing limitations of current MLLMs in handling fine visual details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs struggle with precisely understanding and localizing visual details in high-resolution images, especially for extra-small objects in cluttered contexts due to restricted input resolutions.

Method: Two-stage coarse-to-fine pipeline: Global Semantic Exploration (GSE) for instruction-guided reasoning and coarse region generation, and Localized Perceptual Refinement (LPR) for accurate bounding box and segmentation mask refinement. Uses locate-informed retrospective reward to couple stages.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art MLLM-based approaches on both instruction-guided segmentation and visual reasoning tasks on FineRS-4k and public datasets.

Conclusion: FineRS effectively addresses the challenge of handling extremely small objects in high-resolution scenes through its two-stage reinforcement learning framework, demonstrating superior performance in both reasoning and segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities
across a wide range of vision-language tasks. However, due to the restricted
input resolutions, MLLMs face significant challenges in precisely understanding
and localizing visual details in high-resolution images -- particularly when
dealing with extra-small objects embedded in cluttered contexts. To address
this issue, we propose \textsc{FineRS}, a two-stage MLLM-based reinforcement
learning framework for jointly reasoning and segmenting extremely small objects
within high-resolution scenes. \textsc{FineRS} adopts a coarse-to-fine pipeline
comprising Global Semantic Exploration (GSE) and Localized Perceptual
Refinement (LPR). Specifically, GSE performs instruction-guided reasoning to
generate a textural response and a coarse target region, while LPR refines this
region to produce an accurate bounding box and segmentation mask. To couple the
two stages, we introduce a locate-informed retrospective reward, where LPR's
outputs are used to optimize GSE for more robust coarse region exploration. %
Additionally, we present \textsc{FineRS}-4k, a new dataset for evaluating MLLMs
on attribute-level reasoning and pixel-level segmentation on subtle,
small-scale targets in complex high-resolution scenes. Experimental results on
\textsc{FineRS}-4k and public datasets demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art MLLM-based approaches on both instruction-guided
segmentation and visual reasoning tasks.

*Shufan Shen,Junshu Sun,Qingming Huang,Shuhui Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VL-SAE is a sparse autoencoder that interprets vision-language representations by mapping them to unified concepts, enabling both interpretation and enhancement of vision-language alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The interpretability of vision-language alignment remains uninvestigated due to difficulty in mapping multi-modal representations to unified concepts.

Method: VL-SAE uses a sparse autoencoder with distance-based encoder and modality-specific decoders to establish neuron-concept correlations through consistent activations for semantically similar representations.

Result: VL-SAE successfully interprets vision-language alignment by comparing semantics with concepts and enhances alignment at concept level, improving performance in zero-shot classification and hallucination elimination.

Conclusion: VL-SAE provides an effective framework for interpreting and enhancing vision-language representations through unified concept mapping, benefiting downstream tasks.

Abstract: The alignment of vision-language representations endows current
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with strong multi-modal reasoning capabilities.
However, the interpretability of the alignment component remains uninvestigated
due to the difficulty in mapping the semantics of multi-modal representations
into a unified concept set. To address this problem, we propose VL-SAE, a
sparse autoencoder that encodes vision-language representations into its hidden
activations. Each neuron in its hidden layer correlates to a concept
represented by semantically similar images and texts, thereby interpreting
these representations with a unified concept set. To establish the
neuron-concept correlation, we encourage semantically similar representations
to exhibit consistent neuron activations during self-supervised training.
First, to measure the semantic similarity of multi-modal representations, we
perform their alignment in an explicit form based on cosine similarity. Second,
we construct the VL-SAE with a distance-based encoder and two modality-specific
decoders to ensure the activation consistency of semantically similar
representations. Experiments across multiple VLMs (e.g., CLIP, LLaVA)
demonstrate the superior capability of VL-SAE in interpreting and enhancing the
vision-language alignment. For interpretation, the alignment between vision and
language representations can be understood by comparing their semantics with
concepts. For enhancement, the alignment can be strengthened by aligning
vision-language representations at the concept level, contributing to
performance improvements in downstream tasks, including zero-shot image
classification and hallucination elimination. Codes are available at

*Reed Naidoo,Matt De Vries,Olga Fourkioti,Vicky Bousgouni,Mar Arias-Garcia,Maria Portillo-Malumbres,Chris Bakal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FORM is a machine learning framework that predicts 3D cellular structure changes in response to perturbations, overcoming limitations of 2D models through a morphology encoder and diffusion-based trajectory module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current computational models are limited to 2D representations, which cannot capture the complexity of 3D cell morphology under perturbation, creating a bottleneck for accurate virtual cell development.

Method: FORM uses a morphology encoder trained via multi-channel VQGAN to learn 3D cell shape representations, combined with a diffusion-based perturbation trajectory module that models morphology evolution across conditions.

Result: Trained on 65,000+ 3D cell volumes, FORM enables unconditional morphology synthesis, conditional simulation of perturbed states, prediction of signaling activity, and modeling of combinatorial perturbation effects.

Conclusion: FORM and the accompanying MorphoEval benchmark advance toward realizing 3D virtual cells by linking morphology, perturbation, and function through high-resolution predictive simulation.

Abstract: Understanding how cells respond to external stimuli is a central challenge in
biomedical research and drug development. Current computational frameworks for
modelling cellular responses remain restricted to two-dimensional
representations, limiting their capacity to capture the complexity of cell
morphology under perturbation. This dimensional constraint poses a critical
bottleneck for the development of accurate virtual cell models. Here, we
present FORM, a machine learning framework for predicting perturbation-induced
changes in three-dimensional cellular structure. FORM consists of two
components: a morphology encoder, trained end-to-end via a novel multi-channel
VQGAN to learn compact 3D representations of cell shape, and a diffusion-based
perturbation trajectory module that captures how morphology evolves across
perturbation conditions. Trained on a large-scale dataset of over 65,000
multi-fluorescence 3D cell volumes spanning diverse chemical and genetic
perturbations, FORM supports both unconditional morphology synthesis and
conditional simulation of perturbed cell states. Beyond generation, FORM can
predict downstream signalling activity, simulate combinatorial perturbation
effects, and model morphodynamic transitions between states of unseen
perturbations. To evaluate performance, we introduce MorphoEval, a benchmarking
suite that quantifies perturbation-induced morphological changes in structural,
statistical, and biological dimensions. Together, FORM and MorphoEval work
toward the realisation of the 3D virtual cell by linking morphology,
perturbation, and function through high-resolution predictive simulation.

*Lemin Liu,Fangchao Hu,Honghua Jiang,Yaru Chen,Limin Liu,Yongliang Qiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CT-CLIP is a multi-branch framework combining CNN, Transformer, and CLIP for apple leaf disease recognition, achieving high accuracy by fusing local and global features and using multimodal learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multi-scale feature fusion methods fail to adequately handle the phenotypic heterogeneity of apple leaf diseases and the relationships between local and global features in complex orchard environments.

Method: Proposes CNN-Transformer-CLIP (CT-CLIP) framework with CNN for local lesion details, Vision Transformer for global structural relationships, Adaptive Feature Fusion Module for dynamic fusion, and multimodal image-text learning using pre-trained CLIP weights.

Result: Achieves 97.38% accuracy on public dataset and 96.12% on self-built dataset, outperforming baseline methods and showing strong performance under few-shot conditions.

Conclusion: CT-CLIP demonstrates strong capabilities in agricultural disease recognition, enhances accuracy in complex environments, and provides an innovative solution for automated disease recognition in agriculture.

Abstract: In complex orchard environments, the phenotypic heterogeneity of different
apple leaf diseases, characterized by significant variation among lesions,
poses a challenge to traditional multi-scale feature fusion methods. These
methods only integrate multi-layer features extracted by convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) and fail to adequately account for the relationships between
local and global features. Therefore, this study proposes a multi-branch
recognition framework named CNN-Transformer-CLIP (CT-CLIP). The framework
synergistically employs a CNN to extract local lesion detail features and a
Vision Transformer to capture global structural relationships. An Adaptive
Feature Fusion Module (AFFM) then dynamically fuses these features, achieving
optimal coupling of local and global information and effectively addressing the
diversity in lesion morphology and distribution. Additionally, to mitigate
interference from complex backgrounds and significantly enhance recognition
accuracy under few-shot conditions, this study proposes a multimodal image-text
learning approach. By leveraging pre-trained CLIP weights, it achieves deep
alignment between visual features and disease semantic descriptions.
Experimental results show that CT-CLIP achieves accuracies of 97.38% and 96.12%
on a publicly available apple disease and a self-built dataset, outperforming
several baseline methods. The proposed CT-CLIP demonstrates strong capabilities
in recognizing agricultural diseases, significantly enhances identification
accuracy under complex environmental conditions, provides an innovative and
practical solution for automated disease recognition in agricultural
applications.

*Xinyu Zhou,Tongxin Pan,Lingyi Hong,Pinxue Guo,Haijing Guo,Zhaoyu Chen,Kaixun Jiang,Wenqiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dynamic semantic aware correlation modeling framework for UAV tracking that improves accuracy and robustness under challenges like camera motion and fast motion, with multiple model variants for speed-accuracy trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UAV tracking methods focus on speed but lack semantic awareness, leading to suboptimal performance under challenges like camera motion, fast motion, and low resolution.

Method: Proposes a Dynamic Semantic Relevance Generator combined with correlation maps from Transformer to explore semantic relevance, enhancing search region's ability to extract important information from templates. Also includes a pruning method for speed optimization.

Result: Achieves competitive performance on multiple UAV tracking datasets, with multiple model variants providing flexible speed-accuracy trade-offs.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses semantic awareness limitations in UAV tracking, improving accuracy and robustness while maintaining speed flexibility through model variants.

Abstract: UAV tracking can be widely applied in scenarios such as disaster rescue,
environmental monitoring, and logistics transportation. However, existing UAV
tracking methods predominantly emphasize speed and lack exploration in semantic
awareness, which hinders the search region from extracting accurate
localization information from the template. The limitation results in
suboptimal performance under typical UAV tracking challenges such as camera
motion, fast motion, and low resolution, etc. To address this issue, we propose
a dynamic semantic aware correlation modeling tracking framework. The core of
our framework is a Dynamic Semantic Relevance Generator, which, in combination
with the correlation map from the Transformer, explore semantic relevance. The
approach enhances the search region's ability to extract important information
from the template, improving accuracy and robustness under the aforementioned
challenges. Additionally, to enhance the tracking speed, we design a pruning
method for the proposed framework. Therefore, we present multiple model
variants that achieve trade-offs between speed and accuracy, enabling flexible
deployment according to the available computational resources. Experimental
results validate the effectiveness of our method, achieving competitive
performance on multiple UAV tracking datasets. The code is available at

### [34] [Gaze-VLM:Bridging Gaze and VLMs through Attention Regularization for Egocentric Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21356)
*Anupam Pani,Yanchao Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A gaze-regularized framework that enhances Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for egocentric understanding tasks using gaze only during training, improving prediction accuracy without requiring gaze input during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Eye gaze provides valuable cues about attention and future actions, making it powerful for modeling egocentric behavior, but prior approaches either ignore gaze or use it as direct input rather than for training regularization.

Method: Introduces gaze-regularized attention mechanism that aligns model focus with human visual gaze during training, designed to be flexible and modular across VLM architectures that use attention.

Result: Improves semantic prediction scores by up to 11% for future event prediction and around 7% for current activity understanding compared to baseline models trained without gaze regularization.

Conclusion: Gaze-guided training significantly improves accuracy and robustness of egocentric VLMs, establishing foundation for using human gaze to enhance predictive capabilities in real-world applications like assistive robots and human-machine collaboration.

Abstract: Eye gaze offers valuable cues about attention, short-term intent, and future
actions, making it a powerful signal for modeling egocentric behavior. In this
work, we propose a gaze-regularized framework that enhances VLMs for two key
egocentric understanding tasks: fine-grained future event prediction and
current activity understanding. Unlike prior approaches that rely solely on
visual inputs or use gaze as an auxiliary input signal , our method uses gaze
only during training. We introduce a gaze-regularized attention mechanism that
aligns model focus with human visual gaze. This design is flexible and modular,
allowing it to generalize across multiple VLM architectures that utilize
attention. Experimental results show that our approach improves semantic
prediction scores by up to 11 for future event prediction and around 7 for
current activity understanding, compared to the corresponding baseline models
trained without gaze regularization. These results highlight the value of
gaze-guided training in improving the accuracy and robustness of egocentric
VLMs. Overall, this work establishes a foundation for using human gaze to
enhance the predictive capabilities of VLMs in real-world scenarios like
assistive robots and human-machine collaboration. Code and additional

### [35] [Why Registration Quality Matters: Enhancing sCT Synthesis with IMPACT-Based Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21358)
*Valentin Boussot,Cédric Hémon,Jean-Claude Nunes,Jean-Louis Dillenseger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified pipeline for synthetic CT generation from MRI and CBCT using a 2.5D U-Net++ with ResNet-34 encoder, trained with combined L1 and IMPACT-Synth perceptual loss. IMPACT-based registration outperformed mutual-information methods for anatomical consistency but showed evaluation bias favoring challenge pipeline alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a robust synthetic CT (sCT) generation pipeline for the SynthRAD2025 challenge that addresses registration bias and improves anatomical fidelity in medical imaging.

Method: 2.5D U-Net++ with ResNet-34 encoder trained jointly across anatomical regions with fine-tuning. Loss combines L1 and IMPACT-Synth perceptual loss using SAM and TotalSegmentator. Training used AdamW with patch-based inputs and test-time augmentation with five-fold ensembling. Compared Elastix (mutual information) vs IMPACT (feature-based) registration.

Result: IMPACT-based registration achieved more accurate anatomical alignments and lower MAE on local tests, but Elastix-aligned models scored higher on public validation due to registration bias favoring challenge pipeline alignment.

Conclusion: Registration errors propagate into supervised learning, influencing both training and evaluation. IMPACT helps mitigate this bias and supports more robust sCT synthesis models by promoting anatomically consistent alignment.

Abstract: We participated in the SynthRAD2025 challenge (Tasks 1 and 2) with a unified
pipeline for synthetic CT (sCT) generation from MRI and CBCT, implemented using
the KonfAI framework. Our model is a 2.5D U-Net++ with a ResNet-34 encoder,
trained jointly across anatomical regions and fine-tuned per region. The loss
function combined pixel-wise L1 loss with IMPACT-Synth, a perceptual loss
derived from SAM and TotalSegmentator to enhance structural fidelity. Training
was performed using AdamW (initial learning rate = 0.001, halved every 25k
steps) on patch-based, normalized, body-masked inputs (320x320 for MRI, 256x256
for CBCT), with random flipping as the only augmentation. No post-processing
was applied. Final predictions leveraged test-time augmentation and five-fold
ensembling. The best model was selected based on validation MAE. Two
registration strategies were evaluated: (i) Elastix with mutual information,
consistent with the challenge pipeline, and (ii) IMPACT, a feature-based
similarity metric leveraging pretrained segmentation networks. On the local
test sets, IMPACT-based registration achieved more accurate and anatomically
consistent alignments than mutual-information-based registration, resulting in
improved sCT synthesis with lower MAE and more realistic anatomical structures.
On the public validation set, however, models trained with Elastix-aligned data
achieved higher scores, reflecting a registration bias favoring alignment
strategies consistent with the evaluation pipeline. This highlights how
registration errors can propagate into supervised learning, influencing both
training and evaluation, and potentially inflating performance metrics at the
expense of anatomical fidelity. By promoting anatomically consistent alignment,
IMPACT helps mitigate this bias and supports the development of more robust and
generalizable sCT synthesis models.

*Xi Zhang,Hanwei Zhu,Yan Zhong,Jiamang Wang,Weisi Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework that enables diffusion models to adapt image generation quality based on real-time network bandwidth constraints, allowing early-stop sampling while maintaining appropriate perceptual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional diffusion models use fixed denoising steps regardless of transmission limitations, leading to wasted computation and quality loss when bandwidth requires compression.

Method: Joint end-to-end training strategy where diffusion model is conditioned on target quality level from available bandwidth, using lightweight quality embedding to guide denoising trajectory with minimal architectural changes.

Result: Significantly improves visual fidelity of bandwidth-adapted generations compared to naive early-stopping, maintaining perceptual quality appropriate to transmission conditions.

Conclusion: Offers a promising solution for efficient image delivery in bandwidth-constrained environments by enabling adaptive quality generation based on real-time network conditions.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel framework to enable diffusion models to
adapt their generation quality based on real-time network bandwidth
constraints. Traditional diffusion models produce high-fidelity images by
performing a fixed number of denoising steps, regardless of downstream
transmission limitations. However, in practical cloud-to-device scenarios,
limited bandwidth often necessitates heavy compression, leading to loss of fine
textures and wasted computation. To address this, we introduce a joint
end-to-end training strategy where the diffusion model is conditioned on a
target quality level derived from the available bandwidth. During training, the
model learns to adaptively modulate the denoising process, enabling early-stop
sampling that maintains perceptual quality appropriate to the target
transmission condition. Our method requires minimal architectural changes and
leverages a lightweight quality embedding to guide the denoising trajectory.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the
visual fidelity of bandwidth-adapted generations compared to naive
early-stopping, offering a promising solution for efficient image delivery in
bandwidth-constrained environments. Code is available at:

TL;DR: TerraGen is a unified layout-to-image generation framework for remote sensing that enables spatially controllable synthesis across multiple vision tasks like detection and segmentation, addressing limitations of task-isolated generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative data augmentation frameworks are task-isolated (each task requires independent models) and ignore geographical information and spatial constraints in remote sensing.

Method: Introduces a geographic-spatial layout encoder that unifies bounding box and segmentation mask inputs, with multi-scale injection scheme and mask-weighted loss to encode spatial constraints from global to fine details.

Result: Achieves best generation image quality across diverse tasks and serves as universal data-augmentation generator, significantly enhancing downstream task performance with robust cross-task generalization in both full-data and few-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: TerraGen provides a unified framework for spatially controllable remote sensing imagery synthesis that outperforms task-specific approaches and demonstrates strong generalization capabilities across multiple vision tasks.

Abstract: Remote sensing vision tasks require extensive labeled data across multiple,
interconnected domains. However, current generative data augmentation
frameworks are task-isolated, i.e., each vision task requires training an
independent generative model, and ignores the modeling of geographical
information and spatial constraints. To address these issues, we propose
\textbf{TerraGen}, a unified layout-to-image generation framework that enables
flexible, spatially controllable synthesis of remote sensing imagery for
various high-level vision tasks, e.g., detection, segmentation, and extraction.
Specifically, TerraGen introduces a geographic-spatial layout encoder that
unifies bounding box and segmentation mask inputs, combined with a multi-scale
injection scheme and mask-weighted loss to explicitly encode spatial
constraints, from global structures to fine details. Also, we construct the
first large-scale multi-task remote sensing layout generation dataset
containing 45k images and establish a standardized evaluation protocol for this
task. Experimental results show that our TerraGen can achieve the best
generation image quality across diverse tasks. Additionally, TerraGen can be
used as a universal data-augmentation generator, enhancing downstream task
performance significantly and demonstrating robust cross-task generalisation in
both full-data and few-shot scenarios.

TL;DR: A depth-consistency-constrained method for seamless image stitching that addresses parallax issues through multi-stage alignment with depth regularization and graph-based seam optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Significant variations in object depth cause large parallax in image stitching, leading to ghosting and misalignment problems in stitched results.

Method: Multi-stage mechanism with global depth regularization for alignment, graph-based low-cost computation for optimal seam determination, soft-seam region diffusion for transition areas, and reparameterization strategy for efficiency optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance against existing methods, effectively mitigating alignment errors induced by parallax and achieving natural seamless stitching.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses parallax challenges in image stitching through depth-constrained alignment and optimized seam computation, providing high-quality stitching results with improved efficiency.

Abstract: Image stitching synthesizes images captured from multiple perspectives into a
single image with a broader field of view. The significant variations in object
depth often lead to large parallax, resulting in ghosting and misalignment in
the stitched results. To address this, we propose a
depth-consistency-constrained seamless-free image stitching method. First, to
tackle the multi-view alignment difficulties caused by parallax, a multi-stage
mechanism combined with global depth regularization constraints is developed to
enhance the alignment accuracy of the same apparent target across different
depth ranges. Second, during the multi-view image fusion process, an optimal
stitching seam is determined through graph-based low-cost computation, and a
soft-seam region is diffused to precisely locate transition areas, thereby
effectively mitigating alignment errors induced by parallax and achieving
natural and seamless stitching results. Furthermore, considering the
computational overhead in the shift regression process, a reparameterization
strategy is incorporated to optimize the structural design, significantly
improving algorithm efficiency while maintaining optimal performance. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method against
the existing methods. Code is available at https://github.com/DLUT-YRH/DSFN.

TL;DR: The paper proposes MUVR, a new benchmark for Multi-modal Untrimmed Video Retrieval that supports video-centric multi-modal queries and evaluates retrieval models and MLLMs on untrimmed videos from long-video platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance video retrieval for long-video platforms by addressing the limitations of existing methods in processing untrimmed videos and multi-modal queries, as well as MLLMs in multi-video understanding and reranking.

Method: Created MUVR benchmark with 53K untrimmed videos from Bilibili, featuring 1,050 multi-modal queries and 84K matches. It includes three versions (Base, Filter, QA) with multi-level visual correspondence covering six levels (copy, event, scene, instance, action, others) and proposes a Reranking Score for evaluation.

Result: Extensive evaluations conducted on 3 state-of-the-art video retrieval models, 6 image-based VLMs, and 10 MLLMs. The benchmark reveals significant limitations in current methods for processing untrimmed videos and multi-modal queries.

Conclusion: MUVR provides a comprehensive benchmark that highlights the challenges in untrimmed video retrieval and multi-modal query processing, serving as a valuable resource for advancing video retrieval capabilities on long-video platforms.

Abstract: We propose the Multi-modal Untrimmed Video Retrieval task, along with a new
benchmark (MUVR) to advance video retrieval for long-video platforms. MUVR aims
to retrieve untrimmed videos containing relevant segments using multi-modal
queries. It has the following features: 1) Practical retrieval paradigm: MUVR
supports video-centric multi-modal queries, expressing fine-grained retrieval
needs through long text descriptions, video tag prompts, and mask prompts. It
adopts a one-to-many retrieval paradigm and focuses on untrimmed videos,
tailored for long-video platform applications. 2) Multi-level visual
correspondence: To cover common video categories (e.g., news, travel, dance)
and precisely define retrieval matching criteria, we construct multi-level
visual correspondence based on core video content (e.g., news events, travel
locations, dance moves) which users are interested in and want to retrieve. It
covers six levels: copy, event, scene, instance, action, and others. 3)
Comprehensive evaluation criteria: We develop 3 versions of MUVR (i.e., Base,
Filter, QA). MUVR-Base/Filter evaluates retrieval models, while MUVR-QA
assesses MLLMs in a question-answering format. We also propose a Reranking
Score to evaluate the reranking ability of MLLMs. MUVR consists of 53K
untrimmed videos from the video platform Bilibili, with 1,050 multi-modal
queries and 84K matches. Extensive evaluations of 3 state-of-the-art video
retrieval models, 6 image-based VLMs, and 10 MLLMs are conducted. MUVR reveals
the limitations of retrieval methods in processing untrimmed videos and
multi-modal queries, as well as MLLMs in multi-video understanding and
reranking. Our code and benchmark is available at

*Whie Jung,Semin Kim,Junee Kim,Seunghoon Hong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A scalable framework for adaptive visual concept learning that identifies diverse semantic axes in real-world images and enables independent manipulation of concepts without predefined categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual concept learning approaches are limited to predefined primitive axes (color, shape) and mostly work on synthetic datasets, failing to capture the rich semantic spectrum of real-world scenes.

Method: Leverages pretrained vision-language model with universal prompting to identify image-related concept axes, uses universal concept encoder to bind visual features without additional parameters, and optimizes compositional anchoring objective for independent axis manipulation.

Result: Demonstrated superior editing capabilities on ImageNet, CelebA-HQ, and AFHQ datasets, handling diverse real-world concepts that cannot be manually predefined, with strong compositional generalization outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The framework enables scalable, adaptive visual concept learning in real-world scenes without predefined axes, achieving better performance and generalization than current approaches.

Abstract: Human intelligence effortlessly interprets visual scenes along a rich
spectrum of semantic dimensions. However, existing approaches to
language-grounded visual concept learning are limited to a few predefined
primitive axes, such as color and shape, and are typically explored in
synthetic datasets. In this work, we propose a scalable framework that
adaptively identifies image-related concept axes and grounds visual concepts
along these axes in real-world scenes. Leveraging a pretrained vision-language
model and our universal prompting strategy, our framework identifies a diverse
image-related axes without any prior knowledge. Our universal concept encoder
adaptively binds visual features to the discovered axes without introducing
additional model parameters for each concept. To ground visual concepts along
the discovered axes, we optimize a compositional anchoring objective, which
ensures that each axis can be independently manipulated without affecting
others. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on subsets of
ImageNet, CelebA-HQ, and AFHQ, showcasing superior editing capabilities across
diverse real-world concepts that are too varied to be manually predefined. Our
method also exhibits strong compositional generalization, outperforming
existing visual concept learning and text-based editing methods. The code is

*Honghua Chen,Yushi Lan,Yongwei Chen,Xingang Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ArtiLatent is a generative framework that synthesizes articulated 3D objects with fine geometry, accurate articulation, and realistic appearance using a unified latent space and latent diffusion model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create articulated 3D objects with both geometric consistency and realistic appearance across different articulation states, addressing the challenge of modeling articulation-dependent visibility changes.

Method: Jointly models part geometry and articulation dynamics using sparse voxel representations and articulation properties in a unified latent space via VAE, then trains a latent diffusion model for sampling. Uses articulation-aware Gaussian decoder for photorealistic reconstruction that accounts for visibility changes.

Result: Outperforms existing approaches on furniture-like objects from PartNet-Mobility and ACD datasets in geometric consistency and appearance fidelity, especially in handling occluded regions across articulation configurations.

Conclusion: ArtiLatent provides a scalable solution for articulated 3D object synthesis and manipulation by effectively modeling both geometry and articulation dynamics in a unified framework.

Abstract: We propose ArtiLatent, a generative framework that synthesizes human-made 3D
objects with fine-grained geometry, accurate articulation, and realistic
appearance. Our approach jointly models part geometry and articulation dynamics
by embedding sparse voxel representations and associated articulation
properties, including joint type, axis, origin, range, and part category, into
a unified latent space via a variational autoencoder. A latent diffusion model
is then trained over this space to enable diverse yet physically plausible
sampling. To reconstruct photorealistic 3D shapes, we introduce an
articulation-aware Gaussian decoder that accounts for articulation-dependent
visibility changes (e.g., revealing the interior of a drawer when opened). By
conditioning appearance decoding on articulation state, our method assigns
plausible texture features to regions that are typically occluded in static
poses, significantly improving visual realism across articulation
configurations. Extensive experiments on furniture-like objects from
PartNet-Mobility and ACD datasets demonstrate that ArtiLatent outperforms
existing approaches in geometric consistency and appearance fidelity. Our
framework provides a scalable solution for articulated 3D object synthesis and
manipulation.

### [42] [Anisotropic Pooling for LUT-realizable CNN Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21437)
*Xi Zhang,Xiaolin Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes anisotropic pooling methods to replace average pooling in LUT-based CNN image restoration, improving performance by better handling anisotropic signal structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LUT-based CNN methods use average pooling for fusion, which is ill-suited for anisotropic signal structures and limits performance.

Method: Introduces generalized median pooling and extends it with learnable data-dependent pooling coefficients that adaptively weigh contributions from differently oriented pixel patches.

Result: Experimental results show both perceptually and numerically superior performance compared to existing LUT-realizable CNN methods on various restoration benchmarks.

Conclusion: Anisotropic pooling strategies effectively improve LUT-based CNN restoration by better managing table size constraints while handling anisotropic structures.

Abstract: Table look-up realization of image restoration CNNs has the potential of
achieving competitive image quality while being much faster and resource frugal
than the straightforward CNN implementation. The main technical challenge
facing the LUT-based CNN algorithm designers is to manage the table size
without overly restricting the receptive field. The prevailing strategy is to
reuse the table for small pixel patches of different orientations (apparently
assuming a degree of isotropy) and then fuse the look-up results. The fusion is
currently done by average pooling, which we find being ill suited to
anisotropic signal structures. To alleviate the problem, we investigate and
discuss anisotropic pooling methods to replace naive averaging for improving
the performance of the current LUT-realizable CNN restoration methods. First,
we introduce the method of generalized median pooling which leads to measurable
gains over average pooling. We then extend this idea by learning data-dependent
pooling coefficients for each orientation, so that they can adaptively weigh
the contributions of differently oriented pixel patches. Experimental results
on various restoration benchmarks show that our anisotropic pooling strategy
yields both perceptually and numerically superior results compared to existing
LUT-realizable CNN methods.

### [43] [OpenHype: Hyperbolic Embeddings for Hierarchical Open-Vocabulary Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21441)
*Lisa Weijler,Sebastian Koch,Fabio Poiesi,Timo Ropinski,Pedro Hermosilla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OpenHype uses hyperbolic latent space to model 3D scene hierarchies continuously, overcoming limitations of discrete hierarchies and multi-pass rendering approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for modeling 3D scene hierarchies either require multiple rendering passes (slow inference) or use predefined discrete hierarchies (poor generalization to real-world diversity).

Method: Proposes OpenHype that represents scene hierarchies using continuous hyperbolic latent space, leveraging hyperbolic geometry to encode multi-scale relationships and enable smooth hierarchy traversal via geodesic paths.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on standard benchmarks, demonstrating superior efficiency and adaptability in 3D scene understanding.

Conclusion: OpenHype provides an effective solution for continuous hierarchical representation of 3D scenes using hyperbolic geometry, addressing key limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Modeling the inherent hierarchical structure of 3D objects and 3D scenes is
highly desirable, as it enables a more holistic understanding of environments
for autonomous agents. Accomplishing this with implicit representations, such
as Neural Radiance Fields, remains an unexplored challenge. Existing methods
that explicitly model hierarchical structures often face significant
limitations: they either require multiple rendering passes to capture
embeddings at different levels of granularity, significantly increasing
inference time, or rely on predefined, closed-set discrete hierarchies that
generalize poorly to the diverse and nuanced structures encountered by agents
in the real world. To address these challenges, we propose OpenHype, a novel
approach that represents scene hierarchies using a continuous hyperbolic latent
space. By leveraging the properties of hyperbolic geometry, OpenHype naturally
encodes multi-scale relationships and enables smooth traversal of hierarchies
through geodesic paths in latent space. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches on standard benchmarks, demonstrating superior efficiency and
adaptability in 3D scene understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhysWorld is a framework that uses a simulator to generate diverse physical demonstrations for learning efficient world models of deformable objects, achieving fast and accurate predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning physics-consistent dynamics models from limited real-world video data is challenging, especially for deformable objects with spatially-varying physical properties.

Method: Constructs a physics-consistent digital twin in MPM simulator, applies part-aware perturbations to generate diverse demonstrations, and trains a lightweight GNN-based world model embedded with physical properties.

Result: Achieves accurate future predictions for deformable objects with 47x faster inference speed than PhysTwin, and generalizes well to novel interactions.

Conclusion: PhysWorld effectively overcomes data scarcity by using simulator-generated demonstrations to learn efficient world models for deformable object dynamics.

Abstract: Interactive world models that simulate object dynamics are crucial for
robotics, VR, and AR. However, it remains a significant challenge to learn
physics-consistent dynamics models from limited real-world video data,
especially for deformable objects with spatially-varying physical properties.
To overcome the challenge of data scarcity, we propose PhysWorld, a novel
framework that utilizes a simulator to synthesize physically plausible and
diverse demonstrations to learn efficient world models. Specifically, we first
construct a physics-consistent digital twin within MPM simulator via
constitutive model selection and global-to-local optimization of physical
properties. Subsequently, we apply part-aware perturbations to the physical
properties and generate various motion patterns for the digital twin,
synthesizing extensive and diverse demonstrations. Finally, using these
demonstrations, we train a lightweight GNN-based world model that is embedded
with physical properties. The real video can be used to further refine the
physical properties. PhysWorld achieves accurate and fast future predictions
for various deformable objects, and also generalizes well to novel
interactions. Experiments show that PhysWorld has competitive performance while
enabling inference speeds 47 times faster than the recent state-of-the-art
method, i.e., PhysTwin.

### [45] [MoniTor: Exploiting Large Language Models with Instruction for Online Video Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21449)
*Shengtian Yang,Yue Feng,Yingshi Liu,Jingrou Zhang,Jie Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoniTor is a training-free online Video Anomaly Detection method that uses memory-based scoring queues and LSTM-inspired prediction with vision-language models to detect anomalies in real-time video streams.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online VAD has been neglected due to real-time constraints and computational intensity, despite recent advances in LLMs and VLMs that could enable more nuanced anomaly understanding.

Method: Uses streaming input to VLMs with LSTM-inspired prediction mechanism, scoring queue for recent scores, and anomaly prior to guide LLMs in distinguishing normal vs abnormal behaviors over time.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets, competitive with weakly supervised methods without requiring training.

Conclusion: MoniTor effectively addresses online VAD challenges through memory-based scoring and temporal modeling, demonstrating strong performance without training requirements.

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to locate unusual activities or behaviors
within videos. Recently, offline VAD has garnered substantial research
attention, which has been invigorated by the progress in large language models
(LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), offering the potential for a more
nuanced understanding of anomalies. However, online VAD has seldom received
attention due to real-time constraints and computational intensity. In this
paper, we introduce a novel Memory-based online scoring queue scheme for
Training-free VAD (MoniTor), to address the inherent complexities in online
VAD. Specifically, MoniTor applies a streaming input to VLMs, leveraging the
capabilities of pre-trained large-scale models. To capture temporal
dependencies more effectively, we incorporate a novel prediction mechanism
inspired by Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. This ensures the model can
effectively model past states and leverage previous predictions to identify
anomalous behaviors. Thereby, it better understands the current frame.
Moreover, we design a scoring queue and an anomaly prior to dynamically store
recent scores and cover all anomalies in the monitoring scenario, providing
guidance for LLMs to distinguish between normal and abnormal behaviors over
time. We evaluate MoniTor on two large datasets (i.e., UCF-Crime and
XD-Violence) containing various surveillance and real-world scenarios. The
results demonstrate that MoniTor outperforms state-of-the-art methods and is
competitive with weakly supervised methods without training. Code is available

### [46] [VidSplice: Towards Coherent Video Inpainting via Explicit Spaced Frame Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21461)
*Ming Xie,Junqiu Yu,Qiaole Dong,Xiangyang Xue,Yanwei Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VidSplice is a novel video inpainting framework that decouples the task into multi-frame consistent image inpainting and masked area motion propagation, using spaced-frame priors and a CoSpliced Module to enhance spatiotemporal stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video inpainting methods using I2V priors struggle with severe content degradation and overlook spatiotemporal stability, leading to insufficient control over video generation.

Method: Proposes VidSplice with spaced-frame priors, CoSpliced Module for first-frame propagation strategy, and context controller module to constrain content distortion during generation.

Result: Achieves competitive performance across diverse video inpainting scenarios with significant improvements in foreground alignment and motion stability.

Conclusion: VidSplice effectively addresses limitations of existing methods and outperforms current approaches in video inpainting tasks.

Abstract: Recent video inpainting methods often employ image-to-video (I2V) priors to
model temporal consistency across masked frames. While effective in moderate
cases, these methods struggle under severe content degradation and tend to
overlook spatiotemporal stability, resulting in insufficient control over the
latter parts of the video. To address these limitations, we decouple video
inpainting into two sub-tasks: multi-frame consistent image inpainting and
masked area motion propagation. We propose VidSplice, a novel framework that
introduces spaced-frame priors to guide the inpainting process with
spatiotemporal cues. To enhance spatial coherence, we design a CoSpliced Module
to perform first-frame propagation strategy that diffuses the initial frame
content into subsequent reference frames through a splicing mechanism.
Additionally, we introduce a delicate context controller module that encodes
coherent priors after frame duplication and injects the spliced video into the
I2V generative backbone, effectively constraining content distortion during
generation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that VidSplice achieves
competitive performance across diverse video inpainting scenarios. Moreover,
its design significantly improves both foreground alignment and motion
stability, outperforming existing approaches.

*Yiming Tang,Wenjia Zhong,Rushi Shah,Dianbo Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CXR-LanIC is a novel framework that makes deep learning models for chest X-ray diagnosis interpretable by discovering task-aligned visual patterns through transcoder-based sparse autoencoders, achieving both competitive accuracy and transparent explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models achieve high accuracy in chest X-ray diagnosis but remain black-box systems, limiting clinical adoption. Clinicians need transparent, verifiable explanations to trust automated diagnoses and identify failure modes.

Method: Trains transcoder-based sparse autoencoders on BiomedCLIP diagnostic classifier to decompose medical image representations into interpretable visual patterns. Uses ensemble of 100 transcoders on multimodal embeddings from MIMIC-CXR dataset to discover ~5,000 monosemantic patterns across clinical categories.

Result: Discovers approximately 5,000 interpretable patterns spanning cardiac, pulmonary, pleural, structural, device, and artifact categories. Each pattern shows consistent activation behavior across images with specific radiological features. Achieves competitive diagnostic accuracy on five key findings while enabling transparent attribution through 20-50 interpretable patterns per prediction.

Conclusion: CXR-LanIC demonstrates that medical AI systems can be both accurate and interpretable, supporting safer clinical deployment through transparent, clinically grounded explanations. The key innovation is extracting interpretable features from classifier trained on specific diagnostic objectives rather than general-purpose embeddings.

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved remarkable accuracy in chest X-ray
diagnosis, yet their widespread clinical adoption remains limited by the
black-box nature of their predictions. Clinicians require transparent,
verifiable explanations to trust automated diagnoses and identify potential
failure modes. We introduce CXR-LanIC (Language-Grounded Interpretable
Classifier for Chest X-rays), a novel framework that addresses this
interpretability challenge through task-aligned pattern discovery. Our approach
trains transcoder-based sparse autoencoders on a BiomedCLIP diagnostic
classifier to decompose medical image representations into interpretable visual
patterns. By training an ensemble of 100 transcoders on multimodal embeddings
from the MIMIC-CXR dataset, we discover approximately 5,000 monosemantic
patterns spanning cardiac, pulmonary, pleural, structural, device, and artifact
categories. Each pattern exhibits consistent activation behavior across images
sharing specific radiological features, enabling transparent attribution where
predictions decompose into 20-50 interpretable patterns with verifiable
activation galleries. CXR-LanIC achieves competitive diagnostic accuracy on
five key findings while providing the foundation for natural language
explanations through planned large multimodal model annotation. Our key
innovation lies in extracting interpretable features from a classifier trained
on specific diagnostic objectives rather than general-purpose embeddings,
ensuring discovered patterns are directly relevant to clinical decision-making,
demonstrating that medical AI systems can be both accurate and interpretable,
supporting safer clinical deployment through transparent, clinically grounded
explanations.

*Yating Huang,Qijun Yang,Lintao Xiang,Hujun Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a dual-stream architecture for histopathology image analysis that integrates tissue-level and cell-level features using a recurrent transformer for efficient cell aggregation and bidirectional attention between tissue and cellular representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pathology foundation models capture global tissue context but lack cell-level feature modeling, which is crucial for fine-grained tasks like cancer subtype classification.

Method: Dual-stream architecture with receptance-weighted key-value aggregation (recurrent transformer with linear complexity) for cell-level modeling and bidirectional tissue-cell interaction module for mutual attention between cellular cues and tissue environment.

Result: Outperforms existing models on four histopathological subtype classification benchmarks.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the critical importance of cell-level aggregation and tissue-cell interaction in fine-grained computational pathology tasks.

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of histopathological images demands integration of
information across spatial and semantic scales, from nuclear morphology and
cellular textures to global tissue organization and disease-specific patterns.
Although recent foundation models in pathology have shown strong capabilities
in capturing global tissue context, their omission of cell-level feature
modeling remains a key limitation for fine-grained tasks such as cancer subtype
classification. To address this, we propose a dual-stream architecture that
models the interplay between macroscale tissue features and aggregated cellular
representations. To efficiently aggregate information from large cell sets, we
propose a receptance-weighted key-value aggregation model, a recurrent
transformer that captures inter-cell dependencies with linear complexity.
Furthermore, we introduce a bidirectional tissue-cell interaction module to
enable mutual attention between localized cellular cues and their surrounding
tissue environment. Experiments on four histopathological subtype
classification benchmarks show that the proposed method outperforms existing
models, demonstrating the critical role of cell-level aggregation and
tissue-cell interaction in fine-grained computational pathology.

Method: Uses graph-weighted solution with online ID updates based on tracks and person features, includes position estimation module, and deeply investigates feature extraction, tracking, and community search components.

Result: Shows superiority over other methods when tested on closed-area recordings and public datasets of highly congested spaces, with better performance than methods without position data.

Conclusion: GRAP-MOT provides effective person tracking in overlapping multi-camera environments, and IDF1 metric is more adequate than MOTA for comparing MOT algorithms in such scenarios.

Abstract: GRAP-MOT is a new approach for solving the person MOT problem dedicated to
videos of closed areas with overlapping multi-camera views, where person
occlusion frequently occurs. Our novel graph-weighted solution updates a
person's identification label online based on tracks and the person's
characteristic features. To find the best solution, we deeply investigated all
elements of the MOT process, including feature extraction, tracking, and
community search. Furthermore, GRAP-MOT is equipped with a person's position
estimation module, which gives additional key information to the MOT method,
ensuring better results than methods without position data. We tested GRAP-MOT
on recordings acquired in a closed-area model and on publicly available real
datasets that fulfil the requirement of a highly congested space, showing the
superiority of our proposition. Finally, we analyzed existing metrics used to
compare MOT algorithms and concluded that IDF1 is more adequate than MOTA in
such comparisons. We made our code, along with the acquired dataset, publicly
available.

Abstract: Placental abruption is a severe complication during pregnancy, and its early
accurate diagnosis is crucial for ensuring maternal and fetal safety.
Traditional ultrasound diagnostic methods heavily rely on physician experience,

convolution and coordinate convolution to strengthen frequency and spatial
feature extraction; incorporates a cascaded group attention mechanism to
suppress ultrasound artifacts and occlusion interference, thereby improving
bounding box localization accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate a
detection accuracy of 78%, representing a 2.5% improvement over YOLOv11n and a
13.7% increase over YOLOv8. The model exhibits significant superiority in
precision-recall curves, confidence scores, and occlusion scenarios. Combining
high accuracy with real-time processing, this model provides a reliable

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision encoders focus on global image representations but overlook fine-grained regional analysis, limited by scarce fine-grained annotated data and lack of fine-grained pre-training paradigm.

Method: Constructed Gran-29M dataset with 2M images and 180M region-level annotations; developed pretraining-adaptation framework with self-distillation; used bounding-box-to-caption regression in pretraining and caption-to-bounding-box regression in adaptation; incorporated self-distillation mechanism for explicit localization constraints.

Result: GranViT surpasses existing vision encoders and attains strong transferability to varying LLMs; achieves state-of-the-art results on fine-grained recognition, multimodal VQA, and OCR understanding.

Conclusion: GranViT successfully addresses the limitations of existing vision encoders by integrating fine-grained feature extraction with semantic alignment to LLMs through region-level autoregressive training and large-scale fine-grained pre-training.

Abstract: Vision encoders are indispensable for allowing impressive performance of
Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in vision language tasks such as
visual question answering and reasoning. However, existing vision encoders
focus on global image representations but overlook fine-grained regional
analysis. They are limited in fine grained perception due to the scarcity of
fine grained annotated data and the lack of a fine grained pre-training
paradigm. In this paper, we propose GranViT, a novel Vision Transformer that
integrates fine-grained feature extraction with semantic alignment to Large
Language Models (LLMs) via region level autoregressive training. We first
construct Gran-29M, a dataset comprising 2million natural and OCR images paired
with over 180 million high-quality region-level annotations, to enable large
scale fine grained pretraining. Consequently, we develop a
pretraining-adaptation framework along with a self distillation mechanism to
train fine-grained GranViT on Gran-29M. We sufficiently exploit the
fine-grained annotations from Gran-29M to resort to bounding-box-to-caption
regression to enhance localized visual representation of the vision encoder in
the pretraining and caption-to-bounding-box regression to improve vision
feature utilization and localization for LLM in the adaptation. We further
incorporate a self distillation mechanism that imposes explicit localization
constraints on the vision encoder to strengthen its regional reasoning
capability. Extensive experiments show that GranViT surpasses existing vision
encoders and attains strong transferability to varying LLMs. Remarkably, it
achieves state-of-the-art results on fine-grained recognition, multimodal VQA,
and OCR understanding.

*Kaibo Wang,Jianda Mao,Tong Wu,Yang Xiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Foresight Guidance (FSG), a novel approach to conditional guidance in diffusion models that reframes guidance as fixed point iterations and addresses inefficiencies in existing methods like CFG.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) in text-to-image diffusion models stem from divergent theoretical interpretations, limiting design space and obscuring key design choices. There's a need for a unified perspective to advance understanding of guidance mechanisms.

Method: The authors reframe conditional guidance as fixed point iterations seeking a golden path where latents produce consistent outputs under both conditional and unconditional generation. They introduce Foresight Guidance (FSG) which prioritizes solving longer-interval subproblems in early diffusion stages with increased iterations.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse datasets and model architectures validate FSG's superiority over state-of-the-art methods in both image quality and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The work offers novel perspectives for conditional guidance and unlocks the potential of adaptive design in diffusion models.

Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is an essential component of text-to-image
diffusion models, and understanding and advancing its operational mechanisms
remains a central focus of research. Existing approaches stem from divergent
theoretical interpretations, thereby limiting the design space and obscuring
key design choices. To address this, we propose a unified perspective that
reframes conditional guidance as fixed point iterations, seeking to identify a
golden path where latents produce consistent outputs under both conditional and
unconditional generation. We demonstrate that CFG and its variants constitute a
special case of single-step short-interval iteration, which is theoretically
proven to exhibit inefficiency. To this end, we introduce Foresight Guidance
(FSG), which prioritizes solving longer-interval subproblems in early diffusion
stages with increased iterations. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets
and model architectures validate the superiority of FSG over state-of-the-art
methods in both image quality and computational efficiency. Our work offers
novel perspectives for conditional guidance and unlocks the potential of

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how attention heads in text-generative models specialize in semantic/visual attributes, develops a method to rank heads by concept relevance, and shows editing just 1% of heads can reliably control model outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the internal mechanisms of language and vision-language models, particularly how individual attention heads specialize in specific attributes, despite their impressive performance.

Method: Reinterpret probing of intermediate activations through signal processing lens to analyze multiple samples systematically, ranking attention heads based on relevance to target concepts.

Result: Found consistent head-level specialization patterns across unimodal/multimodal transformers; editing 1% of selected heads reliably suppresses/enhances target concepts in outputs.

Conclusion: Attention layers contain interpretable and controllable structure, providing simple tools for understanding and editing large-scale generative models.

Abstract: Language and vision-language models have shown impressive performance across
a wide range of tasks, but their internal mechanisms remain only partly
understood. In this work, we study how individual attention heads in
text-generative models specialize in specific semantic or visual attributes.
Building on an established interpretability method, we reinterpret the practice
of probing intermediate activations with the final decoding layer through the
lens of signal processing. This lets us analyze multiple samples in a
principled way and rank attention heads based on their relevance to target
concepts. Our results show consistent patterns of specialization at the head
level across both unimodal and multimodal transformers. Remarkably, we find
that editing as few as 1% of the heads, selected using our method, can reliably
suppress or enhance targeted concepts in the model output. We validate our
approach on language tasks such as question answering and toxicity mitigation,
as well as vision-language tasks including image classification and captioning.
Our findings highlight an interpretable and controllable structure within
attention layers, offering simple tools for understanding and editing
large-scale generative models.

Method: Connects V-JEPA2 video embeddings to frozen Stable Audio Open DiT T2A model via compact video cross-attention inserted after text cross-attention. Uses video token pooling to reduce memory and stabilize training. The bridge learns audio-video dependencies while keeping backbones frozen.

Result: Achieves competitive temporal and semantic alignment on video-audio benchmarks with significantly fewer trainable parameters than multi-modal systems. Maintains prompt-driven controllability and modular architecture for easy encoder/T2A backbone swapping.

Conclusion: Foley Control provides an efficient, modular approach to video-guided Foley generation that preserves the strengths of frozen pretrained models while enabling synchronization. The bridge design is potentially extensible to other audio modalities like speech.

Abstract: Foley Control is a lightweight approach to video-guided Foley that keeps
pretrained single-modality models frozen and learns only a small
cross-attention bridge between them. We connect V-JEPA2 video embeddings to a
frozen Stable Audio Open DiT text-to-audio (T2A) model by inserting compact
video cross-attention after the model's existing text cross-attention, so
prompts set global semantics while video refines timing and local dynamics. The
frozen backbones retain strong marginals (video; audio given text) and the
bridge learns the audio-video dependency needed for synchronization -- without
retraining the audio prior. To cut memory and stabilize training, we pool video
tokens before conditioning. On curated video-audio benchmarks, Foley Control
delivers competitive temporal and semantic alignment with far fewer trainable
parameters than recent multi-modal systems, while preserving prompt-driven
controllability and production-friendly modularity (swap/upgrade encoders or
the T2A backbone without end-to-end retraining). Although we focus on
Video-to-Foley, the same bridge design can potentially extend to other audio
modalities (e.g., speech).

*Yifu Luo,Penghui Du,Bo Li,Sinan Du,Tiantian Zhang,Yongzhe Chang,Kai Wu,Kun Gai,Xueqian Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Chunk-GRPO improves Group Relative Policy Optimization for text-to-image generation by shifting from step-level to chunk-level optimization, addressing inaccurate advantage attribution and temporal dynamics neglect.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO faces limitations in accurate advantage attribution and neglects the temporal dynamics of generation in flow-matching-based text-to-image generation.

Method: Proposes Chunk-GRPO which groups consecutive steps into coherent chunks to capture intrinsic temporal dynamics and optimizes policies at chunk level, with optional weighted sampling strategy.

Result: Extensive experiments show Chunk-GRPO achieves superior results in both preference alignment and image quality compared to step-level approaches.

Conclusion: Chunk-level optimization shows promise for GRPO-based methods in text-to-image generation, effectively addressing step-level limitations.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has shown strong potential for
flow-matching-based text-to-image (T2I) generation, but it faces two key
limitations: inaccurate advantage attribution, and the neglect of temporal
dynamics of generation. In this work, we argue that shifting the optimization
paradigm from the step level to the chunk level can effectively alleviate these
issues. Building on this idea, we propose Chunk-GRPO, the first chunk-level
GRPO-based approach for T2I generation. The insight is to group consecutive
steps into coherent 'chunk's that capture the intrinsic temporal dynamics of
flow matching, and to optimize policies at the chunk level. In addition, we
introduce an optional weighted sampling strategy to further enhance
performance. Extensive experiments show that ChunkGRPO achieves superior
results in both preference alignment and image quality, highlighting the
promise of chunk-level optimization for GRPO-based methods.

### [56] [MATrack: Efficient Multiscale Adaptive Tracker for Real-Time Nighttime UAV Operations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21586)
*Xuzhao Li,Xuchen Li,Shiyu Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MATrack is a multiscale adaptive system for nighttime UAV tracking that addresses challenges like low-light conditions, cluttered backgrounds, and viewpoint changes through three core modules, achieving significant performance improvements over SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nighttime UAV tracking faces challenges from low-light conditions, cluttered backgrounds, and viewpoint changes that cause existing trackers to drift or fail. Current solutions based on low-light enhancement and domain adaptation have shortcomings like visual artifacts, computational expense, and inability to fully leverage dynamic object information.

Method: MATrack uses three core modules: Multiscale Hierarchy Blende (MHB) for feature consistency between static/dynamic templates, Adaptive Key Token Gate for object identification in complex backgrounds, and Nighttime Template Calibrator (NTC) for stable long-sequence tracking.

Result: On UAVDark135 benchmark, MATrack achieves 5.9% precision, 5.4% normalized precision, and 4.2% AUC improvements over SOTA methods while maintaining 81 FPS real-time processing. Real-world UAV platform tests validate reliability for critical applications.

Conclusion: MATrack provides stable and effective nighttime UAV tracking support for critical robotics applications like nighttime search and rescue and border patrol, demonstrating significant performance improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Nighttime UAV tracking faces significant challenges in real-world robotics
operations. Low-light conditions not only limit visual perception capabilities,
but cluttered backgrounds and frequent viewpoint changes also cause existing
trackers to drift or fail during deployment. To address these difficulties,
researchers have proposed solutions based on low-light enhancement and domain
adaptation. However, these methods still have notable shortcomings in actual
UAV systems: low-light enhancement often introduces visual artifacts, domain
adaptation methods are computationally expensive and existing lightweight
designs struggle to fully leverage dynamic object information. Based on an
in-depth analysis of these key issues, we propose MATrack-a multiscale adaptive
system designed specifically for nighttime UAV tracking. MATrack tackles the
main technical challenges of nighttime tracking through the collaborative work
of three core modules: Multiscale Hierarchy Blende (MHB) enhances feature
consistency between static and dynamic templates. Adaptive Key Token Gate
accurately identifies object information within complex backgrounds. Nighttime
Template Calibrator (NTC) ensures stable tracking performance over long
sequences. Extensive experiments show that MATrack achieves a significant
performance improvement. On the UAVDark135 benchmark, its precision, normalized
precision and AUC surpass state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by 5.9%, 5.4% and
4.2% respectively, while maintaining a real-time processing speed of 81 FPS.
Further tests on a real-world UAV platform validate the system's reliability,
demonstrating that MATrack can provide stable and effective nighttime UAV
tracking support for critical robotics applications such as nighttime search
and rescue and border patrol.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TIGER is a two-stage text-image guided super-resolution framework that breaks the trade-off between image quality and text readability by first restoring text glyphs and then using them to guide full-image enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative super-resolution methods perform well on natural images but distort text, creating a fundamental trade-off between image quality and textual readability.

Method: A novel two-stage 'text-first, image-later' framework that explicitly decouples glyph restoration from image enhancement. It first reconstructs precise text structures and then uses them to guide subsequent full-image super-resolution.

Result: TIGER achieves state-of-the-art performance, enhancing readability while preserving overall image quality. The method was evaluated on the new UltraZoom-ST dataset with extreme zoom (×14.29).

Conclusion: The proposed glyph-to-image guidance approach successfully breaks the trade-off between image quality and text readability in super-resolution tasks.

Abstract: Current generative super-resolution methods show strong performance on
natural images but distort text, creating a fundamental trade-off between image
quality and textual readability. To address this, we introduce \textbf{TIGER}
(\textbf{T}ext-\textbf{I}mage \textbf{G}uided
sup\textbf{E}r-\textbf{R}esolution), a novel two-stage framework that breaks
this trade-off through a \textit{"text-first, image-later"} paradigm.
\textbf{TIGER} explicitly decouples glyph restoration from image enhancement:
it first reconstructs precise text structures and then uses them to guide
subsequent full-image super-resolution. This glyph-to-image guidance ensures
both high fidelity and visual consistency. To support comprehensive training
and evaluation, we also contribute the \textbf{UltraZoom-ST} (UltraZoom-Scene
Text), the first scene text dataset with extreme zoom (\textbf{$\times$14.29}).
Extensive experiments show that \textbf{TIGER} achieves
\textbf{state-of-the-art} performance, enhancing readability while preserving

*Pauline Mouches,Julien Jung,Armand Demasson,Agnès Guinard,Romain Bouet,Rosalie Marchal,Romain Quentin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning models (ANN and CNN) can detect interictal spikes in MEG recordings using limited clinical annotations, outperforming state-of-the-art methods with F1-scores of 0.46 and 0.44 respectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual detection of interictal epileptic spikes in MEG recordings is tedious and error-prone with only moderate interrater agreement. Current automated methods are unsuitable for clinical practice due to extensive annotation requirements or lack of robustness.

Method: Proposed two deep learning architectures: feature-based ANN and CNN, trained on 59 patients' data. Used interactive machine learning to iteratively improve annotation quality. Evaluated against state-of-the-art model for classifying short time windows of signal.

Result: Both models outperformed state-of-the-art model on 10 holdout test patients (CNN F1=0.46, ANN F1=0.44). Interactive learning demonstrated robustness to noisy annotations. Simple architectures proved effective on complex, imperfectly annotated data.

Conclusion: Deep learning models provide efficient automated spike detection tools. Interactive machine learning enables faster data annotation. Simple architectures are robust for analyzing complex clinical data with imperfect annotations.

Abstract: In drug-resistant epilepsy, presurgical evaluation of epilepsy can be
considered. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) has been shown to be an effective exam
to inform the localization of the epileptogenic zone through the localization
of interictal epileptic spikes. Manual detection of these pathological
biomarkers remains a fastidious and error-prone task due to the high
dimensionality of MEG recordings, and interrater agreement has been reported to
be only moderate. Current automated methods are unsuitable for clinical
practice, either requiring extensively annotated data or lacking robustness on
non-typical data. In this work, we demonstrate that deep learning models can be
used for detecting interictal spikes in MEG recordings, even when only temporal
and single-expert annotations are available, which represents real-world
clinical practice. We propose two model architectures: a feature-based
artificial neural network (ANN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN),
trained on a database of 59 patients, and evaluated against a state-of-the-art
model to classify short time windows of signal. In addition, we employ an
interactive machine learning strategy to iteratively improve our data
annotation quality using intermediary model outputs. Both proposed models
outperform the state-of-the-art model (F1-scores: CNN=0.46, ANN=0.44) when
tested on 10 holdout test patients. The interactive machine learning strategy
demonstrates that our models are robust to noisy annotations. Overall, results
highlight the robustness of models with simple architectures when analyzing
complex and imperfectly annotated data. Our method of interactive machine
learning offers great potential for faster data annotation, while our models
represent useful and efficient tools for automated interictal spikes detection.

TL;DR: S3OD method improves salient object detection generalization using large-scale synthetic data generation and ambiguity-aware architecture, achieving 20-50% error reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Salient object detection faces data limitations due to expensive pixel-precise annotations, requiring separate training for related subtasks like DIS and HR-SOD.

Method: Introduces S3OD dataset with 139,000+ high-resolution images generated via multi-modal diffusion pipeline, using iterative generation framework and multi-mask decoder to handle ambiguity.

Result: Models trained on synthetic data achieve 20-50% error reduction in cross-dataset generalization; fine-tuned versions reach state-of-the-art performance across DIS and HR-SOD benchmarks.

Conclusion: Large-scale synthetic data generation combined with ambiguity-aware architecture dramatically improves generalization in salient object detection tasks.

Abstract: Salient object detection exemplifies data-bounded tasks where expensive
pixel-precise annotations force separate model training for related subtasks
like DIS and HR-SOD. We present a method that dramatically improves
generalization through large-scale synthetic data generation and
ambiguity-aware architecture. We introduce S3OD, a dataset of over 139,000
high-resolution images created through our multi-modal diffusion pipeline that
extracts labels from diffusion and DINO-v3 features. The iterative generation
framework prioritizes challenging categories based on model performance. We
propose a streamlined multi-mask decoder that naturally handles the inherent
ambiguity in salient object detection by predicting multiple valid
interpretations. Models trained solely on synthetic data achieve 20-50% error
reduction in cross-dataset generalization, while fine-tuned versions reach
state-of-the-art performance across DIS and HR-SOD benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Modest-Align is a lightweight cross-modal alignment framework that addresses overconfidence and performance degradation in low-resource settings through random perturbation and embedding smoothing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current cross-modal alignment models like CLIP suffer from overconfidence and degraded performance in resource-constrained settings with limited or low-quality data, particularly due to ambiguous image-text pairs and contrastive learning approaches that reinforce uncertainty.

Method: Proposes Modest-Align with two complementary strategies: Random Perturbation (introducing controlled noise to simulate uncertainty) and Embedding Smoothing (calibrating similarity distributions in embedding space).

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in retrieval tasks, achieving competitive results with over 100x less training data and 600x less GPU time than CLIP across multiple benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Modest-Align provides a practical and scalable solution for cross-modal alignment in real-world, low-resource scenarios by reducing overconfidence and improving performance on noisy or weakly aligned samples.

Abstract: Cross-modal alignment aims to map heterogeneous modalities into a shared
latent space, as exemplified by models like CLIP, which benefit from
large-scale image-text pretraining for strong recognition capabilities.
However, when operating in resource-constrained settings with limited or
low-quality data, these models often suffer from overconfidence and degraded
performance due to the prevalence of ambiguous or weakly correlated image-text
pairs. Current contrastive learning approaches, which rely on single positive
pairs, further exacerbate this issue by reinforcing overconfidence on uncertain
samples. To address these challenges, we propose Modest-Align, a lightweight
alignment framework designed for robustness and efficiency. Our approach
leverages two complementary strategies -- Random Perturbation, which introduces
controlled noise to simulate uncertainty, and Embedding Smoothing, which
calibrates similarity distributions in the embedding space. These mechanisms
collectively reduce overconfidence and improve performance on noisy or weakly
aligned samples. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that Modest-Align outperforms state-of-the-art methods in retrieval
tasks, achieving competitive results with over 100x less training data and 600x
less GPU time than CLIP. Our method offers a practical and scalable solution
for cross-modal alignment in real-world, low-resource scenarios.

*Orest Kupyn,Fabian Manhardt,Federico Tombari,Christian Rupprecht*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using epipolar geometry constraints to improve video diffusion models, addressing geometric inconsistencies and unstable motion through preference-based optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation models struggle with geometric inconsistencies, unstable motion, and visual artifacts that break the illusion of realistic 3D scenes, limiting their practical applications.

Method: Align diffusion models using pairwise epipolar geometry constraints via preference-based optimization, enforcing geometric principles without requiring end-to-end differentiability. Training on static scenes with dynamic cameras ensures high-quality measurements.

Result: Classical geometric constraints provide more stable optimization signals than modern learned metrics, which produce noisy targets. The approach generates spatially consistent videos without compromising visual quality.

Conclusion: By bridging data-driven deep learning with classical geometric computer vision, this method presents a practical approach for generating geometrically consistent videos.

Abstract: Video generation models have progressed tremendously through large latent
diffusion transformers trained with rectified flow techniques. Yet these models
still struggle with geometric inconsistencies, unstable motion, and visual
artifacts that break the illusion of realistic 3D scenes. 3D-consistent video
generation could significantly impact numerous downstream applications in
generation and reconstruction tasks. We explore how epipolar geometry
constraints improve modern video diffusion models. Despite massive training
data, these models fail to capture fundamental geometric principles underlying
visual content. We align diffusion models using pairwise epipolar geometry
constraints via preference-based optimization, directly addressing unstable
camera trajectories and geometric artifacts through mathematically principled
geometric enforcement. Our approach efficiently enforces geometric principles
without requiring end-to-end differentiability. Evaluation demonstrates that
classical geometric constraints provide more stable optimization signals than
modern learned metrics, which produce noisy targets that compromise alignment
quality. Training on static scenes with dynamic cameras ensures high-quality
measurements while the model generalizes effectively to diverse dynamic
content. By bridging data-driven deep learning with classical geometric
computer vision, we present a practical method for generating spatially
consistent videos without compromising visual quality.

*Ziqi Gao,Qiufu Li,Linlin Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAP-MAE is a domain-adaptive masked autoencoder that adaptively integrates knowledge from cross-domain point cloud datasets for general point cloud analysis, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks with single pre-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point cloud data is limited across different domains, and combining mixed-domain data for MAE pre-training can lead to misaligned prior knowledge that degrades downstream task performance.

Method: Proposes DAP-MAE with a heterogeneous domain adapter that uses adaptation mode during pre-training and fusion mode during fine-tuning, plus a domain feature generator to guide feature adaptation to downstream tasks.

Result: Achieves 95.18% in object classification on ScanObjectNN and 88.45% in facial expression recognition on Bosphorus, with excellent performance across four different point cloud analysis tasks using only one pre-training.

Conclusion: DAP-MAE effectively addresses the domain adaptation challenge in point cloud MAE pre-training, enabling comprehensive learning from cross-domain data while maintaining strong performance across diverse downstream tasks.

Abstract: Compared to 2D data, the scale of point cloud data in different domains
available for training, is quite limited. Researchers have been trying to
combine these data of different domains for masked autoencoder (MAE)
pre-training to leverage such a data scarcity issue. However, the prior
knowledge learned from mixed domains may not align well with the downstream 3D
point cloud analysis tasks, leading to degraded performance. To address such an
issue, we propose the Domain-Adaptive Point Cloud Masked Autoencoder (DAP-MAE),
an MAE pre-training method, to adaptively integrate the knowledge of
cross-domain datasets for general point cloud analysis. In DAP-MAE, we design a
heterogeneous domain adapter that utilizes an adaptation mode during
pre-training, enabling the model to comprehensively learn information from
point clouds across different domains, while employing a fusion mode in the
fine-tuning to enhance point cloud features. Meanwhile, DAP-MAE incorporates a
domain feature generator to guide the adaptation of point cloud features to
various downstream tasks. With only one pre-training, DAP-MAE achieves
excellent performance across four different point cloud analysis tasks,
reaching 95.18% in object classification on ScanObjectNN and 88.45% in facial
expression recognition on Bosphorus.

*Han Yang,Guangjun Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Gompertz-CNN is a dynamic knowledge distillation framework that uses the Gompertz growth model to adjust distillation loss weights based on student learning stages, achieving significant accuracy improvements over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional knowledge distillation methods fail to capture the evolving cognitive capacity of student models during training, leading to suboptimal knowledge transfer.

Method: Proposes a stage-aware distillation strategy using the Gompertz curve to dynamically adjust distillation loss weights, incorporating Wasserstein distance for feature-level discrepancies and gradient matching for backward propagation alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show Gompertz-CNN outperforms traditional distillation methods, achieving up to 8% accuracy gain on CIFAR-10 and 4% on CIFAR-100 across various teacher-student architectures.

Conclusion: The Gompertz-CNN framework effectively addresses limitations of traditional knowledge distillation by dynamically adapting to student learning progression, resulting in superior performance across multiple datasets and architectures.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel dynamic knowledge distillation framework,
Gompertz-CNN, which integrates the Gompertz growth model into the training
process to address the limitations of traditional knowledge distillation.
Conventional methods often fail to capture the evolving cognitive capacity of
student models, leading to suboptimal knowledge transfer. To overcome this, we
propose a stage-aware distillation strategy that dynamically adjusts the weight
of distillation loss based on the Gompertz curve, reflecting the student's
learning progression: slow initial growth, rapid mid-phase improvement, and
late-stage saturation. Our framework incorporates Wasserstein distance to
measure feature-level discrepancies and gradient matching to align backward
propagation behaviors between teacher and student models. These components are
unified under a multi-loss objective, where the Gompertz curve modulates the
influence of distillation losses over time. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10
and CIFAR-100 using various teacher-student architectures (e.g., ResNet50 and
MobileNet_v2) demonstrate that Gompertz-CNN consistently outperforms
traditional distillation methods, achieving up to 8% and 4% accuracy gains on
CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, respectively.

TL;DR: Group Inertial Poser uses sparse wearable IMUs and UWB ranging to track multiple people's full-body motion and global trajectories by fusing inertial data with inter-person distance measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of vision-based motion capture (occlusion, environmental instrumentation) and address IMU-only tracking's weaknesses in translation estimates and relative positioning between individuals.

Method: Fuses ultra-wideband ranging (UWB) distances between sensors with inertial observations using structured state-space models, plus a novel two-step optimization for global trajectory tracking.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and robustness across synthetic and real-world data, using the new GIP-DB dataset with 200 minutes of two-person motion recordings.

Conclusion: Shows promise for IMU+UWB-based multi-human motion capture in real-world environments, enabling robust tracking without environmental instrumentation.

Abstract: Tracking human full-body motion using sparse wearable inertial measurement
units (IMUs) overcomes the limitations of occlusion and instrumentation of the
environment inherent in vision-based approaches. However, purely IMU-based
tracking compromises translation estimates and accurate relative positioning
between individuals, as inertial cues are inherently self-referential and
provide no direct spatial reference for others. In this paper, we present a
novel approach for robustly estimating body poses and global translation for
multiple individuals by leveraging the distances between sparse wearable
sensors - both on each individual and across multiple individuals. Our method
Group Inertial Poser estimates these absolute distances between pairs of
sensors from ultra-wideband ranging (UWB) and fuses them with inertial
observations as input into structured state-space models to integrate temporal
motion patterns for precise 3D pose estimation. Our novel two-step optimization
further leverages the estimated distances for accurately tracking people's
global trajectories through the world. We also introduce GIP-DB, the first
IMU+UWB dataset for two-person tracking, which comprises 200 minutes of motion
recordings from 14 participants. In our evaluation, Group Inertial Poser
outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and robustness across
synthetic and real-world data, showing the promise of IMU+UWB-based multi-human

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a systematic study of Long-Tail Recognition (LTR) methods for species recognition on the NACTI dataset, achieving 99.40% Top-1 accuracy and demonstrating improved generalization under domain shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The NACTI dataset shows severe long-tailed class imbalance (largest class covers >50% of 3.7M images), which motivates the need for specialized LTR methodologies to handle this common issue in wildlife data collections.

Method: Systematic study of LTR methodologies including various loss functions and LTR-sensitive regularization, building on PyTorch Wildlife model. Also evaluates domain shifts using a Reduced-Bias Test set from ENA-Detection dataset.

Result: Best configuration achieves 99.40% Top-1 accuracy on NACTI test data (vs 95.51% baseline), and 52.55% accuracy on Reduced-Bias Test set (vs 51.20% with WCE loss). Shows consistent improvements with LTR-enhancing scheduler choices.

Conclusion: LTR methods significantly improve performance on long-tailed wildlife datasets and demonstrate stronger generalization under distribution shift, though they cannot fully address catastrophic breakdown for 'Tail' classes under severe domain shift.

Abstract: As most ''in the wild'' data collections of the natural world, the North
America Camera Trap Images (NACTI) dataset shows severe long-tailed class
imbalance, noting that the largest 'Head' class alone covers >50% of the 3.7M
images in the corpus. Building on the PyTorch Wildlife model, we present a
systematic study of Long-Tail Recognition methodologies for species recognition
on the NACTI dataset covering experiments on various LTR loss functions plus
LTR-sensitive regularisation. Our best configuration achieves 99.40% Top-1
accuracy on our NACTI test data split, substantially improving over a 95.51%
baseline using standard cross-entropy with Adam. This also improves on
previously reported top performance in MLWIC2 at 96.8% albeit using partly
unpublished (potentially different) partitioning, optimiser, and evaluation
protocols. To evaluate domain shifts (e.g. night-time captures, occlusion,
motion-blur) towards other datasets we construct a Reduced-Bias Test set from
the ENA-Detection dataset where our experimentally optimised long-tail enhanced
model achieves leading 52.55% accuracy (up from 51.20% with WCE loss),
demonstrating stronger generalisation capabilities under distribution shift. We
document the consistent improvements of LTR-enhancing scheduler choices in this
NACTI wildlife domain, particularly when in tandem with state-of-the-art LTR
losses. We finally discuss qualitative and quantitative shortcomings that LTR
methods cannot sufficiently address, including catastrophic breakdown for
'Tail' classes under severe domain shift. For maximum reproducibility we
publish all dataset splits, key code, and full network weights.

*Aarav Shetty,Gary B Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unsupervised classification of synapses in EM images using spatial proximity as a similarity measure, without requiring predefined classes or ground truth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional synapse classification requires supervised learning with labeled examples, which limits discovery of new synapse types and requires prior knowledge of class numbers.

Method: Use spatial proximity as similarity metric - nearby synapses in same neuron are more similar than random synapses from different cells. Apply this unsupervised approach to Drosophila data.

Result: Successfully separates synapses into classes without knowing the number of types in advance. Provides principled way to select ground-truth spanning synapse structure range.

Conclusion: Proposed unsupervised method enables synapse classification without predefined classes, offering advantages for discovering new synapse types and establishing ground-truth selection.

Abstract: Separating synapses into different classes based on their appearance in EM
images has many applications in biology. Examples may include assigning a
neurotransmitter to a particular class, or separating synapses whose strength
can be modulated from those whose strength is fixed. Traditionally, this has
been done in a supervised manner, giving the classification algorithm examples
of the different classes. Here we instead separate synapses into classes based
only on the observation that nearby synapses in the same neuron are likely more
similar than synapses chosen randomly from different cells. We apply our
methodology to data from {\it Drosophila}. Our approach has the advantage that
the number of synapse types does not need to be known in advance. It may also
provide a principled way to select ground-truth that spans the range of synapse
structure.

TL;DR: This study evaluates UNI and Virchow2 foundation models for classifying whole-slide images into melanocytic, basaloid, and squamous lesions using patch-level embeddings aggregated via mean-aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid generation of whole-slide images in dermatopathology necessitates automated methods for efficient processing and accurate classification.

Method: Used UNI and Virchow2 as feature extractors, aggregated patch-level embeddings into slide-level features using mean-aggregation, and trained multiple classifiers including logistic regression, gradient-boosted trees, and random forest models.

Result: Virchow2 outperformed UNI across most classifiers, with logistic regression achieving 90% accuracy for Virchow2 (though not statistically significant). Mean-aggregation provided reliable slide-level feature representations.

Conclusion: Foundation models show potential for automated WSI classification, providing a scalable approach for dermatopathological diagnosis and paving the way for slide-level representation learning advancements.

Abstract: The rapid generation of whole-slide images (WSIs) in dermatopathology
necessitates automated methods for efficient processing and accurate
classification. This study evaluates the performance of two foundation models,
UNI and Virchow2, as feature extractors for classifying WSIs into three
diagnostic categories: melanocytic, basaloid, and squamous lesions. Patch-level
embeddings were aggregated into slide-level features using a mean-aggregation
strategy and subsequently used to train multiple machine learning classifiers,
including logistic regression, gradient-boosted trees, and random forest
models. Performance was assessed using precision, recall, true positive rate,
false positive rate, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic
curve (AUROC) on the test set. Results demonstrate that patch-level features
extracted using Virchow2 outperformed those extracted via UNI across most
slide-level classifiers, with logistic regression achieving the highest
accuracy (90%) for Virchow2, though the difference was not statistically
significant. The study also explored data augmentation techniques and image
normalization to enhance model robustness and generalizability. The
mean-aggregation approach provided reliable slide-level feature
representations. All experimental results and metrics were tracked and
visualized using WandB.ai, facilitating reproducibility and interpretability.

TL;DR: WorldGrow is a hierarchical framework for infinite 3D scene generation that leverages pre-trained 3D models to create large, continuous environments with coherent geometry and realistic appearance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods have limitations: 2D-lifting approaches suffer from inconsistencies, 3D implicit representations are hard to scale, and current 3D foundation models are mostly object-centric, limiting scene-level generation.

Method: Three core components: (1) data curation pipeline for high-quality scene blocks, (2) 3D block inpainting for context-aware scene extension, and (3) coarse-to-fine generation strategy for global layout plausibility and local fidelity.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance in geometry reconstruction on 3D-FRONT dataset and uniquely supports infinite scene generation with photorealistic and structurally consistent outputs.

Conclusion: WorldGrow demonstrates capability for constructing large-scale virtual environments and has potential for building future world models.

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of generating the infinitely extendable 3D world --
large, continuous environments with coherent geometry and realistic appearance.
Existing methods face key challenges: 2D-lifting approaches suffer from
geometric and appearance inconsistencies across views, 3D implicit
representations are hard to scale up, and current 3D foundation models are
mostly object-centric, limiting their applicability to scene-level generation.
Our key insight is leveraging strong generation priors from pre-trained 3D
models for structured scene block generation. To this end, we propose
WorldGrow, a hierarchical framework for unbounded 3D scene synthesis. Our
method features three core components: (1) a data curation pipeline that
extracts high-quality scene blocks for training, making the 3D structured
latent representations suitable for scene generation; (2) a 3D block inpainting
mechanism that enables context-aware scene extension; and (3) a coarse-to-fine
generation strategy that ensures both global layout plausibility and local
geometric/textural fidelity. Evaluated on the large-scale 3D-FRONT dataset,
WorldGrow achieves SOTA performance in geometry reconstruction, while uniquely
supporting infinite scene generation with photorealistic and structurally
consistent outputs. These results highlight its capability for constructing
large-scale virtual environments and potential for building future world
models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper applies post-hoc explanation methods to neural network-based seal detection in aerial imagery to build trust and identify model limitations for ecological monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of trust in black-box neural network models for ecological research and conservation monitoring by providing interpretable evidence for predictions and documenting deployment limitations.

Method: Used Faster R-CNN to detect harbor seals in aerial imagery from Glacier Bay National Park, and generated explanations using gradient-based class activation mapping (HiResCAM, LayerCAM), LIME, and perturbation-based explanations.

Result: Explanations focused on seal torsos and contours rather than background, removal of seals reduced detection confidence, and analysis revealed systematic errors like confusion between seals and black ice/rocks.

Conclusion: Pairing object detection with post-hoc explainability enables moving beyond black-box predictions toward auditable, decision-supporting tools for conservation monitoring, with actionable next steps for model improvement.

Abstract: Computer vision can accelerate ecological research and conservation
monitoring, yet adoption in ecology lags in part because of a lack of trust in
black-box neural-network-based models. We seek to address this challenge by
applying post-hoc explanations to provide evidence for predictions and document
limitations that are important to field deployment. Using aerial imagery from
Glacier Bay National Park, we train a Faster R-CNN to detect pinnipeds (harbor
seals) and generate explanations via gradient-based class activation mapping
(HiResCAM, LayerCAM), local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME),
and perturbation-based explanations. We assess explanations along three axes
relevant to field use: (i) localization fidelity: whether high-attribution
regions coincide with the animal rather than background context; (ii)
faithfulness: whether deletion/insertion tests produce changes in detector
confidence; and (iii) diagnostic utility: whether explanations reveal
systematic failure modes. Explanations concentrate on seal torsos and contours
rather than surrounding ice/rock, and removal of the seals reduces detection
confidence, providing model-evidence for true positives. The analysis also
uncovers recurrent error sources, including confusion between seals and black
ice and rocks. We translate these findings into actionable next steps for model
development, including more targeted data curation and augmentation. By pairing
object detection with post-hoc explainability, we can move beyond "black-box"
predictions toward auditable, decision-supporting tools for conservation
monitoring.

### [70] [BachVid: Training-Free Video Generation with Consistent Background and Character](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21696)
*Han Yan,Xibin Song,Yifu Wang,Hongdong Li,Pan Ji,Chao Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BachVid is a training-free method that achieves consistent video generation without reference images by analyzing DiT's attention mechanism and injecting cached intermediate variables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for consistent video generation rely on reference images or extensive training, and often only address character consistency while leaving background consistency to image-to-video models.

Method: Systematic analysis of DiT's attention mechanism to extract foreground masks and identify matching points, then caching intermediate variables from an identity video and injecting them into new videos.

Result: BachVid achieves robust consistency in generated videos without requiring additional training or reference images.

Conclusion: BachVid offers a novel and efficient solution for consistent video generation that works for both foreground and background consistency without training or reference images.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently driven significant progress in
text-to-video (T2V) generation. However, generating multiple videos with
consistent characters and backgrounds remains a significant challenge. Existing
methods typically rely on reference images or extensive training, and often
only address character consistency, leaving background consistency to
image-to-video models. We introduce BachVid, the first training-free method
that achieves consistent video generation without needing any reference images.
Our approach is based on a systematic analysis of DiT's attention mechanism and
intermediate features, revealing its ability to extract foreground masks and
identify matching points during the denoising process. Our method leverages
this finding by first generating an identity video and caching the intermediate
variables, and then inject these cached variables into corresponding positions
in newly generated videos, ensuring both foreground and background consistency
across multiple videos. Experimental results demonstrate that BachVid achieves
robust consistency in generated videos without requiring additional training,
offering a novel and efficient solution for consistent video generation without
relying on reference images or additional training.

### [71] [Visual Diffusion Models are Geometric Solvers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21697)
*Nir Goren,Shai Yehezkel,Omer Dahary,Andrey Voynov,Or Patashnik,Daniel Cohen-Or*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Visual diffusion models can solve hard geometric problems by treating them as image generation tasks, demonstrating effectiveness on the Inscribed Square Problem, Steiner Tree Problem, and Simple Polygon Problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge generative modeling and geometric problem solving by showing that standard visual diffusion models can directly reason about geometric problems in pixel space without specialized architectures.

Method: Treat geometric problem instances as images and train standard visual diffusion models to transform Gaussian noise into images representing valid approximate solutions that match exact ones.

Result: The model successfully learns to transform noisy geometric structures into correct configurations, effectively solving three challenging geometric problems through image generation.

Conclusion: Operating in image space provides a general framework for approximating notoriously hard geometric problems and opens doors to tackling a wider class of challenging geometric tasks.

Abstract: In this paper we show that visual diffusion models can serve as effective
geometric solvers: they can directly reason about geometric problems by working
in pixel space. We first demonstrate this on the Inscribed Square Problem, a
long-standing problem in geometry that asks whether every Jordan curve contains
four points forming a square. We then extend the approach to two other
well-known hard geometric problems: the Steiner Tree Problem and the Simple
Polygon Problem.
  Our method treats each problem instance as an image and trains a standard
visual diffusion model that transforms Gaussian noise into an image
representing a valid approximate solution that closely matches the exact one.
The model learns to transform noisy geometric structures into correct
configurations, effectively recasting geometric reasoning as image generation.
  Unlike prior work that necessitates specialized architectures and
domain-specific adaptations when applying diffusion to parametric geometric
representations, we employ a standard visual diffusion model that operates on
the visual representation of the problem. This simplicity highlights a
surprising bridge between generative modeling and geometric problem solving.
Beyond the specific problems studied here, our results point toward a broader
paradigm: operating in image space provides a general and practical framework
for approximating notoriously hard problems, and opens the door to tackling a
far wider class of challenging geometric tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An automated framework using self-reflective agents to detect visual attribute dependencies in vision models through iterative hypothesis generation and testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To detect unintended reliance on specific visual features in vision models, which is critical for ensuring model robustness, preventing overfitting, and avoiding spurious correlations.

Method: A self-reflective agent that systematically generates and tests hypotheses about visual attributes, iteratively refining hypotheses based on experimental outcomes and using self-evaluation to assess findings.

Result: The agent's performance consistently improves with self-reflection, showing significant performance increase over non-reflective baselines on a benchmark of 130 models across 18 categories. It identifies real-world dependencies in state-of-the-art models like CLIP's vision encoder and YOLOv8.

Conclusion: The self-reflective framework effectively detects visual attribute dependencies in vision models, with iterative reflection significantly enhancing performance over non-reflective approaches.

Abstract: When a vision model performs image recognition, which visual attributes drive
its predictions? Detecting unintended reliance on specific visual features is
critical for ensuring model robustness, preventing overfitting, and avoiding
spurious correlations. We introduce an automated framework for detecting such
dependencies in trained vision models. At the core of our method is a
self-reflective agent that systematically generates and tests hypotheses about
visual attributes that a model may rely on. This process is iterative: the
agent refines its hypotheses based on experimental outcomes and uses a
self-evaluation protocol to assess whether its findings accurately explain
model behavior. When inconsistencies arise, the agent self-reflects over its
findings and triggers a new cycle of experimentation. We evaluate our approach
on a novel benchmark of 130 models designed to exhibit diverse visual attribute
dependencies across 18 categories. Our results show that the agent's
performance consistently improves with self-reflection, with a significant
performance increase over non-reflective baselines. We further demonstrate that
the agent identifies real-world visual attribute dependencies in
state-of-the-art models, including CLIP's vision encoder and the YOLOv8 object
detector.
