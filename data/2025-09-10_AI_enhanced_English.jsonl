In this paper, we present\nVIsual Representation ALignment (VIRAL), a simple yet effective regularization\nstrategy that aligns the internal visual representations of MLLMs with those of\npre-trained vision foundation models (VFMs). By explicitly enforcing this\nalignment, VIRAL enables the model not only to retain critical visual details\nfrom the input vision encoder but also to complement additional visual\nknowledge from VFMs, thereby enhancing its ability to reason over complex\nvisual inputs. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across all\ntasks on widely adopted multimodal benchmarks. Furthermore, we conduct\ncomprehensive ablation studies to validate the key design choices underlying\nour framework.
