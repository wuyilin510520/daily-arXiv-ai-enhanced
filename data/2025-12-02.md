Abstract: The use of tiny devices capable of low-latency gesture recognition is gaining momentum in everyday human-computer interaction and especially in medical monitoring fields. Embedded solutions such as fall detection, rehabilitation tracking, and patient supervision require fast and efficient tracking of movements while avoiding unwanted false alarms. This study presents an efficient solution on how to build very efficient motion-based models only using triaxial accelerometer sensors. We explore the capability of the AutoML pipelines to extract the most important features from the data segments. This approach also involves training multiple lightweight machine learning algorithms using the extracted features. We use WeBe Band, a multi-sensor wearable device that is equipped with a powerful enough MCU to effectively perform gesture recognition entirely on the device. Of the models explored, we found that the neural network provided the best balance between accuracy, latency, and memory use. Our results also demonstrate that reliable real-time gesture recognition can be achieved in WeBe Band, with great potential for real-time medical monitoring solutions that require a secure and fast response time.

Conclusion: Data-centric framework with carefully curated, curriculum-grounded multimodal data can elevate supervised fine-tuning to near state-of-the-art performance, establishing path for advancing open-weight vision-language models.

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning has become a cornerstone of modern AI research. Standardized exam questions offer a uniquely rigorous testbed for such reasoning, providing structured visual contexts and verifiable answers. While recent progress has largely focused on algorithmic advances such as reinforcement learning (e.g., GRPO, DPO), the data centric foundations of vision language reasoning remain less explored.
  We show that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with high-quality data can rival proprietary approaches. To this end, we compile a 161.4 million token multimodal dataset combining textbook question-solution pairs, curriculum aligned diagrams, and contextual materials, and fine-tune Qwen-2.5VL-32B using an optimized reasoning syntax (QMSA). The resulting model achieves 78.6% accuracy, only 1.0% below Gemini 2.0 Flash, on our newly released benchmark YKSUniform, which standardizes 1,854 multimodal exam questions across 309 curriculum topics.
  Our results reveal that data composition and representational syntax play a decisive role in multimodal reasoning. This work establishes a data centric framework for advancing open weight vision language models, demonstrating that carefully curated and curriculum-grounded multimodal data can elevate supervised fine-tuning to near state-of-the-art performance.

### [5] [Satellite to Street : Disaster Impact Estimator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00065)
*Sreesritha Sai,Sai Venkata Suma Sreeja,Deepthi,Nikhil*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning framework called Satellite-to-Street uses dual-input U-Net with enhanced feature fusion to create pixel-level damage maps from pre- and post-disaster satellite imagery, addressing class imbalance and subtle structural variations for better disaster assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual satellite imagery interpretation for post-disaster damage assessment is slow, subjective, and hard to scale. Existing deep learning models struggle with subtle structural variations and severe class imbalance, leading to poor detection of highly damaged regions.

Method: Proposes Satellite-to-Street: Disaster Impact Estimator using a modified dual-input U-Net architecture with enhanced feature fusion to capture both local structural changes and broader contextual cues. Integrates class-aware weighted loss functions to handle dominance of undamaged pixels in real disaster datasets.

Result: Experiments on publicly available disaster datasets show improved localization and classification of structural damage compared to traditional segmentation and baseline change-detection models.

Conclusion: The framework provides rapid, consistent damage assessment to support (not replace) expert decision-making, enabling more efficient, data-driven disaster management through fine-grained pixel-level damage maps.

Abstract: Accurate post-disaster damage assessment is of high importance for prioritizing emergency response; however, manual interpretation of satellite imagery is slow, subjective, and hard to scale. While deep-learning models for image segmentation, such as U-Net-based baselines and change-detection models, are useful baselines, they often struggle with subtle structural variations and severe class imbalance, yielding poor detection of highly damaged regions. The present work proposes a deep-learning framework that jointly processes pre- and post-disaster satellite images to obtain fine-grained pixel-level damage maps: Satellite-to-Street: Disaster Impact Estimator. The model uses a modified dual-input U-Net architecture with enhanced feature fusion to capture both the local structural changes as well as the broader contextual cues. Class-aware weighted loss functions are integrated in order to handle the dominance of undamaged pixels in real disaster datasets, thus enhancing sensitivity toward major and destroyed categories. Experimentation on publicly available disaster datasets shows improved localization and classification of structural damage when compared to traditional segmentation and baseline change-detection models. The resulting damage maps provide a rapid and consistent assessment mechanism to support and not replace expert decision-making, thus allowing more efficient, data-driven disaster management.

### [6] [ProvRain: Rain-Adaptive Denoising and Vehicle Detection via MobileNet-UNet and Faster R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00073)
*Aswinkumar Varathakumaran,Nirmala Paramanandham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProvRain pipeline improves night-time vehicle detection in rainy conditions using MobileNet-U-Net denoising with curricula training, achieving significant accuracy and recall improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Night-time vehicle detection faces challenges with noise from weather conditions (rain/snow) and camera issues, which degrade detection accuracy before vehicles appear directly in camera view.

Method: Developed ProvRain pipeline using lightweight MobileNet-U-Net architecture with curricula training to handle noise. Used synthetic and PVDN dataset data, compared against Faster RCNN baseline.

Result: 8.94% accuracy increase and 10.25% recall improvement for vehicle detection in rainy night conditions. MobileNet-U-Net showed 10-15% PSNR improvement, 5-6% SSIM increase, and up to 67% reduction in perceptual error (LPIPS) compared to transformer approaches.

Conclusion: The ProvRain pipeline effectively addresses noise issues in night-time vehicle detection while maintaining accuracy, demonstrating significant performance improvements over baseline methods in challenging weather conditions.

Abstract: Provident vehicle detection has a lot of scope in the detection of vehicle during night time. The extraction of features other than the headlamps of vehicles allows us to detect oncoming vehicles before they appear directly on the camera. However, it faces multiple issues especially in the field of night vision, where a lot of noise caused due to weather conditions such as rain or snow as well as camera conditions. This paper focuses on creating a pipeline aimed at dealing with such noise while at the same time maintaining the accuracy of provident vehicular detection. The pipeline in this paper, ProvRain, uses a lightweight MobileNet-U-Net architecture tuned to generalize to robust weather conditions by using the concept of curricula training. A mix of synthetic as well as available data from the PVDN dataset is used for this. This pipeline is compared to the base Faster RCNN architecture trained on the PVDN dataset to see how much the addition of a denoising architecture helps increase the detection model's performance in rainy conditions. The system boasts an 8.94\% increase in accuracy and a 10.25\% increase in recall in the detection of vehicles in rainy night time frames. Similarly, the custom MobileNet-U-Net architecture that was trained also shows a 10-15\% improvement in PSNR, a 5-6\% increase in SSIM, and upto a 67\% reduction in perceptual error (LPIPS) compared to other transformer approaches.

### [7] [Adapter Shield: A Unified Framework with Built-in Authentication for Preventing Unauthorized Zero-Shot Image-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00075)
*Jun Jia,Hongyi Miao,Yingjie Zhou,Wangqiu Zhou,Jianbo Zhang,Linhan Cao,Dandan Zhu,Hua Yang,Xiongkuo Min,Wei Sun,Guangtao Zhai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Adapter Shield is a universal defense system that protects personal images from misuse in zero-shot image generation by encrypting image embeddings and using adversarial perturbations to distort unauthorized outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zero-shot image-to-image generation enables high-fidelity replication of faces and artistic styles without model modifications, but this creates serious intellectual property risks including unauthorized identity cloning and stylistic imitation. Current methods lack effective protection against these threats.

Method: The method analyzes how zero-shot generation uses image encoders to extract embeddings fed into diffusion models via cross-attention. It creates a reversible encryption system that maps original embeddings to encrypted representations using secret keys. For protection, it uses multi-target adversarial perturbations to shift embeddings toward encrypted patterns, ensuring unauthorized users get distorted outputs while authorized users can decrypt with correct keys.

Result: Extensive evaluations show the method surpasses existing state-of-the-art defenses in blocking unauthorized zero-shot image synthesis while supporting flexible and secure access control for verified users.

Conclusion: Adapter Shield provides the first universal and authentication-integrated solution for defending personal images against misuse in zero-shot generation scenarios, effectively balancing protection with authorized access.

Abstract: With the rapid progress in diffusion models, image synthesis has advanced to the stage of zero-shot image-to-image generation, where high-fidelity replication of facial identities or artistic styles can be achieved using just one portrait or artwork, without modifying any model weights. Although these techniques significantly enhance creative possibilities, they also pose substantial risks related to intellectual property violations, including unauthorized identity cloning and stylistic imitation. To counter such threats, this work presents Adapter Shield, the first universal and authentication-integrated solution aimed at defending personal images from misuse in zero-shot generation scenarios. We first investigate how current zero-shot methods employ image encoders to extract embeddings from input images, which are subsequently fed into the UNet of diffusion models through cross-attention layers. Inspired by this mechanism, we construct a reversible encryption system that maps original embeddings into distinct encrypted representations according to different secret keys. The authorized users can restore the authentic embeddings via a decryption module and the correct key, enabling normal usage for authorized generation tasks. For protection purposes, we design a multi-target adversarial perturbation method that actively shifts the original embeddings toward designated encrypted patterns. Consequently, protected images are embedded with a defensive layer that ensures unauthorized users can only produce distorted or encrypted outputs. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method surpasses existing state-of-the-art defenses in blocking unauthorized zero-shot image synthesis, while supporting flexible and secure access control for verified users.

*Mario de Jesus da Graca,Jörg Dahlkemper,Peer Stelldinger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Using diffusion models to generate synthetic brightfield microscopy images improves cell detection accuracy while reducing annotation costs, with synthetic images being indistinguishable from real ones by experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data scarcity and annotation bottlenecks in brightfield microscopy limit deep learning progress for single cell detection, creating need for synthetic data generation methods.

Method: Trained U-Net based diffusion model to generate synthetic brightfield microscopy images, created datasets with varying synthetic/real ratios, and tested with YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and RT-DETR object detectors.

Result: Synthetic data improved detection accuracies at minimal cost; human experts couldn't distinguish synthetic from real images (50% accuracy); diffusion-based generation effectively augments real datasets.

Conclusion: Diffusion-based synthetic data generation is promising for microscopy image analysis, reducing manual annotation reliance and potentially improving cell detection model robustness.

Abstract: Accurate single cell detection in brightfield microscopy is crucial for biological research, yet data scarcity and annotation bottlenecks limit the progress of deep learning methods. We investigate the use of unconditional models to generate synthetic brightfield microscopy images and evaluate their impact on object detection performance. A U-Net based diffusion model was trained and used to create datasets with varying ratios of synthetic and real images. Experiments with YOLOv8, YOLOv9 and RT-DETR reveal that training with synthetic data can achieve improved detection accuracies (at minimal costs). A human expert survey demonstrates the high realism of generated images, with experts not capable to distinguish them from real microscopy images (accuracy 50%). Our findings suggest that diffusion-based synthetic data generation is a promising avenue for augmenting real datasets in microscopy image analysis, reducing the reliance on extensive manual annotation and potentially improving the robustness of cell detection models.

### [9] [Conceptual Evaluation of Deep Visual Stereo Odometry for the MARWIN Radiation Monitoring Robot in Accelerator Tunnels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00080)
*André Dehne,Juri Zach,Peer Stelldinger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MARWIN robot at European XFEL needs better navigation for accelerator tunnels. Current lidar/QR-code system lacks flexibility. Paper proposes deep visual stereo odometry (DVSO) as vision-based alternative for more autonomous navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MARWIN navigation system (lidar-based edge detection + wheel/lidar odometry + QR-code referencing) works in predefined sections but lacks flexibility for unknown geometries and obstacles in long, monotonous accelerator tunnels.

Method: Proposes deep visual stereo odometry (DVSO) using stereo disparity, optical flow, and self-supervised learning to jointly estimate depth and ego-motion without labeled data. Can be fused with absolute references or other sensors for global consistency.

Result: Conceptual evaluation for accelerator tunnel environments (using European XFEL case study). Expected benefits: reduced scale drift via stereo, low-cost sensing, scalable data collection. Challenges: low-texture surfaces, lighting variability, computational load, radiation robustness.

Conclusion: DVSO shows promise for enabling MARWIN to navigate more autonomously in constrained, safety-critical infrastructures. Paper defines research agenda to address remaining challenges.

Abstract: The MARWIN robot operates at the European XFEL to perform autonomous radiation monitoring in long, monotonous accelerator tunnels where conventional localization approaches struggle. Its current navigation concept combines lidar-based edge detection, wheel/lidar odometry with periodic QR-code referencing, and fuzzy control of wall distance, rotation, and longitudinal position. While robust in predefined sections, this design lacks flexibility for unknown geometries and obstacles. This paper explores deep visual stereo odometry (DVSO) with 3D-geometric constraints as a focused alternative. DVSO is purely vision-based, leveraging stereo disparity, optical flow, and self-supervised learning to jointly estimate depth and ego-motion without labeled data. For global consistency, DVSO can subsequently be fused with absolute references (e.g., landmarks) or other sensors. We provide a conceptual evaluation for accelerator tunnel environments, using the European XFEL as a case study. Expected benefits include reduced scale drift via stereo, low-cost sensing, and scalable data collection, while challenges remain in low-texture surfaces, lighting variability, computational load, and robustness under radiation. The paper defines a research agenda toward enabling MARWIN to navigate more autonomously in constrained, safety-critical infrastructures.

*Divendar Murtadak,Yoon Kim,Trilokya Akula*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diagnostic prompting improves MLLM reliability for visual complexity assessment of Amazon search results pages, showing 858% relative improvement in F1-score, though absolute performance remains modest with persistent challenges in visual perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether diagnostic prompting can improve Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) reliability for visual complexity assessment of Amazon Search Results Pages (SRP), addressing the gap between MLLM and human expert judgments.

Method: Compared diagnostic prompting with standard gestalt principles-based prompting using 200 Amazon SRP pages and human expert annotations, analyzed decision trees to understand reasoning patterns, and conducted failure case analysis.

Result: Diagnostic prompting showed notable improvements with F1-score increasing from 0.031 to 0.297 (+858% relative improvement), though absolute performance remains modest (Cohen's κ = 0.071). Models prioritize visual design elements (badge clutter: 38.6% importance) while humans emphasize content similarity.

Conclusion: Diagnostic prompting represents a promising initial step toward human-aligned MLLM-based evaluation, but persistent challenges in visual perception (particularly for product similarity and color intensity assessment) require continued research and refinement with larger ground truth datasets for reliable practical deployment.

Abstract: This study investigates whether diagnostic prompting can improve Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) reliability for visual complexity assessment of Amazon Search Results Pages (SRP). We compare diagnostic prompting with standard gestalt principles-based prompting using 200 Amazon SRP pages and human expert annotations. Diagnostic prompting showed notable improvements in predicting human complexity judgments, with F1-score increasing from 0.031 to 0.297 (+858\% relative improvement), though absolute performance remains modest (Cohen's $κ$ = 0.071). The decision tree revealed that models prioritize visual design elements (badge clutter: 38.6\% importance) while humans emphasize content similarity, suggesting partial alignment in reasoning patterns. Failure case analysis reveals persistent challenges in MLLM visual perception, particularly for product similarity and color intensity assessment. Our findings indicate that diagnostic prompting represents a promising initial step toward human-aligned MLLM-based evaluation, though failure cases with consistent human-MLLM disagreement require continued research and refinement in prompting approaches with larger ground truth datasets for reliable practical deployment.

### [11] [A Fast and Efficient Modern BERT based Text-Conditioned Diffusion Model for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00084)
*Venkata Siddharth Dhara,Pawan Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastTextDiff is a label-efficient diffusion-based segmentation model that integrates medical text annotations to enhance semantic representations, using ModernBERT instead of Clinical BioBERT for improved efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional diffusion-based segmentation models require dense pixel-wise labels that are expensive, time-consuming, and require expert knowledge. There's a need for more label-efficient approaches that can leverage existing medical text annotations.

Method: Proposes FastTextDiff which integrates medical text annotations via ModernBERT (a transformer for long clinical notes) to guide cross-modal attention between visual and textual features. Uses FlashAttention 2, alternating attention mechanism, and trained on MIMIC-III/IV datasets.

Result: FastTextDiff improves both segmentation accuracy and training efficiency over traditional diffusion-based models. ModernBERT proves to be a fast, scalable alternative to Clinical BioBERT in diffusion-based segmentation pipelines.

Conclusion: The study highlights the promise of multi-modal techniques for medical image analysis and demonstrates that integrating text annotations with diffusion models can create more label-efficient segmentation systems.

Abstract: In recent times, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have proven effective for medical image generation and denoising, and as representation learners for downstream segmentation. However, segmentation performance is limited by the need for dense pixel-wise labels, which are expensive, time-consuming, and require expert knowledge. We propose FastTextDiff, a label-efficient diffusion-based segmentation model that integrates medical text annotations to enhance semantic representations. Our approach uses ModernBERT, a transformer capable of processing long clinical notes, to tightly link textual annotations with semantic content in medical images. Trained on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV, ModernBERT encodes clinical knowledge that guides cross-modal attention between visual and textual features. This study validates ModernBERT as a fast, scalable alternative to Clinical BioBERT in diffusion-based segmentation pipelines and highlights the promise of multi-modal techniques for medical image analysis. By replacing Clinical BioBERT with ModernBERT, FastTextDiff benefits from FlashAttention 2, an alternating attention mechanism, and a 2-trillion-token corpus, improving both segmentation accuracy and training efficiency over traditional diffusion-based models.

### [12] [Multi-modal On-Device Learning for Monocular Depth Estimation on Ultra-low-power MCUs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00086)
*Davide Nadalini,Manuele Rusci,Elia Cereda,Luca Benini,Francesco Conti,Daniele Palossi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: On-device learning for monocular depth estimation on ultra-low-power IoT devices using sparse updates and multi-modal pseudo-labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address domain shift problem in monocular depth estimation on ULP IoT platforms where limited model parameters cause accuracy drops when sensor data differs from training data.

Method: Multi-modal on-device learning with tiny μPyD-Net model (107k params), depth sensor activation for pseudo-label collection, and novel memory-driven sparse update scheme to minimize fine-tuning memory to 1.2MB.

Result: ODL performed in 17.8 minutes on IoT node, reducing RMSE from 4.9m to 0.6m with only 3k self-labeled samples; only 2% and 1.5% accuracy drops on KITTI and NYUv2 datasets.

Conclusion: First demonstration of practical on-device learning for MDE on IoT platforms, enabling adaptation to new environments with minimal energy consumption and memory overhead.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation (MDE) plays a crucial role in enabling spatially-aware applications in Ultra-low-power (ULP) Internet-of-Things (IoT) platforms. However, the limited number of parameters of Deep Neural Networks for the MDE task, designed for IoT nodes, results in severe accuracy drops when the sensor data observed in the field shifts significantly from the training dataset. To address this domain shift problem, we present a multi-modal On-Device Learning (ODL) technique, deployed on an IoT device integrating a Greenwaves GAP9 MicroController Unit (MCU), a 80 mW monocular camera and a 8 x 8 pixel depth sensor, consuming $\approx$300mW. In its normal operation, this setup feeds a tiny 107 k-parameter $μ$PyD-Net model with monocular images for inference. The depth sensor, usually deactivated to minimize energy consumption, is only activated alongside the camera to collect pseudo-labels when the system is placed in a new environment. Then, the fine-tuning task is performed entirely on the MCU, using the new data. To optimize our backpropagation-based on-device training, we introduce a novel memory-driven sparse update scheme, which minimizes the fine-tuning memory to 1.2 MB, 2.2x less than a full update, while preserving accuracy (i.e., only 2% and 1.5% drops on the KITTI and NYUv2 datasets). Our in-field tests demonstrate, for the first time, that ODL for MDE can be performed in 17.8 minutes on the IoT node, reducing the root mean squared error from 4.9 to 0.6m with only 3 k self-labeled samples, collected in a real-life deployment scenario.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate the feasibility of automated classroom analysis and establish a foundation for scalable teacher feedback systems, showing that fine-tuned models are more effective than prompting-based approaches for this multimodal recognition task.

Abstract: Observation of classroom interactions can provide concrete feedback to teachers, but current methods rely on manual annotation, which is resource-intensive and hard to scale. This work explores AI-driven analysis of classroom recordings, focusing on multimodal instructional activity and discourse recognition as a foundation for actionable feedback. Using a densely annotated dataset of 164 hours of video and 68 lesson transcripts, we design parallel, modality-specific pipelines. For video, we evaluate zero-shot multimodal LLMs, fine-tuned vision-language models, and self-supervised video transformers on 24 activity labels. For transcripts, we fine-tune a transformer-based classifier with contextualized inputs and compare it against prompting-based LLMs on 19 discourse labels. To handle class imbalance and multi-label complexity, we apply per-label thresholding, context windows, and imbalance-aware loss functions. The results show that fine-tuned models consistently outperform prompting-based approaches, achieving macro-F1 scores of 0.577 for video and 0.460 for transcripts. These results demonstrate the feasibility of automated classroom analysis and establish a foundation for scalable teacher feedback systems.

### [14] [SemImage: Semantic Image Representation for Text, a Novel Framework for Embedding Disentangled Linguistic Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00088)
*Mohammad Zare*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SemImage converts text documents into 2D semantic images where words become pixels in HSV color space, with Hue encoding topic, Saturation encoding sentiment, and Value encoding intensity, processed by CNNs for document classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a visual representation of text documents that makes semantic features (topic, sentiment, intensity) visible and interpretable while enabling effective processing by convolutional neural networks for document classification tasks.

Method: Represent each word as a pixel in 2D image with rows as sentences and boundary rows between sentences. Map word embeddings to HSV color space where Hue encodes topic (with circular components), Saturation encodes sentiment, and Value encodes intensity. Use multi-task learning with ColorMapper network and auxiliary supervision for topic/sentiment prediction. Insert dynamic boundary rows between semantically dissimilar sentences.

Result: Achieves competitive or better accuracy than strong baselines (BERT, hierarchical attention networks) on multi-label and single-label document classification benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm importance of multi-channel HSV representation and dynamic boundary rows. Visualizations show clear patterns corresponding to topic shifts and sentiment changes.

Conclusion: SemImage provides an effective visual representation of text that enables CNN processing while offering enhanced interpretability through visible semantic patterns, making linguistic features accessible to both humans and machines.

Abstract: We propose SemImage, a novel method for representing a text document as a two-dimensional semantic image to be processed by convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In a SemImage, each word is represented as a pixel in a 2D image: rows correspond to sentences and an additional boundary row is inserted between sentences to mark semantic transitions. Each pixel is not a typical RGB value but a vector in a disentangled HSV color space, encoding different linguistic features: the Hue with two components H_cos and H_sin to account for circularity encodes the topic, Saturation encodes the sentiment, and Value encodes intensity or certainty. We enforce this disentanglement via a multi-task learning framework: a ColorMapper network maps each word embedding to the HSV space, and auxiliary supervision is applied to the Hue and Saturation channels to predict topic and sentiment labels, alongside the main task objective. The insertion of dynamically computed boundary rows between sentences yields sharp visual boundaries in the image when consecutive sentences are semantically dissimilar, effectively making paragraph breaks salient. We integrate SemImage with standard 2D CNNs (e.g., ResNet) for document classification. Experiments on multi-label datasets (with both topic and sentiment annotations) and single-label benchmarks demonstrate that SemImage can achieve competitive or better accuracy than strong text classification baselines (including BERT and hierarchical attention networks) while offering enhanced interpretability. An ablation study confirms the importance of the multi-channel HSV representation and the dynamic boundary rows. Finally, we present visualizations of SemImage that qualitatively reveal clear patterns corresponding to topic shifts and sentiment changes in the generated image, suggesting that our representation makes these linguistic features visible to both humans and machines.

### [15] [TeleViT1.0: Teleconnection-aware Vision Transformers for Subseasonal to Seasonal Wildfire Pattern Forecasts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00089)
*Ioannis Prapas,Nikolaos Papadopoulos,Nikolaos-Ioannis Bountos,Dimitrios Michail,Gustau Camps-Valls,Ioannis Papoutsis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TeleViT is a vision transformer model that integrates local fire drivers, global climate fields, and teleconnection indices for multi-scale wildfire forecasting up to 4 months ahead, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-term wildfire forecasting is challenging but crucial for resource planning. While short-term predictions use local weather, long-term forecasting requires accounting for global climate patterns and teleconnections that influence fire conditions weeks to months in advance.

Method: TeleViT uses an asymmetric tokenization strategy to create heterogeneous tokens from: (1) fine-scale local fire drivers, (2) coarsened global fields, and (3) teleconnection indices. These multi-scale tokens are processed jointly by a transformer encoder, with a decoder preserving spatial structure by mapping local tokens to prediction patches.

Result: TeleViT outperforms U-Net++, ViT, and climatology across all lead times up to 4 months on the SeasFire dataset (2001-2021). At zero lead: AUPRC 0.630 vs ViT 0.617; at 4-month lead: 0.601-0.603 vs ViT 0.582. Best performance in African savannas, lower in boreal/arid regions. Attention analysis shows local tokens dominate predictions with global fields providing contextual information.

Conclusion: Architectures that explicitly encode large-scale Earth-system context can extend wildfire predictability on subseasonal-to-seasonal timescales. TeleViT demonstrates the value of multi-scale fusion for long-range forecasting, with local drivers being primary predictors supplemented by global teleconnection context.

Abstract: Forecasting wildfires weeks to months in advance is difficult, yet crucial for planning fuel treatments and allocating resources. While short-term predictions typically rely on local weather conditions, long-term forecasting requires accounting for the Earth's interconnectedness, including global patterns and teleconnections. We introduce TeleViT, a Teleconnection-aware Vision Transformer that integrates (i) fine-scale local fire drivers, (ii) coarsened global fields, and (iii) teleconnection indices. This multi-scale fusion is achieved through an asymmetric tokenization strategy that produces heterogeneous tokens processed jointly by a transformer encoder, followed by a decoder that preserves spatial structure by mapping local tokens to their corresponding prediction patches.
  Using the global SeasFire dataset (2001-2021, 8-day resolution), TeleViT improves AUPRC performance over U-Net++, ViT, and climatology across all lead times, including horizons up to four months. At zero lead, TeleViT with indices and global inputs reaches AUPRC 0.630 (ViT 0.617, U-Net 0.620), at 16x8day lead (around 4 months), TeleViT variants using global input maintain 0.601-0.603 (ViT 0.582, U-Net 0.578), while surpassing the climatology (0.572) at all lead times. Regional results show the highest skill in seasonally consistent fire regimes, such as African savannas, and lower skill in boreal and arid regions. Attention and attribution analyses indicate that predictions rely mainly on local tokens, with global fields and indices contributing coarse contextual information. These findings suggest that architectures explicitly encoding large-scale Earth-system context can extend wildfire predictability on subseasonal-to-seasonal timescales.

*Karam Mawas,Mehdi Maboudi,Pedro Achanccaray,Markus Gerke*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Automated quality control workflow for 3D concrete printing filaments that works with both extrusion-based and shotcrete methods, using various sensors and applicable to both fresh and cured states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The AEC industry needs sustainable construction methods, and 3D concrete printing requires precise quality control of filaments/layers since they define the printed structure's geometry.

Method: Developed an automated QC procedure that is sensor-agnostic (works with cameras, structured light systems, or laser scanners) and can be applied to both extrusion-based and shotcrete 3D printing methods.

Result: Created a workflow that enables quality control of filaments in both fresh and cured states, supporting both online (real-time) and post-printing quality assessment.

Conclusion: The proposed automated QC method provides a versatile solution for ensuring geometric quality in 3D concrete printing, adaptable to different printing techniques, sensors, and material states.

Abstract: The architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry is constantly evolving to meet the demand for sustainable and effective design and construction of the built environment. In the literature, two primary deposition techniques for large-scale 3D concrete printing (3DCP) have been described, namely extrusion-based (Contour Crafting-CC) and shotcrete 3D printing (SC3DP) methods. The deposition methods use a digitally controlled nozzle to print material layer by layer. The continuous flow of concrete material used to create the printed structure is called a filament or layer. As these filaments are the essential structure defining the printed object, the filaments' geometry quality control is crucial. This paper presents an automated procedure for quality control (QC) of filaments in extrusion-based and SC3DP printing methods. The paper also describes a workflow that is independent of the sensor used for data acquisition, such as a camera, a structured light system (SLS) or a terrestrial laser scanner (TLS). This method can be used with materials in either the fresh or cured state. Thus, it can be used for online and post-printing QC.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoAtNet-Tiny outperforms VGG16 and ViT-B/16 in classifying depression, schizophrenia, and healthy controls from actigraphy-derived images, showing better accuracy, stability, and performance on underrepresented classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate and compare different image-based deep learning methods (VGG16, ViT-B/16, CoAtNet-Tiny) for identifying mental health conditions (depression, schizophrenia, healthy controls) using actigraphy data converted to images.

Method: Converted wrist-worn activity signals from Psykose and Depresjon datasets into 30×48 images, used three-fold subject-wise cross-validation to evaluate VGG16, ViT-B/16, and CoAtNet-Tiny architectures for classification.

Result: CoAtNet-Tiny achieved highest average accuracy, most stable performance across folds, and strongest precision/recall/F1-scores for underrepresented depression and schizophrenia classes. VGG16 showed steady improvement but lower accuracy, ViT-B/16 had strong but inconsistent results.

Conclusion: CoAtNet-Tiny is the most reliable method for mental health classification from actigraphy images, suggesting hybrid CNN-transformer designs may be particularly suitable for this application domain.

Abstract: This work examines how three different image-based methods, VGG16, ViT-B/16, and CoAtNet-Tiny, perform in identifying depression, schizophrenia, and healthy controls using daily actigraphy records. Wrist-worn activity signals from the Psykose and Depresjon datasets were converted into 30 by 48 images and evaluated through a three-fold subject-wise split. Although all methods fitted the training data well, their behaviour on unseen data differed. VGG16 improved steadily but often settled at lower accuracy. ViT-B/16 reached strong results in some runs, but its performance shifted noticeably from fold to fold. CoAtNet-Tiny stood out as the most reliable, recording the highest average accuracy and the most stable curves across folds. It also produced the strongest precision, recall, and F1-scores, particularly for the underrepresented depression and schizophrenia classes. Overall, the findings indicate that CoAtNet-Tiny performed most consistently on the actigraphy images, while VGG16 and ViT-B/16 yielded mixed results. These observations suggest that certain hybrid designs may be especially suited for mental-health work that relies on actigraphy-derived images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TinyViT combines deep learning and classical ML for solar panel fault detection using only visible-light images, eliminating need for expensive specialized sensors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current solar panel fault detection methods rely on expensive multi-modal imaging (electroluminescence/IR sensors), creating logistical and economic barriers for widespread deployment, especially in resource-limited installations.

Method: TinyViT pipeline integrates Transformer-based segmentation, spectral-spatial feature engineering, and ensemble regression to process consumer-grade color camera images of PV panels for fault classification and severity estimation.

Result: The system successfully classifies seven nuanced surface faults and generates actionable severity grades, achieving competitive accuracy and interpretability on real-world datasets without specialized sensors.

Conclusion: This approach enables affordable, scalable solar panel maintenance by using only visible-light imagery, advancing solar health monitoring toward universal field accessibility for resource-limited installations.

Abstract: Sustained operation of solar photovoltaic assets hinges on accurate detection and prioritization of surface faults across vast, geographically distributed modules. While multi modal imaging strategies are popular, they introduce logistical and economic barriers for routine farm level deployment. This work demonstrates that deep learning and classical machine learning may be judiciously combined to achieve robust surface anomaly categorization and severity estimation from planar visible band imagery alone. We introduce TinyViT which is a compact pipeline integrating Transformer based segmentation, spectral-spatial feature engineering, and ensemble regression. The system ingests consumer grade color camera mosaics of PV panels, classifies seven nuanced surface faults, and generates actionable severity grades for maintenance triage. By eliminating reliance on electroluminescence or IR sensors, our method enables affordable, scalable upkeep for resource limited installations, and advances the state of solar health monitoring toward universal field accessibility. Experiments on real public world datasets validate both classification and regression sub modules, achieving accuracy and interpretability competitive with specialized approaches.

*Ruo-Syuan Mei,Sixian Jia,Guangze Li,Soo Yeon Lee,Brian Musser,William Keller,Sreten Zakula,Jorge Arinez,Chenhui Shao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hybrid synthetic data generation framework enables zero-shot learning for industrial quality inspection without manual annotation, achieving high accuracy despite severe class imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world manufacturing faces data constraints: expensive labeled data collection, rare defective samples causing class imbalance, and limited adoption of ML-based quality inspection methods.

Method: Hybrid SDG framework combining simulation-based rendering, domain randomization, and real background compositing. Two-stage architecture with YOLOv8n for detection and MobileNetV3-small for classification, trained exclusively on synthetic data.

Result: Achieves mAP@0.5 of 0.995 for detection, 96% classification accuracy, and 90.1% balanced accuracy on real industrial parts. Outperforms few-shot baselines (90-91% vs 50% accuracy) under severe class imbalance.

Conclusion: The proposed SDG approach enables annotation-free, scalable, and robust quality inspection for real-world manufacturing, overcoming data scarcity and class imbalance challenges.

Abstract: Machine learning, particularly deep learning, is transforming industrial quality inspection. Yet, training robust machine learning models typically requires large volumes of high-quality labeled data, which are expensive, time-consuming, and labor-intensive to obtain in manufacturing. Moreover, defective samples are intrinsically rare, leading to severe class imbalance that degrades model performance. These data constraints hinder the widespread adoption of machine learning-based quality inspection methods in real production environments. Synthetic data generation (SDG) offers a promising solution by enabling the creation of large, balanced, and fully annotated datasets in an efficient, cost-effective, and scalable manner. This paper presents a hybrid SDG framework that integrates simulation-based rendering, domain randomization, and real background compositing to enable zero-shot learning for computer vision-based industrial part inspection without manual annotation. The SDG pipeline generates 12,960 labeled images in one hour by varying part geometry, lighting, and surface properties, and then compositing synthetic parts onto real image backgrounds. A two-stage architecture utilizing a YOLOv8n backbone for object detection and MobileNetV3-small for quality classification is trained exclusively on synthetic data and evaluated on 300 real industrial parts. The proposed approach achieves an mAP@0.5 of 0.995 for detection, 96% classification accuracy, and 90.1% balanced accuracy. Comparative evaluation against few-shot real-data baseline approaches demonstrates significant improvement. The proposed SDG-based approach achieves 90-91% balanced accuracy under severe class imbalance, while the baselines reach only 50% accuracy. These results demonstrate that the proposed method enables annotation-free, scalable, and robust quality inspection for real-world manufacturing applications.

*Jayan Adhikari,Prativa Joshi,Susish Baral*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning framework combining ResNet50 OOD filtering with YOLO architectures for breast cancer detection that rejects non-mammographic inputs to improve reliability on OOD data while maintaining high detection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current breast cancer detection models suffer from reliability issues when presented with Out-of-Distribution (OOD) inputs like different imaging modalities or equipment variations, leading to unreliable detection and potential misdiagnosis in diverse clinical environments.

Method: Integrated approach using ResNet50-based OOD filtering to reject non-mammographic inputs via cosine similarity, followed by YOLO architectures (YOLOv8, YOLOv11, YOLOv12) for breast cancer detection. ResNet50 was selected after evaluating 12 CNN architectures for OOD filtering.

Result: OOD detection achieved 99.77% general accuracy with 100% accuracy on OOD test sets, effectively eliminating irrelevant imaging modalities. The joint framework achieved mAP@0.5 of 0.947 for detection, with enhanced interpretability through Grad-CAM visualizations.

Conclusion: The study provides a fundamental foundation for deploying reliable AI-based breast cancer detection systems in diverse clinical environments by integrating OOD filtering to prevent false alarms on out-of-distribution inputs while maintaining high detection accuracy on mammographic data.

Abstract: Deep learning models for breast cancer detection from mammographic images have significant reliability problems when presented with Out-of-Distribution (OOD) inputs such as other imaging modalities (CT, MRI, X-ray) or equipment variations, leading to unreliable detection and misdiagnosis. The current research mitigates the fundamental OOD issue through a comprehensive approach integrating ResNet50-based OOD filtering with YOLO architectures (YOLOv8, YOLOv11, YOLOv12) for accurate detection of breast cancer. Our strategy establishes an in-domain gallery via cosine similarity to rigidly reject non-mammographic inputs prior to processing, ensuring that only domain-associated images supply the detection pipeline. The OOD detection component achieves 99.77\% general accuracy with immaculate 100\% accuracy on OOD test sets, effectively eliminating irrelevant imaging modalities. ResNet50 was selected as the optimum backbone after 12 CNN architecture searches. The joint framework unites OOD robustness with high detection performance (mAP@0.5: 0.947) and enhanced interpretability through Grad-CAM visualizations. Experimental validation establishes that OOD filtering significantly improves system reliability by preventing false alarms on out-of-distribution inputs while maintaining higher detection accuracy on mammographic data. The present study offers a fundamental foundation for the deployment of reliable AI-based breast cancer detection systems in diverse clinical environments with inherent data heterogeneity.

### [21] [Local and Global Context-and-Object-part-Aware Superpixel-based Data Augmentation for Deep Visual Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00130)
*Fadi Dornaika,Danyang Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LGCOAMix is a novel CutMix-based data augmentation method that uses superpixel attention for context-aware and object-part-aware grid blending, addressing limitations of existing rectangular region cutting methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CutMix methods focus too much on global semantics with image-level constraints, reducing attention to discriminative local context. They use rectangular/square region cutting which loses object part information, and require inefficient double forward propagation or external pre-trained networks for label consistency.

Method: Proposes LGCOAMix - an efficient context-aware and object-part-aware superpixel-based grid blending method. Uses superpixel attention approach for label mixing, learns local features from discriminative superpixel-wise regions and cross-image superpixel contrasts.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art CutMix-based methods on classification tasks and weakly supervised object location on CUB200-2011. Effective for both CNN and Transformer networks.

Conclusion: LGCOAMix successfully addresses limitations of existing CutMix methods by introducing superpixel attention for better local feature learning and more efficient augmentation, demonstrating superior performance across multiple benchmarks and network architectures.

Abstract: Cutmix-based data augmentation, which uses a cut-and-paste strategy, has shown remarkable generalization capabilities in deep learning. However, existing methods primarily consider global semantics with image-level constraints, which excessively reduces attention to the discriminative local context of the class and leads to a performance improvement bottleneck. Moreover, existing methods for generating augmented samples usually involve cutting and pasting rectangular or square regions, resulting in a loss of object part information. To mitigate the problem of inconsistency between the augmented image and the generated mixed label, existing methods usually require double forward propagation or rely on an external pre-trained network for object centering, which is inefficient. To overcome the above limitations, we propose LGCOAMix, an efficient context-aware and object-part-aware superpixel-based grid blending method for data augmentation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a label mixing strategy using a superpixel attention approach has been proposed for cutmix-based data augmentation. It is the first instance of learning local features from discriminative superpixel-wise regions and cross-image superpixel contrasts. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets show that LGCOAMix outperforms state-of-the-art cutmix-based data augmentation methods on classification tasks, {and weakly supervised object location on CUB200-2011.} We have demonstrated the effectiveness of LGCOAMix not only for CNN networks, but also for Transformer networks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight CNN for laser speckle material recognition achieves 95% accuracy on 59 material classes with only 341k parameters, enabling edge deployment on devices like Raspberry Pi.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate material recognition is critical for safe laser cutting to prevent poor cuts, machine damage, or hazardous fumes. Existing speckle-based methods use computationally expensive networks or handle limited material subsets.

Method: Proposed a lightweight convolutional neural network specifically designed for speckle patterns, minimizing parameters while maintaining discriminative power. Tested on complete SensiCut dataset of 59 material classes.

Result: Achieves 95.05% test accuracy with 0.951 F1-scores, using only 341k parameters (~1.3 MB) - 70x fewer than ResNet-50. Inference speed of 295 images/sec enables Raspberry Pi/Jetson deployment. Material family regrouping yields 98-100% recall for practical laser cutter presets.

Conclusion: Compact, domain-specific CNNs outperform large backbones for speckle-based material classification, advancing feasibility of material-aware, edge-deployable laser cutting systems.

Abstract: Accurate material recognition is critical for safe and effective laser cutting, as misidentification can lead to poor cut quality, machine damage, or the release of hazardous fumes. Laser speckle sensing has recently emerged as a low-cost and non-destructive modality for material classification; however, prior work has either relied on computationally expensive backbone networks or addressed only limited subsets of materials. In this study, A lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) tailored for speckle patterns is proposed, designed to minimize parameters while maintaining high discriminative power. Using the complete SensiCut dataset of 59 material classes spanning woods, acrylics, composites, textiles, metals, and paper-based products, the proposed model achieves 95.05% test accuracy, with macro and weighted F1-scores of 0.951. The network contains only 341k trainable parameters (~1.3 MB) -- over 70X fewer than ResNet-50 -- and achieves an inference speed of 295 images per second, enabling deployment on Raspberry Pi and Jetson-class devices. Furthermore, when materials are regrouped into nine and five practical families, recall exceeds 98% and approaches 100%, directly supporting power and speed preset selection in laser cutters. These results demonstrate that compact, domain-specific CNNs can outperform large backbones for speckle-based material classification, advancing the feasibility of material-aware, edge-deployable laser cutting systems.

TL;DR: ICVision is an AI system that uses vision-language models to classify EEG ICA components by visually interpreting dashboard plots like human experts, achieving better agreement with experts than conventional classifiers while providing explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current EEG ICA component classifiers rely on handcrafted features and lack human-like visual reasoning and explainability. There's a need for AI systems that can interpret neurophysiological data the way trained neurologists do - by seeing and reasoning about visual patterns.

Method: ICVision uses GPT-4 Vision to directly interpret ICA dashboard visualizations (topography, time series, power spectra, and ERP plots) as multimodal inputs. It classifies components into six canonical categories and provides both confidence scores and human-like explanations.

Result: Evaluated on 3,168 ICA components from 124 EEG datasets, ICVision achieved κ = 0.677 agreement with expert consensus, surpassing MNE ICLabel. Over 97% of outputs were rated as interpretable and actionable by experts, and it preserved clinically relevant brain signals in ambiguous cases.

Conclusion: ICVision represents a paradigm shift toward AI agents capable of expert-level visual decision-making in brain science. It enables globally scalable, explainable, and reproducible EEG workflows and demonstrates the potential of vision-language AI for scientific applications.

Abstract: We introduce EEG Autoclean Vision Language AI (ICVision) a first-of-its-kind system that emulates expert-level EEG ICA component classification through AI-agent vision and natural language reasoning. Unlike conventional classifiers such as ICLabel, which rely on handcrafted features, ICVision directly interprets ICA dashboard visualizations topography, time series, power spectra, and ERP plots, using a multimodal large language model (GPT-4 Vision). This allows the AI to see and explain EEG components the way trained neurologists do, making it the first scientific implementation of AI-agent visual cognition in neurophysiology. ICVision classifies each component into one of six canonical categories (brain, eye, heart, muscle, channel noise, and other noise), returning both a confidence score and a human-like explanation. Evaluated on 3,168 ICA components from 124 EEG datasets, ICVision achieved k = 0.677 agreement with expert consensus, surpassing MNE ICLabel, while also preserving clinically relevant brain signals in ambiguous cases. Over 97% of its outputs were rated as interpretable and actionable by expert reviewers. As a core module of the open-source EEG Autoclean platform, ICVision signals a paradigm shift in scientific AI, where models do not just classify, but see, reason, and communicate. It opens the door to globally scalable, explainable, and reproducible EEG workflows, marking the emergence of AI agents capable of expert-level visual decision-making in brain science and beyond.

Conclusion: DenseScan broadens downstream task capabilities and aims to catalyze new research avenues in 3D scene understanding by providing richer, contextually aware annotations for robotics, AR, and other applications.

Abstract: 3D understanding is a key capability for real-world AI assistance. High-quality data plays an important role in driving the development of the 3D understanding community. Current 3D scene understanding datasets often provide geometric and instance-level information, yet they lack the rich semantic annotations necessary for nuanced visual-language tasks.In this work, we introduce DenseScan, a novel dataset with detailed multi-level descriptions generated by an automated pipeline leveraging multi-view 2D images and multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our approach enables dense captioning of scene elements, ensuring comprehensive object-level descriptions that capture context-sensitive details. Furthermore, we extend these annotations through scenario-based question generation, producing high-level queries that integrate object properties, spatial relationships, and scene context. By coupling geometric detail with semantic richness, DenseScan broadens the range of downstream tasks, from detailed visual-language navigation to interactive question answering. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly enhances object-level understanding and question-answering performance in 3D environments compared to traditional annotation pipelines. We release both the annotated dataset and our annotation pipeline to facilitate future research and applications in robotics, augmented reality, and beyond. Through DenseScan, we aim to catalyze new avenues in 3D scene understanding, allowing researchers and practitioners to tackle the complexities of real-world environments with richer, more contextually aware annotations.

Method: Uses a transformer-based RelightNet that takes physics-informed features (geometry, albedo, shading, camera view) from coarse mesh proxy and input views, cross-attends with novel lighting conditions, and regresses relit appearance as texel-aligned 3D Gaussian splats attached to the mesh.

Result: Superior visual fidelity and lighting reproduction compared to state-of-the-art approaches, demonstrating efficient single-pass relighting without OLAT capture.

Conclusion: RHC enables efficient, high-quality free-view rendering and relighting of dynamic humans from sparse-view videos, overcoming limitations of traditional OLAT-based methods through a novel transformer architecture and physics-informed feature encoding.

Abstract: We present Relightable Holoported Characters (RHC), a novel person-specific method for free-view rendering and relighting of full-body and highly dynamic humans solely observed from sparse-view RGB videos at inference. In contrast to classical one-light-at-a-time (OLAT)-based human relighting, our transformer-based RelightNet predicts relit appearance within a single network pass, avoiding costly OLAT-basis capture and generation. For training such a model, we introduce a new capture strategy and dataset recorded in a multi-view lightstage, where we alternate frames lit by random environment maps with uniformly lit tracking frames, simultaneously enabling accurate motion tracking and diverse illumination as well as dynamics coverage. Inspired by the rendering equation, we derive physics-informed features that encode geometry, albedo, shading, and the virtual camera view from a coarse human mesh proxy and the input views. Our RelightNet then takes these features as input and cross-attends them with a novel lighting condition, and regresses the relit appearance in the form of texel-aligned 3D Gaussian splats attached to the coarse mesh proxy. Consequently, our RelightNet implicitly learns to efficiently compute the rendering equation for novel lighting conditions within a single feed-forward pass. Experiments demonstrate our method's superior visual fidelity and lighting reproduction compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Project page: https://vcai.mpi-inf.mpg.de/projects/RHC/

*Yuzhen Hu,Saurabh Prasad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniDiff: Parameter-efficient framework adapting ImageNet-pretrained diffusion models to multiple remote sensing modalities (HSI, SAR) using only target-domain data, addressing sparse annotation constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse annotations limit supervised multimodal remote sensing methods like MSFMamba. ImageNet-pretrained models offer rich visual representations but adapting them to heterogeneous modalities (HSI, SAR) without large labeled datasets is challenging.

Method: UniDiff combines FiLM-based timestep-modality conditioning, parameter-efficient adaptation (~5% of parameters), and pseudo-RGB anchoring to preserve pre-trained representations and prevent catastrophic forgetting. Adapts single ImageNet-pretrained diffusion model to multiple sensing modalities using only target-domain data.

Result: Demonstrated on two established multi-modal benchmarking datasets. Unsupervised adaptation effectively mitigates annotation constraints and achieves effective fusion of multi-modal remotely sensed data.

Conclusion: UniDiff enables effective feature extraction from remote sensing data under sparse annotations by adapting pre-trained diffusion models to heterogeneous modalities without requiring large labeled datasets.

Abstract: Sparse annotations fundamentally constrain multimodal remote sensing: even recent state-of-the-art supervised methods such as MSFMamba are limited by the availability of labeled data, restricting their practical deployment despite architectural advances. ImageNet-pretrained models provide rich visual representations, but adapting them to heterogeneous modalities such as hyperspectral imaging (HSI) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) without large labeled datasets remains challenging. We propose UniDiff, a parameter-efficient framework that adapts a single ImageNet-pretrained diffusion model to multiple sensing modalities using only target-domain data. UniDiff combines FiLM-based timestep-modality conditioning, parameter-efficient adaptation of approximately 5% of parameters, and pseudo-RGB anchoring to preserve pre-trained representations and prevent catastrophic forgetting. This design enables effective feature extraction from remote sensing data under sparse annotations. Our results with two established multi-modal benchmarking datasets demonstrate that unsupervised adaptation of a pre-trained diffusion model effectively mitigates annotation constraints and achieves effective fusion of multi-modal remotely sensed data.

*Zhengda Ma,Abhirup Banerjee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HeartFormer: First geometric deep learning framework for 3D four-chamber cardiac reconstruction from 2D cine MRI using point cloud completion with multi-class semantic awareness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional cine MRI provides only 2D slice images, limiting comprehensive understanding of cardiac morphology and physiology in both healthy and pathological conditions.

Method: HeartFormer uses a point cloud completion network with two components: SA-DSTNet for initial coarse point cloud generation with global and substructure geometry features, and SA-GFRTNet for progressive refinement using semantic-geometry representations.

Result: Achieves robust, accurate, and generalizable performance, consistently surpassing state-of-the-art methods on HeartCompv1 dataset (17,000 3D multi-class cardiac meshes) and UK Biobank.

Conclusion: HeartFormer provides the first geometric deep learning solution for 3D cardiac reconstruction from 2D MRI, establishing a benchmark with publicly available dataset and demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: We present the first geometric deep learning framework based on point cloud representation for 3D four-chamber cardiac reconstruction from cine MRI data. This work addresses a long-standing limitation in conventional cine MRI, which typically provides only 2D slice images of the heart, thereby restricting a comprehensive understanding of cardiac morphology and physiological mechanisms in both healthy and pathological conditions. To overcome this, we propose \textbf{HeartFormer}, a novel point cloud completion network that extends traditional single-class point cloud completion to the multi-class. HeartFormer consists of two key components: a Semantic-Aware Dual-Structure Transformer Network (SA-DSTNet) and a Semantic-Aware Geometry Feature Refinement Transformer Network (SA-GFRTNet). SA-DSTNet generates an initial coarse point cloud with both global geometry features and substructure geometry features. Guided by these semantic-geometry representations, SA-GFRTNet progressively refines the coarse output, effectively leveraging both global and substructure geometric priors to produce high-fidelity and geometrically consistent reconstructions. We further construct \textbf{HeartCompv1}, the first publicly available large-scale dataset with 17,000 high-resolution 3D multi-class cardiac meshes and point-clouds, to establish a general benchmark for this emerging research direction. Extensive cross-domain experiments on HeartCompv1 and UK Biobank demonstrate that HeartFormer achieves robust, accurate, and generalizable performance, consistently surpassing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Code and dataset will be released upon acceptance at: https://github.com/10Darren/HeartFormer.

### [30] [USB: Unified Synthetic Brain Framework for Bidirectional Pathology-Healthy Generation and Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00269)
*Jun Wang,Peirong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: USB is the first unified framework for bidirectional generation and editing of pathological and healthy brain images using paired diffusion modeling, enabling both generation and editing while maintaining anatomical consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Paired pathological-healthy brain data is extremely difficult to obtain due to clinical constraints, while existing methods treat pathological and healthy image modeling independently rather than unifying them.

Method: USB uses a paired diffusion mechanism to model the joint distribution of lesions and brain anatomy, with a consistency guidance algorithm to preserve anatomical consistency and lesion correspondence during bidirectional editing.

Result: Extensive experiments on six public brain MRI datasets (healthy controls, stroke, Alzheimer's) demonstrate USB's ability to produce diverse and realistic results, establishing the first unified benchmark for brain image generation and editing.

Conclusion: USB opens opportunities for scalable dataset creation and robust neuroimaging analysis by unifying pathological and healthy brain image modeling in a single framework.

Abstract: Understanding the relationship between pathological and healthy brain structures is fundamental to neuroimaging, connecting disease diagnosis and detection with modeling, prediction, and treatment planning. However, paired pathological-healthy data are extremely difficult to obtain, as they rely on pre- and post-treatment imaging, constrained by clinical outcomes and longitudinal data availability. Consequently, most existing brain image generation and editing methods focus on visual quality yet remain domain-specific, treating pathological and healthy image modeling independently. We introduce USB (Unified Synthetic Brain), the first end-to-end framework that unifies bidirectional generation and editing of pathological and healthy brain images. USB models the joint distribution of lesions and brain anatomy through a paired diffusion mechanism and achieves both pathological and healthy image generation. A consistency guidance algorithm further preserves anatomical consistency and lesion correspondence during bidirectional pathology-healthy editing. Extensive experiments on six public brain MRI datasets including healthy controls, stroke, and Alzheimer's patients, demonstrate USB's ability to produce diverse and realistic results. By establishing the first unified benchmark for brain image generation and editing, USB opens opportunities for scalable dataset creation and robust neuroimaging analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Remote sensing applications like disaster detection require real-time efficiency and lightweight models, but existing super-resolution methods struggle with the trade-off between performance and computational efficiency.

Method: HIMOSA leverages inherent redundancy in remote sensing imagery with content-aware sparse attention mechanism, and uses hierarchical window expansion to exploit multi-scale repetitive patterns while reducing computational complexity through attention sparsity adjustment.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple remote sensing datasets show state-of-the-art performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: HIMOSA successfully addresses the performance-efficiency trade-off in remote sensing super-resolution, achieving fast inference with strong reconstruction capabilities for real-time applications.

Abstract: In remote sensing applications, such as disaster detection and response, real-time efficiency and model lightweighting are of critical importance. Consequently, existing remote sensing image super-resolution methods often face a trade-off between model performance and computational efficiency. In this paper, we propose a lightweight super-resolution framework for remote sensing imagery, named HIMOSA. Specifically, HIMOSA leverages the inherent redundancy in remote sensing imagery and introduces a content-aware sparse attention mechanism, enabling the model to achieve fast inference while maintaining strong reconstruction performance. Furthermore, to effectively leverage the multi-scale repetitive patterns found in remote sensing imagery, we introduce a hierarchical window expansion and reduce the computational complexity by adjusting the sparsity of the attention. Extensive experiments on multiple remote sensing datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current lung cancer screening depends on nodule size and growth, which inherently delays diagnosis. There are limitations in dataset scale and explainability in existing AI approaches.

Method: Designed an ensemble of shallow deep learning and feature-based specialized models. Trained and evaluated on 25,709 CT scans with 69,449 annotated nodules.

Result: Achieved AUC of 0.98 internally and 0.945 on independent cohort. Outperformed radiologists, Lung-RADS, and leading AI models (Sybil, Brock, Google, Kaggle) across all nodule sizes and stages, with 0.5 false positives per scan at 99.3% sensitivity. Surpassed radiologists by up to one year in diagnosing indeterminate and slow-growing nodules.

Conclusion: The AI system addresses key barriers to AI adoption in lung cancer screening by providing both detection and malignancy diagnosis with high accuracy, potentially enabling earlier diagnosis than current size/growth-dependent methods.

Abstract: Early detection of malignant lung nodules is critical, but its dependence on size and growth in screening inherently delays diagnosis. We present an AI system that redefines lung cancer screening by performing both detection and malignancy diagnosis directly at the nodule level on low-dose CT scans. To address limitations in dataset scale and explainability, we designed an ensemble of shallow deep learning and feature-based specialized models. Trained and evaluated on 25,709 scans with 69,449 annotated nodules, the system outperforms radiologists, Lung-RADS, and leading AI models (Sybil, Brock, Google, Kaggle). It achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.98 internally and 0.945 on an independent cohort. With 0.5 false positives per scan at 99.3\% sensitivity, it addresses key barriers to AI adoption. Critically, it outperforms radiologists across all nodule sizes and stages, excelling in stage 1 cancers, and all growth-based metrics, including the least accurate: Volume-Doubling Time. It also surpasses radiologists by up to one year in diagnosing indeterminate and slow-growing nodules.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional AR systems are limited by fixed class detectors or fiducial markers, lacking the ability to interpret complex, open-vocabulary natural language queries and perform relational reasoning in physical spaces.

Method: A modular AR agent system that coordinates MLLMs with coordinate-aware perception tools, constructs dynamic AR scene graphs encoding nine typed relations (spatial, structural-semantic, causal-functional), and uses task-adaptive region-of-interest highlighting with contextual spatial retrieval.

Result: The system enables complex relational reasoning from simple object identification to multi-object relations with meter-accurate 3D anchors, supports human-in-the-loop refinement, and dynamically invokes coordinate-aware tools for selection, measurement, comparison, and actuation.

Conclusion: The modular architecture establishes AR agents as intermediaries that augment MLLMs with real-world spatial intelligence, supporting plug-and-use vision-language models without retraining, and introduces GroundedAR-Bench for evaluating language-driven real-world localization and relation grounding.

Abstract: Traditional augmented reality (AR) systems predominantly rely on fixed class detectors or fiducial markers, limiting their ability to interpret complex, open-vocabulary natural language queries. We present a modular AR agent system that integrates multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with grounded vision models to enable relational reasoning in space and language-conditioned spatial retrieval in physical environments. Our adaptive task agent coordinates MLLMs and coordinate-aware perception tools to address varying query complexities, ranging from simple object identification to multi-object relational reasoning, while returning meter-accurate 3D anchors. It constructs dynamic AR scene graphs encoding nine typed relations (spatial, structural-semantic, causal-functional), enabling MLLMs to understand not just what objects exist, but how they relate and interact in 3D space. Through task-adaptive region-of-interest highlighting and contextual spatial retrieval, the system guides human attention to information-dense areas while supporting human-in-the-loop refinement. The agent dynamically invokes coordinate-aware tools for complex queries-selection, measurement, comparison, and actuation-grounding language understanding in physical operations. The modular architecture supports plug-and-use vision-language models without retraining, establishing AR agents as intermediaries that augment MLLMs with real-world spatial intelligence for interactive scene understanding. We also introduce GroundedAR-Bench, an evaluation framework for language-driven real world localization and relation grounding across diverse environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TGSFormer is a scalable Temporal Gaussian Splatting framework for embodied 3D Semantic Scene Completion that uses persistent Gaussian memory and confidence-aware fusion to achieve state-of-the-art results with fewer primitives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Gaussian-based methods for embodied SSC suffer from redundancy due to random initialization of primitives within predefined bounds, poor scalability to unbounded scenes, and latency/memory overhead issues with depth-guided approaches.

Method: TGSFormer maintains persistent Gaussian memory for temporal prediction without relying on image coherence or frame caches. It uses a Dual Temporal Encoder with confidence-aware cross-attention to process current/historical Gaussian features, and a Confidence-aware Voxel Fusion module to merge overlapping primitives into voxel-aligned representations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on both local and embodied SSC benchmarks, offering superior accuracy and scalability with significantly fewer primitives while maintaining consistent long-term scene integrity.

Conclusion: TGSFormer provides an effective solution for scalable embodied SSC that overcomes redundancy and scalability limitations of previous methods through temporal Gaussian memory and confidence-aware fusion.

Abstract: Embodied 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) infers dense geometry and semantics from continuous egocentric observations. Most existing Gaussian-based methods rely on random initialization of many primitives within predefined spatial bounds, resulting in redundancy and poor scalability to unbounded scenes. Recent depth-guided approach alleviates this issue but remains local, suffering from latency and memory overhead as scale increases. To overcome these challenges, we propose TGSFormer, a scalable Temporal Gaussian Splatting framework for embodied SSC. It maintains a persistent Gaussian memory for temporal prediction, without relying on image coherence or frame caches. For temporal fusion, a Dual Temporal Encoder jointly processes current and historical Gaussian features through confidence-aware cross-attention. Subsequently, a Confidence-aware Voxel Fusion module merges overlapping primitives into voxel-aligned representations, regulating density and maintaining compactness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TGSFormer achieves state-of-the-art results on both local and embodied SSC benchmarks, offering superior accuracy and scalability with significantly fewer primitives while maintaining consistent long-term scene integrity. The code will be released upon acceptance.

*Xiao Cui,Yulei Qin,Wengang Zhou,Hongsheng Li,Houqiang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dataset distillation method using Optimal Transport for fine-grained alignment at both global and instance levels, achieving significant accuracy improvements over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current dataset distillation methods for large-scale datasets focus only on matching global distributional statistics (mean, variance), overlooking critical instance-level characteristics and intraclass variations, leading to suboptimal generalization performance.

Method: Reformulates dataset distillation as an Optimal Transport distance minimization problem with three components: (1) OT-guided diffusion sampling for latent distribution alignment, (2) label-image-aligned soft relabeling for adaptive label distributions, and (3) OT-based logit matching for output alignment with soft-label distributions.

Result: Extensive experiments show consistent outperformance of state-of-the-art approaches, achieving at least 4% accuracy improvement under IPC=10 settings for each architecture on ImageNet-1K, while maintaining efficiency.

Conclusion: Optimal Transport provides a geometrically faithful framework for dataset distillation that effectively preserves local modes, intra-class patterns, and fine-grained variations, enabling superior generalization through fine-grained alignment at both global and instance levels.

Abstract: Dataset distillation seeks to synthesize a compact distilled dataset, enabling models trained on it to achieve performance comparable to models trained on the full dataset. Recent methods for large-scale datasets focus on matching global distributional statistics (e.g., mean and variance), but overlook critical instance-level characteristics and intraclass variations, leading to suboptimal generalization. We address this limitation by reformulating dataset distillation as an Optimal Transport (OT) distance minimization problem, enabling fine-grained alignment at both global and instance levels throughout the pipeline. OT offers a geometrically faithful framework for distribution matching. It effectively preserves local modes, intra-class patterns, and fine-grained variations that characterize the geometry of complex, high-dimensional distributions. Our method comprises three components tailored for preserving distributional geometry: (1) OT-guided diffusion sampling, which aligns latent distributions of real and distilled images; (2) label-image-aligned soft relabeling, which adapts label distributions based on the complexity of distilled image distributions; and (3) OT-based logit matching, which aligns the output of student models with soft-label distributions. Extensive experiments across diverse architectures and large-scale datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in an efficient manner, achieving at least 4% accuracy improvement under IPC=10 settings for each architecture on ImageNet-1K.

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing synthetic anomaly methods produce visually distinct anomalies that ignore anatomical structure and don't resemble real pathological patterns in chest X-rays, limiting their effectiveness for anomaly detection.

Method: Proposes ART-ASyn framework with Progressive Binary Thresholding Segmentation (PBTSeg) for lung segmentation, then generates realistic lung opacity anomalies using texture-based augmentation that respects anatomical structure, creating paired synthetic anomalies with precise masks.

Result: The method generates anatomically consistent synthetic anomalies with precise masks, enabling explicit segmentation supervision. It demonstrates generalizability through zero-shot anomaly segmentation on unseen datasets without target-domain annotations.

Conclusion: ART-ASyn addresses limitations of existing synthetic anomaly methods by generating realistic, anatomically consistent anomalies for chest X-rays, enabling better unsupervised anomaly detection and zero-shot generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection aims to identify anomalies without pixel-level annotations. Synthetic anomaly-based methods exhibit a unique capacity to introduce controllable irregularities with known masks, enabling explicit supervision during training. However, existing methods often produce synthetic anomalies that are visually distinct from real pathological patterns and ignore anatomical structure. This paper presents a novel Anatomy-aware Realistic Texture-based Anomaly Synthesis framework (ART-ASyn) for chest X-rays that generates realistic and anatomically consistent lung opacity related anomalies using texture-based augmentation guided by our proposed Progressive Binary Thresholding Segmentation method (PBTSeg) for lung segmentation. The generated paired samples of synthetic anomalies and their corresponding precise pixel-level anomaly mask for each normal sample enable explicit segmentation supervision. In contrast to prior work limited to one-class classification, ART-ASyn is further evaluated for zero-shot anomaly segmentation, demonstrating generalizability on an unseen dataset without target-domain annotations.

*Chenqi Zhu,Levi Burner,Yiannis Aloimonos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel visual odometry method using ruled surfaces from line features instead of point correspondences, constrained by IMU measurements to reduce solution space dimensionality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional visual odometry relies on costly and inaccurate point-to-point feature correspondence. Existing methods using line features or sensor fusion still heavily depend on correspondence. The paper aims to bypass correspondence problems by analyzing ruled surfaces formed by moving lines in image-space time.

Method: Uses ruled surfaces formed by lines sweeping through image-space time as camera moves. Requires only differentially computed updates from point-to-line associations. Constrains surfaces with IMU measurements to reduce solution space dimensionality. Inspired by event cameras' edge detection capabilities.

Result: Presents a novel algorithm for 3D scene reconstruction and visual odometry from ruled surfaces, with reduced computational cost and improved accuracy by avoiding traditional correspondence problems.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers an alternative approach to visual odometry that bypasses traditional correspondence problems by analyzing ruled surfaces from line features, enhanced by IMU constraints for more efficient and accurate odometry estimation.

Abstract: Visual odometry techniques typically rely on feature extraction from a sequence of images and subsequent computation of optical flow. This point-to-point correspondence between two consecutive frames can be costly to compute and suffers from varying accuracy, which affects the odometry estimate's quality. Attempts have been made to bypass the difficulties originating from the correspondence problem by adopting line features and fusing other sensors (event camera, IMU) to improve performance, many of which still heavily rely on correspondence. If the camera observes a straight line as it moves, the image of the line sweeps a smooth surface in image-space time. It is a ruled surface and analyzing its shape gives information about odometry. Further, its estimation requires only differentially computed updates from point-to-line associations. Inspired by event cameras' propensity for edge detection, this research presents a novel algorithm to reconstruct 3D scenes and visual odometry from these ruled surfaces. By constraining the surfaces with the inertia measurements from an onboard IMU sensor, the dimensionality of the solution space is greatly reduced.

Motivation: The rapid advancement of AI-generated multimodal video-audio content raises significant security and authenticity concerns. Existing datasets are limited to visual-only or facial deepfakes, failing to address the expanding landscape of general multimodal AI-generated content and impeding development of trustworthy detection systems.

Method: Created MVAD dataset with three key characteristics: (1) genuine multimodality with samples generated according to three realistic video-audio forgery patterns; (2) high perceptual quality using diverse state-of-the-art generative models; (3) comprehensive diversity spanning realistic/anime styles, four content categories (humans, animals, objects, scenes), and four video-audio multimodal data types.

Conclusion: MVAD bridges the critical gap in multimodal AI-generated content detection by providing a comprehensive, high-quality, diverse dataset that will facilitate development of trustworthy detection systems for video-audio content authenticity verification.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI-generated multimodal video-audio content has raised significant concerns regarding information security and content authenticity. Existing synthetic video datasets predominantly focus on the visual modality alone, while the few incorporating audio are largely confined to facial deepfakes--a limitation that fails to address the expanding landscape of general multimodal AI-generated content and substantially impedes the development of trustworthy detection systems. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce the Multimodal Video-Audio Dataset (MVAD), the first comprehensive dataset specifically designed for detecting AI-generated multimodal video-audio content. Our dataset exhibits three key characteristics: (1) genuine multimodality with samples generated according to three realistic video-audio forgery patterns; (2) high perceptual quality achieved through diverse state-of-the-art generative models; and (3) comprehensive diversity spanning realistic and anime visual styles, four content categories (humans, animals, objects, and scenes), and four video-audio multimodal data types.

### [39] [Assimilation Matters: Model-level Backdoor Detection in Vision-Language Pretrained Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00343)
*Zhongqi Wang,Jie Zhang,Shiguang Shan,Xilin Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AMDET is a novel model-level backdoor detection framework for vision-language pretrained models that operates without prior knowledge of training data, triggers, or targets by exploiting feature assimilation in backdoored text encoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLPs like CLIP are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, but existing detection methods require impractical prior knowledge about training datasets, triggers, targets, or downstream classifiers, making real-world deployment challenging.

Method: AMDET leverages the feature assimilation property where all tokens in backdoor samples show high similarity due to attention concentration on trigger tokens. It performs gradient-based inversion on token embeddings to recover implicit features that activate backdoor behaviors, and filters out natural backdoor features by analyzing loss landscapes.

Result: Extensive experiments on 3,600 backdoored and benign-finetuned models with two attack paradigms and three VLP structures show AMDET achieves 89.90% F1 score, completes detection in ~5 minutes on RTX 4090 GPU, and demonstrates strong robustness against adaptive attacks.

Conclusion: AMDET provides an effective, efficient, and practical solution for backdoor detection in VLPs without requiring prior knowledge, successfully identifying both intentionally injected backdoors and natural backdoor-like features in official models.

Abstract: Vision-language pretrained models (VLPs) such as CLIP have achieved remarkable success, but are also highly vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Given a model fine-tuned by an untrusted third party, determining whether the model has been injected with a backdoor is a critical and challenging problem. Existing detection methods usually rely on prior knowledge of training dataset, backdoor triggers and targets, or downstream classifiers, which may be impractical for real-world applications. To address this, To address this challenge, we introduce Assimilation Matters in DETection (AMDET), a novel model-level detection framework that operates without any such prior knowledge. Specifically, we first reveal the feature assimilation property in backdoored text encoders: the representations of all tokens within a backdoor sample exhibit a high similarity. Further analysis attributes this effect to the concentration of attention weights on the trigger token. Leveraging this insight, AMDET scans a model by performing gradient-based inversion on token embeddings to recover implicit features that capable of activating backdoor behaviors. Furthermore, we identify the natural backdoor feature in the OpenAI's official CLIP model, which are not intentionally injected but still exhibit backdoor-like behaviors. We then filter them out from real injected backdoor by analyzing their loss landscapes. Extensive experiments on 3,600 backdoored and benign-finetuned models with two attack paradigms and three VLP model structures show that AMDET detects backdoors with an F1 score of 89.90%. Besides, it achieves one complete detection in approximately 5 minutes on a RTX 4090 GPU and exhibits strong robustness against adaptive attacks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First diffusion-based framework for millimeter-wave radar-based human motion prediction, addressing radar noise and inconsistency through dual-domain guidance and global joint modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB-D cameras for human motion prediction have limitations: sensitive to lighting conditions and raise privacy concerns, limiting real-world applications. Millimeter-wave radar offers robustness and privacy preservation but suffers from specular reflections and multipath effects causing noisy, inconsistent measurements.

Method: Proposes mmPred, a diffusion-based framework with: 1) Dual-domain historical motion representation combining Time-domain Pose Refinement (TPR) for fine details and Frequency-domain Dominant Motion (FDM) for global trends and inconsistency suppression; 2) Global Skeleton-relational Transformer (GST) as diffusion backbone to model global inter-joint cooperation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by 8.6% on mmBody dataset and 22% on mm-Fi dataset.

Conclusion: Introduces radar as novel sensing modality for human motion prediction, addresses radar-specific artifacts with specialized diffusion framework, demonstrates superior performance over existing methods on radar-based datasets.

Abstract: Existing Human Motion Prediction (HMP) methods based on RGB-D cameras are sensitive to lighting conditions and raise privacy concerns, limiting their real-world applications such as firefighting and healthcare. Motivated by the robustness and privacy-preserving nature of millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar, this work introduces radar as a novel sensing modality for HMP, for the first time. Nevertheless, radar signals often suffer from specular reflections and multipath effects, resulting in noisy and temporally inconsistent measurements, such as body-part miss-detection. To address these radar-specific artifacts, we propose mmPred, the first diffusion-based framework tailored for radar-based HMP. mmPred introduces a dual-domain historical motion representation to guide the generation process, combining a Time-domain Pose Refinement (TPR) branch for learning fine-grained details and a Frequency-domain Dominant Motion (FDM) branch for capturing global motion trends and suppressing frame-level inconsistency. Furthermore, we design a Global Skeleton-relational Transformer (GST) as the diffusion backbone to model global inter-joint cooperation, enabling corrupted joints to dynamically aggregate information from others. Extensive experiments show that mmPred achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by 8.6% on mmBody and 22% on mm-Fi.

*Junqiao Fan,Pengfei Liu,Haocong Rao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SMamDiff: A single-stage diffusion model for human motion prediction using spatial Mamba architecture with residual-DCT encoding and stickman-drawing spatial processing to ensure spatial-temporal coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing human motion prediction methods either produce deterministic forecasts ignoring uncertainty or use probabilistic models sacrificing kinematic plausibility. Diffusion models improve accuracy-diversity trade-off but rely on multi-stage pipelines that are costly for edge deployment in room-side sensing and service robot applications.

Method: SMamDiff introduces two novel designs: 1) residual-DCT motion encoding that subtracts last observed pose before temporal DCT to reduce DC component dominance and highlight higher-frequency cues, 2) stickman-drawing spatial-mamba module that processes joints in ordered, joint-by-joint manner to induce long-range cross-joint dependencies.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results among single-stage probabilistic HMP methods on Human3.6M and HumanEva datasets while using less latency and memory than multi-stage diffusion baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed coherence mechanisms in SMamDiff enable effective spatial-temporal modeling within a single-stage diffusion framework, making it suitable for edge deployment in intelligent room-side sensing and service robot applications.

Abstract: With intelligent room-side sensing and service robots widely deployed, human motion prediction (HMP) is essential for safe, proactive assistance. However, many existing HMP methods either produce a single, deterministic forecast that ignores uncertainty or rely on probabilistic models that sacrifice kinematic plausibility. Diffusion models improve the accuracy-diversity trade-off but often depend on multi-stage pipelines that are costly for edge deployment. This work focuses on how to ensure spatial-temporal coherence within a single-stage diffusion model for HMP. We introduce SMamDiff, a Spatial Mamba-based Diffusion model with two novel designs: (i) a residual-DCT motion encoding that subtracts the last observed pose before a temporal DCT, reducing the first DC component ($f=0$) dominance and highlighting informative higher-frequency cues so the model learns how joints move rather than where they are; and (ii) a stickman-drawing spatial-mamba module that processes joints in an ordered, joint-by-joint manner, making later joints condition on earlier ones to induce long-range, cross-joint dependencies. On Human3.6M and HumanEva, these coherence mechanisms deliver state-of-the-art results among single-stage probabilistic HMP methods while using less latency and memory than multi-stage diffusion baselines.

*Jianhong Han,Yupei Wang,Yuan Zhang,Liang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MM-DETR: Lightweight multimodal object detection framework using Mamba-based fusion with channel-wise gating, modality completion via 2D selective scanning, and frequency-aware adapters for efficient cross-modal feature extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal object detection methods struggle to balance performance and lightweight design. Attention-based or deformable convolution fusion blocks are complex, while shared backbones yield suboptimal representations and dual-stream architectures double parameters, limiting practical deployment.

Method: Proposes MM-DETR with three key components: 1) Mamba-based dual granularity fusion encoder using channel-wise dynamic gating and 1D selective scan for efficient cross-modal modeling; 2) Region-aware 2D selective scanning completion branch for modality-specific cue recovery; 3) Lightweight frequency-aware modality adapter with spatial-frequency co-expert structure and pixel-wise router for efficient feature extraction.

Result: Extensive experiments on four multimodal benchmark datasets demonstrate effectiveness and generalization capability of the proposed method.

Conclusion: MM-DETR provides a lightweight and efficient framework for multimodal object detection that addresses the trade-off between performance and parameter efficiency through novel fusion mechanisms and modality-specific adaptation.

Abstract: Multimodal remote sensing object detection aims to achieve more accurate and robust perception under challenging conditions by fusing complementary information from different modalities. However, existing approaches that rely on attention-based or deformable convolution fusion blocks still struggle to balance performance and lightweight design. Beyond fusion complexity, extracting modality features with shared backbones yields suboptimal representations due to insufficient modality-specific modeling, whereas dual-stream architectures nearly double the parameter count, ultimately limiting practical deployment. To this end, we propose MM-DETR, a lightweight and efficient framework for multimodal object detection. Specifically, we propose a Mamba-based dual granularity fusion encoder that reformulates global interaction as channel-wise dynamic gating and leverages a 1D selective scan for efficient cross-modal modeling with linear complexity. Following this design, we further reinterpret multimodal fusion as a modality completion problem. A region-aware 2D selective scanning completion branch is introduced to recover modality-specific cues, supporting fine-grained fusion along a bidirectional pyramid pathway with minimal overhead. To further reduce parameter redundancy while retaining strong feature extraction capability, a lightweight frequency-aware modality adapter is inserted into the shared backbone. This adapter employs a spatial-frequency co-expert structure to capture modality-specific cues, while a pixel-wise router dynamically balances expert contributions for efficient spatial-frequency fusion. Extensive experiments conducted on four multimodal benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization capability of the proposed method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Smaller segmentation models develop human-like coarse body representations, while larger models create overly detailed encodings, suggesting coarse representations emerge under limited computational resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether vision models trained for segmentation develop internal representations similar to human "body" representations used for physical reasoning, and to investigate the structure of these representations.

Method: Adapted a psychophysical experiment with 50 human participants to a semantic segmentation task, then tested a family of seven segmentation networks of varying sizes to analyze their internal representations.

Result: Smaller segmentation models naturally form human-like coarse body representations, while larger models tend toward overly detailed, fine-grain encodings.

Conclusion: Coarse representations emerge under limited computational resources, and machine representations can provide a scalable approach to understanding the structure of physical reasoning in the brain.

Abstract: Human physical reasoning relies on internal "body" representations - coarse, volumetric approximations that capture an object's extent and support intuitive predictions about motion and physics. While psychophysical evidence suggests humans use such coarse representations, their internal structure remains largely unknown. Here we test whether vision models trained for segmentation develop comparable representations. We adapt a psychophysical experiment conducted with 50 human participants to a semantic segmentation task and test a family of seven segmentation networks, varying in size. We find that smaller models naturally form human-like coarse body representations, whereas larger models tend toward overly detailed, fine-grain encodings. Our results demonstrate that coarse representations can emerge under limited computational resources, and that machine representations can provide a scalable path toward understanding the structure of physical reasoning in the brain.

### [44] [THCRL: Trusted Hierarchical Contrastive Representation Learning for Multi-View Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00368)
*Jian Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: THCRL is a novel Trusted Hierarchical Contrastive Representation Learning method that addresses untrustworthy fusion in Multi-View Clustering by using Deep Symmetry Hierarchical Fusion with denoising and Average K-Nearest Neighbors Contrastive Learning to improve representation similarity within clusters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Multi-View Clustering methods suffer from untrustworthy fusion due to two main issues: 1) ignoring inherent noise within individual views, and 2) traditional Contrastive Learning approaches focus only on same-instance cross-view similarity while neglecting structural information from nearest neighbors within the same cluster, leading to wrong fusion directions.

Method: THCRL consists of two key modules: 1) Deep Symmetry Hierarchical Fusion (DSHF) module that uses UNet architecture with multiple denoising mechanisms for trustworthy multi-view data fusion, and 2) Average K-Nearest Neighbors Contrastive Learning (AKCL) module that aligns fused representation with view-specific representation by enhancing similarity among samples in the same cluster rather than just same samples across views.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that THCRL achieves state-of-the-art performance in deep Multi-View Clustering tasks.

Conclusion: THCRL effectively addresses the untrustworthy fusion problem in Multi-View Clustering by incorporating denoising mechanisms and cluster-aware contrastive learning, resulting in improved consensus representation learning and superior clustering performance.

Abstract: Multi-View Clustering (MVC) has garnered increasing attention in recent years. It is capable of partitioning data samples into distinct groups by learning a consensus representation. However, a significant challenge remains: the problem of untrustworthy fusion. This problem primarily arises from two key factors: 1) Existing methods often ignore the presence of inherent noise within individual views; 2) In traditional MVC methods using Contrastive Learning (CL), similarity computations typically rely on different views of the same instance, while neglecting the structural information from nearest neighbors within the same cluster. Consequently, this leads to the wrong direction for multi-view fusion. To address this problem, we present a novel Trusted Hierarchical Contrastive Representation Learning (THCRL). It consists of two key modules. Specifically, we propose the Deep Symmetry Hierarchical Fusion (DSHF) module, which leverages the UNet architecture integrated with multiple denoising mechanisms to achieve trustworthy fusion of multi-view data. Furthermore, we present the Average K-Nearest Neighbors Contrastive Learning (AKCL) module to align the fused representation with the view-specific representation. Unlike conventional strategies, AKCL enhances representation similarity among samples belonging to the same cluster, rather than merely focusing on the same sample across views, thereby reinforcing the confidence of the fused representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that THCRL achieves the state-of-the-art performance in deep MVC tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: POLARIS addresses inversion error accumulation in diffusion models by treating guidance scale as step-wise variable, improving inversion quality with minimal code changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper identifies a critical overlooked factor in diffusion model inversion: approximate noise error that accumulates throughout the inversion process, degrading reconstruction quality.

Method: POLARIS reformulates inversion as an error-origin problem rather than error-compensation. It treats guidance scale ω as step-wise variable and derives mathematical formula to minimize inversion error at each step.

Result: POLARIS improves inversion latent quality with just one line of code, has negligible performance overhead, substantially mitigates noise approximation errors, and consistently improves downstream task accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed POLARIS method effectively addresses inversion error accumulation in diffusion models through a mathematically grounded approach that treats guidance scale as a step-wise optimization variable.

Abstract: The Inversion-Denoising Paradigm, which is based on diffusion models, excels in diverse image editing and restoration tasks. We revisit its mechanism and reveal a critical, overlooked factor in reconstruction degradation: the approximate noise error. This error stems from approximating the noise at step t with the prediction at step t-1, resulting in severe error accumulation throughout the inversion process. We introduce Projection-Orthogonal Least Squares for Robust and Adaptive Inversion (POLARIS), which reformulates inversion from an error-compensation problem into an error-origin problem. Rather than optimizing embeddings or latent codes to offset accumulated drift, POLARIS treats the guidance scale ω as a step-wise variable and derives a mathematically grounded formula to minimize inversion error at each step. Remarkably, POLARIS improves inversion latent quality with just one line of code. With negligible performance overhead, it substantially mitigates noise approximation errors and consistently improves the accuracy of downstream tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PorePatch dataset for pore-scale facial image patches, uses Data-Model Co-Evolution framework to create it, and finds deep learning descriptors outperform traditional ones in matching but not in 3D reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Facial skin regions have weak texture, making local descriptor matching challenging for facial motion analysis and 3D reconstruction. Deep learning descriptors perform well in other domains but lack pore-scale facial datasets for development.

Method: Proposes PorePatch dataset with Data-Model Co-Evolution (DMCE) framework to progressively refine high-quality pore-scale image patches from high-resolution facial images. Establishes evaluation benchmark and trains SOTA models on the dataset.

Result: SOTA model achieves FPR95 of 1.91% on matching task, outperforming PSIFT (22.41%) by 20.5%. However, in 3D reconstruction task, deep learning descriptors don't significantly outperform traditional descriptors, showing limitations for facial weak-texture regions.

Conclusion: Deep learning descriptors still have limitations in addressing facial weak-texture region challenges despite good matching performance. More work is needed in this field, and the PorePatch dataset provides a foundation for future research.

Abstract: The weak-texture nature of facial skin regions presents significant challenges for local descriptor matching in applications such as facial motion analysis and 3D face reconstruction. Although deep learning-based descriptors have demonstrated superior performance to traditional hand-crafted descriptors in many applications, the scarcity of pore-scale image patch datasets has hindered their further development in the facial domain. In this paper, we propose the PorePatch dataset, a high-quality pore-scale image patch dataset, and establish a rational evaluation benchmark. We introduce a Data-Model Co-Evolution (DMCE) framework to generate a progressively refined, high-quality dataset from high-resolution facial images. We then train existing SOTA models on our dataset and conduct extensive experiments. Our results show that the SOTA model achieves a FPR95 value of 1.91% on the matching task, outperforming PSIFT (22.41%) by a margin of 20.5%. However, its advantage is diminished in the 3D reconstruction task, where its overall performance is not significantly better than that of traditional descriptors. This indicates that deep learning descriptors still have limitations in addressing the challenges of facial weak-texture regions, and much work remains to be done in this field.

Conclusion: EZ-SP enables efficient real-time 3D semantic segmentation with minimal VRAM footprint (<2 MB), making superpoint-based approaches practical for large-scale applications across multiple domains.

Abstract: Superpoint-based pipelines provide an efficient alternative to point- or voxel-based 3D semantic segmentation, but are often bottlenecked by their CPU-bound partition step. We propose a learnable, fully GPU partitioning algorithm that generates geometrically and semantically coherent superpoints 13$\times$ faster than prior methods. Our module is compact (under 60k parameters), trains in under 20 minutes with a differentiable surrogate loss, and requires no handcrafted features. Combine with a lightweight superpoint classifier, the full pipeline fits in $<$2 MB of VRAM, scales to multi-million-point scenes, and supports real-time inference. With 72$\times$ faster inference and 120$\times$ fewer parameters, EZ-SP matches the accuracy of point-based SOTA models across three domains: indoor scans (S3DIS), autonomous driving (KITTI-360), and aerial LiDAR (DALES).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WiseEdit is a new benchmark for evaluating cognition- and creativity-informed image editing models, featuring 1,220 test cases across three cognitive steps (Awareness, Interpretation, Imagination) and three knowledge types (Declarative, Procedural, Metacognitive).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks are too narrow to holistically assess the advanced cognitive and creative capabilities of modern image editing models, which require deeper evaluation of knowledge-intensive reasoning and creative composition.

Method: The benchmark decomposes image editing into three cascaded cognitive steps: Awareness (perceiving what needs editing), Interpretation (understanding how to edit), and Imagination (creative transformation). It also includes complex tasks combining these steps and incorporates three knowledge types: Declarative (factual knowledge), Procedural (how-to knowledge), and Metacognitive (self-regulation knowledge).

Result: WiseEdit comprises 1,220 test cases that objectively reveal limitations of state-of-the-art image editing models in knowledge-based cognitive reasoning and creative composition capabilities.

Conclusion: WiseEdit provides a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating advanced image editing models, exposing their current limitations in cognitive and creative capabilities while offering a structured framework for future model development and assessment.

Abstract: Recent image editing models boast next-level intelligent capabilities, facilitating cognition- and creativity-informed image editing. Yet, existing benchmarks provide too narrow a scope for evaluation, failing to holistically assess these advanced abilities. To address this, we introduce WiseEdit, a knowledge-intensive benchmark for comprehensive evaluation of cognition- and creativity-informed image editing, featuring deep task depth and broad knowledge breadth. Drawing an analogy to human cognitive creation, WiseEdit decomposes image editing into three cascaded steps, i.e., Awareness, Interpretation, and Imagination, each corresponding to a task that poses a challenge for models to complete at the specific step. It also encompasses complex tasks, where none of the three steps can be finished easily. Furthermore, WiseEdit incorporates three fundamental types of knowledge: Declarative, Procedural, and Metacognitive knowledge. Ultimately, WiseEdit comprises 1,220 test cases, objectively revealing the limitations of SoTA image editing models in knowledge-based cognitive reasoning and creative composition capabilities. The benchmark, evaluation code, and the generated images of each model will be made publicly available soon. Project Page: https://qnancy.github.io/wiseedit_project_page/.

*Jiazhen Liu,Mingkuan Feng,Long Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STAMP resolves the MLLM segmentation trilemma by decoupling autoregressive dialogue generation from non-autoregressive mask prediction, achieving simultaneous excellence in dialogue ability, segmentation performance, and inference speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs face a trilemma when integrating segmentation: they must compromise between preserving dialogue ability, achieving high segmentation performance, and ensuring fast inference. Existing methods either degrade dialogue quality or suffer from poor segmentation performance or slow inference speeds.

Method: STAMP uses "all-mask prediction" paradigm that decouples dialogue generation from mask prediction. After generating textual responses autoregressively, it predicts entire segmentation masks in a single forward pass by treating it as a parallel "fill-in-the-blank" task over image patches.

Result: STAMP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple segmentation benchmarks, achieving excellence in all three dimensions: dialogue ability, segmentation performance, and inference speed without compromise.

Conclusion: The all-mask prediction paradigm successfully resolves the MLLM segmentation trilemma, providing a practical solution that maintains dialogue quality while achieving high segmentation performance and fast inference simultaneously.

Abstract: Integrating segmentation into Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) presents a core trilemma: simultaneously preserving dialogue ability, achieving high segmentation performance, and ensuring fast inference. Prevailing paradigms are forced into a compromise. Embedding prediction methods introduce a conflicting pixel-level objective that degrades the MLLM's general dialogue abilities. The alternative, next-token prediction, reframes segmentation as an autoregressive task, which preserves dialogue but forces a trade-off between poor segmentation performance with sparse outputs or prohibitive inference speeds with rich ones. We resolve this trilemma with all-mask prediction, a novel paradigm that decouples autoregressive dialogue generation from non-autoregressive mask prediction. We present STAMP: Simultaneous Textual All-Mask Prediction, an MLLM that embodies this paradigm. After generating a textual response, STAMP predicts an entire segmentation mask in a single forward pass by treating it as a parallel "fill-in-the-blank" task over image patches. This design maintains the MLLM's dialogue ability by avoiding conflicting objectives, enables high segmentation performance by leveraging rich, bidirectional spatial context for all mask tokens, and achieves exceptional speed. Extensive experiments show that STAMP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple segmentation benchmarks, providing a solution that excels in dialogue, segmentation, and speed without compromise.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiSCo: Semantic video compression framework using multimodal decomposition (text, degraded video, optional sketches/poses) + conditional video diffusion for reconstruction, achieving 2-10X better perceptual quality at low bitrates vs traditional codecs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional video codecs fail at ultra-low bitrates due to misalignment between pixel accuracy and human perception. They produce severe artifacts when optimized for pixel fidelity rather than semantic meaning.

Method: Decomposes video into three compact modalities: textual description (semantics), spatiotemporally degraded video (appearance), and optional sketches/poses (motion). Uses conditional video diffusion model for reconstruction with temporal forward filling, token interleaving, and modality-specific codecs.

Result: Outperforms baseline semantic and traditional codecs by 2-10X on perceptual metrics at low bitrates, demonstrating superior video quality preservation.

Conclusion: Semantic compression with generative priors is more effective than pixel-based approaches at ultra-low bitrates, aligning better with human perception by transmitting only meaningful information.

Abstract: Traditional video codecs optimized for pixel fidelity collapse at ultra-low bitrates and produce severe artifacts. This failure arises from a fundamental misalignment between pixel accuracy and human perception. We propose a semantic video compression framework named DiSCo that transmits only the most meaningful information while relying on generative priors for detail synthesis. The source video is decomposed into three compact modalities: a textual description, a spatiotemporally degraded video, and optional sketches or poses that respectively capture semantic, appearance, and motion cues. A conditional video diffusion model then reconstructs high-quality, temporally coherent videos from these compact representations. Temporal forward filling, token interleaving, and modality-specific codecs are proposed to improve multimodal generation and modality compactness. Experiments show that our method outperforms baseline semantic and traditional codecs by 2-10X on perceptual metrics at low bitrates.

TL;DR: SplatFont3D: A novel structure-aware text-to-3D artistic font generation framework using 3D Gaussian splatting for precise part-level style control and efficient rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D artistic font generation (3D-AFG) is underexplored despite its potential for immersive 3D environments and enhancing 2D-AFG. Unlike general 3D objects, 3D fonts require precise semantics with strong structural constraints and fine-grained part-level style control.

Method: Proposes SplatFont3D with: 1) Glyph2Cloud module that enhances 2D glyphs and produces 3D point clouds for Gaussian initialization, 2) Score distillation sampling with pretrained 2D diffusion model for optimization, 3) Dynamic component assignment strategy using geometric priors of 3D Gaussians for part-level control.

Result: Outperforms existing 3D models for 3D-AFG in style-text consistency, visual quality, and rendering efficiency. Provides more explicit part-level style control than NeRF with faster rendering.

Conclusion: SplatFont3D successfully addresses the challenges of 3D-AFG by enabling precise part-level style control through 3D Gaussian splatting, offering superior performance in generating 3D artistic fonts from text prompts.

Abstract: Artistic font generation (AFG) can assist human designers in creating innovative artistic fonts. However, most previous studies primarily focus on 2D artistic fonts in flat design, leaving personalized 3D-AFG largely underexplored. 3D-AFG not only enables applications in immersive 3D environments such as video games and animations, but also may enhance 2D-AFG by rendering 2D fonts of novel views. Moreover, unlike general 3D objects, 3D fonts exhibit precise semantics with strong structural constraints and also demand fine-grained part-level style control. To address these challenges, we propose SplatFont3D, a novel structure-aware text-to-3D AFG framework with 3D Gaussian splatting, which enables the creation of 3D artistic fonts from diverse style text prompts with precise part-level style control. Specifically, we first introduce a Glyph2Cloud module, which progressively enhances both the shapes and styles of 2D glyphs (or components) and produces their corresponding 3D point clouds for Gaussian initialization. The initialized 3D Gaussians are further optimized through interaction with a pretrained 2D diffusion model using score distillation sampling. To enable part-level control, we present a dynamic component assignment strategy that exploits the geometric priors of 3D Gaussians to partition components, while alleviating drift-induced entanglement during 3D Gaussian optimization. Our SplatFont3D provides more explicit and effective part-level style control than NeRF, attaining faster rendering efficiency. Experiments show that our SplatFont3D outperforms existing 3D models for 3D-AFG in style-text consistency, visual quality, and rendering efficiency.

TL;DR: A physics-based 3D shape generation pipeline that incorporates physical properties (like aerodynamics) to enhance realism beyond visual plausibility, using flow matching with alternating velocity-based and physics-based updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D shape generation models lack knowledge of physical properties that are crucial for engineering-designed shapes (e.g., aerodynamic efficiency for cars), limiting their ability to generate physically realistic shapes for industrial design applications.

Method: Proposes a unified physics-based pipeline with: 1) Flow matching model with explicit physical guidance using alternating velocity-based updates and physics-based refinement, 2) Physics-aware regularization in velocity updates, 3) Shape-and-physics variational autoencoder (SP-VAE) that jointly encodes shape and physics into unified latent space.

Result: Experiments on three benchmarks show the synergistic formulation improves shape realism beyond mere visual plausibility, demonstrating enhanced physical validity in generated shapes.

Conclusion: The proposed physics-based 3D shape generation pipeline successfully incorporates physical properties to generate more realistic shapes for industrial design applications, moving beyond visual plausibility to physical validity.

Abstract: Existing generative models for 3D shapes can synthesize high-fidelity and visually plausible shapes. For certain classes of shapes that have undergone an engineering design process, the realism of the shape is tightly coupled with the underlying physical properties, e.g., aerodynamic efficiency for automobiles. Since existing methods lack knowledge of such physics, they are unable to use this knowledge to enhance the realism of shape generation. Motivated by this, we propose a unified physics-based 3D shape generation pipeline, with a focus on industrial design applications. Specifically, we introduce a new flow matching model with explicit physical guidance, consisting of an alternating update process. We iteratively perform a velocity-based update and a physics-based refinement, progressively adjusting the latent code to align with the desired 3D shapes and physical properties. We further strengthen physical validity by incorporating a physics-aware regularization term into the velocity-based update step. To support such physics-guided updates, we build a shape-and-physics variational autoencoder (SP-VAE) that jointly encodes shape and physics information into a unified latent space. The experiments on three benchmarks show that this synergistic formulation improves shape realism beyond mere visual plausibility.

TL;DR: A computer vision pipeline using existing bus CCTV cameras achieves high passenger counting accuracy in ideal conditions but degrades significantly under real-world stressors like overcrowding in sub-Saharan African public transport.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Public transport in sub-Saharan Africa operates in overcrowded conditions where automated passenger counting systems fail. Existing onboard CCTV deployed for security could be leveraged to recover passenger flow data without additional hardware investment.

Method: Combines YOLOv12 for person detection, BotSORT for tracking, OSNet for person re-identification embeddings, OCR for timestamping, and telematics for stop classification to create origin-destination flow matrices from bus CCTV footage.

Result: High accuracy under low-density, well-lit conditions (95% recall, 91% precision, 93% F1) with OD matrices matching manual tallies. Performance degrades sharply under real-world stressors: ~40% undercount during peak-hour boarding and 17 percentage-point recall drop for monochrome footage.

Conclusion: While the baseline pipeline shows promise for ideal conditions, real-world deployment in SSA transit reveals significant failure modes under overcrowding and environmental challenges, motivating development of more robust, deployment-focused person re-identification methods.

Abstract: Public transport in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) often operates in overcrowded conditions where existing automated systems fail to capture reliable passenger flow data. Leveraging onboard CCTV already deployed for security, we present a baseline pipeline that combines YOLOv12 detection, BotSORT tracking, OSNet embeddings, OCR-based timestamping, and telematics-based stop classification to recover bus origin--destination (OD) flows. On annotated CCTV segments from Nairobi and Kigali buses, the system attains high counting accuracy under low-density, well-lit conditions (recall $\approx$95\%, precision $\approx$91\%, F1 $\approx$93\%). It produces OD matrices that closely match manual tallies. Under realistic stressors such as overcrowding, color-to-monochrome shifts, posture variation, and non-standard door use, performance degrades sharply (e.g., $\sim$40\% undercount in peak-hour boarding and a $\sim$17 percentage-point drop in recall for monochrome segments), revealing deployment-specific failure modes and motivating more robust, deployment-focused Re-ID methods for SSA transit.

*Minh-Quan Le,Yuanzhi Zhu,Vicky Kalogeiton,Dimitris Samaras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NewtonRewards is a physics-grounded post-training framework that uses verifiable rewards (optical flow for velocity, appearance features for mass) to enforce Newtonian physics in video generation, improving physical plausibility across motion primitives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video diffusion models produce visually compelling clips but often violate basic physical laws (objects floating, inconsistent accelerations, unrealistic collisions), revealing a gap between visual realism and physical realism.

Method: NewtonRewards extracts measurable proxies from generated videos using frozen utility models: optical flow as proxy for velocity, and high-level appearance features as proxy for mass. It enforces Newtonian structure through two rewards: Newtonian kinematic constraint (constant-acceleration dynamics) and mass conservation reward (preventing degenerate solutions).

Result: NewtonRewards consistently improves physical plausibility, motion smoothness, and temporal coherence across five Newtonian Motion Primitives (free fall, horizontal/parabolic throw, ramp sliding down/up) on the NewtonBench-60K benchmark, maintaining strong performance under out-of-distribution shifts in height, speed, and friction.

Conclusion: Physics-grounded verifiable rewards offer a scalable path toward physics-aware video generation, bridging the gap between visual and physical realism without relying on human or VLM feedback.

Abstract: Recent video diffusion models can synthesize visually compelling clips, yet often violate basic physical laws-objects float, accelerations drift, and collisions behave inconsistently-revealing a persistent gap between visual realism and physical realism. We propose $\texttt{NewtonRewards}$, the first physics-grounded post-training framework for video generation based on $\textit{verifiable rewards}$. Instead of relying on human or VLM feedback, $\texttt{NewtonRewards}$ extracts $\textit{measurable proxies}$ from generated videos using frozen utility models: optical flow serves as a proxy for velocity, while high-level appearance features serve as a proxy for mass. These proxies enable explicit enforcement of Newtonian structure through two complementary rewards: a Newtonian kinematic constraint enforcing constant-acceleration dynamics, and a mass conservation reward preventing trivial, degenerate solutions. We evaluate $\texttt{NewtonRewards}$ on five Newtonian Motion Primitives (free fall, horizontal/parabolic throw, and ramp sliding down/up) using our newly constructed large-scale benchmark, $\texttt{NewtonBench-60K}$. Across all primitives in visual and physics metrics, $\texttt{NewtonRewards}$ consistently improves physical plausibility, motion smoothness, and temporal coherence over prior post-training methods. It further maintains strong performance under out-of-distribution shifts in height, speed, and friction. Our results show that physics-grounded verifiable rewards offer a scalable path toward physics-aware video generation.

*Jiachuan Peng,Kyle Lam,Jianing Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A pneumonia classifier trained solely on synthetic chest X-ray images generated by Google's Nano Banana AI achieved strong performance on real-world datasets, demonstrating feasibility of synthetic data for medical AI development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of using synthetic medical imaging data generated by advanced AI models for training diagnostic classifiers, addressing data scarcity and privacy concerns in medical AI development.

Method: Trained a pneumonia classifier using synthetic chest X-ray images generated by Google's Nano Banana AI model, then directly tested on real-world CXR datasets without additional real data training.

Result: The classifier achieved AUROC of 0.923 and AUPR of 0.900 on RSNA dataset (14,863 CXRs), and AUROC of 0.824 and AUPR of 0.913 on Chest X-Ray dataset (5,856 CXRs), showing strong performance on real-world data despite being trained only on synthetic images.

Conclusion: Synthetic data shows promise for medical AI development but requires careful prompt design, post-processing, and substantial validation with regulatory oversight before clinical translation.

Abstract: We trained a classifier with synthetic chest X-ray (CXR) images generated by Nano Banana, the latest AI model for image generation and editing, released by Google. When directly applied to real-world CXRs having only been trained with synthetic data, the classifier achieved an AUROC of 0.923 (95% CI: 0.919 - 0.927), and an AUPR of 0.900 (95% CI: 0.894 - 0.907) in recognizing pneumonia in the 2018 RSNA Pneumonia Detection dataset (14,863 CXRs), and an AUROC of 0.824 (95% CI: 0.810 - 0.836), and an AUPR of 0.913 (95% CI: 0.904 - 0.922) in the Chest X-Ray dataset (5,856 CXRs). These external validation results on real-world data demonstrate the feasibility of this approach and suggest potential for synthetic data in medical AI development. Nonetheless, several limitations remain at present, including challenges in prompt design for controlling the diversity of synthetic CXR data and the requirement for post-processing to ensure alignment with real-world data. However, the growing sophistication and accessibility of medical intelligence will necessitate substantial validation, regulatory approval, and ethical oversight prior to clinical translation.

### [56] [FR-TTS: Test-Time Scaling for NTP-based Image Generation with Effective Filling-based Reward Signal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00438)
*Hang Xu,Linjiang Huang,Feng Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FR-TTS introduces a filling-based reward method for test-time scaling in next-token prediction, addressing the challenge of evaluating incomplete intermediate sequences by estimating their future trajectory through reasonable completion schemes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Test-time scaling works well for image generation but fails in next-token prediction due to low correlation between rewards of intermediate token sequences and final outputs, making incomplete sequences poor indicators for pruning decisions.

Method: Proposes Filling-Based Reward (FR) that estimates future trajectory of intermediate samples by finding and applying reasonable filling schemes to complete sequences. Builds FR-TTS strategy that searches for good filling schemes and incorporates diversity reward with dynamic weighting for balanced evaluation.

Result: FR provides excellent correlation between intermediate and final sample rewards, with multiple intrinsic signals validating its reliability. FR-TTS outperforms established benchmarks and various reward models in experimental validation.

Conclusion: FR-TTS successfully adapts test-time scaling to next-token prediction by solving the intermediate evaluation problem through filling-based reward estimation, enabling effective quality assessment and pruning of incomplete sequences.

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) has become a prevalent technique in image generation, significantly boosting output quality by expanding the number of parallel samples and filtering them using pre-trained reward models. However, applying this powerful methodology to the next-token prediction (NTP) paradigm remains challenging. The primary obstacle is the low correlation between the reward of an image decoded from an intermediate token sequence and the reward of the fully generated image. Consequently, these incomplete intermediate representations prove to be poor indicators for guiding the pruning direction, a limitation that stems from their inherent incompleteness in scale or semantic content. To effectively address this critical issue, we introduce the Filling-Based Reward (FR). This novel design estimates the approximate future trajectory of an intermediate sample by finding and applying a reasonable filling scheme to complete the sequence. Both the correlation coefficient between rewards of intermediate samples and final samples, as well as multiple intrinsic signals like token confidence, indicate that the FR provides an excellent and reliable metric for accurately evaluating the quality of intermediate samples. Building upon this foundation, we propose FR-TTS, a sophisticated scaling strategy. FR-TTS efficiently searches for good filling schemes and incorporates a diversity reward with a dynamic weighting schedule to achieve a balanced and comprehensive evaluation of intermediate samples. We experimentally validate the superiority of FR-TTS over multiple established benchmarks and various reward models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated personality and soft skill assessment faces challenges due to limited datasets and methods that fail to capture geometric structure inherent in human traits.

Method: Cross-Modal Regression with Manifold Fusion (CRMF) - geometric deep learning framework modeling behavioral representations across hyperbolic, spherical, and Euclidean manifolds with geometry-specific expert networks and adaptive routing mechanism.

Result: CRMF substantially outperforms baselines with up to 11.4% improvement in Spearman correlation and 6.0% in concordance index, while training 40-50% fewer parameters than large multimodal models.

Conclusion: The RecruitView dataset and CRMF framework provide effective solutions for automated personality assessment by leveraging geometric structures in behavioral data, with publicly available dataset.

Abstract: Automated personality and soft skill assessment from multimodal behavioral data remains challenging due to limited datasets and methods that fail to capture geometric structure inherent in human traits. We introduce RecruitView, a dataset of 2,011 naturalistic video interview clips from 300+ participants with 27,000 pairwise comparative judgments across 12 dimensions: Big Five personality traits, overall personality score, and six interview performance metrics. To leverage this data, we propose Cross-Modal Regression with Manifold Fusion (CRMF), a geometric deep learning framework that explicitly models behavioral representations across hyperbolic, spherical, and Euclidean manifolds. CRMF employs geometry-specific expert networks to capture hierarchical trait structures, directional behavioral patterns, and continuous performance variations simultaneously. An adaptive routing mechanism dynamically weights expert contributions based on input characteristics. Through principled tangent space fusion, CRMF achieves superior performance while training 40-50% fewer trainable parameters than large multimodal models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CRMF substantially outperforms the selected baselines, achieving up to 11.4% improvement in Spearman correlation and 6.0% in concordance index.

*Guanyu Hu,Tangzheng Lian,Dimitrios Kollias,Oya Celiktutan,Xinyu Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CausalAffect is a novel framework for discovering causal relationships between facial Action Units (AUs) and expressions, using a two-level causal hierarchy and counterfactual interventions to achieve psychologically plausible causal reasoning without requiring annotated datasets or handcrafted priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing facial affect analysis approaches lack structured reasoning about causal dependencies between AUs and expressions, failing to capture psychologically plausible causal relations that drive facial muscle activations and expressive outcomes.

Method: CausalAffect uses a two-level polarity and direction aware causal hierarchy modeling AU-AU and AU-Expression dependencies, integrating population-level regularities with sample-adaptive structures. It employs feature-level counterfactual intervention mechanisms to enforce true causal effects while suppressing spurious correlations.

Result: The framework recovers causal structures consistent with established psychological theories while revealing novel inhibitory and previously uncharacterized dependencies. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks show state-of-the-art performance in both AU detection and expression recognition.

Conclusion: CausalAffect establishes a principled connection between causal discovery and interpretable facial behavior analysis, advancing the field by providing psychologically plausible causal reasoning without requiring annotated datasets or handcrafted priors.

Abstract: Understanding human affect from facial behavior requires not only accurate recognition but also structured reasoning over the latent dependencies that drive muscle activations and their expressive outcomes. Although Action Units (AUs) have long served as the foundation of affective computing, existing approaches rarely address how to infer psychologically plausible causal relations between AUs and expressions directly from data. We propose CausalAffect, the first framework for causal graph discovery in facial affect analysis. CausalAffect models AU-AU and AU-Expression dependencies through a two-level polarity and direction aware causal hierarchy that integrates population-level regularities with sample-adaptive structures. A feature-level counterfactual intervention mechanism further enforces true causal effects while suppressing spurious correlations. Crucially, our approach requires neither jointly annotated datasets nor handcrafted causal priors, yet it recovers causal structures consistent with established psychological theories while revealing novel inhibitory and previously uncharacterized dependencies. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate that CausalAffect advances the state of the art in both AU detection and expression recognition, establishing a principled connection between causal discovery and interpretable facial behavior. All trained models and source code will be released upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RealGen is a photorealistic text-to-image framework that uses LLM prompt optimization, diffusion models, and a novel "Detector Reward" mechanism to generate highly realistic images without AI artifacts, outperforming existing models in photorealism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current advanced image generation models like GPT-Image-1 and Qwen-Image achieve good text-to-image consistency but still produce "fake" images with AI artifacts (overly smooth skin, oily facial sheens). The goal is to achieve "indistinguishable-from-reality" photorealistic generation.

Method: RealGen integrates: 1) LLM component for prompt optimization, 2) diffusion model for realistic image generation, 3) "Detector Reward" mechanism that quantifies artifacts using semantic-level and feature-level synthetic image detectors, 4) GRPO algorithm to optimize the entire pipeline using the reward signal.

Result: RealGen significantly outperforms general models (GPT-Image-1, Qwen-Image) and specialized photorealistic models (FLUX-Krea) in terms of realism, detail, and aesthetics. The proposed RealBench benchmark enables accurate human-free photorealism assessment.

Conclusion: RealGen successfully addresses the photorealism gap in text-to-image generation through its integrated framework with detector-based reward optimization, achieving state-of-the-art realistic image generation that better aligns with real user experience.

Abstract: With the continuous advancement of image generation technology, advanced models such as GPT-Image-1 and Qwen-Image have achieved remarkable text-to-image consistency and world knowledge However, these models still fall short in photorealistic image generation. Even on simple T2I tasks, they tend to produce " fake" images with distinct AI artifacts, often characterized by "overly smooth skin" and "oily facial sheens". To recapture the original goal of "indistinguishable-from-reality" generation, we propose RealGen, a photorealistic text-to-image framework. RealGen integrates an LLM component for prompt optimization and a diffusion model for realistic image generation. Inspired by adversarial generation, RealGen introduces a "Detector Reward" mechanism, which quantifies artifacts and assesses realism using both semantic-level and feature-level synthetic image detectors. We leverage this reward signal with the GRPO algorithm to optimize the entire generation pipeline, significantly enhancing image realism and detail. Furthermore, we propose RealBench, an automated evaluation benchmark employing Detector-Scoring and Arena-Scoring. It enables human-free photorealism assessment, yielding results that are more accurate and aligned with real user experience. Experiments demonstrate that RealGen significantly outperforms general models like GPT-Image-1 and Qwen-Image, as well as specialized photorealistic models like FLUX-Krea, in terms of realism, detail, and aesthetics.

TL;DR: Proposes Structured Context Learning with Structured Partition of Sequence (SPoS) for Generic Event Boundary Detection, achieving linear complexity and state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generic Event Boundary Detection (GEBD) aims to identify moments in videos that humans perceive as event boundaries, but existing methods lack structured context learning and have computational limitations.

Method: Introduces Structured Partition of Sequence (SPoS) to partition input frames and provide structured context for temporal models. Uses group similarity calculations and lightweight fully convolutional network for boundary detection. Applies Gaussian kernel preprocessing to handle annotation ambiguities.

Result: Achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on Kinetics-GEBD, TAPOS, and shot transition detection datasets with linear computational complexity relative to video length.

Conclusion: The proposed Structured Context Learning with SPoS provides an effective, flexible, and computationally efficient approach for GEBD that outperforms existing methods while maintaining good speed-accuracy trade-off.

Abstract: Generic Event Boundary Detection (GEBD) aims to identify moments in videos that humans perceive as event boundaries. This paper proposes a novel method for addressing this task, called Structured Context Learning, which introduces the Structured Partition of Sequence (SPoS) to provide a structured context for learning temporal information. Our approach is end-to-end trainable and flexible, not restricted to specific temporal models like GRU, LSTM, and Transformers. This flexibility enables our method to achieve a better speed-accuracy trade-off. Specifically, we apply SPoS to partition the input frame sequence and provide a structured context for the subsequent temporal model. Notably, SPoS's overall computational complexity is linear with respect to the video length. We next calculate group similarities to capture differences between frames, and a lightweight fully convolutional network is utilized to determine the event boundaries based on the grouped similarity maps. To remedy the ambiguities of boundary annotations, we adapt the Gaussian kernel to preprocess the ground-truth event boundaries. Our proposed method has been extensively evaluated on the challenging Kinetics-GEBD, TAPOS, and shot transition detection datasets, demonstrating its superiority over existing state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans resolve visual uncertainty by comparing images with relevant examples, but ViTs lack the ability to identify which examples would actually improve their predictions. Current methods rely on similarity-based retrieval which may not align with task performance.

Method: Task-Aligned Context Selection (TACS) jointly trains a selector network with the task model using a hybrid optimization scheme combining gradient-based supervision and reinforcement learning, making retrieval part of the learning objective to align selection with task rewards.

Result: TACS consistently outperforms similarity-based retrieval across 18 datasets covering fine-grained recognition, medical image classification, and medical image segmentation, particularly in challenging or data-limited settings.

Conclusion: By aligning example selection with task rewards, TACS enables discriminative models to discover which contextual examples genuinely help, providing a more effective approach than similarity-based retrieval for improving visual understanding.

Abstract: Humans often resolve visual uncertainty by comparing an image with relevant examples, but ViTs lack the ability to identify which examples would improve their predictions. We present Task-Aligned Context Selection (TACS), a framework that learns to select paired examples which truly improve task performance rather than those that merely appear similar. TACS jointly trains a selector network with the task model through a hybrid optimization scheme combining gradient-based supervision and reinforcement learning, making retrieval part of the learning objective. By aligning selection with task rewards, TACS enables discriminative models to discover which contextual examples genuinely help. Across 18 datasets covering fine-grained recognition, medical image classification, and medical image segmentation, TACS consistently outperforms similarity-based retrieval, particularly in challenging or data-limited settings.

TL;DR: CC-FMO is a zero-shot pipeline for generating 3D scenes from single images that preserves object layout and instance fidelity through hybrid instance generation and camera-conditioned scale solving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches struggle with coherent scene generation due to inaccurate per-object pose estimations and spatial inconsistency, especially when moving from instance-level to scene-level generation.

Method: Uses a hybrid instance generator combining semantics-aware vector-set representation with detail-rich structured latent representation, plus a camera-conditioned scale-solving algorithm to apply foundational pose estimation models.

Result: Extensive experiments show CC-FMO consistently generates high-fidelity camera-aligned compositional scenes, outperforming all state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: CC-FMO provides an effective zero-shot solution for single-image to 3D scene generation that achieves both instance fidelity and scene-level coherence.

Abstract: High-quality 3D scene generation from a single image is crucial for AR/VR and embodied AI applications. Early approaches struggle to generalize due to reliance on specialized models trained on curated small datasets. While recent advancements in large-scale 3D foundation models have significantly enhanced instance-level generation, coherent scene generation remains a challenge, where performance is limited by inaccurate per-object pose estimations and spatial inconsistency. To this end, this paper introduces CC-FMO, a zero-shot, camera-conditioned pipeline for single-image to 3D scene generation that jointly conforms to the object layout in input image and preserves instance fidelity. CC-FMO employs a hybrid instance generator that combines semantics-aware vector-set representation with detail-rich structured latent representation, yielding object geometries that are both semantically plausible and high-quality. Furthermore, CC-FMO enables the application of foundational pose estimation models in the scene generation task via a simple yet effective camera-conditioned scale-solving algorithm, to enforce scene-level coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CC-FMO consistently generates high-fidelity camera-aligned compositional scenes, outperforming all state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: Smartphone-based structured-light system using 2D-DTW for terrain unevenness sensing on mobile rovers


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-cost mobile rovers need to detect small ground unevenness that's hard to see visually but affects stability, requiring a simple sensing solution

Method: Smartphone projects grid pattern onto ground, uses topology-constrained 2D dynamic time warping to match deformed grid under perspective distortion and occlusion

Result: Developed 2D-DTW algorithm that runs on resource-limited platforms while preserving grid structure for accurate triangulation, applicable beyond terrain sensing

Conclusion: Proposed system enables mobile rovers to sense terrain unevenness using simple smartphone hardware with novel 2D-DTW algorithm for grid pattern matching

Abstract: Low-cost mobile rovers often operate on uneven terrain where small bumps or tilts are difficult to perceive visually but can significantly affect locomotion stability. To address this problem, we explore a smartphone-based structured-light system that projects a grid pattern onto the ground and reconstructs local terrain unevenness from a single handheld device. The system is inspired by face-recognition projectors, but adapted for ground sensing. A key technical challenge is robustly matching the projected grid with its deformed observation under perspective distortion and partial occlusion. Conventional one-dimensional dynamic time warping (1D-DTW) is not directly applicable to such two-dimensional grid patterns. We therefore propose a topology-constrained two-dimensional dynamic time warping (2D-DTW) algorithm that performs column-wise alignment under a global grid consistency constraint. The proposed method is designed to be simple enough to run on resource limited platforms while preserving the grid structure required for accurate triangulation. We demonstrate that our 2D-DTW formulation can be used not only for terrain sensing but also as a general tool for matching structured grid patterns in image processing scenarios. This paper describes the overall system design as well as the 2D-DTW extension that emerged from this application.

Motivation: Existing video diffusion models require large domain-specific datasets and struggle to generalize, while recent image generation models trained on language-image corpora show strong compositionality and temporal coherence, suggesting potential for video-like robotic planning.

Method: Two-part framework: (1) text-conditioned generation using language instruction and first frame, and (2) trajectory-conditioned generation using 2D trajectory overlay and initial frame. Both use LoRA finetuning for light adaptation of pretrained image generators.

Result: Experiments on Jaco Play dataset, Bridge V2, and RT1 dataset show both modes produce smooth, coherent robot videos aligned with their respective conditions, demonstrating transferable temporal priors in pretrained image generators.

Conclusion: Pretrained image generators encode transferable temporal priors and can function as video-like robotic planners under minimal supervision, offering a promising approach for unifying perception, planning, and action in embodied agents.

Abstract: Generating realistic robotic manipulation videos is an important step toward unifying perception, planning, and action in embodied agents. While existing video diffusion models require large domain-specific datasets and struggle to generalize, recent image generation models trained on language-image corpora exhibit strong compositionality, including the ability to synthesize temporally coherent grid images. This suggests a latent capacity for video-like generation even without explicit temporal modeling.
  We explore whether such models can serve as visual planners for robots when lightly adapted using LoRA finetuning. We propose a two-part framework that includes: (1) text-conditioned generation, which uses a language instruction and the first frame, and (2) trajectory-conditioned generation, which uses a 2D trajectory overlay and the same initial frame. Experiments on the Jaco Play dataset, Bridge V2, and the RT1 dataset show that both modes produce smooth, coherent robot videos aligned with their respective conditions.

TL;DR: Cross-Temporal 3D Gaussian Splatting (Cross-Temporal 3DGS) enables efficient 3D scene reconstruction and updating across time periods using sparse images and historical scene priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Maintaining consistent 3D scene representations over time is challenging but crucial for applications like urban planning, disaster assessment, and historical preservation where dense scans are often unavailable. There's a need for efficient methods to update 3D scenes from sparse-view observations.

Method: Three-stage framework: 1) Cross-temporal camera alignment for pose estimation across timestamps, 2) Interference-based confidence initialization to identify unchanged regions between timestamps, and 3) Progressive cross-temporal optimization that iteratively integrates historical prior information into 3D scenes.

Result: Experimental results show significant improvements over baseline methods in reconstruction quality and data efficiency. The method supports non-continuous capture, enabling scene updates with new sparse views and recovery of past scenes from limited data.

Conclusion: Cross-Temporal 3DGS is a promising solution for scene versioning, cross-temporal digital twins, and long-term spatial documentation, demonstrating potential for temporal change analysis using only sparse images that can later be reconstructed into detailed 3D representations.

Abstract: Maintaining consistent 3D scene representations over time is a significant challenge in computer vision. Updating 3D scenes from sparse-view observations is crucial for various real-world applications, including urban planning, disaster assessment, and historical site preservation, where dense scans are often unavailable or impractical. In this paper, we propose Cross-Temporal 3D Gaussian Splatting (Cross-Temporal 3DGS), a novel framework for efficiently reconstructing and updating 3D scenes across different time periods, using sparse images and previously captured scene priors. Our approach comprises three stages: 1) Cross-temporal camera alignment for estimating and aligning camera poses across different timestamps; 2) Interference-based confidence initialization to identify unchanged regions between timestamps, thereby guiding updates; and 3) Progressive cross-temporal optimization, which iteratively integrates historical prior information into the 3D scene to enhance reconstruction quality. Our method supports non-continuous capture, enabling not only updates using new sparse views to refine existing scenes, but also recovering past scenes from limited data with the help of current captures. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential of this approach to achieve temporal changes using only sparse images, which can later be reconstructed into detailed 3D representations as needed. Experimental results show significant improvements over baseline methods in reconstruction quality and data efficiency, making this approach a promising solution for scene versioning, cross-temporal digital twins, and long-term spatial documentation.

TL;DR: SAIDO framework for AI-generated image detection uses scene-aware expert modules and importance-guided dynamic optimization to improve generalization and reduce forgetting in continual learning scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI-generated image detection methods struggle with generalization to new generative methods and content types in real-world scenarios, creating a need for more adaptable solutions.

Method: Proposes SAIDO framework with two key components: 1) Scene-Awareness-Based Expert Module (SAEM) that dynamically identifies new scenes using VLLMs and allocates independent expert modules for each scene, and 2) Importance-Guided Dynamic Optimization Mechanism (IDOM) that uses importance-guided gradient projection to optimize neurons, balancing plasticity and stability while mitigating catastrophic forgetting.

Result: Outperforms current SOTA in continual learning tasks with 44.22% relative reduction in average detection error rate and 40.57% reduction in forgetting rate. On open-world datasets, improves average detection accuracy by 9.47% compared to current SOTA.

Conclusion: SAIDO framework effectively addresses generalization challenges in AI-generated image detection through scene-aware dynamic expert allocation and importance-guided optimization, achieving superior performance in both continual learning and open-world scenarios.

Abstract: The widespread misuse of image generation technologies has raised security concerns, driving the development of AI-generated image detection methods. However, generalization has become a key challenge and open problem: existing approaches struggle to adapt to emerging generative methods and content types in real-world scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a Scene-Aware and Importance-Guided Dynamic Optimization detection framework with continual learning (SAIDO). Specifically, we design Scene-Awareness-Based Expert Module (SAEM) that dynamically identifies and incorporates new scenes using VLLMs. For each scene, independent expert modules are dynamically allocated, enabling the framework to capture scene-specific forgery features better and enhance cross-scene generalization. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting when learning from multiple image generative methods, we introduce Importance-Guided Dynamic Optimization Mechanism (IDOM), which optimizes each neuron through an importance-guided gradient projection strategy, thereby achieving an effective balance between model plasticity and stability. Extensive experiments on continual learning tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms the current SOTA method in both stability and plasticity, achieving 44.22\% and 40.57\% relative reductions in average detection error rate and forgetting rate, respectively. On open-world datasets, it improves the average detection accuracy by 9.47\% compared to the current SOTA method.

TL;DR: A hybrid approach combining 3D generative models, semantic-aware deformation, and Gaussian Splatting optimization for reconstructing multi-human, multi-object dynamic scenes from monocular video.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world environments are dynamic with complex human-object interactions, but 3D geometry modeling of such scenes remains challenging due to diverse motion patterns, frequent occlusions, and the limitations of existing methods in multi-human, multi-object scenarios.

Method: Hybrid approach combining: 1) 3D generative models for high-fidelity meshes, 2) Semantic-aware deformation (rigid transformation for objects, LBS-based deformation for humans), and 3) Gaussian Splatting optimization for refining alignments in the scene.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on HOI-M3 dataset (the only multi-human, multi-object interaction dataset), producing better surface reconstruction with structural consistency under severe occlusion and temporal consistency.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid approach effectively addresses the challenges of multi-human, multi-object dynamic scene reconstruction by maintaining object structures under occlusion and producing consistent geometry across views and time.

Abstract: Real-world human-built environments are highly dynamic, involving multiple humans and their complex interactions with surrounding objects. While 3D geometry modeling of such scenes is crucial for applications like AR/VR, gaming, and embodied AI, it remains underexplored due to challenges like diverse motion patterns and frequent occlusions. Beyond novel view rendering, 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) has demonstrated remarkable progress in producing detailed, high-quality surface geometry with fast optimization of the underlying structure. However, very few GS-based methods address multihuman, multiobject scenarios, primarily due to the above-mentioned inherent challenges. In a monocular setup, these challenges are further amplified, as maintaining structural consistency under severe occlusion becomes difficult when the scene is optimized solely based on GS-based rendering loss. To tackle the challenges of such a multihuman, multiobject dynamic scene, we propose a hybrid approach that effectively combines the advantages of 1) 3D generative models for generating high-fidelity meshes of the scene elements, 2) Semantic-aware deformation, \ie rigid transformation of the rigid objects and LBS-based deformation of the humans, and mapping of the deformed high-fidelity meshes in the dynamic scene, and 3) GS-based optimization of the individual elements for further refining their alignments in the scene. Such a hybrid approach helps maintain the object structures even under severe occlusion and can produce multiview and temporally consistent geometry. We choose HOI-M3 for evaluation, as, to the best of our knowledge, this is the only dataset featuring multihuman, multiobject interactions in a dynamic scene. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art method in producing better surface reconstruction of such scenes.

TL;DR: NeuroVolve is a generative framework that synthesizes images guided by neural activity patterns from brain regions, using optimization in vision-language model embedding space to create stimuli that satisfy complex neural constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior generative models only replicate category selectivity in isolated brain regions (like faces in FFA), offering limited insight into how different brain regions interact during complex natural vision. There's a need for a framework that can generate images under guidance of multiple brain regions simultaneously to understand distributed neural representations.

Method: NeuroVolve optimizes a neural objective function in the embedding space of a pretrained vision-language model. It generates images by activating/deactivating single or multiple brain regions together through programmable neural objectives, tracking optimization steps to reveal semantic trajectories through embedding space.

Result: The framework successfully recovers known selectivity for individual brain regions and synthesizes coherent scenes satisfying complex multi-region constraints. It generates both low-level and semantic feature-specific stimuli for single ROIs, as well as stimuli aligned to curated neural objectives including co-activation and decorrelation between regions, exposing cooperative and antagonistic tuning relationships.

Conclusion: NeuroVolve unifies brain-guided image editing and preferred stimulus generation in a single process, captures subject-specific preferences for personalized brain-driven synthesis, and offers interpretable constraints for mapping, analyzing, and probing neural representations of visual information.

Abstract: What visual information is encoded in individual brain regions, and how do distributed patterns combine to create their neural representations? Prior work has used generative models to replicate known category selectivity in isolated regions (e.g., faces in FFA), but these approaches offer limited insight into how regions interact during complex, naturalistic vision. We introduce NeuroVolve, a generative framework that provides brain-guided image synthesis via optimization of a neural objective function in the embedding space of a pretrained vision-language model. Images are generated under the guidance of a programmable neural objective, i.e., activating or deactivating single regions or multiple regions together. NeuroVolve is validated by recovering known selectivity for individual brain regions, while expanding to synthesize coherent scenes that satisfy complex, multi-region constraints. By tracking optimization steps, it reveals semantic trajectories through embedding space, unifying brain-guided image editing and preferred stimulus generation in a single process. We show that NeuroVolve can generate both low-level and semantic feature-specific stimuli for single ROIs, as well as stimuli aligned to curated neural objectives. These include co-activation and decorrelation between regions, exposing cooperative and antagonistic tuning relationships. Notably, the framework captures subject-specific preferences, supporting personalized brain-driven synthesis and offering interpretable constraints for mapping, analyzing, and probing neural representations of visual information.

TL;DR: DAAAM is a real-time 4D scene understanding framework that creates hierarchical 4D scene graphs with detailed semantic descriptions while maintaining real-time performance for large-scale environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods face a tradeoff between rich open-vocabulary descriptions and real-time performance when grounding descriptions in 3D. Applications like augmented reality and robot autonomy need both geometric structure for accurate language-grounding and semantic detail in spatio-temporal memory frameworks.

Method: Proposes DAAAM with optimization-based frontend to infer semantic descriptions from localized captioning models using batch processing for speed. Builds hierarchical 4D scene graphs as globally consistent memory representation. Interfaces with tool-calling agents for inference and reasoning.

Result: Achieves SOTA on NaVQA and SG3D benchmarks: improves OC-NaVQA question accuracy by 53.6%, position errors by 21.9%, temporal errors by 21.6%, and SG3D task grounding accuracy by 27.8% over baselines. Speeds up inference by order of magnitude for online processing.

Conclusion: DAAAM enables real-time 4D scene understanding with detailed semantic descriptions while maintaining performance, addressing the tradeoff between rich descriptions and real-time grounding. Framework shows strong generalization and releases code/data open-source.

Abstract: Computer vision and robotics applications ranging from augmented reality to robot autonomy in large-scale environments require spatio-temporal memory frameworks that capture both geometric structure for accurate language-grounding as well as semantic detail. Existing methods face a tradeoff, where producing rich open-vocabulary descriptions comes at the expense of real-time performance when these descriptions have to be grounded in 3D. To address these challenges, we propose Describe Anything, Anywhere, at Any Moment (DAAAM), a novel spatio-temporal memory framework for large-scale and real-time 4D scene understanding. DAAAM introduces a novel optimization-based frontend to infer detailed semantic descriptions from localized captioning models, such as the Describe Anything Model (DAM), leveraging batch processing to speed up inference by an order of magnitude for online processing. It leverages such semantic understanding to build a hierarchical 4D scene graph (SG), which acts as an effective globally spatially and temporally consistent memory representation. DAAAM constructs 4D SGs with detailed, geometrically grounded descriptions while maintaining real-time performance. We show that DAAAM's 4D SG interfaces well with a tool-calling agent for inference and reasoning.
  We thoroughly evaluate DAAAM in the complex task of spatio-temporal question answering on the NaVQA benchmark and show its generalization capabilities for sequential task grounding on the SG3D benchmark. We further curate an extended OC-NaVQA benchmark for large-scale and long-time evaluations. DAAAM achieves state-of-the-art results in both tasks, improving OC-NaVQA question accuracy by 53.6%, position errors by 21.9%, temporal errors by 21.6%, and SG3D task grounding accuracy by 27.8% over the most competitive baselines, respectively. We release our data and code open-source.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Yoga-16 dataset and benchmarks deep learning models for yoga pose classification, finding skeleton-based representations outperform raw images with VGG16+MediaPipe achieving 96.09% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Yoga is popular but incorrect postures can cause injuries. Automated yoga pose classification is needed to reduce reliance on expert practitioners. Existing research lacks systematic benchmarking, often focusing only on raw images or single pose extraction models.

Method: Created curated 'Yoga-16' dataset addressing limitations of existing datasets. Systematically evaluated three deep learning architectures (VGG16, ResNet50, Xception) with three input modalities: direct images, MediaPipe Pose skeleton images, and YOLOv8 Pose skeleton images. Used Grad-CAM for interpretability analysis and cross-validation.

Result: Skeleton-based representations outperformed raw image inputs. Highest accuracy of 96.09% achieved by VGG16 with MediaPipe Pose skeleton input. Provided interpretability insights through Grad-CAM analysis.

Conclusion: Skeleton-based approaches are superior for yoga pose classification. The Yoga-16 dataset and systematic benchmarking provide valuable resources for future research. The combination of VGG16 with MediaPipe Pose skeleton offers state-of-the-art performance for automated yoga pose recognition.

Abstract: Yoga is a popular form of exercise worldwide due to its spiritual and physical health benefits, but incorrect postures can lead to injuries. Automated yoga pose classification has therefore gained importance to reduce reliance on expert practitioners. While human pose keypoint extraction models have shown high potential in action recognition, systematic benchmarking for yoga pose recognition remains limited, as prior works often focus solely on raw images or a single pose extraction model. In this study, we introduce a curated dataset, 'Yoga-16', which addresses limitations of existing datasets, and systematically evaluate three deep learning architectures (VGG16, ResNet50, and Xception) using three input modalities (direct images, MediaPipe Pose skeleton images, and YOLOv8 Pose skeleton images). Our experiments demonstrate that skeleton-based representations outperform raw image inputs, with the highest accuracy of 96.09% achieved by VGG16 with MediaPipe Pose skeleton input. Additionally, we provide interpretability analysis using Grad-CAM, offering insights into model decision-making for yoga pose classification with cross validation analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SatireDecoder is a training-free framework that enhances visual satire comprehension in vision-language models through multi-agent visual cascaded decoupling and uncertainty-guided chain-of-thought reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual satire comprehension is challenging for current vision-language models as it requires detecting satire, deciphering nuanced meanings, and identifying implicated entities. Existing models fail to integrate local entity relationships with global context, leading to misinterpretation, comprehension biases, and hallucinations.

Method: Proposes SatireDecoder with two key components: 1) Multi-agent system performing visual cascaded decoupling to decompose images into fine-grained local and global semantic representations, and 2) Chain-of-thought reasoning strategy guided by uncertainty analysis that breaks down satire comprehension into sequential subtasks with minimized uncertainty.

Result: SatireDecoder significantly improves interpretive accuracy while reducing hallucinations. Experimental results show it outperforms existing baselines in comprehending visual satire.

Conclusion: SatireDecoder offers a promising direction for vision-language reasoning in nuanced, high-level semantic tasks, addressing the limitations of current models in visual satire comprehension through a training-free framework with improved entity-context integration and uncertainty-guided reasoning.

Abstract: Satire, a form of artistic expression combining humor with implicit critique, holds significant social value by illuminating societal issues. Despite its cultural and societal significance, satire comprehension, particularly in purely visual forms, remains a challenging task for current vision-language models. This task requires not only detecting satire but also deciphering its nuanced meaning and identifying the implicated entities. Existing models often fail to effectively integrate local entity relationships with global context, leading to misinterpretation, comprehension biases, and hallucinations. To address these limitations, we propose SatireDecoder, a training-free framework designed to enhance satirical image comprehension. Our approach proposes a multi-agent system performing visual cascaded decoupling to decompose images into fine-grained local and global semantic representations. In addition, we introduce a chain-of-thought reasoning strategy guided by uncertainty analysis, which breaks down the complex satire comprehension process into sequential subtasks with minimized uncertainty. Our method significantly improves interpretive accuracy while reducing hallucinations. Experimental results validate that SatireDecoder outperforms existing baselines in comprehending visual satire, offering a promising direction for vision-language reasoning in nuanced, high-level semantic tasks.

TL;DR: MedCT-VLM adapts CT-CLIP foundation model for medical CT imaging using LoRA, achieving significant zero-shot classification improvements on thoracic pathologies with minimal parameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models have strong zero-shot capabilities but limited application to volumetric medical imaging; need for parameter-efficient adaptation to leverage large-scale pretraining for downstream clinical tasks with scarce labeled data.

Method: Parameter-efficient vision-language framework using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to adapt CT-CLIP (trained on 25,692 chest CT volumes) for multi-label pathology classification; inserts low-rank decomposition matrices into attention layers of both vision and text encoders, training only 1.67M parameters (0.38% of total) instead of full 440M parameter fine-tuning.

Result: LoRA fine-tuning improves zero-shot classification across 18 thoracic pathologies: mean AUROC from 61.3% to 68.9% (+7.6 pp), accuracy from 67.2% to 73.6% (+6.4 pp), and macro-F1 from 32.1% to 36.9% (+4.8 pp).

Conclusion: Parameter-efficient methods like LoRA can effectively transfer large-scale pretraining to downstream medical imaging tasks, particularly valuable for zero-shot scenarios where labeled data is scarce.

Abstract: Foundation models trained via vision-language pretraining have demonstrated strong zero-shot capabilities across diverse image domains, yet their application to volumetric medical imaging remains limited. We introduce MedCT-VLM: Medical CT Vision-Language Model, a parameter-efficient vision-language framework designed to adapt large-scale CT foundation models for downstream clinical tasks. MedCT-VLM uses a parameter-efficient approach to adapt CT-CLIP, a contrastive vision-language model trained on 25,692 chest CT volumes, for multi-label pathology classification using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Rather than fine-tuning the model's 440 M parameters directly, we insert low-rank decomposition matrices into attention layers of both vision and text encoders, training only 1.67M parameters (0.38\% of total). We evaluate on zero-shot classification across 18 thoracic pathologies, where the model must align CT embeddings with unseen text prompts at inference without task-specific training. LoRA fine-tuning improves mean AUROC from 61.3\% to 68.9\% (+7.6 pp), accuracy from 67.2\% to 73.6\% (+6.4 pp), and macro-F1 from 32.1\% to 36.9\% (+4.8 pp). These results demonstrate that parameter-efficient methods can effectively transfer large-scale pretraining to downstream medical imaging tasks, particularly for zero-shot scenarios where labeled data is scarce.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning models (YOLOv9, U-Net, Swin Transformer, DeepLabV3, Mask R-CNN) were evaluated for automated pith detection in tree cross-sections, with Swin Transformer achieving highest accuracy (0.94) and Mask R-CNN showing significant improvement after NMS application.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pith detection in tree cross-sections is currently manual and error-prone, creating a need for automated solutions to improve forestry and wood quality analysis efficiency and accuracy.

Method: Evaluated multiple deep learning models on 582 labeled images with dynamic augmentation, tested generalizability on oak dataset (11 images), and conducted exploratory analysis by training worst-performing model on additional 64 images to improve generalization.

Result: Swin Transformer achieved highest accuracy (0.94) with excellent fine segmentation; YOLOv9 performed well for bounding boxes but struggled with boundaries; U-Net effective for structured patterns; DeepLabV3 captured multi-scale features; Mask R-CNN improved from 0.45 to 0.80 IoU after NMS application.

Conclusion: Deep learning shows strong potential for automated pith detection, with model selection depending on dataset characteristics and application requirements, though challenges like tensor mismatches and boundary inconsistencies require careful hyperparameter tuning and augmentation strategies.

Abstract: Pith detection in tree cross-sections is essential for forestry and wood quality analysis but remains a manual, error-prone task. This study evaluates deep learning models -- YOLOv9, U-Net, Swin Transformer, DeepLabV3, and Mask R-CNN -- to automate the process efficiently. A dataset of 582 labeled images was dynamically augmented to improve generalization. Swin Transformer achieved the highest accuracy (0.94), excelling in fine segmentation. YOLOv9 performed well for bounding box detection but struggled with boundary precision. U-Net was effective for structured patterns, while DeepLabV3 captured multi-scale features with slight boundary imprecision. Mask R-CNN initially underperformed due to overlapping detections, but applying Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) improved its IoU from 0.45 to 0.80. Generalizability was next tested using an oak dataset of 11 images from Oregon State University's Tree Ring Lab. Additionally, for exploratory analysis purposes, an additional dataset of 64 labeled tree cross-sections was used to train the worst-performing model to see if this would improve its performance generalizing to the unseen oak dataset. Key challenges included tensor mismatches and boundary inconsistencies, addressed through hyperparameter tuning and augmentation. Our results highlight deep learning's potential for tree cross-section pith detection, with model choice depending on dataset characteristics and application needs.

Method: 1) Used DCGANs for per-class data augmentation to resolve class imbalance; 2) Fine-tuned ResNet-50 classifier on augmented dataset for 7-class classification; 3) Integrated LIME and SHAP XAI techniques for model interpretability and feature visualization.

Result: Achieved 92.50% overall accuracy and 98.82% Macro-AUC, outperforming prior benchmarked architectures. XAI confirmed predictions were based on clinically relevant features like irregular morphology. Melanoma NOS category had F1-Score of 0.8602.

Conclusion: Successfully validated a verifiable framework combining high performance with clinical interpretability for safe diagnostic deployment. Future work should enhance discrimination for critical categories like Melanoma NOS.

Abstract: Accurate and timely diagnosis of multi-class skin lesions is hampered by subjective methods, inherent data imbalance in datasets like HAM10000, and the "black box" nature of Deep Learning (DL) models. This study proposes a trustworthy and highly accurate Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system to overcome these limitations. The approach utilizes Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs) for per class data augmentation to resolve the critical class imbalance problem. A fine-tuned ResNet-50 classifier is then trained on the augmented dataset to classify seven skin disease categories. Crucially, LIME and SHAP Explainable AI (XAI) techniques are integrated to provide transparency by confirming that predictions are based on clinically relevant features like irregular morphology. The system achieved a high overall Accuracy of 92.50 % and a Macro-AUC of 98.82 %, successfully outperforming various prior benchmarked architectures. This work successfully validates a verifiable framework that combines high performance with the essential clinical interpretability required for safe diagnostic deployment. Future research should prioritize enhancing discrimination for critical categories, such as Melanoma NOS (F1-Score is 0.8602).

TL;DR: GAT-ADA: Graph-Attention Network with Adversarial Domain Alignment for cross-domain facial expression recognition, achieving 74.39% mean accuracy across multiple domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-domain facial expression recognition is challenging due to severe domain shift between training and deployment data, requiring effective adaptation methods.

Method: Hybrid framework combining ResNet-50 backbone with batch-level Graph Attention Network (GAT) to model inter-sample relations. Uses sparse ring graphs for attention aggregation, adversarial learning via Gradient Reversal Layer (GRL), and statistical alignment with CORAL and MMD.

Result: Achieves 74.39% mean cross-domain accuracy across multiple targets (CK+, JAFFE, SFEW 2.0, FER2013, ExpW). On RAF-DB to FER2013, reaches 98.0% accuracy, representing ~36-point improvement over best baseline.

Conclusion: GAT-ADA effectively addresses domain shift in facial expression recognition by combining graph attention for sample relations with adversarial and statistical domain alignment, demonstrating significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Cross-domain facial expression recognition (CD-FER) remains difficult due to severe domain shift between training and deployment data. We propose Graph-Attention Network with Adversarial Domain Alignment (GAT-ADA), a hybrid framework that couples a ResNet-50 as backbone with a batch-level Graph Attention Network (GAT) to model inter-sample relations under shift. Each mini-batch is cast as a sparse ring graph so that attention aggregates cross-sample cues that are informative for adaptation. To align distributions, GAT-ADA combines adversarial learning via a Gradient Reversal Layer (GRL) with statistical alignment using CORAL and MMD. GAT-ADA is evaluated under a standard unsupervised domain adaptation protocol: training on one labeled source (RAF-DB) and adapting to multiple unlabeled targets (CK+, JAFFE, SFEW 2.0, FER2013, and ExpW). GAT-ADA attains 74.39% mean cross-domain accuracy. On RAF-DB to FER2013, it reaches 98.0% accuracy, corresponding to approximately a 36-point improvement over the best baseline we re-implemented with the same backbone and preprocessing.

*Shanhui Liu,Rui Xu,Yunke Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CF-ViM is an adaptive coarse-to-fine framework for Vision Mamba that reduces computation by processing simple images at coarse resolution and only refining complex regions when needed, outperforming baseline Vision Mamba and token reduction methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Mamba's efficiency is constrained by input token count, and existing token reduction methods (pruning/merging) cause information loss by uniformly applying fine-grained processing to all images regardless of complexity.

Method: CF-ViM first performs coarse-grained inference using large patches to reduce tokens. When prediction confidence is low, selected regions are re-processed at finer resolution to recover visual details with minimal additional cost, using dynamic resolution assignment based on image complexity.

Result: Experiments on ImageNet show CF-ViM outperforms both baseline Vision Mamba and state-of-the-art token reduction techniques in accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: The adaptive coarse-to-fine approach allows CF-ViM to allocate computation efficiently according to image complexity, preserving essential visual information while reducing computational cost.

Abstract: Vision Mamba has emerged as a promising and efficient alternative to Vision Transformers, yet its efficiency remains fundamentally constrained by the number of input tokens. Existing token reduction approaches typically adopt token pruning or merging to reduce computation. However, they inherently lead to information loss, as they discard or compress token representations. This problem is exacerbated when applied uniformly to fine-grained token representations across all images, regardless of visual complexity. We observe that not all inputs require fine-grained processing. Simple images can be effectively handled at coarse resolution, while only complex ones may warrant refinement. Based on this insight, we propose \textit{Coarse-to-Fine Vision Mamba (CF-ViM)}, an adaptive framework for efficient inference. CF-ViM first performs coarse-grained inference by dividing the input image into large patches, significantly reducing the token length and computation. When the model's prediction confidence is low, selected regions are re-processed at a finer resolution to recover critical visual details with minimal additional cost. This dynamic resolution assignment strategy allows CF-ViM to allocate computation adaptively according to image complexity, ensuring efficient processing without compromising essential visual information. Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that CF-ViM outperforms both the baseline Vision Mamba and state-of-the-art token reduction techniques in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

*Kiri L. Wagstaff*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Researchers create more realistic multi-digit writer benchmarks from NIST data to better evaluate real-world number recognition systems, showing isolated digit performance doesn't translate to multi-digit recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world number recognition involves multiple digits written by the same person (ZIP codes, checks, times), but current benchmarks focus on isolated digits. This creates a gap between research and practical applications.

Method: Leverage writer information from NIST digit images to create Multi-Digit Writer (MDW) benchmark datasets that simulate realistic scenarios where multiple digits come from the same writer.

Result: Classifiers that perform well on isolated digits often fail on multi-digit recognition. The MDW benchmarks reveal this performance gap and enable development of task-specific methods.

Conclusion: Real number recognition requires new benchmarks and methods beyond isolated digit classification. MDW datasets provide realistic evaluation with task-specific metrics that better reflect real-world impact.

Abstract: Isolated digit classification has served as a motivating problem for decades of machine learning research. In real settings, numbers often occur as multiple digits, all written by the same person. Examples include ZIP Codes, handwritten check amounts, and appointment times. In this work, we leverage knowledge about the writers of NIST digit images to create more realistic benchmark multi-digit writer (MDW) data sets. As expected, we find that classifiers may perform well on isolated digits yet do poorly on multi-digit number recognition. If we want to solve real number recognition problems, additional advances are needed. The MDW benchmarks come with task-specific performance metrics that go beyond typical error calculations to more closely align with real-world impact. They also create opportunities to develop methods that can leverage task-specific knowledge to improve performance well beyond that of individual digit classification methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-driven 4D scene editing remains challenging due to difficulties in maintaining multi-view and temporal consistency during editing. Existing 2D diffusion-based methods edit frames independently, causing motion distortion, geometric drift, and incomplete editing.

Method: Leverages Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) and 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) with two key components: Spatio-Temporal Sub-Grid Attention (STGA) for local consistency across views and time, and Context Token Propagation (CTP) for global propagation via token inheritance and optical-flow-guided token replacement.

Result: Extensive experiments on DyNeRF dataset show superior editing fidelity and both multi-view and temporal consistency compared to prior approaches.

Conclusion: Dynamic-eDiTor enables seamless, globally consistent text-driven 4D scene editing without additional training, directly optimizing pre-trained 4DGS representations.

Abstract: Recent progress in 4D representations, such as Dynamic NeRF and 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS), has enabled dynamic 4D scene reconstruction. However, text-driven 4D scene editing remains under-explored due to the challenge of ensuring both multi-view and temporal consistency across space and time during editing. Existing studies rely on 2D diffusion models that edit frames independently, often causing motion distortion, geometric drift, and incomplete editing. We introduce Dynamic-eDiTor, a training-free text-driven 4D editing framework leveraging Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) and 4DGS. This mechanism consists of Spatio-Temporal Sub-Grid Attention (STGA) for locally consistent cross-view and temporal fusion, and Context Token Propagation (CTP) for global propagation via token inheritance and optical-flow-guided token replacement. Together, these components allow Dynamic-eDiTor to perform seamless, globally consistent multi-view video without additional training and directly optimize pre-trained source 4DGS. Extensive experiments on multi-view video dataset DyNeRF demonstrate that our method achieves superior editing fidelity and both multi-view and temporal consistency prior approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FoundationGait is the first scalable, self-supervised gait foundation model with 0.13B parameters, pretrained on 2M+ walking sequences, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse gait tasks and datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current gait models are small, narrowly designed, and fail to scale or generalize. The paper aims to address two barriers: (1) scalability - why gait models haven't followed scaling laws, and (2) generalization - whether one model can serve diverse gait tasks traditionally studied in isolation.

Method: FoundationGait is a scalable, self-supervised pretraining framework for gait understanding. The largest version has 0.13B parameters and is pretrained on 12 public gait datasets comprising over 2 million walking sequences using self-supervised learning.

Result: The model performs robustly across diverse gait datasets, conditions, tasks (human identification, scoliosis screening, depression prediction, attribute estimation), and input modalities. Achieves 48.0% zero-shot rank-1 accuracy on Gait3D (1,000 test subjects) and 64.5% on OU-MVLP (5,000+ test subjects), setting new milestones in robust gait recognition.

Conclusion: FoundationGait successfully addresses scalability and generalization barriers in gait modeling, demonstrating that a unified foundation model can effectively serve diverse gait tasks and achieve state-of-the-art performance across various conditions and datasets.

Abstract: Gait patterns play a critical role in human identification and healthcare analytics, yet current progress remains constrained by small, narrowly designed models that fail to scale or generalize. Building a unified gait foundation model requires addressing two longstanding barriers: (a) Scalability. Why have gait models historically failed to follow scaling laws? (b) Generalization. Can one model serve the diverse gait tasks that have traditionally been studied in isolation? We introduce FoundationGait, the first scalable, self-supervised pretraining framework for gait understanding. Its largest version has nearly 0.13 billion parameters and is pretrained on 12 public gait datasets comprising over 2 million walking sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FoundationGait, with or without fine-tuning, performs robustly across a wide spectrum of gait datasets, conditions, tasks (e.g., human identification, scoliosis screening, depression prediction, and attribute estimation), and even input modality. Notably, it achieves 48.0% zero-shot rank-1 accuracy on the challenging in-the-wild Gait3D dataset (1,000 test subjects) and 64.5% on the largest in-the-lab OU-MVLP dataset (5,000+ test subjects), setting a new milestone in robust gait recognition.

*Mengzhu Xu,Hanzhi Liu,Ningkang Peng,Qianyu Chen,Canran Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AFD introduces an affordance-first decomposition approach for continual video-language learning that explicitly separates stable affordance tokens from query-specific adaptation, achieving SOTA with minimal forgetting across multiple protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current continual learning approaches for video-language understanding fail to properly distinguish what should remain stable versus what should adapt, rely on static routing/capacity, or require replaying past videos, which violates privacy constraints.

Method: AFD maps videos to slowly varying affordance tokens forming a shared time-aligned substrate, uses a lightweight query-routed conflict-aware scheduler for targeted adaptation, stabilizes substrate via weak alignment and teacher consistency, and employs question-only replay.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art across protocols: 51.6% avg accuracy with -1.8% forgetting on domain-incremental VideoQA, ViLCo R@1@0.5 of 29.6% (MQ) and 20.7% (NLQ) with 18.4% stAP@0.25 (VQ), and 39.5% accuracy with -1.6% forgetting on time-incremental iVQA.

Conclusion: AFD provides an explicit, interpretable split between stable interaction-centered substrate and targeted adaptation, offering a principled solution for continual video-language learning under realistic memory and privacy constraints.

Abstract: Continual learning for video--language understanding is increasingly important as models face non-stationary data, domains, and query styles, yet prevailing solutions blur what should stay stable versus what should adapt, rely on static routing/capacity, or require replaying past videos. We aim to explicitly specify where stability lives and where plasticity should be focused under realistic memory and privacy constraints. We introduce Affordance-First Decomposition (AFD): videos are mapped to slowly varying affordance tokens that form a shared, time-aligned substrate, while a lightweight, query-routed, conflict-aware scheduler concentrates adaptation and grows capacity only when needed. The substrate is stabilized via weak alignment and teacher consistency, and training uses question-only replay. AFD achieves state-of-the-art across protocols: 51.6% average accuracy with -1.8% forgetting on domain-incremental VideoQA, ViLCo R@1@0.5 of 29.6% (MQ) and 20.7% (NLQ) with 18.4% stAP@0.25 (VQ), and 39.5% accuracy with -1.6% forgetting on time-incremental iVQA. Overall, AFD offers an explicit, interpretable split between a stable interaction-centered substrate and targeted adaptation.

*Ka Chung Lai,Ahmet Cetinkaya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAR-net is a cascade refinement network for rotational motion blur deblurring in semi-blind scenarios with noisy angle information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenging problem of deblurring images affected by rotational motion blur, particularly in semi-blind scenarios where only noisy information about the blur angle is available. Existing methods may not handle such parameter uncertainty effectively.

Method: The proposed CAR-net uses a progressive refinement process: starting with initial deblurring via frequency-domain inversion, then applying a series of refinement stages that predict and apply residual corrections to progressively suppress artifacts and restore details. The architecture includes an optional angle detection module that can be trained end-to-end with refinement modules.

Result: The paper demonstrates efficiency through experiments on both synthetic and real-life images, showing that CAR-net effectively deblurs rotationally blurred images even with noisy angle information. Code, models, and dataset links are publicly available.

Conclusion: CAR-net provides an effective neural network architecture for rotational motion blur deblurring that handles parameter uncertainty through progressive refinement and optional angle detection, making it suitable for practical semi-blind scenarios.

Abstract: We propose a new neural network architecture called CAR-net (CAscade Refinement Network) to deblur images that are subject to rotational motion blur. Our architecture is specifically designed for the semi-blind scenarios where only noisy information of the rotational motion blur angle is available. The core of our approach is progressive refinement process that starts with an initial deblurred estimate obtained from frequency-domain inversion; A series of refinement stages take the current deblurred image to predict and apply residual correction to the current estimate, progressively suppressing artifacts and restoring fine details. To handle parameter uncertainty, our architecture accommodates an optional angle detection module which can be trained end-to-end with refinement modules. We provide a detailed description of our architecture and illustrate its efficiency through experiments using both synthetic and real-life images.

### [83] [Optimizing LVLMs with On-Policy Data for Effective Hallucination Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00706)
*Chengzhi Yu,Yifan Xu,Yifan Chen,Wenyi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel approach to mitigate hallucinations in large vision-language models by using on-policy data with binary hallucination annotations and an iterative DPO algorithm with dynamic sample reweighting, achieving significant hallucination reduction and enabling open-source models to surpass GPT-4V performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hallucination mitigation methods for LVLMs have critical limitations: they often use off-policy data which is less effective than on-policy data, and current annotation methods introduce additional hallucinations into training samples, potentially reinforcing the model's hallucination patterns.

Method: 1) Analysis showing on-policy data outperforms off-policy data for hallucination mitigation; 2) Training a hallucination classifier to provide clean binary annotations for on-policy data; 3) Designing an iterative DPO algorithm with dynamic sample reweighting to effectively leverage on-policy data.

Result: Significant hallucination reduction: 50.8% reduction on MMHalBench for LLaVA-1.5-7B, 79.5% average reduction on Object HalBench. More importantly, LLaVA-1.5-13B surpasses GPT-4V performance, demonstrating the method's ability to fully tap into open-source model potential.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses hallucination in LVLMs through principled on-policy data annotation and robust iterative optimization, enabling open-source models to achieve state-of-the-art performance and surpassing proprietary models like GPT-4V.

Abstract: Recently, large vision-language models (LVLMs) have risen to be a promising approach for multimodal tasks. However, principled hallucination mitigation remains a critical challenge.In this work, we first analyze the data generation process in LVLM hallucination mitigation and affirm that on-policy data significantly outperforms off-policy data, which thus calls for efficient and reliable preference annotation of on-policy data. We then point out that, existing annotation methods introduce additional hallucination in training samples, which may enhance the model's hallucination patterns, to address this problem, we propose training a hallucination classifier giving binary annotations, which guarantee clean chosen samples for the subsequent alignment. To further harness of the power of on-policy data, we design a robust iterative direct preference optimization (DPO) algorithm adopting a dynamic sample reweighting scheme. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three benchmarks with comparison to 8 state-of-the-art baselines. In particular, our approach reduces the hallucination rate of LLaVA-1.5-7B on MMHalBench by 50.8% and the average hallucination rate on Object HalBench by 79.5%; more significantly, our method fully taps into the potential of open-source models, enabling LLaVA-1.5-13B to even surpass the performance of GPT-4V.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RS-ISRefiner is a click-based interactive image segmentation framework specifically designed for remote sensing images, addressing challenges like scale variations, irregular boundaries, and complex backgrounds through adapter-based tuning and hybrid attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing interactive image segmentation methods designed for natural images struggle with remote sensing imagery due to scale variations, irregular boundaries, complex backgrounds, limited annotated data, and computational overhead.

Method: Proposes RS-ISRefiner with: 1) adapter-based tuning strategy preserving Vision Foundation Model representations while learning remote sensing-specific features, 2) hybrid attention mechanism combining convolutional local modeling with Transformer-based global reasoning, and 3) improved probability map modulation incorporating historical user interactions.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on six remote sensing datasets (iSAID, ISPRS Potsdam, SandBar, NWPU, LoveDA Urban, WHUBuilding) show RS-ISRefiner consistently outperforms state-of-the-art IIS methods in segmentation accuracy, efficiency, and interaction cost.

Conclusion: RS-ISRefiner effectively addresses remote sensing segmentation challenges, demonstrating strong generalizability and making it highly suitable for practical high-quality instance segmentation in remote sensing applications.

Abstract: Interactive image segmentation(IIS) plays a critical role in generating precise annotations for remote sensing imagery, where objects often exhibit scale variations, irregular boundaries and complex backgrounds. However, existing IIS methods, primarily designed for natural images, struggle to generalize to remote sensing domains due to limited annotated data and computational overhead. To address these challenges, we proposed RS-ISRefiner, a novel click-based IIS framework tailored for remote sensing images. The framework employs an adapter-based tuning strategy that preserves the general representations of Vision Foundation Models while enabling efficient learning of remote sensing-specific spatial and boundary characteristics. A hybrid attention mechanism integrating convolutional local modeling with Transformer-based global reasoning enhances robustness against scale diversity and scene complexity. Furthermore, an improved probability map modulation scheme effectively incorporates historical user interactions, yielding more stable iterative refinement and higher boundary fidelity. Comprehensive experiments on six remote sensing datasets, including iSAID, ISPRS Potsdam, SandBar, NWPU, LoveDA Urban and WHUBuilding, demonstrate that RS-ISRefiner consistently outperforms state-of-the-art IIS methods in terms of segmentation accuracy, efficiency and interaction cost. These results confirm the effectiveness and generalizability of our framework, making it highly suitable for high-quality instance segmentation in practical remote sensing scenarios.

TL;DR: TrajDiff is a perception annotation-free end-to-end autonomous driving framework that uses trajectory-oriented BEV diffusion to generate diverse driving trajectories without manual perception labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current end-to-end autonomous driving systems rely on expensive manual perception annotations. The authors aim to develop a perception annotation-free planning paradigm to reduce annotation costs while maintaining performance.

Method: Proposes TrajDiff: 1) Uses raw sensor inputs and future trajectories to construct Gaussian BEV heatmap targets capturing driving modalities, 2) Designs trajectory-oriented BEV encoder without perceptual supervision, 3) Introduces Trajectory-oriented BEV Diffusion Transformer (TB-DiT) that leverages ego-state and predicted TrajBEV features to generate diverse trajectories without handcrafted motion priors.

Result: Achieves 87.5 PDMS on NAVSIM benchmark (state-of-the-art among annotation-free methods). With data scaling, improves to 88.5 PDMS, comparable to advanced perception-based approaches.

Conclusion: TrajDiff successfully establishes a fully perception annotation-free generative method for end-to-end autonomous driving that achieves competitive performance while eliminating manual annotation costs, and demonstrates benefits of data scaling in annotation-free settings.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems directly generate driving policies from raw sensor inputs. While these systems can extract effective environmental features for planning, relying on auxiliary perception tasks, developing perception annotation-free planning paradigms has become increasingly critical due to the high cost of manual perception annotation. In this work, we propose TrajDiff, a Trajectory-oriented BEV Conditioned Diffusion framework that establishes a fully perception annotation-free generative method for end-to-end autonomous driving. TrajDiff requires only raw sensor inputs and future trajectory, constructing Gaussian BEV heatmap targets that inherently capture driving modalities. We design a simple yet effective trajectory-oriented BEV encoder to extract the TrajBEV feature without perceptual supervision. Furthermore, we introduce Trajectory-oriented BEV Diffusion Transformer (TB-DiT), which leverages ego-state information and the predicted TrajBEV features to directly generate diverse yet plausible trajectories, eliminating the need for handcrafted motion priors. Beyond architectural innovations, TrajDiff enables exploration of data scaling benefits in the annotation-free setting. Evaluated on the NAVSIM benchmark, TrajDiff achieves 87.5 PDMS, establishing state-of-the-art performance among all annotation-free methods. With data scaling, it further improves to 88.5 PDMS, which is comparable to advanced perception-based approaches. Our code and model will be made publicly available.

*Qiang Lyu,Zicong Chen,Chongxiao Wang,Haolin Shi,Shibo Gao,Ran Piao,Youwei Zeng,Jianlou Si,Fei Ding,Jing Li,Chun Pong Lau,Weiqiang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Multi-GRPO improves text-to-image alignment by addressing two limitations of existing GRPO methods: shared credit assignment and reward-mixing, using temporal and reward-based grouping for better advantage estimation and multi-objective optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GRPO-based methods for aligning text-to-image models suffer from two critical limitations: (1) shared credit assignment where trajectory-level advantages from group-normalized sparse terminal rewards are uniformly applied across timesteps, failing to accurately estimate early denoising steps' potential, and (2) reward-mixing where predefined weights for combining multi-objective rewards with mismatched scales and variances lead to unstable gradients and conflicting updates.

Method: Proposes Multi-GRPO with two orthogonal grouping mechanisms: (1) tree-based trajectories inspired by Monte Carlo Tree Search for temporal grouping - branching trajectories at early denoising steps enables accurate advantage estimation for early steps via descendant leaves while amortizing computation through shared prefixes, and (2) reward-based grouping to compute advantages for each reward function independently before aggregation, disentangling conflicting signals.

Result: Multi-GRPO achieves superior stability and alignment performance across single-reward PickScore-25k and multi-objective OCR-Color-10 benchmarks, effectively balancing conflicting objectives. The method also introduces OCR-Color-10, a visual text rendering dataset with explicit color constraints for multi-objective evaluation.

Conclusion: Multi-GRPO addresses key limitations in GRPO-based text-to-image alignment through innovative temporal and reward-based grouping mechanisms, demonstrating improved stability and performance in both single and multi-objective settings, with code made publicly available.

Abstract: Recently, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has shown promising potential for aligning text-to-image (T2I) models, yet existing GRPO-based methods suffer from two critical limitations. (1) \textit{Shared credit assignment}: trajectory-level advantages derived from group-normalized sparse terminal rewards are uniformly applied across timesteps, failing to accurately estimate the potential of early denoising steps with vast exploration spaces. (2) \textit{Reward-mixing}: predefined weights for combining multi-objective rewards (e.g., text accuracy, visual quality, text color)--which have mismatched scales and variances--lead to unstable gradients and conflicting updates. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{Multi-GRPO}, a multi-group advantage estimation framework with two orthogonal grouping mechanisms. For better credit assignment, we introduce tree-based trajectories inspired by Monte Carlo Tree Search: branching trajectories at selected early denoising steps naturally forms \emph{temporal groups}, enabling accurate advantage estimation for early steps via descendant leaves while amortizing computation through shared prefixes. For multi-objective optimization, we introduce \emph{reward-based grouping} to compute advantages for each reward function \textit{independently} before aggregation, disentangling conflicting signals. To facilitate evaluation of multiple objective alignment, we curate \textit{OCR-Color-10}, a visual text rendering dataset with explicit color constraints. Across the single-reward \textit{PickScore-25k} and multi-objective \textit{OCR-Color-10} benchmarks, Multi-GRPO achieves superior stability and alignment performance, effectively balancing conflicting objectives.

*Zhengxin Chen,Xiaohai He,Tingrong Zhang,Shuhua Xiong,Chao Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes MGTPCN, a learned image compression method combining novel prior-guided convolution (PGConv) for local features and multi-scale gated transformer (MGT) for non-local features, achieving state-of-the-art performance with better complexity trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learned image compression methods have shown remarkable performance, sometimes outperforming traditional codecs like VVC, largely due to powerful nonlinear transform coding. The representation capabilities of convolutional layers and Swin-T blocks are crucial for this, but vanilla convolution and Swin-T blocks have limitations in extracting local and non-local features respectively.

Method: 1) PGConv: Prior-guided convolution using asymmetric convolutions (AConvs) to strengthen skeleton elements and difference convolutions (DConvs) to extract high-frequency information, with re-parameterization to reduce complexity. 2) MGT: Multi-scale gated transformer using dilated window-based multi-head self-attention with different dilation rates and depth-wise convolutions with different kernel sizes to extract multi-scale features, plus gate mechanism for enhanced non-linearity. 3) MGTPCN: Joint network combining both components for learned image compression.

Result: Experimental results show MGTPCN surpasses state-of-the-art algorithms with better trade-off between performance and complexity.

Conclusion: The proposed MGTPCN framework effectively improves learned image compression by enhancing both local feature extraction (via PGConv) and non-local feature extraction (via MGT), achieving superior performance with favorable complexity trade-offs compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Recently, learned image compression methods have made remarkable achievements, some of which have outperformed the traditional image codec VVC. The advantages of learned image compression methods over traditional image codecs can be largely attributed to their powerful nonlinear transform coding. Convolutional layers and shifted window transformer (Swin-T) blocks are the basic units of neural networks, and their representation capabilities play an important role in nonlinear transform coding. In this paper, to improve the ability of the vanilla convolution to extract local features, we propose a novel prior-guided convolution (PGConv), where asymmetric convolutions (AConvs) and difference convolutions (DConvs) are introduced to strengthen skeleton elements and extract high-frequency information, respectively. A re-parameterization strategy is also used to reduce the computational complexity of PGConv. Moreover, to improve the ability of the Swin-T block to extract non-local features, we propose a novel multi-scale gated transformer (MGT), where dilated window-based multi-head self-attention blocks with different dilation rates and depth-wise convolution layers with different kernel sizes are used to extract multi-scale features, and a gate mechanism is introduced to enhance non-linearity. Finally, we propose a novel joint Multi-scale Gated Transformer and Prior-guided Convolutional Network (MGTPCN) for learned image compression. Experimental results show that our MGTPCN surpasses state-of-the-art algorithms with a better trade-off between performance and complexity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProSeg is a probabilistic model for multi-rater medical image segmentation that simultaneously achieves both diverse and personalized segmentation outputs by modeling expert preferences and image ambiguity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image segmentation faces data uncertainty from ambiguous boundaries and inter-observer variability. Existing models either produce diverse segmentations lacking expert specificity or personalized outputs that merely replicate individual annotators, but not both simultaneously.

Method: ProSeg introduces two latent variables to model expert annotation preferences and image boundary ambiguity. Conditional probabilistic distributions are obtained through variational inference, allowing segmentation outputs to be generated by sampling from these distributions.

Result: Extensive experiments on nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and lung nodule (LIDC-IDRI) datasets demonstrate that ProSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance, providing segmentation results that are both diverse and expert-personalized.

Conclusion: ProSeg successfully addresses the limitations of previous multi-rater segmentation models by enabling simultaneous diversification and personalization through probabilistic modeling of expert preferences and image ambiguity.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is inherently influenced by data uncertainty, arising from ambiguous boundaries in medical scans and inter-observer variability in diagnosis. To address this challenge, previous works formulated the multi-rater medical image segmentation task, where multiple experts provide separate annotations for each image. However, existing models are typically constrained to either generate diverse segmentation that lacks expert specificity or to produce personalized outputs that merely replicate individual annotators. We propose Probabilistic modeling of multi-rater medical image Segmentation (ProSeg) that simultaneously enables both diversification and personalization. Specifically, we introduce two latent variables to model expert annotation preferences and image boundary ambiguity. Their conditional probabilistic distributions are then obtained through variational inference, allowing segmentation outputs to be generated by sampling from these distributions. Extensive experiments on both the nasopharyngeal carcinoma dataset (NPC) and the lung nodule dataset (LIDC-IDRI) demonstrate that our ProSeg achieves a new state-of-the-art performance, providing segmentation results that are both diverse and expert-personalized.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FigEdit is a large-scale benchmark for scientific figure editing that addresses the fundamental mismatch between pixel-level generative models and the structured nature of charts, revealing current models' limitations in handling structured transformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative models treat chart editing as pixel manipulation, but charts are visual representations of structured data governed by graphical grammar. There's a need for structure-aware approaches to scientific figure editing.

Method: Created FigEdit benchmark with 30,000+ samples covering 10 chart types and complex editing instructions. Organized into five progressively challenging tasks: single edits, multi edits, conversational edits, visual-guidance-based edits, and style transfer.

Result: State-of-the-art models perform poorly on scientific figures, consistently failing at structured transformations. Traditional metrics (SSIM, PSNR) are inadequate for evaluating semantic correctness of chart edits.

Conclusion: FigEdit demonstrates limitations of pixel-level manipulation and provides foundation for developing structure-aware models. The benchmark enables systematic progress, fair comparison, and encourages research on models understanding both visual and semantic layers of charts.

Abstract: Generative models, such as diffusion and autoregressive approaches, have demonstrated impressive capabilities in editing natural images. However, applying these tools to scientific charts rests on a flawed assumption: a chart is not merely an arrangement of pixels but a visual representation of structured data governed by a graphical grammar. Consequently, chart editing is not a pixel-manipulation task but a structured transformation problem. To address this fundamental mismatch, we introduce \textit{FigEdit}, a large-scale benchmark for scientific figure editing comprising over 30,000 samples. Grounded in real-world data, our benchmark is distinguished by its diversity, covering 10 distinct chart types and a rich vocabulary of complex editing instructions. The benchmark is organized into five distinct and progressively challenging tasks: single edits, multi edits, conversational edits, visual-guidance-based edits, and style transfer. Our evaluation of a range of state-of-the-art models on this benchmark reveals their poor performance on scientific figures, as they consistently fail to handle the underlying structured transformations required for valid edits. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that traditional evaluation metrics (e.g., SSIM, PSNR) have limitations in capturing the semantic correctness of chart edits. Our benchmark demonstrates the profound limitations of pixel-level manipulation and provides a robust foundation for developing and evaluating future structure-aware models. By releasing \textit{FigEdit} (https://github.com/adobe-research/figure-editing), we aim to enable systematic progress in structure-aware figure editing, provide a common ground for fair comparison, and encourage future research on models that understand both the visual and semantic layers of scientific charts.

Conclusion: The approach sheds light on understanding and modeling the physical processes behind pixels, bridging the gap between vision and physics, with potential applications in video generation and editing.

Abstract: A longstanding goal in computer vision is to model motions from videos, while the representations behind motions, i.e. the invisible physical interactions that cause objects to deform and move, remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we study how to recover the invisible forces from visual observations, e.g., estimating the wind field by observing a leaf falling to the ground. Our key innovation is an end-to-end differentiable inverse graphics framework, which jointly models object geometry, physical properties, and interactions directly from videos. Through backpropagation, our approach enables the recovery of force representations from object motions. We validate our method on both synthetic and real-world scenarios, and the results demonstrate its ability to infer plausible force fields from videos.

### [92] [The Outline of Deception: Physical Adversarial Attacks on Traffic Signs Using Edge Patches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00765)
*Haojie Jia,Te Hu,Haowen Li,Long Jin,Chongshi Xin,Yuchi Yao,Jiarui Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TESP-Attack is a stealth-aware adversarial patch method for traffic signs that uses edge-aligned masks and U-Net generation with color/texture constraints to create visually concealed attacks that maintain high effectiveness across various classification models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current physical adversarial attacks on traffic signs lack stealth - they apply perturbations to central regions creating visually salient patterns easily detectable by humans, limiting real-world practicality. Intelligent driving systems are vulnerable to such attacks which can cause misclassification leading to safety risks and cascading failures in V2X networks.

Method: Uses instance segmentation to generate edge-aligned masks conforming to traffic sign shapes. A U-Net generator crafts adversarial patches optimized through color and texture constraints plus frequency domain analysis for seamless background integration and visual concealment.

Result: Achieves over 90% attack success rate across various traffic sign classification models under limited query budgets. Shows strong cross-model transferability and maintains robust real-world performance stable under varying angles and distances.

Conclusion: TESP-Attack successfully addresses the stealth limitation of current physical attacks by creating visually concealed adversarial patches that remain highly effective, demonstrating practical applicability for real-world adversarial scenarios in intelligent driving systems.

Abstract: Intelligent driving systems are vulnerable to physical adversarial attacks on traffic signs. These attacks can cause misclassification, leading to erroneous driving decisions that compromise road safety. Moreover, within V2X networks, such misinterpretations can propagate, inducing cascading failures that disrupt overall traffic flow and system stability. However, a key limitation of current physical attacks is their lack of stealth. Most methods apply perturbations to central regions of the sign, resulting in visually salient patterns that are easily detectable by human observers, thereby limiting their real-world practicality. This study proposes TESP-Attack, a novel stealth-aware adversarial patch method for traffic sign classification. Based on the observation that human visual attention primarily focuses on the central regions of traffic signs, we employ instance segmentation to generate edge-aligned masks that conform to the shape characteristics of the signs. A U-Net generator is utilized to craft adversarial patches, which are then optimized through color and texture constraints along with frequency domain analysis to achieve seamless integration with the background environment, resulting in highly effective visual concealment. The proposed method demonstrates outstanding attack success rates across traffic sign classification models with varied architectures, achieving over 90% under limited query budgets. It also exhibits strong cross-model transferability and maintains robust real-world performance that remains stable under varying angles and distances.

TL;DR: EAG3R enhances 3D geometry estimation by combining RGB images with event streams, improving robustness in dynamic low-light scenes without needing nighttime training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB-only methods struggle with dynamic objects and extreme illumination in real-world conditions due to conventional camera limitations. Event cameras offer complementary information but aren't well-integrated into existing geometry estimation frameworks.

Method: Built on MonST3R backbone, EAG3R introduces: 1) Retinex-inspired image enhancement + lightweight event adapter with SNR-aware fusion to combine RGB/event features based on local reliability; 2) Event-based photometric consistency loss for spatiotemporal coherence during global optimization.

Result: EAG3R significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RGB-only baselines across monocular depth estimation, camera pose tracking, and dynamic reconstruction tasks in challenging dynamic low-light scenes.

Conclusion: Augmenting pointmap-based reconstruction with asynchronous event streams enables robust geometry estimation in challenging conditions without requiring retraining on night-time data, demonstrating the value of multimodal sensor fusion.

Abstract: Robust 3D geometry estimation from videos is critical for applications such as autonomous navigation, SLAM, and 3D scene reconstruction. Recent methods like DUSt3R demonstrate that regressing dense pointmaps from image pairs enables accurate and efficient pose-free reconstruction. However, existing RGB-only approaches struggle under real-world conditions involving dynamic objects and extreme illumination, due to the inherent limitations of conventional cameras. In this paper, we propose EAG3R, a novel geometry estimation framework that augments pointmap-based reconstruction with asynchronous event streams. Built upon the MonST3R backbone, EAG3R introduces two key innovations: (1) a retinex-inspired image enhancement module and a lightweight event adapter with SNR-aware fusion mechanism that adaptively combines RGB and event features based on local reliability; and (2) a novel event-based photometric consistency loss that reinforces spatiotemporal coherence during global optimization. Our method enables robust geometry estimation in challenging dynamic low-light scenes without requiring retraining on night-time data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EAG3R significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RGB-only baselines across monocular depth estimation, camera pose tracking, and dynamic reconstruction tasks.

Abstract: This work addresses the scarcity of high-quality, large-scale resources for Japanese Vision-and-Language (V&L) modeling. We present a scalable and reproducible pipeline that integrates large-scale web collection with rigorous filtering/deduplication, object-detection-driven evidence extraction, and Large Language Model (LLM)-based refinement under grounding constraints. Using this pipeline, we build two resources: an image-caption dataset (DEJIMA-Cap) and a VQA dataset (DEJIMA-VQA), each containing 3.88M image-text pairs, far exceeding the size of existing Japanese V&L datasets. Human evaluations demonstrate that DEJIMA achieves substantially higher Japaneseness and linguistic naturalness than datasets constructed via translation or manual annotation, while maintaining factual correctness at a level comparable to human-annotated corpora. Quantitative analyses of image feature distributions further confirm that DEJIMA broadly covers diverse visual domains characteristic of Japan, complementing its linguistic and cultural representativeness. Models trained on DEJIMA exhibit consistent improvements across multiple Japanese multimodal benchmarks, confirming that culturally grounded, large-scale resources play a key role in enhancing model performance.

*Bo Guo,Sijia Wen,Yifan Zhao,Jia Li,Zhiming Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PolarGS enhances 3D Gaussian Splatting by using polarization cues to resolve photometric ambiguities in reflective and textureless surfaces, achieving superior geometric accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing surface reconstruction methods for 3DGS degrade in photometrically ambiguous regions like reflective and textureless surfaces where unreliable photometric cues disrupt geometry estimation. Polarization provides complementary optical information that can resolve these ambiguities.

Method: Two complementary modules: 1) Polarization-guided photometric correction that identifies reflective regions via Degree of Linear Polarization (DoLP) and refines reflective Gaussians with Color Refinement Maps; 2) Polarization-enhanced Gaussian densification for textureless areas that integrates Angle and Degree of Linear Polarization into a PatchMatch-based depth completion process to back-project and fuse new Gaussians.

Result: PolarGS achieves superior geometric accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods and is framework-agnostic.

Conclusion: Leveraging polarization as an optical prior effectively resolves photometric ambiguities in 3DGS reconstruction, particularly for challenging reflective and textureless surfaces, leading to more complete and accurate geometry recovery.

Abstract: Recent advances in surface reconstruction for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled remarkable geometric accuracy. However, their performance degrades in photometrically ambiguous regions such as reflective and textureless surfaces, where unreliable cues disrupt photometric consistency and hinder accurate geometry estimation. Reflected light is often partially polarized in a manner that reveals surface orientation, making polarization an optic complement to photometric cues in resolving such ambiguities. Therefore, we propose PolarGS, an optics-aware extension of RGB-based 3DGS that leverages polarization as an optical prior to resolve photometric ambiguities and enhance reconstruction accuracy. Specifically, we introduce two complementary modules: a polarization-guided photometric correction strategy, which ensures photometric consistency by identifying reflective regions via the Degree of Linear Polarization (DoLP) and refining reflective Gaussians with Color Refinement Maps; and a polarization-enhanced Gaussian densification mechanism for textureless area geometry recovery, which integrates both Angle and Degree of Linear Polarization (A/DoLP) into a PatchMatch-based depth completion process. This enables the back-projection and fusion of new Gaussians, leading to more complete reconstruction. PolarGS is framework-agnostic and achieves superior geometric accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CircleFlow: A flow-guided edge localization framework for high-fidelity PSF estimation using circle grid targets and implicit neural representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate PSF estimation is crucial for optical characterization and computational vision, but remains challenging due to inherent ambiguity and ill-posed nature of intensity-based deconvolution.

Method: Uses structured capture with circle grid target to encode locally anisotropic and spatially varying PSFs. Leverages binary luminance prior to decouple image and kernel estimation. Reconstructs sharp image through subpixel alignment guided by optical flow, models PSF as energy-constrained implicit neural representation, and jointly optimizes both in demosaicing-aware differentiable framework.

Result: Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world data demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy and reliability in PSF estimation.

Conclusion: CircleFlow provides physically consistent and robust PSF estimation enabled by accurate edge localization, validating its effectiveness for practical PSF calibration.

Abstract: The point spread function (PSF) serves as a fundamental descriptor linking the real-world scene to the captured signal, manifesting as camera blur. Accurate PSF estimation is crucial for both optical characterization and computational vision, yet remains challenging due to the inherent ambiguity and the ill-posed nature of intensity-based deconvolution. We introduce CircleFlow, a high-fidelity PSF estimation framework that employs flow-guided edge localization for precise blur characterization. CircleFlow begins with a structured capture that encodes locally anisotropic and spatially varying PSFs by imaging a circle grid target, while leveraging the target's binary luminance prior to decouple image and kernel estimation. The latent sharp image is then reconstructed through subpixel alignment of an initialized binary structure guided by optical flow, whereas the PSF is modeled as an energy-constrained implicit neural representation. Both components are jointly optimized within a demosaicing-aware differentiable framework, ensuring physically consistent and robust PSF estimation enabled by accurate edge localization. Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world data demonstrate that CircleFlow achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and reliability, validating its effectiveness for practical PSF calibration.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpecTemp is a reinforcement learning-based framework that accelerates video understanding by using a dual-model design: a lightweight draft model proposes salient frames, while a powerful target model verifies and refines temporal reasoning, balancing efficiency with accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current thinking-with-frames approaches for video MLLMs suffer from efficiency bottlenecks due to redundant multi-modal context that grows progressively. There's a need to balance temporal reasoning capabilities with computational efficiency for long video understanding.

Method: SpecTemp uses a reinforcement learning-based speculative temporal reasoning framework with a cooperative dual-model design. A lightweight draft MLLM rapidly explores and proposes salient frames from densely sampled temporal regions, while a powerful target MLLM focuses on temporal reasoning and verifies the draft's proposals, iteratively refining attention until convergence. The framework is trained on the SpecTemp-80K dataset with synchronized dual-level annotations.

Result: Experiments across multiple video understanding benchmarks show that SpecTemp maintains competitive accuracy while significantly accelerating inference compared to existing thinking-with-frames methods.

Conclusion: SpecTemp effectively addresses the efficiency bottleneck in video understanding by decoupling temporal perception from reasoning, mirroring human brain pathways to balance efficiency with accuracy in long video understanding tasks.

Abstract: Long video understanding is essential for human-like intelligence, enabling coherent perception and reasoning over extended temporal contexts. While the emerging thinking-with-frames paradigm, which alternates between global temporal reasoning and local frame examination, has advanced the reasoning capabilities of video multi-modal large language models (MLLMs), it suffers from a significant efficiency bottleneck due to the progressively growing and redundant multi-modal context. To address this, we propose SpecTemp, a reinforcement learning-based Speculative Temporal reasoning framework that decouples temporal perception from reasoning via a cooperative dual-model design. In SpecTemp, a lightweight draft MLLM rapidly explores and proposes salient frames from densely sampled temporal regions, while a powerful target MLLM focuses on temporal reasoning and verifies the draft's proposals, iteratively refining its attention until convergence. This design mirrors the collaborative pathways of the human brain, balancing efficiency with accuracy. To support training, we construct the SpecTemp-80K dataset, featuring synchronized dual-level annotations for coarse evidence spans and fine-grained frame-level evidence. Experiments across multiple video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that SpecTemp not only maintains competitive accuracy but also significantly accelerates inference compared with existing thinking-with-frames methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image restoration methods rely on pixel-level hard-fitting to ground-truth images, which leads to over-smoothing and poor generalization. Post-training paradigms have shown success in high-level generation tasks but remain unexplored for low-level vision tasks.

Method: IRPO uses a GRPO-based post-training paradigm with two key innovations: 1) Data formulation principle selecting underperforming samples from pre-training stage for optimal performance and efficiency, and 2) A reward-level criteria system with three components: General Reward for structural fidelity, Expert Reward using Qwen-VL for perceptual alignment, and Restoration Reward for task-specific low-level quality.

Result: IRPO achieves state-of-the-art results on six in-domain and five out-of-domain low-level benchmarks, surpassing AdaIR baseline by 0.83 dB on in-domain tasks and 3.43 dB on OOD settings across diverse degradation types.

Conclusion: IRPO demonstrates the effectiveness of post-training paradigms for low-level vision tasks, offering improved performance and generalization through systematic exploration of data formulation and reward modeling.

Abstract: Recent advances in post-training paradigms have achieved remarkable success in high-level generation tasks, yet their potential for low-level vision remains rarely explored. Existing image restoration (IR) methods rely on pixel-level hard-fitting to ground-truth images, struggling with over-smoothing and poor generalization. To address these limitations, we propose IRPO, a low-level GRPO-based post-training paradigm that systematically explores both data formulation and reward modeling. We first explore a data formulation principle for low-level post-training paradigm, in which selecting underperforming samples from the pre-training stage yields optimal performance and improved efficiency. Furthermore, we model a reward-level criteria system that balances objective accuracy and human perceptual preference through three complementary components: a General Reward for structural fidelity, an Expert Reward leveraging Qwen-VL for perceptual alignment, and a Restoration Reward for task-specific low-level quality. Comprehensive experiments on six in-domain and five out-of-domain (OOD) low-level benchmarks demonstrate that IRPO achieves state-of-the-art results across diverse degradation types, surpassing the AdaIR baseline by 0.83 dB on in-domain tasks and 3.43 dB on OOD settings.

Conclusion: PanFlow provides a robust solution for panoramic video generation with precise motion control, addressing previous limitations and enabling various practical applications in immersive media.

Abstract: Panoramic video generation has attracted growing attention due to its applications in virtual reality and immersive media. However, existing methods lack explicit motion control and struggle to generate scenes with large and complex motions. We propose PanFlow, a novel approach that exploits the spherical nature of panoramas to decouple the highly dynamic camera rotation from the input optical flow condition, enabling more precise control over large and dynamic motions. We further introduce a spherical noise warping strategy to promote loop consistency in motion across panorama boundaries. To support effective training, we curate a large-scale, motion-rich panoramic video dataset with frame-level pose and flow annotations. We also showcase the effectiveness of our method in various applications, including motion transfer and video editing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PanFlow significantly outperforms prior methods in motion fidelity, visual quality, and temporal coherence.

Motivation: Current VLM-based GUI automation models struggle with accurate widget identification and action determination due to limited spatial information in vision encoder features, and top-performing models are large, requiring extensive training and causing inference delays.

Method: Introduces AFRAgent, an instruct-BLIP-based multimodal architecture with adaptive feature renormalization - a token-level affine transformation technique that enriches low-resolution image embeddings and fuses high-resolution details to enhance image embeddings in the LLM pipeline.

Result: AFRAgent achieves superior performance on Meta-GUI and AITW benchmarks for smartphone automation while being less than one-fourth the size of its nearest competitor, establishing a new state-of-the-art baseline.

Conclusion: AFRAgent demonstrates that efficient, compact models can achieve state-of-the-art performance in GUI automation through innovative feature enhancement techniques, addressing both accuracy and efficiency challenges in mobile UI automation.

Abstract: There is a growing demand for mobile user interface (UI) automation, driven by its broad applications across industries. With the advent of visual language models (VLMs), GUI automation has progressed from generating text-based instructions for humans to autonomously executing tasks, thus optimizing automation workflows. Recent approaches leverage VLMs for this problem due to their ability to 1) process on-screen content directly, 2) remain independent of device-specific APIs by utilizing human actions (e.g., clicks, typing), and 3) apply real-world contextual knowledge for task understanding. However, these models often have trouble accurately identifying widgets and determining actions due to limited spatial information in vision encoder features. Additionally, top-performing models are often large, requiring extensive training and resulting in inference delays. In this work, we introduce AFRAgent, an instruct-BLIP-based multimodal architecture that achieves superior performance in GUI automation while being less than one-fourth the size of its nearest competitor. To enhance image embeddings in the large language model (LLM) pipeline, we propose an adaptive feature renormalization-based (a token-level affine transformation) technique that effectively enriches low-resolution image embeddings and fuses high-resolution details. We evaluate AFRAgent on Meta-GUI and AITW benchmarks, establishing a new state-of-the-art baseline for smartphone automation.

Motivation: Existing medical foundation models require extensive fine-tuning or have task-biased pretraining objectives, creating need for strong task-agnostic models that work with minimal adaptation.

Method: Adapts Vision Transformers and DINOv2 for volumetric CT data with modifications to patch embeddings, positional encodings, and volumetric augmentations for depth-awareness. Uses self-supervised pretraining on 105K CT volumes.

Result: Large-scale 3D pretraining yields stable, robust frozen representations that generalize strongly across downstream tasks with minimal fine-tuning.

Conclusion: TAP-CT provides a powerful, low-resource baseline for medical imaging research, with all models and code released for transparency and reproducibility.

Abstract: Existing foundation models (FMs) in the medical domain often require extensive fine-tuning or rely on training resource-intensive decoders, while many existing encoders are pretrained with objectives biased toward specific tasks. This illustrates a need for a strong, task-agnostic foundation model that requires minimal fine-tuning beyond feature extraction. In this work, we introduce a suite of task-agnostic pretraining of CT foundation models (TAP-CT): a simple yet effective adaptation of Vision Transformers (ViTs) and DINOv2 for volumetric data, enabling scalable self-supervised pretraining directly on 3D CT volumes. Our approach incorporates targeted modifications to patch embeddings, positional encodings, and volumetric augmentations, making the architecture depth-aware while preserving the simplicity of the underlying architectures. We show that large-scale 3D pretraining on an extensive in-house CT dataset (105K volumes) yields stable, robust frozen representations that generalize strongly across downstream tasks. To promote transparency and reproducibility, and to establish a powerful, low-resource baseline for future research in medical imaging, we will release all pretrained models, experimental configurations, and downstream benchmark code at https://huggingface.co/fomofo/tap-ct-b-3d.

TL;DR: DeepPriorCBCT is a three-stage deep learning framework that achieves diagnostic-grade CBCT reconstruction using only 1/6 of conventional radiation dose, validated through large multicenter retrospective data and a prospective clinical trial.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CBCT-guided puncture for thoracic tumors exposes patients to significant radiation, increasing secondary malignancy risk. Existing low-dose CBCT methods lack validation with large-scale multicenter data and prospective clinical evaluation.

Method: Three-stage deep learning framework called DeepPriorCBCT that reconstructs diagnostic-quality images from sparse sampling (1/6 of conventional dose). Developed and validated using 4102 patients with 8675 CBCT scans from 12 centers, plus a prospective cross-over trial (NCT07035977) with 138 patients.

Result: Reconstructed images were indistinguishable from original scans according to 11 physicians. Diagnostic performance and image quality comparable to standard reconstruction. In prospective trial, 5 radiologists found no significant differences in image quality or lesion assessment. 25 interventionalists expressed no preference between model-based and full-sampling images. Radiation exposure reduced to approximately 1/6 of conventional approach.

Conclusion: DeepPriorCBCT enables high-quality CBCT reconstruction under sparse sampling conditions while markedly decreasing intraoperative radiation risk, validated through both retrospective multicenter data and prospective clinical trials.

Abstract: Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT)-guided puncture has become an established approach for diagnosing and treating early- to mid-stage thoracic tumours, yet the associated radiation exposure substantially elevates the risk of secondary malignancies. Although multiple low-dose CBCT strategies have been introduced, none have undergone validation using large-scale multicenter retrospective datasets, and prospective clinical evaluation remains lacking. Here, we propose DeepPriorCBCT - a three-stage deep learning framework that achieves diagnostic-grade reconstruction using only one-sixth of the conventional radiation dose. 4102 patients with 8675 CBCT scans from 12 centers were included to develop and validate DeepPriorCBCT. Additionally, a prospective cross-over trial (Registry number: NCT07035977) which recruited 138 patients scheduled for percutaneous thoracic puncture was conducted to assess the model's clinical applicability. Assessment by 11 physicians confirmed that reconstructed images were indistinguishable from original scans. Moreover, diagnostic performance and overall image quality were comparable to those generated by standard reconstruction algorithms. In the prospective trial, five radiologists reported no significant differences in image quality or lesion assessment between DeepPriorCBCT and the clinical standard (all P>0.05). Likewise, 25 interventionalists expressed no preference between model-based and full-sampling images for surgical guidance (Kappa<0.2). Radiation exposure with DeepPriorCBCT was reduced to approximately one-sixth of that with the conventional approach, and collectively, the findings confirm that it enables high-quality CBCT reconstruction under sparse sampling conditions while markedly decreasing intraoperative radiation risk.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has revolutionary 3D representation capabilities but suffers from substantial data size that limits widespread adoption. Existing feed-forward compression methods fail to model long-range spatial dependencies due to limited receptive fields and inadequate context capacity in entropy models.

Method: 1) Creates large-scale context structure using thousands of Gaussians based on Morton serialization; 2) Designs fine-grained space-channel auto-regressive entropy model to leverage expansive context; 3) Develops attention-based transform coding model to extract informative latent priors by aggregating features from wide-range neighboring Gaussians.

Result: Achieves 20× compression ratio for 3DGS in feed-forward inference and establishes state-of-the-art performance among generalizable codecs.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively models long-range correlations to enable highly compact and generalizable 3D representations, overcoming limitations of existing feed-forward compression methods for 3DGS.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a revolutionary 3D representation. However, its substantial data size poses a major barrier to widespread adoption. While feed-forward 3DGS compression offers a practical alternative to costly per-scene per-train compressors, existing methods struggle to model long-range spatial dependencies, due to the limited receptive field of transform coding networks and the inadequate context capacity in entropy models. In this work, we propose a novel feed-forward 3DGS compression framework that effectively models long-range correlations to enable highly compact and generalizable 3D representations. Central to our approach is a large-scale context structure that comprises thousands of Gaussians based on Morton serialization. We then design a fine-grained space-channel auto-regressive entropy model to fully leverage this expansive context. Furthermore, we develop an attention-based transform coding model to extract informative latent priors by aggregating features from a wide range of neighboring Gaussians. Our method yields a $20\times$ compression ratio for 3DGS in a feed-forward inference and achieves state-of-the-art performance among generalizable codecs.

TL;DR: A framework called "Look, Recite, Then Answer" improves Vision-Language Models in specialized domains by addressing reasoning-driven hallucinations through self-generated knowledge hints and evidence alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have performance plateaus in specialized domains like precision agriculture due to "Reasoning-Driven Hallucination" where linguistic priors override visual perception, and the "Modality Gap" where visual embeddings fail to activate fine-grained expert knowledge already encoded in model parameters.

Method: A parameter-efficient framework with three decoupled inference stages: (1) Look generates objective visual descriptions and candidate sets; (2) Recite uses a lightweight 1.7B router to transform visual cues into targeted queries that trigger candidate-specific parametric knowledge; (3) Answer performs parallel evidence alignment between descriptions and recited knowledge to select the most consistent label.

Result: On AgroBench, the method achieves state-of-the-art results, improving Weed Identification accuracy by 23.6% over Qwen-VL and surpassing GPT-4o without external search overhead.

Conclusion: The modular design mitigates hallucinations by transforming passive perception into active, controllable knowledge retrieval, enhancing VLMs' performance in specialized domains while keeping backbone models frozen.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit significant performance plateaus in specialized domains like precision agriculture, primarily due to "Reasoning-Driven Hallucination" where linguistic priors override visual perception. A key bottleneck is the "Modality Gap": visual embeddings fail to reliably activate the fine-grained expert knowledge already encoded in model parameters. We propose "Look, Recite, Then Answer," a parameter-efficient framework that enhances VLMs via self-generated knowledge hints while keeping backbone models frozen. The framework decouples inference into three stages: (1) Look generates objective visual descriptions and candidate sets; (2) Recite employs a lightweight 1.7B router to transform visual cues into targeted queries that trigger candidate-specific parametric knowledge; (3) Answer performs parallel evidence alignment between descriptions and recited knowledge to select the most consistent label. On AgroBench, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, improving Weed Identification accuracy by 23.6% over Qwen-VL and surpassing GPT-4o without external search overhead. This modular design mitigates hallucinations by transforming passive perception into active, controllable knowledge retrieval

*Masatoshi Tateno,Gido Kato,Hirokatsu Kataoka,Yoichi Sato,Takuma Yagi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HanDyVQA is a fine-grained video QA benchmark for hand-object interaction dynamics, covering manipulation and effects with 11.1K QA pairs and 10.3K segmentation masks, revealing significant gaps between current models and human performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HOI benchmarks focus on manipulation OR effects at coarse levels, lacking fine-grained spatio-temporal reasoning to capture the underlying dynamics in hand-object interactions.

Method: Created HanDyVQA benchmark with six question types (Action, Process, Objects, Location, State Change, Object Parts) totaling 11.1K multiple-choice QA pairs, plus 10.3K segmentation masks for object/part-level reasoning evaluation.

Result: Best model (Gemini-2.5-Pro) achieved only 73% accuracy vs human 97%, revealing challenges in spatial relationships, motion, and part-level geometric understanding. Integrating HOI cues improved performance.

Conclusion: HanDyVQA exposes limitations of current video foundation models in fine-grained HOI dynamics understanding, and provides insights for developing models with deeper HOI comprehension through explicit HOI-related feature integration.

Abstract: Hand-object interaction (HOI) inherently involves dynamics where human manipulations produce distinct spatio-temporal effects on objects. However, existing semantic HOI benchmarks focused either on manipulation or on the resulting effects at a coarse level, lacking fine-grained spatio-temporal reasoning to capture the underlying dynamics in HOI. We introduce HanDyVQA, a fine-grained video question-answering benchmark that comprehensively covers both the manipulation and effect aspects of HOI. HanDyVQA comprises six complementary question types (Action, Process, Objects, Location, State Change, and Object Parts), totalling 11.1K multiple-choice QA pairs. Collected QA pairs recognizing manipulation styles, hand/object motions, and part-level state changes. HanDyVQA also includes 10.3K segmentation masks for Objects and Object Parts questions, enabling the evaluation of object/part-level reasoning in video object segmentation. We evaluated recent video foundation models on our benchmark and found that even the best-performing model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, reached only 73% average accuracy, which is far from human performance (97%). Further analysis shows the remaining challenges in spatial relationship, motion, and part-level geometric understanding. We also found that integrating explicit HOI-related cues into visual features improves performance, offering insights for developing future models with a deeper understanding of HOI dynamics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Training-free multilingual remote sensing image captioning using retrieval-augmented prompting with SigLIP2 encoder and LLM/VLM, featuring graph-based PageRank re-ranking for improved coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of current remote sensing captioning: reliance on large annotated datasets, English-only focus restricting global applicability, and need for more inclusive/scalable Earth observation systems.

Method: 1) Use domain-adapted SigLIP2 encoder to retrieve related captions/examples from datastore; 2) Two variants: image-blind (multilingual LLM with textual prompts) and image-aware (VLM processing prompt+image); 3) Graph-based PageRank re-ranking on image-caption graph for coherence; 4) Direct multilingual generation (no translation).

Result: Competitive with fully supervised English-only systems; generalizes to 10 languages across 4 benchmark datasets; PageRank re-ranking yields up to 35% performance improvements; VLMs produce visually grounded captions, LLMs achieve stronger BLEU/CIDEr scores; direct multilingual generation outperforms translation-based approaches.

Conclusion: First systematic evaluation of training-free multilingual captioning for remote sensing; advances inclusive/scalable multimodal Earth observation; demonstrates effectiveness of retrieval-augmented prompting with graph-based re-ranking for multilingual applications.

Abstract: Remote sensing image captioning has advanced rapidly through encoder--decoder models, although the reliance on large annotated datasets and the focus on English restricts global applicability. To address these limitations, we propose the first training-free multilingual approach, based on retrieval-augmented prompting. For a given aerial image, we employ a domain-adapted SigLIP2 encoder to retrieve related captions and few-shot examples from a datastore, which are then provided to a language model. We explore two variants: an image-blind setup, where a multilingual Large Language Model (LLM) generates the caption from textual prompts alone, and an image-aware setup, where a Vision--Language Model (VLM) jointly processes the prompt and the input image. To improve the coherence of the retrieved content, we introduce a graph-based re-ranking strategy using PageRank on a graph of images and captions. Experiments on four benchmark datasets across ten languages demonstrate that our approach is competitive with fully supervised English-only systems and generalizes to other languages. Results also highlight the importance of re-ranking with PageRank, yielding up to 35% improvements in performance metrics. Additionally, it was observed that while VLMs tend to generate visually grounded but lexically diverse captions, LLMs can achieve stronger BLEU and CIDEr scores. Lastly, directly generating captions in the target language consistently outperforms other translation-based strategies. Overall, our work delivers one of the first systematic evaluations of multilingual, training-free captioning for remote sensing imagery, advancing toward more inclusive and scalable multimodal Earth observation systems.

TL;DR: STC is a plug-and-play hierarchical framework that accelerates streaming VideoLLMs by compressing visual tokens through caching similar frame features and pruning less salient tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Streaming VideoLLMs face computational bottlenecks in real-time deployment due to redundant processing of temporally similar frames in ViT encoding and inflated token sequences during LLM pre-filling, causing latency and memory overhead.

Method: STC introduces two token-level accelerators: STC-Cacher reduces ViT encoding overhead by caching and reusing features from temporally similar frames, and STC-Pruner compresses visual token sequences before entering LLM by preserving only the most salient tokens based on spatial and temporal relevance.

Result: STC outperforms other compression methods across four baseline streaming VideoLLMs on five benchmarks, retaining up to 99% accuracy on ReKV framework while reducing ViT encoding latency by 24.5% and LLM pre-filling latency by 45.3%.

Conclusion: STC effectively addresses computational bottlenecks in streaming VideoLLMs through hierarchical token compression, enabling efficient real-time video understanding while maintaining high accuracy.

Abstract: Streaming Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across various video understanding tasks, but they face significant challenges in real-time deployment due to the high computational cost of processing dense visual tokens from continuous video streams. In streaming video scenarios, the primary bottleneck lies in the Vision Transformer (ViT) encoding stage, where redundant processing of temporally similar frames leads to inefficiency. Additionally, inflated token sequences during LLM pre-filling further exacerbate latency and memory overhead. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{S}treaming \textbf{T}oken \textbf{C}ompression (\textbf{STC}), a plug-and-play hierarchical framework that seamlessly integrates into existing streaming VideoLLMs, optimizing both ViT encoding and LLM pre-filling stages to accelerate processing. STC introduces two token-level accelerators: \textbf{STC-Cacher}, which reduces ViT encoding overhead by caching and reusing features from temporally similar frames, and \textbf{STC-Pruner}, which compresses the visual token sequence before it enters the LLM, preserving only the most salient tokens based on both spatial and temporal relevance. Extensive experiments on four baseline streaming VideoLLMs across five benchmarks demonstrate that STC outperforms other compression methods. Notably, STC retains up to \textbf{99\%} of accuracy on the ReKV framework while reducing ViT encoding latency and LLM pre-filling latency by \textbf{24.5\%} and \textbf{45.3\%}.

TL;DR: SwiftVLA is a compact Vision-Language-Action model that enhances lightweight VLMs with 4D spatiotemporal understanding using a pretrained 4D visual geometry transformer, fusion tokens, and mask-and-reconstruct training, achieving performance comparable to much larger models while being significantly faster and more memory-efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language-Action models are too large for practical deployment, while lightweight alternatives compromise spatiotemporal reasoning. Existing methods that incorporate 3D inputs still rely on large VLMs and lack temporal understanding.

Method: 1) Uses pretrained 4D visual geometry transformer with temporal cache to extract 4D features from 2D images; 2) Introduces Fusion Tokens trained with future prediction to unify 2D and 4D representations; 3) Employs mask-and-reconstruct strategy to teach VLM effective 4D representations, allowing 4D branch to be dropped at inference.

Result: Outperforms lightweight baselines and rivals VLAs up to 7 times larger. Achieves comparable performance on edge devices while being 18 times faster and reducing memory footprint by 12 times.

Conclusion: SwiftVLA successfully enhances compact models with 4D understanding while maintaining efficiency, enabling practical deployment of capable VLA models on resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models built on pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show strong potential but are limited in practicality due to their large parameter counts. To mitigate this issue, using a lightweight VLM has been explored, but it compromises spatiotemporal reasoning. Although some methods suggest that incorporating additional 3D inputs can help, they usually rely on large VLMs to fuse 3D and 2D inputs and still lack temporal understanding. Therefore, we propose SwiftVLA, an architecture that enhances a compact model with 4D understanding while preserving design efficiency. Specifically, our approach features a pretrained 4D visual geometry transformer with a temporal cache that extracts 4D features from 2D images. Then, to enhance the VLM's ability to exploit both 2D images and 4D features, we introduce Fusion Tokens, a set of learnable tokens trained with a future prediction objective to generate unified representations for action generation. Finally, we introduce a mask-and-reconstruct strategy that masks 4D inputs to the VLM and trains the VLA to reconstruct them, enabling the VLM to learn effective 4D representations and allowing the 4D branch to be dropped at inference with minimal performance loss. Experiments in real and simulated environments show that SwiftVLA outperforms lightweight baselines and rivals VLAs up to 7 times larger, achieving comparable performance on edge devices while being 18 times faster and reducing memory footprint by 12 times.

TL;DR: CAE is a training-free hierarchical semantic alignment method for image clustering that combines caption-level descriptions and noun-level concepts via optimal transport to address noun ambiguity and improve clustering performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image clustering methods that use nouns as external semantic knowledge often overlook noun ambiguity, which can distort semantic representations and degrade clustering quality. There's a need to address this limitation while maintaining a training-free approach.

Method: CAE incorporates two complementary textual semantics: caption-level descriptions (fine-grained attributes) and noun-level concepts (high-level object categories). It selects relevant nouns from WordNet and descriptions from caption datasets, constructs a semantic space aligned with image features, aligns image features with selected nouns and captions via optimal transport to obtain a more discriminative semantic space, and finally combines enhanced semantic and image features for clustering.

Result: Extensive experiments across 8 datasets demonstrate effectiveness, notably surpassing state-of-the-art training-free approach with 4.2% improvement in accuracy and 2.9% improvement in adjusted rand index (ARI) on ImageNet-1K dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed CAE method effectively addresses noun ambiguity in image clustering by hierarchically aligning complementary semantic information, achieving significant performance improvements in a training-free manner.

Abstract: Image clustering is a classic problem in computer vision, which categorizes images into different groups. Recent studies utilize nouns as external semantic knowledge to improve clus- tering performance. However, these methods often overlook the inherent ambiguity of nouns, which can distort semantic representations and degrade clustering quality. To address this issue, we propose a hierarChical semAntic alignmEnt method for image clustering, dubbed CAE, which improves cluster- ing performance in a training-free manner. In our approach, we incorporate two complementary types of textual seman- tics: caption-level descriptions, which convey fine-grained attributes of image content, and noun-level concepts, which represent high-level object categories. We first select relevant nouns from WordNet and descriptions from caption datasets to construct a semantic space aligned with image features. Then, we align image features with selected nouns and captions via optimal transport to obtain a more discriminative semantic space. Finally, we combine the enhanced semantic and image features to perform clustering. Extensive experiments across 8 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, notably surpassing the state-of-the-art training-free approach with a 4.2% improvement in accuracy and a 2.9% improvement in adjusted rand index (ARI) on the ImageNet-1K dataset.

TL;DR: TalkingPose is a diffusion-based framework for generating long-form, temporally consistent human upper-body animations from a single RGB image and driving poses, overcoming computational limitations of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models for character animation are limited to short video segments due to computational and memory constraints, hindering their ability to generate temporally coherent long-form content.

Method: TalkingPose uses a stable diffusion backbone to transfer expressive facial and hand movements from driving frames to a target actor, with a feedback-driven mechanism for temporal coherence that doesn't require additional computational costs or secondary training.

Result: The framework enables generation of animations with unlimited duration while maintaining temporal consistency, and the authors introduce a comprehensive, large-scale dataset as a new benchmark for human upper-body animation.

Conclusion: TalkingPose addresses the key limitation of temporal coherence in long-form character animation generation through an efficient feedback mechanism and provides a new benchmark dataset for the field.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have significantly improved the realism and generalizability of character-driven animation, enabling the synthesis of high-quality motion from just a single RGB image and a set of driving poses. Nevertheless, generating temporally coherent long-form content remains challenging. Existing approaches are constrained by computational and memory limitations, as they are typically trained on short video segments, thus performing effectively only over limited frame lengths and hindering their potential for extended coherent generation. To address these constraints, we propose TalkingPose, a novel diffusion-based framework specifically designed for producing long-form, temporally consistent human upper-body animations. TalkingPose leverages driving frames to precisely capture expressive facial and hand movements, transferring these seamlessly to a target actor through a stable diffusion backbone. To ensure continuous motion and enhance temporal coherence, we introduce a feedback-driven mechanism built upon image-based diffusion models. Notably, this mechanism does not incur additional computational costs or require secondary training stages, enabling the generation of animations with unlimited duration. Additionally, we introduce a comprehensive, large-scale dataset to serve as a new benchmark for human upper-body animation.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses non-upright panorama correction in robotic vision, offering improved performance over traditional approaches through joint angle estimation and image reconstruction with cross-projection feature fusion.

Abstract: Panoramic cameras, capable of capturing a 360-degree field of view, are crucial in robotic vision, particularly in environments with sparse features. However, non-upright panoramas due to unstable robot postures hinder downstream tasks. Traditional IMU-based correction methods suffer from drift and external disturbances, while vision-based approaches offer a promising alternative. This study presents a dual-stream angle-aware generation network that jointly estimates camera inclination angles and reconstructs upright panoramic images. The network comprises a CNN branch that extracts local geometric structures from equirectangular projections and a ViT branch that captures global contextual cues from cubemap projections. These are integrated through a dual-projection adaptive fusion module that aligns spatial features across both domains. To further enhance performance, we introduce a high-frequency enhancement block, circular padding, and channel attention mechanisms to preserve 360° continuity and improve geometric sensitivity. Experiments on the SUN360 and M3D datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in both inclination estimation and upright panorama generation. Ablation studies further validate the contribution of each module and highlight the synergy between the two tasks.

TL;DR: LAHNet is a point cloud registration method using local attention with Locality-Sensitive Hashing for window partitioning and cross-window interactions to enhance feature distinctiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing point cloud descriptors focus too much on local information, lacking broader receptive fields needed for distinctive features. A reasonable receptive field is essential for enhancing feature distinctiveness in point cloud registration.

Method: Proposes LAHNet with: 1) Group Transformer using Locality-Sensitive Hashing to partition point clouds into non-overlapping windows for capturing long-range context; 2) Cross-window strategy to expand receptive field; 3) Interaction Transformer with overlap matrix to match overlap regions between point cloud pairs by representing windows as global signals.

Result: Extensive experiments show LAHNet learns robust and distinctive features, achieving significant registration results on real-world indoor and outdoor benchmarks.

Conclusion: LAHNet effectively addresses the receptive field limitation in point cloud registration by introducing local attention mechanisms with Locality-Sensitive Hashing, leading to improved feature distinctiveness and registration performance.

Abstract: Most existing learning-based point cloud descriptors for point cloud registration focus on perceiving local information of point clouds to generate distinctive features. However, a reasonable and broader receptive field is essential for enhancing feature distinctiveness. In this paper, we propose a Local Attentive Hashing Network for point cloud registration, called LAHNet, which introduces a local attention mechanism with the inductive bias of locality of convolution-like operators into point cloud descriptors. Specifically, a Group Transformer is designed to capture reasonable long-range context between points. This employs a linear neighborhood search strategy, Locality-Sensitive Hashing, enabling uniformly partitioning point clouds into non-overlapping windows. Meanwhile, an efficient cross-window strategy is adopted to further expand the reasonable feature receptive field. Furthermore, building on this effective windowing strategy, we propose an Interaction Transformer to enhance the feature interactions of the overlap regions within point cloud pairs. This computes an overlap matrix to match overlap regions between point cloud pairs by representing each window as a global signal. Extensive results demonstrate that LAHNet can learn robust and distinctive features, achieving significant registration results on real-world indoor and outdoor benchmarks.

TL;DR: SceneProp reformulates scene-graph grounding as MAP inference in an MRF using differentiable Belief Propagation, enabling better performance on complex relational queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard phrase grounding methods struggle with complex compositional queries involving multiple objects and relationships, lacking structural inductive bias. Existing scene-graph grounding methods paradoxically perform worse as queries become more complex, failing to leverage relational context that should make grounding easier.

Method: SceneProp reformulates scene-graph grounding as a Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) inference problem in a Markov Random Field (MRF). It performs global inference over the entire query graph using a differentiable implementation of the Belief Propagation algorithm within an end-to-end framework.

Result: Experiments on four benchmarks show SceneProp significantly outperforms prior work. Critically, its accuracy consistently improves with the size and complexity of the query graph, demonstrating that more relational context leads to better grounding.

Conclusion: SceneProp successfully addresses the structural deficit in complex visual query grounding by leveraging global inference over scene graphs, showing that relational context can and should improve grounding performance rather than hinder it.

Abstract: Grounding complex, compositional visual queries with multiple objects and relationships is a fundamental challenge for vision-language models. While standard phrase grounding methods excel at localizing single objects, they lack the structural inductive bias to parse intricate relational descriptions, often failing as queries become more descriptive. To address this structural deficit, we focus on scene-graph grounding, a powerful but less-explored formulation where the query is an explicit graph of objects and their relationships. However, existing methods for this task also struggle, paradoxically showing decreased performance as the query graph grows -- failing to leverage the very information that should make grounding easier. We introduce SceneProp, a novel method that resolves this issue by reformulating scene-graph grounding as a Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) inference problem in a Markov Random Field (MRF). By performing global inference over the entire query graph, SceneProp finds the optimal assignment of image regions to nodes that jointly satisfies all constraints. This is achieved within an end-to-end framework via a differentiable implementation of the Belief Propagation algorithm. Experiments on four benchmarks show that our dedicated focus on the scene-graph grounding formulation allows SceneProp to significantly outperform prior work. Critically, its accuracy consistently improves with the size and complexity of the query graph, demonstrating for the first time that more relational context can, and should, lead to better grounding.

TL;DR: 3D-GS segmentation method using binary encoding for memory efficiency and progressive training for fine-grained segmentation, achieving SOTA performance with reduced memory and faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D-GS segmentation methods have high memory overhead from category features and struggle with fine-grained segmentation due to label space congestion and lack of multi-granularity control.

Method: Coarse-to-fine binary encoding scheme compresses per-Gaussian features into single integers via binary-to-decimal mapping. Progressive training decomposes panoptic segmentation into independent sub-tasks. Fine-tuning opacity addresses incompatibility between photometric rendering and semantic segmentation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance on multiple benchmarks while significantly reducing memory consumption and accelerating inference.

Conclusion: The proposed binary encoding and progressive training approach effectively addresses memory efficiency and fine-grained segmentation challenges in 3D-GS, making it practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has emerged as an efficient 3D representation and a promising foundation for semantic tasks like segmentation. However, existing 3D-GS-based segmentation methods typically rely on high-dimensional category features, which introduce substantial memory overhead. Moreover, fine-grained segmentation remains challenging due to label space congestion and the lack of stable multi-granularity control mechanisms. To address these limitations, we propose a coarse-to-fine binary encoding scheme for per-Gaussian category representation, which compresses each feature into a single integer via the binary-to-decimal mapping, drastically reducing memory usage. We further design a progressive training strategy that decomposes panoptic segmentation into a series of independent sub-tasks, reducing inter-class conflicts and thereby enhancing fine-grained segmentation capability. Additionally, we fine-tune opacity during segmentation training to address the incompatibility between photometric rendering and semantic segmentation, which often leads to foreground-background confusion. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance while significantly reducing memory consumption and accelerating inference.

TL;DR: DEMR proposes a debiased evidential learning framework for moment retrieval that addresses uncertainty estimation biases through cross-modal alignment, query reconstruction, and geometric regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional moment retrieval methods struggle with fine-grained information and deterministic reasoning, leading to poor alignment with complex/ambiguous moments. Existing approaches lack adaptability for complex video scenarios and suffer from modality imbalance and structural issues in uncertainty estimation.

Method: Proposes Debiased Evidential Learning for Moment Retrieval (DEMR) with: 1) Reflective Flipped Fusion (RFF) block for cross-modal alignment, 2) query reconstruction task to enhance text sensitivity, and 3) Geom-regularizer to refine uncertainty predictions for adaptive alignment with difficult moments.

Result: Extensive testing on standard datasets and debiased datasets (ActivityNet-CD and Charades-CD) demonstrates significant improvements in effectiveness, robustness, and interpretability compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: DEMR provides a promising solution for temporal-semantic robustness in moment retrieval by addressing uncertainty estimation biases through debiased evidential learning, achieving better alignment with challenging moments and improved retrieval accuracy.

Abstract: In the domain of moment retrieval, accurately identifying temporal segments within videos based on natural language queries remains challenging. Traditional methods often employ pre-trained models that struggle with fine-grained information and deterministic reasoning, leading to difficulties in aligning with complex or ambiguous moments. To overcome these limitations, we explore Deep Evidential Regression (DER) to construct a vanilla Evidential baseline. However, this approach encounters two major issues: the inability to effectively handle modality imbalance and the structural differences in DER's heuristic uncertainty regularizer, which adversely affect uncertainty estimation. This misalignment results in high uncertainty being incorrectly associated with accurate samples rather than challenging ones. Our observations indicate that existing methods lack the adaptability required for complex video scenarios. In response, we propose Debiased Evidential Learning for Moment Retrieval (DEMR), a novel framework that incorporates a Reflective Flipped Fusion (RFF) block for cross-modal alignment and a query reconstruction task to enhance text sensitivity, thereby reducing bias in uncertainty estimation. Additionally, we introduce a Geom-regularizer to refine uncertainty predictions, enabling adaptive alignment with difficult moments and improving retrieval accuracy. Extensive testing on standard datasets and debiased datasets ActivityNet-CD and Charades-CD demonstrates significant enhancements in effectiveness, robustness, and interpretability, positioning our approach as a promising solution for temporal-semantic robustness in moment retrieval.

TL;DR: 4DHOISolver is an optimization framework for reconstructing 4D human-object interactions from monocular videos using sparse human-in-the-loop contact annotations, enabling creation of the Open4DHOI dataset and motion imitation by RL agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalized robots need diverse human-object interaction data from real-world videos, but extracting accurate 4D interaction data from in-the-wild monocular videos remains an unsolved challenge due to its ill-posed nature.

Method: 4DHOISolver framework uses sparse human-in-the-loop contact point annotations to constrain the ill-posed 4D HOI reconstruction problem while maintaining spatio-temporal coherence and physical plausibility through efficient optimization.

Result: Created Open4DHOI dataset with 144 object types and 103 actions; enabled RL agents to imitate recovered motions; benchmark showed existing 3D foundation models cannot yet predict precise human-object contact correspondences automatically.

Conclusion: The human-in-the-loop strategy is currently necessary for accurate 4D HOI reconstruction, presenting an open challenge for the community to develop better automatic contact prediction methods.

Abstract: Generalized robots must learn from diverse, large-scale human-object interactions (HOI) to operate robustly in the real world. Monocular internet videos offer a nearly limitless and readily available source of data, capturing an unparalleled diversity of human activities, objects, and environments. However, accurately and scalably extracting 4D interaction data from these in-the-wild videos remains a significant and unsolved challenge. Thus, in this work, we introduce 4DHOISolver, a novel and efficient optimization framework that constrains the ill-posed 4D HOI reconstruction problem by leveraging sparse, human-in-the-loop contact point annotations, while maintaining high spatio-temporal coherence and physical plausibility. Leveraging this framework, we introduce Open4DHOI, a new large-scale 4D HOI dataset featuring a diverse catalog of 144 object types and 103 actions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our reconstructions by enabling an RL-based agent to imitate the recovered motions. However, a comprehensive benchmark of existing 3D foundation models indicates that automatically predicting precise human-object contact correspondences remains an unsolved problem, underscoring the immediate necessity of our human-in-the-loop strategy while posing an open challenge to the community.

Abstract: A generalist robotic policy needs both semantic understanding for task planning and the ability to interact with the environment through predictive capabilities. To tackle this, we present MM-ACT, a unified Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model that integrates text, image, and action in shared token space and performs generation across all three modalities. MM-ACT adopts a re-mask parallel decoding strategy for text and image generation, and employs a one-step parallel decoding strategy for action generation to improve efficiency. We introduce Context-Shared Multimodal Learning, a unified training paradigm that supervises generation in all three modalities from a shared context, enhancing action generation through cross-modal learning. Experiments were conducted on the LIBERO simulation and Franka real-robot setups as well as RoboTwin2.0 to assess in-domain and out-of-domain performances respectively. Our approach achieves a success rate of 96.3% on LIBERO, 72.0% across three tasks of real Franka, and 52.38% across eight bimanual tasks of RoboTwin2.0 with an additional gain of 9.25% from cross-modal learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhotoFramer is a multi-modal framework that provides composition guidance by generating both textual instructions and example images to help users improve poorly composed photos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many casual users struggle with photo composition, and there's a need for accessible composition guidance that makes expert photographic knowledge available to everyday photographers.

Method: The framework uses a multi-modal model that processes and generates both text and images. Training data is organized into hierarchical sub-tasks (shift, zoom-in, view-change) sampled from existing datasets and synthesized via a degradation model that transforms well-composed photos into poorly composed ones.

Result: Textual instructions effectively steer image composition, and combining them with example images yields consistent improvements over image-only baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of the multi-modal approach.

Conclusion: PhotoFramer represents a practical step toward composition assistants that make expert photographic priors accessible to everyday users, with released code, models, and datasets for broader use.

Abstract: Composition matters during the photo-taking process, yet many casual users struggle to frame well-composed images. To provide composition guidance, we introduce PhotoFramer, a multi-modal composition instruction framework. Given a poorly composed image, PhotoFramer first describes how to improve the composition in natural language and then generates a well-composed example image. To train such a model, we curate a large-scale dataset. Inspired by how humans take photos, we organize composition guidance into a hierarchy of sub-tasks: shift, zoom-in, and view-change tasks. Shift and zoom-in data are sampled from existing cropping datasets, while view-change data are obtained via a two-stage pipeline. First, we sample pairs with varying viewpoints from multi-view datasets, and train a degradation model to transform well-composed photos into poorly composed ones. Second, we apply this degradation model to expert-taken photos to synthesize poor images to form training pairs. Using this dataset, we finetune a model that jointly processes and generates both text and images, enabling actionable textual guidance with illustrative examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that textual instructions effectively steer image composition, and coupling them with exemplars yields consistent improvements over exemplar-only baselines. PhotoFramer offers a practical step toward composition assistants that make expert photographic priors accessible to everyday users. Codes, model weights, and datasets have been released in https://zhiyuanyou.github.io/photoframer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing part-level point cloud segmentation faces two major challenges: 1) native 3D models lack generalization due to data scarcity, and 2) introducing 2D pre-trained knowledge often leads to inconsistent segmentation results across different views.

Method: The method includes: 1) a point-consistent part encoder that aggregates multi-view 2D features through native 3D contrastive learning to produce globally consistent point features, 2) a scale-aware prompt decoder that enables real-time adjustment of segmentation granularity via continuous scale signals, and 3) a large-scale, high-quality part-level point cloud dataset with over 100k samples for training.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that S2AM3D achieves leading performance across multiple evaluation settings, exhibiting exceptional robustness and controllability when handling complex structures and parts with significant size variations.

Conclusion: S2AM3D successfully addresses the generalization and consistency challenges in part-level point cloud segmentation by effectively incorporating 2D segmentation priors with 3D consistent supervision, while providing a valuable dataset for future research.

Abstract: Part-level point cloud segmentation has recently attracted significant attention in 3D computer vision. Nevertheless, existing research is constrained by two major challenges: native 3D models lack generalization due to data scarcity, while introducing 2D pre-trained knowledge often leads to inconsistent segmentation results across different views. To address these challenges, we propose S2AM3D, which incorporates 2D segmentation priors with 3D consistent supervision. We design a point-consistent part encoder that aggregates multi-view 2D features through native 3D contrastive learning, producing globally consistent point features. A scale-aware prompt decoder is then proposed to enable real-time adjustment of segmentation granularity via continuous scale signals. Simultaneously, we introduce a large-scale, high-quality part-level point cloud dataset with more than 100k samples, providing ample supervision signals for model training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that S2AM3D achieves leading performance across multiple evaluation settings, exhibiting exceptional robustness and controllability when handling complex structures and parts with significant size variations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LISA-3D is a two-stage framework that lifts 2D language-image segmentation to 3D by adapting LISA with geometry-aware LoRA layers and using frozen SAM-3D for reconstruction, achieving significant improvements in language-to-3D accuracy with minimal parameter adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-driven 3D reconstruction needs a mask generator that understands open-vocabulary instructions while maintaining cross-view consistency, which existing methods struggle with.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Retrofit LISA with geometry-aware LoRA layers for cross-view consistent segmentation, 2) Use frozen SAM-3D reconstructor with RGBA prompts (RGB + masks) to output Gaussian splats or textured meshes without retraining.

Result: Improves language-to-3D accuracy by up to +15.6 points over single-view baselines on ScanRefer and Nr3D datasets, adapting only 11.6M parameters. Supports zero-shot deployment on unseen categories.

Conclusion: LISA-3D provides a practical, modular, and data-efficient recipe for language-guided 3D content creation with strong cross-view consistency and zero-shot capabilities.

Abstract: Text-driven 3D reconstruction demands a mask generator that simultaneously understands open-vocabulary instructions and remains consistent across viewpoints. We present LISA-3D, a two-stage framework that lifts language-image segmentation into 3D by retrofitting the instruction-following model LISA with geometry-aware Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) layers and reusing a frozen SAM-3D reconstructor. During training we exploit off-the-shelf RGB-D sequences and their camera poses to build a differentiable reprojection loss that enforces cross-view agreement without requiring any additional 3D-text supervision. The resulting masks are concatenated with RGB images to form RGBA prompts for SAM-3D, which outputs Gaussian splats or textured meshes without retraining. Across ScanRefer and Nr3D, LISA-3D improves language-to-3D accuracy by up to +15.6 points over single-view baselines while adapting only 11.6M parameters. The system is modular, data-efficient, and supports zero-shot deployment on unseen categories, providing a practical recipe for language-guided 3D content creation.

*Jing He,Haodong Li,Mingzhi Sheng,Ying-Cong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Lotus-2 is a two-stage deterministic framework that adapts diffusion models for stable and accurate geometric dense prediction (depth/normal estimation) using minimal training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular geometric prediction is ill-posed due to appearance ambiguity. While discriminative models need large supervised data and generative models are optimized for diversity rather than deterministic prediction, diffusion models contain powerful world priors that could be better adapted for geometric inference.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Core predictor uses single-step deterministic formulation with clean-data objective and local continuity module for globally coherent structures. 2) Detail sharpener performs constrained multi-step rectified-flow refinement within the manifold to enhance fine-grained geometry via noise-free deterministic flow matching.

Result: Using only 59K training samples (<1% of existing datasets), Lotus-2 achieves SOTA in monocular depth estimation and competitive surface normal prediction, demonstrating diffusion models can serve as deterministic world priors.

Conclusion: Diffusion models can be effectively adapted as deterministic world priors for high-quality geometric reasoning, enabling accurate dense prediction with minimal data beyond traditional discriminative and generative paradigms.

Abstract: Recovering pixel-wise geometric properties from a single image is fundamentally ill-posed due to appearance ambiguity and non-injective mappings between 2D observations and 3D structures. While discriminative regression models achieve strong performance through large-scale supervision, their success is bounded by the scale, quality and diversity of available data and limited physical reasoning. Recent diffusion models exhibit powerful world priors that encode geometry and semantics learned from massive image-text data, yet directly reusing their stochastic generative formulation is suboptimal for deterministic geometric inference: the former is optimized for diverse and high-fidelity image generation, whereas the latter requires stable and accurate predictions. In this work, we propose Lotus-2, a two-stage deterministic framework for stable, accurate and fine-grained geometric dense prediction, aiming to provide an optimal adaption protocol to fully exploit the pre-trained generative priors. Specifically, in the first stage, the core predictor employs a single-step deterministic formulation with a clean-data objective and a lightweight local continuity module (LCM) to generate globally coherent structures without grid artifacts. In the second stage, the detail sharpener performs a constrained multi-step rectified-flow refinement within the manifold defined by the core predictor, enhancing fine-grained geometry through noise-free deterministic flow matching. Using only 59K training samples, less than 1% of existing large-scale datasets, Lotus-2 establishes new state-of-the-art results in monocular depth estimation and highly competitive surface normal prediction. These results demonstrate that diffusion models can serve as deterministic world priors, enabling high-quality geometric reasoning beyond traditional discriminative and generative paradigms.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TRoVe is an automated method to identify error-inducing static feature biases in vision-language models for temporal understanding tasks, improving bias detection by 28.6% over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs for temporal understanding may rely on static feature biases (like backgrounds or object features) rather than actual visual changes, leading to systematic prediction errors. Identifying these biases is crucial before real-world deployment.

Method: TRoVe extracts candidate static features from annotated validation data and scores each feature by: (1) its effect on classification errors, and (2) the extent to which the VLM relies on it for predictions.

Result: TRoVe achieves 28.6% improvement over the closest baseline in identifying error-inducing static feature biases. Applied to 7 off-the-shelf VLMs and 2 temporal tasks, it surfaces previously-unknown biases and shows bias knowledge can improve test-time performance.

Conclusion: TRoVe provides an effective automated approach for discovering static feature biases in temporal VLMs, enabling better model understanding and potential performance improvement through bias awareness.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have made great strides in addressing temporal understanding tasks, which involve characterizing visual changes across a sequence of images. However, recent works have suggested that when making predictions, VLMs may rely on static feature biases, such as background or object features, rather than dynamic visual changes. Static feature biases are a type of shortcut and can contribute to systematic prediction errors on downstream tasks; as a result, identifying and characterizing error-inducing static feature biases is critical prior to real-world model deployment. In this work, we introduce TRoVe, an automated approach for discovering error-inducing static feature biases learned by temporal VLMs. Given a trained VLM and an annotated validation dataset associated with a downstream classification task, TRoVe extracts candidate static features from the dataset and scores each feature by (i) the effect of the feature on classification errors as well as (ii) the extent to which the VLM relies on the feature when making predictions. In order to quantitatively evaluate TRoVe, we introduce an evaluation framework consisting of 101 trained temporal VLMs paired with ground-truth annotations for learned static feature biases. We use this framework to demonstrate that TRoVe can accurately identify error-inducing static feature biases in VLMs, achieving a 28.6% improvement over the closest baseline. Finally, we apply TRoVe to 7 off-the-shelf VLMs and 2 temporal understanding tasks, surfacing previously-unknown static feature biases and demonstrating that knowledge of learned biases can aid in improving model performance at test time.

*Anantha Padmanaban Krishna Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViT-B/16 models are overparameterized; reducing MLP capacity via weight sharing or dimension reduction improves performance and training stability while reducing parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While scaling Vision Transformers typically improves performance, model accuracy doesn't always increase monotonically with scale. The authors investigate whether ViT-B/16 on ImageNet-1K operates in an overparameterized regime where MLP capacity can be reduced without harming performance.

Method: Two parameter-reduction strategies for ViT-B/16 MLP blocks: 1) GroupedMLP shares MLP weights between adjacent transformer blocks, and 2) ShallowMLP halves the MLP hidden dimension. Both remove 32.7% of baseline parameters.

Result: GroupedMLP achieves 81.47% top-1 accuracy (vs baseline 81.05%) with same computational cost. ShallowMLP reaches 81.25% accuracy with 38% inference throughput increase. Both show substantially improved training stability, reducing peak-to-final accuracy degradation from 0.47% to 0.03-0.06%.

Conclusion: ViT-B/16 on ImageNet-1K operates in an overparameterized regime where MLP capacity can be reduced without harming performance. Architectural constraints like parameter sharing and reduced width act as useful inductive biases, highlighting the importance of parameter allocation in Vision Transformer design.

Abstract: Although scaling laws and many empirical results suggest that increasing the size of Vision Transformers often improves performance, model accuracy and training behavior are not always monotonically increasing with scale. Focusing on ViT-B/16 trained on ImageNet-1K, we study two simple parameter-reduction strategies applied to the MLP blocks, each removing 32.7\% of the baseline parameters. Our \emph{GroupedMLP} variant shares MLP weights between adjacent transformer blocks and achieves 81.47\% top-1 accuracy while maintaining the baseline computational cost. Our \emph{ShallowMLP} variant halves the MLP hidden dimension and reaches 81.25\% top-1 accuracy with a 38\% increase in inference throughput. Both models outperform the 86.6M-parameter baseline (81.05\%) and exhibit substantially improved training stability, reducing peak-to-final accuracy degradation from 0.47\% to the range 0.03\% to 0.06\%. These results suggest that, for ViT-B/16 on ImageNet-1K with a standard training recipe, the model operates in an overparameterized regime in which MLP capacity can be reduced without harming performance and can even slightly improve it. More broadly, our findings suggest that architectural constraints such as parameter sharing and reduced width may act as useful inductive biases, and highlight the importance of how parameters are allocated when designing Vision Transformers.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MedGrounder, a generalized medical phrase grounding model that maps radiology report sentences to zero, one, or multiple scored image regions, addressing limitations of existing single-bounding-box approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical phrase grounding systems follow the referring expression comprehension paradigm and return exactly one bounding box per phrase, but real radiology reports often contain multi-region findings, non-diagnostic text, and non-groundable phrases like negations or normal anatomy descriptions.

Method: Proposes MedGrounder with a two-stage training regime: pre-training on report sentence-anatomy box alignment datasets, then fine-tuning on report sentence-human annotated box datasets. Reformulates the task as generalized medical phrase grounding where each sentence maps to zero, one, or multiple scored regions.

Result: MedGrounder achieves strong zero-shot transfer and outperforms REC-style and grounded report generation baselines on multi-region and non-groundable phrases on PadChest-GR and MS-CXR datasets, while using far fewer human box annotations. Can be composed with existing report generators without retraining.

Conclusion: The generalized medical phrase grounding formulation and MedGrounder model effectively handle real-world radiology report complexities, providing a more flexible and practical solution for medical image-text alignment that can work with existing report generation systems.

Abstract: Medical phrase grounding (MPG) maps textual descriptions of radiological findings to corresponding image regions. These grounded reports are easier to interpret, especially for non-experts. Existing MPG systems mostly follow the referring expression comprehension (REC) paradigm and return exactly one bounding box per phrase. Real reports often violate this assumption. They contain multi-region findings, non-diagnostic text, and non-groundable phrases, such as negations or descriptions of normal anatomy. Motivated by this, we reformulate the task as generalised medical phrase grounding (GMPG), where each sentence is mapped to zero, one, or multiple scored regions. To realise this formulation, we introduce the first GMPG model: MedGrounder. We adopted a two-stage training regime: pre-training on report sentence--anatomy box alignment datasets and fine-tuning on report sentence--human annotated box datasets. Experiments on PadChest-GR and MS-CXR show that MedGrounder achieves strong zero-shot transfer and outperforms REC-style and grounded report generation baselines on multi-region and non-groundable phrases, while using far fewer human box annotations. Finally, we show that MedGrounder can be composed with existing report generators to produce grounded reports without retraining the generator.

*Pranav Subbaraman,Shufan Li,Siyan Zhao,Aditya Grover*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Speed-RL accelerates masked generative models using reinforcement learning instead of distillation, achieving 3x faster inference while maintaining image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Masked Generative Models (MGMs) produce high-fidelity images but require many sampling steps, resulting in slow inference speed. Current distillation methods treat acceleration as distribution matching, which may not be optimal.

Method: Proposes Speed-RL, a reinforcement learning paradigm for accelerating pretrained MGMs. Instead of distribution matching, it treats acceleration as an RL problem with combined quality and speed rewards, then fine-tunes the base model using RL optimization.

Result: The method achieves 3x acceleration of the base model while maintaining comparable image quality, as demonstrated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: Speed-RL offers a novel and effective reinforcement learning approach for accelerating masked generative models, outperforming conventional distillation methods by directly optimizing for both quality and speed objectives.

Abstract: Masked Generative Models (MGM)s demonstrate strong capabilities in generating high-fidelity images. However, they need many sampling steps to create high-quality generations, resulting in slow inference speed. In this work, we propose Speed-RL, a novel paradigm for accelerating a pretrained MGMs to generate high-quality images in fewer steps. Unlike conventional distillation methods which formulate the acceleration problem as a distribution matching problem, where a few-step student model is trained to match the distribution generated by a many-step teacher model, we consider this problem as a reinforcement learning problem. Since the goal of acceleration is to generate high quality images in fewer steps, we can combine a quality reward with a speed reward and finetune the base model using reinforcement learning with the combined reward as the optimization target. Through extensive experiments, we show that the proposed method was able to accelerate the base model by a factor of 3x while maintaining comparable image quality.

TL;DR: CycliST is a new benchmark dataset for evaluating Video Language Models' ability to reason about cyclical state transitions in synthetic video sequences with periodic patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Video Language Models lack robust understanding of cyclical dynamics and temporal patterns in visual scenes, creating a significant technical gap in spatio-temporal cognition.

Method: Created synthetic video sequences with periodic patterns in object motion and visual attributes, using a tiered evaluation system with progressive difficulty levels based on number of cyclic objects, scene clutter, and lighting conditions.

Result: Current VLMs struggle with cyclical dynamics (linear/orbital motion), time-dependent visual changes, lack temporal understanding, and cannot extract quantitative insights. No single model consistently leads in performance across tasks.

Conclusion: CycliST provides a targeted challenge and comprehensive evaluation framework to advance visual reasoning models in understanding periodic patterns, highlighting the need for improved temporal cognition in VLMs.

Abstract: We present CycliST, a novel benchmark dataset designed to evaluate Video Language Models (VLM) on their ability for textual reasoning over cyclical state transitions. CycliST captures fundamental aspects of real-world processes by generating synthetic, richly structured video sequences featuring periodic patterns in object motion and visual attributes. CycliST employs a tiered evaluation system that progressively increases difficulty through variations in the number of cyclic objects, scene clutter, and lighting conditions, challenging state-of-the-art models on their spatio-temporal cognition. We conduct extensive experiments with current state-of-the-art VLMs, both open-source and proprietary, and reveal their limitations in generalizing to cyclical dynamics such as linear and orbital motion, as well as time-dependent changes in visual attributes like color and scale. Our results demonstrate that present-day VLMs struggle to reliably detect and exploit cyclic patterns, lack a notion of temporal understanding, and are unable to extract quantitative insights from scenes, such as the number of objects in motion, highlighting a significant technical gap that needs to be addressed. More specifically, we find no single model consistently leads in performance: neither size nor architecture correlates strongly with outcomes, and no model succeeds equally well across all tasks. By providing a targeted challenge and a comprehensive evaluation framework, CycliST paves the way for visual reasoning models that surpass the state-of-the-art in understanding periodic patterns.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A learning-based framework that directly learns spectral bases from unstructured data without traditional operator construction or eigendecomposition, recovering Laplacian-like spectral properties in a unified manner.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional spectral analysis requires manual operator selection, discretization, and expensive eigendecomposition, which becomes challenging for unstructured data and high-dimensional manifolds. The paper aims to bypass these limitations with a data-driven approach.

Method: Train a network to decompose an implicit approximation operator by minimizing reconstruction error of probe functions in a learned basis. The method learns spectral basis, sampling density, and eigenvalues simultaneously without explicit operator construction.

Result: The method successfully recovers meaningful spectral bases resembling Laplacian eigenfunctions on 3D surface point clouds and high-dimensional image manifolds, without requiring meshing or assumptions about manifold dimensionality.

Conclusion: This learning-based framework provides a principled, data-driven alternative to conventional spectral analysis pipelines, enabling spectral analysis of unstructured data in arbitrary dimensions without traditional operator construction.

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework that directly learns a spectral basis for shape and manifold analysis from unstructured data, eliminating the need for traditional operator selection, discretization, and eigensolvers. Grounded in optimal-approximation theory, we train a network to decompose an implicit approximation operator by minimizing the reconstruction error in the learned basis over a chosen distribution of probe functions. For suitable distributions, they can be seen as an approximation of the Laplacian operator and its eigendecomposition, which are fundamental in geometry processing. Furthermore, our method recovers in a unified manner not only the spectral basis, but also the implicit metric's sampling density and the eigenvalues of the underlying operator. Notably, our unsupervised method makes no assumption on the data manifold, such as meshing or manifold dimensionality, allowing it to scale to arbitrary datasets of any dimension. On point clouds lying on surfaces in 3D and high-dimensional image manifolds, our approach yields meaningful spectral bases, that can resemble those of the Laplacian, without explicit construction of an operator. By replacing the traditional operator selection, construction, and eigendecomposition with a learning-based approach, our framework offers a principled, data-driven alternative to conventional pipelines. This opens new possibilities in geometry processing for unstructured data, particularly in high-dimensional spaces.

TL;DR: SlotSPE: A slot-based framework that models structural prognostic events from histology images and gene profiles to improve cancer survival prediction by capturing sparse, patient-specific prognostic signals through factorial coding and slot attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal approaches for cancer survival prediction struggle to efficiently model intra- and inter-modal interactions due to high-dimensional, complex inputs. The key challenge is identifying sparse, patient-specific structural prognostic events (like spatial histologic patterns or pathway co-activations) that determine patient outcomes but are difficult to uncover due to their unannotated nature.

Method: SlotSPE uses slot attention to compress multimodal inputs (histology images and gene profiles) into compact, modality-specific sets of mutually distinctive slots, inspired by factorial coding principles. These slots represent prognostic events and enable efficient modeling of complex intra- and inter-modal interactions while allowing incorporation of biological priors.

Result: Extensive experiments on ten cancer benchmarks show SlotSPE outperforms existing methods in 8 out of 10 cohorts, achieving an overall improvement of 2.9%. The method remains robust under missing genomic data and provides improved interpretability through structured event decomposition.

Conclusion: SlotSPE effectively addresses the challenge of modeling sparse structural prognostic events in multimodal cancer data, offering superior performance, robustness to missing data, and enhanced interpretability compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: The integration of histology images and gene profiles has shown great promise for improving survival prediction in cancer. However, current approaches often struggle to model intra- and inter-modal interactions efficiently and effectively due to the high dimensionality and complexity of the inputs. A major challenge is capturing critical prognostic events that, though few, underlie the complexity of the observed inputs and largely determine patient outcomes. These events, manifested as high-level structural signals such as spatial histologic patterns or pathway co-activations, are typically sparse, patient-specific, and unannotated, making them inherently difficult to uncover. To address this, we propose SlotSPE, a slot-based framework for structural prognostic event modeling. Specifically, inspired by the principle of factorial coding, we compress each patient's multimodal inputs into compact, modality-specific sets of mutually distinctive slots using slot attention. By leveraging these slot representations as encodings for prognostic events, our framework enables both efficient and effective modeling of complex intra- and inter-modal interactions, while also facilitating seamless incorporation of biological priors that enhance prognostic relevance. Extensive experiments on ten cancer benchmarks show that SlotSPE outperforms existing methods in 8 out of 10 cohorts, achieving an overall improvement of 2.9%. It remains robust under missing genomic data and delivers markedly improved interpretability through structured event decomposition.

*Haotian Liu,Haoyu Chen,Chenhui Pan,You Hu,Guoying Zhao,Xiaobai Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniFD is a unified framework that addresses four core face forgery detection tasks (image/video classification, spatial/temporal localization) within a single model, outperforming task-specific approaches with better efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current face forgery detection approaches use task-specific models with independent architectures, leading to computational redundancy and ignoring potential correlations across related tasks. There's a need for a unified solution that can handle multiple detection tasks efficiently.

Method: OmniFD uses: (1) a shared Swin Transformer encoder for unified 4D spatiotemporal representations from images/videos, (2) a cross-task interaction module with learnable queries that captures inter-task dependencies through attention-based reasoning, and (3) lightweight decoding heads for task-specific predictions.

Result: OmniFD outperforms task-specific models, achieving 4.63% improvement in video classification accuracy when incorporating image data. It reduces model parameters by 63% and training time by 50% while establishing superior performance across diverse benchmarks.

Conclusion: OmniFD provides a practical and generalizable unified solution for comprehensive face forgery detection, leveraging multi-task learning to capture generalized representations and enabling fine-grained knowledge transfer across tasks with high efficiency and scalability.

Abstract: Face forgery detection encompasses multiple critical tasks, including identifying forged images and videos and localizing manipulated regions and temporal segments. Current approaches typically employ task-specific models with independent architectures, leading to computational redundancy and ignoring potential correlations across related tasks. We introduce OmniFD, a unified framework that jointly addresses four core face forgery detection tasks within a single model, i.e., image and video classification, spatial localization, and temporal localization. Our architecture consists of three principal components: (1) a shared Swin Transformer encoder that extracts unified 4D spatiotemporal representations from both images and video inputs, (2) a cross-task interaction module with learnable queries that dynamically captures inter-task dependencies through attention-based reasoning, and (3) lightweight decoding heads that transform refined representations into corresponding predictions for all FFD tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate OmniFD's advantage over task-specific models. Its unified design leverages multi-task learning to capture generalized representations across tasks, especially enabling fine-grained knowledge transfer that facilitates other tasks. For example, video classification accuracy improves by 4.63% when image data are incorporated. Furthermore, by unifying images, videos and the four tasks within one framework, OmniFD achieves superior performance across diverse benchmarks with high efficiency and scalability, e.g., reducing 63% model parameters and 50% training time. It establishes a practical and generalizable solution for comprehensive face forgery detection in real-world applications. The source code is made available at https://github.com/haotianll/OmniFD.

### [134] [Weakly Supervised Continuous Micro-Expression Intensity Estimation Using Temporal Deep Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01145)
*Riyadh Mohammed Almushrafy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified framework for continuous micro-expression intensity estimation using only weak temporal labels (onset, apex, offset) without frame-level annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most prior work focuses on discrete micro-expression classification, but few address continuous intensity evolution over time. Progress is limited by lack of frame-level intensity labels, making fully supervised regression impractical.

Method: Uses triangular prior to convert sparse temporal landmarks into dense pseudo-intensity trajectories. A lightweight temporal regression model combines ResNet18 encoder with bidirectional GRU to predict frame-wise intensity directly from image sequences. Requires no frame-level annotation and uses consistent preprocessing pipeline across datasets.

Result: On SAMM: Spearman correlation 0.9014, Kendall correlation 0.7999, outperforming frame-wise baseline. On CASME II: up to 0.9116 and 0.8168 respectively when trained without apex-ranking term. Temporal modeling and structured pseudo labels are central to capturing rise-apex-fall dynamics.

Conclusion: First unified approach for continuous micro-expression intensity estimation using only sparse temporal annotations, demonstrating strong temporal agreement with pseudo-intensity trajectories and effective capture of micro-facial movement dynamics.

Abstract: Micro-facial expressions are brief and involuntary facial movements that reflect genuine emotional states. While most prior work focuses on classifying discrete micro-expression categories, far fewer studies address the continuous evolution of intensity over time. Progress in this direction is limited by the lack of frame-level intensity labels, which makes fully supervised regression impractical.
  We propose a unified framework for continuous micro-expression intensity estimation using only weak temporal labels (onset, apex, offset). A simple triangular prior converts sparse temporal landmarks into dense pseudo-intensity trajectories, and a lightweight temporal regression model that combines a ResNet18 encoder with a bidirectional GRU predicts frame-wise intensity directly from image sequences. The method requires no frame-level annotation effort and is applied consistently across datasets through a single preprocessing and temporal alignment pipeline.
  Experiments on SAMM and CASME II show strong temporal agreement with the pseudo-intensity trajectories. On SAMM, the model reaches a Spearman correlation of 0.9014 and a Kendall correlation of 0.7999, outperforming a frame-wise baseline. On CASME II, it achieves up to 0.9116 and 0.8168, respectively, when trained without the apex-ranking term. Ablation studies confirm that temporal modeling and structured pseudo labels are central to capturing the rise-apex-fall dynamics of micro-facial movements.
  To our knowledge, this is the first unified approach for continuous micro-expression intensity estimation using only sparse temporal annotations.

### [135] [SocialFusion: Addressing Social Degradation in Pre-trained Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01148)
*Hamza Tahboub,Weiyan Shi,Gang Hua,Huaizu Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SocialFusion: A unified framework that addresses "social degradation" in vision-language models by learning minimal connections between frozen visual encoder and language model, achieving positive transfer across multiple social perception tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models (VLMs) struggle with multiple social perception tasks due to "social degradation" - their pre-training process impairs the visual encoder's ability to represent nuanced social information, leading to negative transfer between tasks.

Method: SocialFusion learns minimal connections between a frozen visual encoder and a language model. The approach investigates social degradation through two lenses: decodability (linear representation probing) and compatibility (gradient conflict analysis).

Result: SocialFusion achieves positive transfer across all five social tasks, leveraging synergies between them to enhance overall performance. It achieves comparable performance to task-specific state-of-the-art models on various benchmarks.

Conclusion: Current VLM pre-training strategies may be detrimental to acquiring general social competence, highlighting the need for more socially-aware training paradigms. SocialFusion demonstrates that unified learning of social perception tasks is possible with proper architectural design.

Abstract: Understanding social interactions from visual cues is a fundamental challenge for a socially competent AI. While powerful pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable general capabilities, they surprisingly struggle to unify and learn multiple social perception tasks simultaneously, often exhibiting negative transfer. We identify that this negative transfer stems from a critical issue we term "social degradation," whereby the general visual-linguistic pre-training process of VLMs impairs the visual encoder's ability to represent nuanced social information. We investigate this behavior further under two lenses: decodability through linear representation probing and compatibility through gradient conflict analysis, revealing that both play a role in the degradation, especially the former, which is significantly compromised in the VLM pre-training process. To address these issues, we propose SocialFusion, a unified framework that learns a minimal connection between a frozen visual encoder and a language model. Compared with existing VLMs, it exhibits positive transfer across all five social tasks, leveraging synergies between them to enhance overall performance and achieves comparable performance to task-specific state-of-the-art models on various benchmarks. Our findings suggest that current VLM pre-training strategies may be detrimental to acquiring general social competence and highlight the need for more socially-aware training paradigms.

*Han-Jin Lee,Han-Ju Lee,Jin-Seong Kim,Seok-Hwan Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DPAC: A diffusion guidance method that projects adversarial gradients onto tangent spaces to preserve sample quality while achieving target classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adversarial guidance for diffusion sampling often achieves target classification but degrades sample quality due to accumulated deviations between controlled and nominal trajectories.

Method: Formalizes degradation as path-space KL divergence, derives optimal control condition, and proposes DPAC (Distribution-Preserving Adversarial Control) that projects adversarial gradients onto tangent space defined by generative score geometry.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows DPAC minimizes path-KL, tightens bounds on Wasserstein distance and FID, cancels O(Δt) error term in discrete solvers, and remains robust to approximations. Empirical validation on ImageNet-100 confirms lower FID and path-KL at matched attack success rates.

Conclusion: DPAC provides a principled connection between adversarial control energy and perceptual fidelity, enabling effective diffusion guidance that preserves distributional quality while achieving classification objectives.

Abstract: Adversarially guided diffusion sampling often achieves the target class, but sample quality degrades as deviations between the adversarially controlled and nominal trajectories accumulate. We formalize this degradation as a path-space Kullback-Leibler divergence(path-KL) between controlled and nominal (uncontrolled) diffusion processes, thereby showing via Girsanov's theorem that it exactly equals the control energy. Building on this stochastic optimal control (SOC) view, we theoretically establish that minimizing this path-KL simultaneously tightens upper bounds on both the 2-Wasserstein distance and Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), revealing a principled connection between adversarial control energy and perceptual fidelity. From a variational perspective, we derive a first-order optimality condition for the control: among all directions that yield the same classification gain, the component tangent to iso-(log-)density surfaces (i.e., orthogonal to the score) minimizes path-KL, whereas the normal component directly increases distributional drift. This leads to DPAC (Distribution-Preserving Adversarial Control), a diffusion guidance rule that projects adversarial gradients onto the tangent space defined by the generative score geometry. We further show that in discrete solvers, the tangent projection cancels the O(Δt) leading error term in the Wasserstein distance, achieving an O(Δt^2) quality gap; moreover, it remains second-order robust to score or metric approximation. Empirical studies on ImageNet-100 validate the theoretical predictions, confirming that DPAC achieves lower FID and estimated path-KL at matched attack success rates.

Conclusion: The real-time annotation framework using YOLO on edge devices is effective and feasible for agricultural applications, offering substantial time savings in dataset preparation while maintaining annotation accuracy.

Abstract: Efficient and accurate annotation of datasets remains a significant challenge for deploying object detection models such as You Only Look Once (YOLO) in real-world applications, particularly in agriculture where rapid decision-making is critical. Traditional annotation techniques are labor-intensive, requiring extensive manual labeling post data collection. This paper presents a novel real-time annotation approach leveraging YOLO models deployed on edge devices, enabling immediate labeling during image capture. To comprehensively evaluate the efficiency and accuracy of our proposed system, we conducted an extensive comparative analysis using three prominent YOLO architectures (YOLOv5, YOLOv8, YOLOv12) under various configurations: single-class versus multi-class annotation and pretrained versus scratch-based training. Our analysis includes detailed statistical tests and learning dynamics, demonstrating significant advantages of pretrained and single-class configurations in terms of model convergence, performance, and robustness. Results strongly validate the feasibility and effectiveness of our real-time annotation framework, highlighting its capability to drastically reduce dataset preparation time while maintaining high annotation quality.

### [138] [VSRD++: Autolabeling for 3D Object Detection via Instance-Aware Volumetric Silhouette Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01178)
*Zihua Liu,Hiroki Sakuma,Masatoshi Okutomi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VSRD++ is a weakly supervised monocular 3D object detection framework that eliminates the need for 3D annotations by using neural-field-based volumetric rendering with only 2D supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing monocular 3D object detection methods heavily depend on supervised learning with extensive 3D annotations, which are labor-intensive to acquire from LiDAR point clouds. There's a need for approaches that can work with weaker supervision.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: 1) Multi-view 3D autolabeling using signed distance fields (SDFs) with instance-aware volumetric silhouette rendering, decomposing SDF into cuboid SDF and residual distance field, modeling dynamic objects with velocity and confidence scores, and using 3D attribute initialization. 2) Using optimized 3D bounding boxes as pseudo-labels to train monocular 3D detectors.

Result: Extensive experiments on KITTI-360 dataset show VSRD++ significantly outperforms existing weakly supervised approaches for monocular 3D object detection on both static and dynamic scenes.

Conclusion: VSRD++ successfully eliminates reliance on 3D annotations while achieving strong performance through neural-field-based volumetric rendering and a two-stage weakly supervised approach, making monocular 3D object detection more practical by reducing annotation requirements.

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection is a fundamental yet challenging task in 3D scene understanding. Existing approaches heavily depend on supervised learning with extensive 3D annotations, which are often acquired from LiDAR point clouds through labor-intensive labeling processes. To tackle this problem, we propose VSRD++, a novel weakly supervised framework for monocular 3D object detection that eliminates the reliance on 3D annotations and leverages neural-field-based volumetric rendering with weak 2D supervision. VSRD++ consists of a two-stage pipeline: multi-view 3D autolabeling and subsequent monocular 3D detector training. In the multi-view autolabeling stage, object surfaces are represented as signed distance fields (SDFs) and rendered as instance masks via the proposed instance-aware volumetric silhouette rendering. To optimize 3D bounding boxes, we decompose each instance's SDF into a cuboid SDF and a residual distance field (RDF) that captures deviations from the cuboid. To address the geometry inconsistency commonly observed in volume rendering methods applied to dynamic objects, we model the dynamic objects by including velocity into bounding box attributes as well as assigning confidence to each pseudo-label. Moreover, we also employ a 3D attribute initialization module to initialize the dynamic bounding box parameters. In the monocular 3D object detection phase, the optimized 3D bounding boxes serve as pseudo labels for training monocular 3D object detectors. Extensive experiments on the KITTI-360 dataset demonstrate that VSRD++ significantly outperforms existing weakly supervised approaches for monocular 3D object detection on both static and dynamic scenes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TabletopGen: A training-free framework for generating diverse, interactive 3D tabletop scenes from reference images, with novel pose/scale alignment for accurate reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D scene generation methods focus on large-scale scenes and struggle with high-density layouts and complex spatial relations in tabletop scenes, which are essential for embodied AI and robotic manipulation.

Method: Training-free framework that takes reference images (can be from text-to-image models), performs instance segmentation/completion, reconstructs 3D models with canonical alignment, then uses a two-stage pose/scale estimation (Differentiable Rotation Optimizer + Top-view Spatial Alignment) to assemble collision-free scenes.

Result: State-of-the-art performance surpassing existing methods in visual fidelity, layout accuracy, and physical plausibility, capable of generating realistic tabletop scenes with rich stylistic and spatial diversity.

Conclusion: TabletopGen provides an effective solution for generating high-fidelity, physically interactive 3D tabletop scenes essential for embodied AI applications, with code to be publicly available.

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity, physically interactive 3D simulated tabletop scenes is essential for embodied AI--especially for robotic manipulation policy learning and data synthesis. However, current text- or image-driven 3D scene generation methods mainly focus on large-scale scenes, struggling to capture the high-density layouts and complex spatial relations that characterize tabletop scenes. To address these challenges, we propose TabletopGen, a training-free, fully automatic framework that generates diverse, instance-level interactive 3D tabletop scenes. TabletopGen accepts a reference image as input, which can be synthesized by a text-to-image model to enhance scene diversity. We then perform instance segmentation and completion on the reference to obtain per-instance images. Each instance is reconstructed into a 3D model followed by canonical coordinate alignment. The aligned 3D models then undergo pose and scale estimation before being assembled into a collision-free, simulation-ready tabletop scene. A key component of our framework is a novel pose and scale alignment approach that decouples the complex spatial reasoning into two stages: a Differentiable Rotation Optimizer for precise rotation recovery and a Top-view Spatial Alignment mechanism for robust translation and scale estimation, enabling accurate 3D reconstruction from 2D reference. Extensive experiments and user studies show that TabletopGen achieves state-of-the-art performance, markedly surpassing existing methods in visual fidelity, layout accuracy, and physical plausibility, capable of generating realistic tabletop scenes with rich stylistic and spatial diversity. Our code will be publicly available.

*Yangbangyan Jiang,Qianqian Xu,Huiyang Shao,Zhiyong Yang,Shilong Bao,Xiaochun Cao,Qingming Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes two instance-wise minimax reformulations for partial AUC (PAUC) optimization that close the approximation gap, with linear per-iteration complexity and O(ε^{-1/3}) convergence rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PAUC is important for real-world scenarios with class imbalance and decision constraints, but existing optimization methods suffer from uncontrollable approximation errors or limited scalability due to the NP-hard nature of instance selection within constrained FPR/TPR intervals.

Method: Two instance-wise minimax reformulations: one with asymptotically vanishing gap, another unbiased but with more variables. Key ideas: establish equivalent instance-wise problem to reduce time complexity, simplify sample selection via threshold learning, apply smoothing techniques, and develop efficient solver.

Result: Algorithms achieve linear per-iteration computational complexity w.r.t. sample size and O(ε^{-1/3}) convergence rate for one-way/two-way PAUCs. Tight generalization bound shows impact of TPR/FPR constraints with sharp order of Õ(α^{-1}n_+^{-1} + β^{-1}n_-^{-1}). Extensive experiments validate method strength.

Conclusion: The paper successfully closes the approximation gap in PAUC optimization through novel instance-wise minimax reformulations, providing both theoretical guarantees (convergence rates, generalization bounds) and practical efficiency validated by experiments.

Abstract: As a variant of the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC), the partial AUC (PAUC) focuses on a specific range of false positive rate (FPR) and/or true positive rate (TPR) in the ROC curve. It is a pivotal evaluation metric in real-world scenarios with both class imbalance and decision constraints. However, selecting instances within these constrained intervals during its calculation is NP-hard, and thus typically requires approximation techniques for practical resolution. Despite the progress made in PAUC optimization over the last few years, most existing methods still suffer from uncontrollable approximation errors or a limited scalability when optimizing the approximate PAUC objectives. In this paper, we close the approximation gap of PAUC optimization by presenting two simple instance-wise minimax reformulations: one with an asymptotically vanishing gap, the other with the unbiasedness at the cost of more variables. Our key idea is to first establish an equivalent instance-wise problem to lower the time complexity, simplify the complicated sample selection procedure by threshold learning, and then apply different smoothing techniques. Equipped with an efficient solver, the resulting algorithms enjoy a linear per-iteration computational complexity w.r.t. the sample size and a convergence rate of $O(ε^{-1/3})$ for typical one-way and two-way PAUCs. Moreover, we provide a tight generalization bound of our minimax reformulations. The result explicitly demonstrates the impact of the TPR/FPR constraints $α$/$β$ on the generalization and exhibits a sharp order of $\tilde{O}(α^{-1}\n_+^{-1} + β^{-1}\n_-^{-1})$. Finally, extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets validate the strength of our proposed methods.

TL;DR: M4-BLIP framework for multi-modal media manipulation detection that focuses on local facial features using BLIP-2 and integrates with LLMs for better interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current detection methods overlook localized information, especially in facial regions where manipulations frequently occur, threatening information reliability in digital media.

Method: Uses BLIP-2 model for local feature extraction, incorporates local facial information as prior knowledge, and employs alignment/fusion module to integrate local and global features. Integrates with LLMs for interpretability.

Result: Extensive experiments show M4-BLIP outperforms state-of-the-art competitors in both quantitative metrics and visualization results.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the limitation of overlooking localized information in media manipulation detection and enhances interpretability through LLM integration.

Abstract: In the contemporary digital landscape, multi-modal media manipulation has emerged as a significant societal threat, impacting the reliability and integrity of information dissemination. Current detection methodologies in this domain often overlook the crucial aspect of localized information, despite the fact that manipulations frequently occur in specific areas, particularly in facial regions. In response to this critical observation, we propose the M4-BLIP framework. This innovative framework utilizes the BLIP-2 model, renowned for its ability to extract local features, as the cornerstone for feature extraction. Complementing this, we incorporate local facial information as prior knowledge. A specially designed alignment and fusion module within M4-BLIP meticulously integrates these local and global features, creating a harmonious blend that enhances detection accuracy. Furthermore, our approach seamlessly integrates with Large Language Models (LLM), significantly improving the interpretability of the detection outcomes. Extensive quantitative and visualization experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework against the state-of-the-art competitors.

TL;DR: S²-MLLM enhances 3D visual grounding in MLLMs through implicit spatial reasoning, eliminating inefficient point cloud reconstruction while improving spatial understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs struggle with 3D spatial understanding from 2D inputs, and existing 3DVG methods rely on inefficient viewpoint-dependent point cloud rendering, limiting spatial reasoning capabilities.

Method: Proposes S²-MLLM with spatial guidance strategy using feed-forward 3D reconstruction awareness, and a structure-enhanced module with intra-view/inter-view attention plus multi-level position encoding for spatial understanding.

Result: Achieves superior performance, generalization, and efficiency across ScanRefer, Nr3D, and Sr3D datasets, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: S²-MLLM enables efficient implicit spatial reasoning in MLLMs for 3DVG without point cloud reconstruction, unifying performance, generalization, and efficiency.

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) focuses on locating objects in 3D scenes based on natural language descriptions, serving as a fundamental task for embodied AI and robotics. Recent advances in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have motivated research into extending them to 3DVG. However, MLLMs primarily process 2D visual inputs and struggle with understanding 3D spatial structure of scenes solely from these limited perspectives. Existing methods mainly utilize viewpoint-dependent rendering of reconstructed point clouds to provide explicit structural guidance for MLLMs in 3DVG tasks, leading to inefficiency and limited spatial reasoning. To address this issue, we propose S$^2$-MLLM, an efficient framework that enhances spatial reasoning in MLLMs through implicit spatial reasoning. We introduce a spatial guidance strategy that leverages the structure awareness of feed-forward 3D reconstruction. By acquiring 3D structural understanding during training, our model can implicitly reason about 3D scenes without relying on inefficient point cloud reconstruction. Moreover, we propose a structure-enhanced module (SE), which first employs intra-view and inter-view attention mechanisms to capture dependencies within views and correspondences across views. The module further integrates multi-level position encoding to associate visual representations with spatial positions and viewpoint information, enabling more accurate structural understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that S$^2$-MLLM unifies superior performance, generalization, and efficiency, achieving significant performance over existing methods across the ScanRefer, Nr3D, and Sr3D datasets. Code will be available upon acceptance.

Motivation: Existing personalized generation models work well for single subjects but degrade when extended to multiple subjects, failing to maintain subject consistency and adhere to textual prompts due to lack of high-quality multi-subject datasets and refined training strategies.

Method: 1) A scalable multi-subject data generation pipeline using single-subject models to create diverse training data; 2) Pairwise Subject-Consistency Rewards and general-purpose rewards incorporated into a refined reinforcement learning stage to enhance subject consistency and text controllability.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the approach's effectiveness in advancing multi-subject personalized image generation, with evaluation through a new benchmark covering seven subsets across three dimensions.

Conclusion: The proposed PSR method successfully addresses multi-subject personalization challenges through innovative data generation and reinforcement learning techniques, significantly improving subject consistency and text adherence in personalized image generation.

Abstract: Personalized generation models for a single subject have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness, highlighting their significant potential. However, when extended to multiple subjects, existing models often exhibit degraded performance, particularly in maintaining subject consistency and adhering to textual prompts. We attribute these limitations to the absence of high-quality multi-subject datasets and refined post-training strategies. To address these challenges, we propose a scalable multi-subject data generation pipeline that leverages powerful single-subject generation models to construct diverse and high-quality multi-subject training data. Through this dataset, we first enable single-subject personalization models to acquire knowledge of synthesizing multi-image and multi-subject scenarios. Furthermore, to enhance both subject consistency and text controllability, we design a set of Pairwise Subject-Consistency Rewards and general-purpose rewards, which are incorporated into a refined reinforcement learning stage. To comprehensively evaluate multi-subject personalization, we introduce a new benchmark that assesses model performance using seven subsets across three dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in advancing multi-subject personalized image generation. Github Link: https://github.com/wang-shulei/PSR

*Zirui Zhao,Boye Niu,David Hsu,Wee Sun Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A constraint-guided framework combining geometric reasoning with neural semantics for abstract visual composition, using AlphaGo-style search with vision-language model rewards and adversarial refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Abstract visual composition with geometric primitives is challenging due to combinatorial placement choices, limited data, discrete feasibility constraints (overlap-free, allowable orientations), and sparse solution manifolds that are ill-suited for purely statistical pixel-space generators.

Method: Constraint-guided framework combining explicit geometric reasoning with neural semantics. Uses AlphaGo-style search to enforce feasibility, with fine-tuned vision-language model scoring semantic alignment as reward. Policy network serves as heuristic in Monte-Carlo Tree Search, fine-tuned via search-generated plans. Includes adversarial reward refinement inspired by GANs, where generated instances are used to refine reward model.

Result: In the Tangram Assembly task, the approach yields higher validity and semantic fidelity than diffusion and auto-regressive baselines, especially as constraints tighten.

Conclusion: The proposed constraint-guided framework effectively addresses the challenges of abstract visual composition by integrating geometric reasoning with neural semantics, outperforming existing methods in constrained scenarios.

Abstract: We study abstract visual composition, in which identity is primarily determined by the spatial configuration and relations among a small set of geometric primitives (e.g., parts, symmetry, topology). They are invariant primarily to texture and photorealistic detail. Composing such structures from fixed components under geometric constraints and vague goal specification (such as text) is non-trivial due to combinatorial placement choices, limited data, and discrete feasibility (overlap-free, allowable orientations), which create a sparse solution manifold ill-suited to purely statistical pixel-space generators. We propose a constraint-guided framework that combines explicit geometric reasoning with neural semantics. An AlphaGo-style search enforces feasibility, while a fine-tuned vision-language model scores semantic alignment as reward signals. Our algorithm uses a policy network as a heuristic in Monte-Carlo Tree Search and fine-tunes the network via search-generated plans. Inspired by the Generative Adversarial Network, we use the generated instances for adversarial reward refinement. Over time, the generation should approach the actual data more closely when the reward model cannot distinguish between generated instances and ground-truth. In the Tangram Assembly task, our approach yields higher validity and semantic fidelity than diffusion and auto-regressive baselines, especially as constraints tighten.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TRivia is a self-supervised fine-tuning method for table recognition that uses unlabeled table images and question-answering rewards to train vision-language models without human annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current table recognition relies on supervised learning with labeled data, which is costly and limits open-source models. Proprietary models outperform open-source ones, but privacy regulations often require open-source solutions. There's a need to bridge this gap without expensive labeled data.

Method: TRivia uses Group Relative Policy Optimization to automatically identify effective unlabeled samples. It employs an attention-guided module to generate diverse questions for each table image, and uses question-answering correctness as reward feedback to optimize the table recognition model in a closed-loop self-supervised process.

Result: TRivia-3B, the resulting open-source model, surpasses existing systems (including Gemini 2.5 Pro and MinerU2.5) on three popular benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: TRivia enables effective table recognition without labeled data through self-supervised learning, bridging the performance gap between proprietary and open-source models while addressing privacy and cost concerns.

Abstract: Table recognition (TR) aims to transform table images into semi-structured representations such as HTML or Markdown. As a core component of document parsing, TR has long relied on supervised learning, with recent efforts dominated by fine-tuning vision-language models (VLMs) using labeled data. While VLMs have brought TR to the next level, pushing performance further demands large-scale labeled data that is costly to obtain. Consequently, although proprietary models have continuously pushed the performance boundary, open-source models, often trained with limited resources and, in practice, the only viable option for many due to privacy regulations, still lag far behind. To bridge this gap, we introduce TRivia, a self-supervised fine-tuning method that enables pretrained VLMs to learn TR directly from unlabeled table images in the wild. Built upon Group Relative Policy Optimization, TRivia automatically identifies unlabeled samples that most effectively facilitate learning and eliminates the need for human annotations through a question-answering-based reward mechanism. An attention-guided module generates diverse questions for each table image, and the ability to interpret the recognition results and answer them correctly provides feedback to optimize the TR model. This closed-loop process allows the TR model to autonomously learn to recognize, structure, and reason over tables without labeled data. Leveraging this pipeline, we present TRivia-3B, an open-sourced, compact, and state-of-the-art TR model that surpasses existing systems (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro, MinerU2.5) on three popular benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision-based viscometer uses optical distortion of background patterns through deforming liquid surfaces to measure viscosity without contact, achieving good accuracy with uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional viscometers are invasive and require controlled lab environments that don't match real process conditions, creating a need for non-contact, automation-ready viscosity measurement.

Method: Computer vision system analyzes how fixed background patterns become optically distorted as light refracts through mixing-driven, continuously deforming free surfaces of liquids. Uses multi-pattern strategy for robustness and incorporates uncertainty quantification.

Result: Achieves mean absolute error of 0.113 in log m² s⁻¹ units for regression and up to 81% accuracy in viscosity-class prediction. Performance declines for closely clustered viscosity values but multi-pattern strategy improves robustness.

Conclusion: The stand-off viscometer offers a practical, automation-ready alternative to existing viscometry methods by providing non-contact viscosity measurement with confidence estimates.

Abstract: Viscosity measurement is essential for process monitoring and autonomous laboratory operation, yet conventional viscometers remain invasive and require controlled laboratory environments that differ substantially from real process conditions. We present a computer-vision-based viscometer that infers viscosity by exploiting how a fixed background pattern becomes optically distorted as light refracts through the mixing-driven, continuously deforming free surface. Under diverse lighting conditions, the system achieves a mean absolute error of 0.113 in log m2 s^-1 units for regression and reaches up to 81% accuracy in viscosity-class prediction. Although performance declines for classes with closely clustered viscosity values, a multi-pattern strategy improves robustness by providing enriched visual cues. To ensure sensor reliability, we incorporate uncertainty quantification, enabling viscosity predictions with confidence estimates. This stand-off viscometer offers a practical, automation-ready alternative to existing viscometry methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: nnMobileNet++ is a hybrid CNN-transformer architecture for retinal image analysis that combines dynamic snake convolution for boundary-aware features, transformer blocks for global context, and retinal pretraining, achieving SOTA performance with low computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While lightweight CNNs like nnMobileNet perform well on retinal analysis, they struggle to capture long-range dependencies and model irregular lesions/elongated vascular patterns that are critical for clinical diagnosis. There's a need to enhance these architectures to better handle the specific characteristics of retinal images.

Method: nnMobileNet++ integrates three key components: 1) dynamic snake convolution for boundary-aware feature extraction, 2) stage-specific transformer blocks introduced after the second down-sampling stage for global context modeling, and 3) retinal image pretraining to improve generalization. This creates a hybrid CNN-transformer architecture.

Result: Experiments on multiple public retinal datasets for classification show that nnMobileNet++ achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive accuracy while maintaining low computational cost. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed components.

Conclusion: nnMobileNet++ demonstrates strong potential as a lightweight yet effective framework for retinal image analysis, successfully bridging convolutional and transformer representations to better handle the specific challenges of retinal imaging while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Retinal imaging is a critical, non-invasive modality for the early detection and monitoring of ocular and systemic diseases. Deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), has significant progress in automated retinal analysis, supporting tasks such as fundus image classification, lesion detection, and vessel segmentation. As a representative lightweight network, nnMobileNet has demonstrated strong performance across multiple retinal benchmarks while remaining computationally efficient. However, purely convolutional architectures inherently struggle to capture long-range dependencies and model the irregular lesions and elongated vascular patterns that characterize on retinal images, despite the critical importance of vascular features for reliable clinical diagnosis. To further advance this line of work and extend the original vision of nnMobileNet, we propose nnMobileNet++, a hybrid architecture that progressively bridges convolutional and transformer representations. The framework integrates three key components: (i) dynamic snake convolution for boundary-aware feature extraction, (ii) stage-specific transformer blocks introduced after the second down-sampling stage for global context modeling, and (iii) retinal image pretraining to improve generalization. Experiments on multiple public retinal datasets for classification, together with ablation studies, demonstrate that nnMobileNet++ achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive accuracy while maintaining low computational cost, underscoring its potential as a lightweight yet effective framework for retinal image analysis.

Motivation: Existing AI models for sonar image analysis over-rely on seafloor features, leading to poor generalization despite available datasets. Need to mitigate background bias while maintaining interpretability.

Method: Two-module framework: 1) Targeted Contrastive Unlearning (TCU) extends triplet loss to reduce seafloor-induced background bias, 2) Unlearn to Explain Sonar Framework (UESF) provides visual insights into what the model has forgotten and adapts LIME explainer for faithful attributions.

Result: Extensive experiments on real and synthetic sonar datasets show significant improvements in unlearning effectiveness, model robustness, and interpretability.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses seafloor bias in sonar image analysis, enhancing generalization capabilities while providing interpretable insights into the unlearning process.

Abstract: Acoustic sonar image analysis plays a critical role in object detection and classification, with applications in both civilian and defense domains. Despite the availability of real and synthetic datasets, existing AI models that achieve high accuracy often over-rely on seafloor features, leading to poor generalization. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel framework that integrates two key modules: (i) a Targeted Contrastive Unlearning (TCU) module, which extends the traditional triplet loss to reduce seafloor-induced background bias and improve generalization, and (ii) the Unlearn to Explain Sonar Framework (UESF), which provides visual insights into what the model has deliberately forgotten while adapting the LIME explainer to generate more faithful and localized attributions for unlearning evaluation. Extensive experiments across both real and synthetic sonar datasets validate our approach, demonstrating significant improvements in unlearning effectiveness, model robustness, and interpretability.

*Huynh Trinh Ngoc,Toan Nguyen Hai,Ba Luong Son,Long Tran Quoc*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedSegLatDiff is a diffusion-based framework combining VAE with latent diffusion for efficient medical image segmentation that generates multiple plausible masks with confidence maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional medical image segmentation produces single masks without capturing uncertainty, while recent generative models are computationally heavy. There's a need for efficient methods that can generate diverse segmentation hypotheses like multiple clinicians would.

Method: Combines VAE with latent diffusion model: VAE compresses input into low-dimensional latent space to reduce noise and accelerate training, diffusion operates in this compact space, uses weighted cross-entropy loss instead of MSE in VAE mask reconstruction to preserve tiny structures.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive Dice and IoU scores on ISIC-2018 (skin lesions), CVC-Clinic (polyps), and LIDC-IDRI (lung nodules), while generating diverse segmentation hypotheses and confidence maps.

Conclusion: MedSegLatDiff provides enhanced interpretability and reliability compared to deterministic baselines, making it particularly suitable for clinical deployment by capturing uncertainty and generating multiple plausible segmentations.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. Traditional methods typically produce a single segmentation mask, failing to capture inherent uncertainty. Recent generative models enable the creation of multiple plausible masks per image, mimicking the collaborative interpretation of several clinicians. However, these approaches remain computationally heavy. We propose MedSegLatDiff, a diffusion based framework that combines a variational autoencoder (VAE) with a latent diffusion model for efficient medical image segmentation. The VAE compresses the input into a low dimensional latent space, reducing noise and accelerating training, while the diffusion process operates directly in this compact representation. We further replace the conventional MSE loss with weighted cross entropy in the VAE mask reconstruction path to better preserve tiny structures such as small nodules. MedSegLatDiff is evaluated on ISIC-2018 (skin lesions), CVC-Clinic (polyps), and LIDC-IDRI (lung nodules). It achieves state of the art or highly competitive Dice and IoU scores while simultaneously generating diverse segmentation hypotheses and confidence maps. This provides enhanced interpretability and reliability compared to deterministic baselines, making the model particularly suitable for clinical deployment.

Conclusion: EGG-Fusion establishes itself as one of the most accurate differentiable-rendering-based real-time reconstruction systems, successfully addressing the dual challenges of real-time performance and sensor noise sensitivity while achieving high-precision surface reconstruction.

Abstract: Real-time 3D reconstruction is a fundamental task in computer graphics. Recently, differentiable-rendering-based SLAM system has demonstrated significant potential, enabling photorealistic scene rendering through learnable scene representations such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Current differentiable rendering methods face dual challenges in real-time computation and sensor noise sensitivity, leading to degraded geometric fidelity in scene reconstruction and limited practicality. To address these challenges, we propose a novel real-time system EGG-Fusion, featuring robust sparse-to-dense camera tracking and a geometry-aware Gaussian surfel mapping module, introducing an information filter-based fusion method that explicitly accounts for sensor noise to achieve high-precision surface reconstruction. The proposed differentiable Gaussian surfel mapping effectively models multi-view consistent surfaces while enabling efficient parameter optimization. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves a surface reconstruction error of 0.6\textit{cm} on standardized benchmark datasets including Replica and ScanNet++, representing over 20\% improvement in accuracy compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) GS-based methods. Notably, the system maintains real-time processing capabilities at 24 FPS, establishing it as one of the most accurate differentiable-rendering-based real-time reconstruction systems.

TL;DR: TBT-Former improves temporal action localization by enhancing ActionFormer with a scaled Transformer backbone, cross-scale FPN, and boundary distribution regression head to handle fuzzy boundaries and multi-scale context fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing single-stage anchor-free models like ActionFormer struggle with precise localization of actions with ambiguous temporal boundaries and effective fusion of multi-scale contextual information.

Method: Three core components: 1) Scaled Transformer backbone with more attention heads and expanded MLP dimension, 2) Cross-scale FPN with top-down pathway and lateral connections, 3) Novel boundary distribution regression head inspired by Generalized Focal Loss principles.

Result: Establishes new state-of-the-art performance on THUMOS14 and EPIC-Kitchens 100 datasets, while remaining competitive on ActivityNet-1.3.

Conclusion: TBT-Former advances Transformer-based architectures for temporal action localization by addressing boundary uncertainty and multi-scale feature fusion, setting a new benchmark in the field.

Abstract: Temporal Action Localization (TAL) remains a fundamental challenge in video understanding, aiming to identify the start time, end time, and category of all action instances within untrimmed videos. While recent single-stage, anchor-free models like ActionFormer have set a high standard by leveraging Transformers for temporal reasoning, they often struggle with two persistent issues: the precise localization of actions with ambiguous or "fuzzy" temporal boundaries and the effective fusion of multi-scale contextual information. In this paper, we introduce the Temporal Boundary Transformer (TBT-Former), a new architecture that directly addresses these limitations. TBT-Former enhances the strong ActionFormer baseline with three core contributions: (1) a higher-capacity scaled Transformer backbone with an increased number of attention heads and an expanded Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) dimension for more powerful temporal feature extraction; (2) a cross-scale feature pyramid network (FPN) that integrates a top-down pathway with lateral connections, enabling richer fusion of high-level semantics and low-level temporal details; and (3) a novel boundary distribution regression head. Inspired by the principles of Generalized Focal Loss (GFL), this new head recasts the challenging task of boundary regression as a more flexible probability distribution learning problem, allowing the model to explicitly represent and reason about boundary uncertainty. Within the paradigm of Transformer-based architectures, TBT-Former advances the formidable benchmark set by its predecessors, establishing a new level of performance on the highly competitive THUMOS14 and EPIC-Kitchens 100 datasets, while remaining competitive on the large-scale ActivityNet-1.3.

TL;DR: DCText is a training-free method that improves text rendering in text-to-image models using a divide-and-conquer approach with attention masks and localized noise initialization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models struggle with rendering long or multiple texts due to diluted global attention, leading to poor text accuracy in complex text prompts.

Method: Uses divide-and-conquer strategy: 1) decomposes prompts by extracting/dividing target text, 2) assigns each segment to designated regions, 3) applies Text-Focus and Context-Expansion attention masks sequentially during denoising, 4) uses Localized Noise Initialization for improved accuracy.

Result: Achieves best text accuracy on single- and multi-sentence benchmarks without compromising image quality, while also delivering the lowest generation latency.

Conclusion: DCText provides an effective training-free solution for accurate visual text generation in complex scenarios through strategic attention control and region-based processing.

Abstract: Despite recent text-to-image models achieving highfidelity text rendering, they still struggle with long or multiple texts due to diluted global attention. We propose DCText, a training-free visual text generation method that adopts a divide-and-conquer strategy, leveraging the reliable short-text generation of Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers. Our method first decomposes a prompt by extracting and dividing the target text, then assigns each to a designated region. To accurately render each segment within their regions while preserving overall image coherence, we introduce two attention masks - Text-Focus and Context-Expansion - applied sequentially during denoising. Additionally, Localized Noise Initialization further improves text accuracy and region alignment without increasing computational cost. Extensive experiments on single- and multisentence benchmarks show that DCText achieves the best text accuracy without compromising image quality while also delivering the lowest generation latency.

Method: Uses 3D Gaussians to model surfaces continuously as Gaussian patches, enabling efficient aerodynamic interaction. Unifies simulation and rendering on the same representation where Gaussian patches support force computation for dynamics while providing normals for shading.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance and efficiency on both synthetic and real-world datasets across multiple metrics, offering a scalable approach for realistic aerodynamic scene simulation.

Conclusion: Gaussian Swaying provides an effective framework for aerodynamic simulation that combines computational efficiency with realistic results, overcoming limitations of traditional mesh-based and particle-based methods.

Abstract: Branches swaying in the breeze, flags rippling in the wind, and boats rocking on the water all show how aerodynamics shape natural motion -- an effect crucial for realism in vision and graphics. In this paper, we present Gaussian Swaying, a surface-based framework for aerodynamic simulation using 3D Gaussians. Unlike mesh-based methods that require costly meshing, or particle-based approaches that rely on discrete positional data, Gaussian Swaying models surfaces continuously with 3D Gaussians, enabling efficient and fine-grained aerodynamic interaction. Our framework unifies simulation and rendering on the same representation: Gaussian patches, which support force computation for dynamics while simultaneously providing normals for lightweight shading. Comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets across multiple metrics demonstrate that Gaussian Swaying achieves state-of-the-art performance and efficiency, offering a scalable approach for realistic aerodynamic scene simulation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale brain imaging datasets have high heterogeneity in quality, ranging from well-structured scans to severely distorted/incomplete volumes. Unlike natural images in computer vision, it's unclear whether low-quality neuroimaging data can meaningfully contribute to pretraining or instead hinder model learning.

Method: Systematically pretrained models on datasets with different quality levels, then fine-tuned for brain age prediction on external cohorts to evaluate the impact of data quality on downstream task performance.

Result: Found significant performance differences across quality levels, revealing both opportunities and limitations in using heterogeneous quality data for pretraining.

Conclusion: There's a gap between computer vision practices and clinical neuroimaging standards, emphasizing the necessity of domain-aware curation to ensure trusted and generalizable domain-specific foundation models.

Abstract: Large-scale brain imaging datasets provide unprecedented opportunities for developing domain foundation models through pretraining. However, unlike natural image datasets in computer vision, these neuroimaging data often exhibit high heterogeneity in quality, ranging from well-structured scans to severely distorted or incomplete brain volumes. This raises a fundamental question: can noise or low-quality scans contribute meaningfully to pretraining, or do they instead hinder model learning? In this study, we systematically explore the role of data quality level in pretraining and its impact on downstream tasks. Specifically, we perform pretraining on datasets with different quality levels and perform fine-tuning for brain age prediction on external cohorts. Our results show significant performance differences across quality levels, revealing both opportunities and limitations. We further discuss the gap between computer vision practices and clinical neuroimaging standards, emphasizing the necessity of domain-aware curation to ensure trusted and generalizable domain-specific foundation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video retrieval systems lack meaningful interaction with users and follow a one-way paradigm, failing to meet personalization needs of most users (80.8%).

Method: Introduces IVCR task for multi-turn conversational retrieval, creates IVCR-200K bilingual dataset, and proposes a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) framework supporting multiple interaction modes.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed dataset and framework for interactive video retrieval.

Conclusion: IVCR represents a more realistic retrieval setting that enables conversational interaction between users and systems, addressing limitations of traditional one-way retrieval approaches.

Abstract: In recent years, significant developments have been made in both video retrieval and video moment retrieval tasks, which respectively retrieve complete videos or moments for a given text query. These advancements have greatly improved user satisfaction during the search process. However, previous work has failed to establish meaningful "interaction" between the retrieval system and the user, and its one-way retrieval paradigm can no longer fully meet the personalization and dynamic needs of at least 80.8\% of users. In this paper, we introduce the Interactive Video Corpus Retrieval (IVCR) task, a more realistic setting that enables multi-turn, conversational, and realistic interactions between the user and the retrieval system. To facilitate research on this challenging task, we introduce IVCR-200K, a high-quality, bilingual, multi-turn, conversational, and abstract semantic dataset that supports video retrieval and even moment retrieval. Furthermore, we propose a comprehensive framework based on multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to help users interact in several modes with more explainable solutions. The extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our dataset and framework.

TL;DR: TokenPure is a Diffusion Transformer framework that removes watermarks while preserving image quality by using token-based conditional reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Digital watermarking is crucial for ownership proof of replicable content (AI-generated/virtual assets), but robust watermark removal is needed to handle various attacks and processing operations while maintaining content consistency.

Method: TokenPure reframes watermark removal as conditional generation using token-based conditional reconstruction. It decomposes watermarked images into two complementary token sets: visual tokens (texture) and structural tokens (geometry), which jointly condition the diffusion process to synthesize watermark-free images while preserving fine-grained consistency and structural integrity.

Result: Comprehensive experiments show TokenPure achieves state-of-the-art watermark removal and reconstruction fidelity, substantially outperforming existing baselines in both perceptual quality and consistency.

Conclusion: TokenPure effectively solves the trade-off between thorough watermark destruction and content consistency through its novel token-based conditional reconstruction approach, making it a powerful solution for watermark removal in the digital economy era.

Abstract: In the digital economy era, digital watermarking serves as a critical basis for ownership proof of massive replicable content, including AI-generated and other virtual assets. Designing robust watermarks capable of withstanding various attacks and processing operations is even more paramount. We introduce TokenPure, a novel Diffusion Transformer-based framework designed for effective and consistent watermark removal. TokenPure solves the trade-off between thorough watermark destruction and content consistency by leveraging token-based conditional reconstruction. It reframes the task as conditional generation, entirely bypassing the initial watermark-carrying noise. We achieve this by decomposing the watermarked image into two complementary token sets: visual tokens for texture and structural tokens for geometry. These tokens jointly condition the diffusion process, enabling the framework to synthesize watermark-free images with fine-grained consistency and structural integrity. Comprehensive experiments show that TokenPure achieves state-of-the-art watermark removal and reconstruction fidelity, substantially outperforming existing baselines in both perceptual quality and consistency.

Motivation: Foreign Object Debris in aircraft fuel tanks poses serious safety risks, but there's a lack of dedicated datasets for these complex, enclosed environments. Existing datasets focus on external or open-air settings, not confined fuel tank structures.

Method: Created FOD-S2R dataset with 3,114 real HD images from controlled fuel tank replica and 3,137 synthetic images generated using Unreal Engine. Dataset includes varied FOVs, object distances, lighting conditions, colors, and object sizes. Benchmarked state-of-the-art object detection models to evaluate synthetic data effectiveness.

Conclusion: FOD-S2R provides valuable foundation for automated FOD detection systems in aviation maintenance, demonstrating synthetic data's effectiveness in enhancing real-world detection performance in complex enclosed environments like aircraft fuel tanks.

Abstract: Foreign Object Debris (FOD) within aircraft fuel tanks presents critical safety hazards including fuel contamination, system malfunctions, and increased maintenance costs. Despite the severity of these risks, there is a notable lack of dedicated datasets for the complex, enclosed environments found inside fuel tanks. To bridge this gap, we present a novel dataset, FOD-S2R, composed of real and synthetic images of the FOD within a simulated aircraft fuel tank. Unlike existing datasets that focus on external or open-air environments, our dataset is the first to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of synthetic data in enhancing the real-world FOD detection performance in confined, closed structures. The real-world subset consists of 3,114 high-resolution HD images captured in a controlled fuel tank replica, while the synthetic subset includes 3,137 images generated using Unreal Engine. The dataset is composed of various Field of views (FOV), object distances, lighting conditions, color, and object size. Prior research has demonstrated that synthetic data can reduce reliance on extensive real-world annotations and improve the generalizability of vision models. Thus, we benchmark several state-of-the-art object detection models and demonstrate that introducing synthetic data improves the detection accuracy and generalization to real-world conditions. These experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of synthetic data in enhancing the model performance and narrowing the Sim2Real gap, providing a valuable foundation for developing automated FOD detection systems for aviation maintenance.

Motivation: Current segmentation methods focus on image-based metrics but neglect practical effectiveness in subsequent computational fluid dynamics (CFD) applications for hemodynamic analysis of intracranial aneurysms and vessels.

Method: Created the IAVS dataset with image-mask pairs and hemodynamic analysis outcomes. Developed a two-stage evaluation framework (global aneurysm localization and fine-grained IA-Vessel segmentation) with a simple two-stage baseline method. Established a standardized CFD applicability evaluation system for automated conversion of segmentation masks to CFD models.

The framework and evaluation system enable clinically relevant technique development.

Conclusion: The IAVS dataset, evaluation benchmarks, and CFD applicability evaluation system provide a comprehensive resource for developing and assessing segmentation methods that are clinically relevant for hemodynamic analysis, bridging the gap between image-based metrics and practical CFD applications.

Abstract: The precise segmentation of intracranial aneurysms and their parent vessels (IA-Vessel) is a critical step for hemodynamic analyses, which mainly depends on computational fluid dynamics (CFD). However, current segmentation methods predominantly focus on image-based evaluation metrics, often neglecting their practical effectiveness in subsequent CFD applications. To address this deficiency, we present the Intracranial Aneurysm Vessel Segmentation (IAVS) dataset, the first comprehensive, multi-center collection comprising 641 3D MRA images with 587 annotations of aneurysms and IA-Vessels. In addition to image-mask pairs, IAVS dataset includes detailed hemodynamic analysis outcomes, addressing the limitations of existing datasets that neglect topological integrity and CFD applicability. To facilitate the development and evaluation of clinically relevant techniques, we construct two evaluation benchmarks including global localization of aneurysms (Stage I) and fine-grained segmentation of IA-Vessel (Stage II) and develop a simple and effective two-stage framework, which can be used as a out-of-the-box method and strong baseline. For comprehensive evaluation of applicability of segmentation results, we establish a standardized CFD applicability evaluation system that enables the automated and consistent conversion of segmentation masks into CFD models, offering an applicability-focused assessment of segmentation outcomes. The dataset, code, and model will be public available at https://github.com/AbsoluteResonance/IAVS.

*A S M Ahsanul Sarkar Akib,Raduana Khawla,Abdul Hasib*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents an interpretable machine learning framework using ensemble modeling and explainable AI (XAI) for stroke risk prediction, achieving 99.09% accuracy on the Stroke Prediction Dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stroke is a major global health concern causing death and permanent impairment. Early risk assessment is crucial for prompt intervention and effective preventive strategies, but there's a need for both accurate and interpretable prediction models that clinicians can trust and use in practice.

Method: The researchers developed an interpretable ML framework using ensemble modeling and XAI techniques. They conducted comprehensive evaluation of 10 different ML models with 5-fold cross-validation, performed feature engineering and data preprocessing (including Random Over-Sampling to address class imbalance), and created an optimized ensemble model combining Random Forest, ExtraTrees, and XGBoost. They used LIME-based interpretability analysis to identify key clinical variables.

Result: The optimized ensemble model achieved exceptional performance with 99.09% accuracy on the Stroke Prediction Dataset (SPD). Through LIME-based interpretability analysis, three important clinical variables were identified: age, hypertension, and glucose levels, making the model transparent and clinically applicable.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that combining ensemble learning with explainable AI can provide highly accurate and interpretable stroke risk assessment. The framework has potential to transform stroke prediction and cardiovascular risk management by enabling data-driven prevention and personalized clinical decisions through early prediction.

Abstract: Stroke is a major cause of death and permanent impairment, making it a major worldwide health concern. For prompt intervention and successful preventative tactics, early risk assessment is essential. To address this challenge, we used ensemble modeling and explainable AI (XAI) techniques to create an interpretable machine learning framework for stroke risk prediction. A thorough evaluation of 10 different machine learning models using 5-fold cross-validation across several datasets was part of our all-inclusive strategy, which also included feature engineering and data pretreatment (using Random Over-Sampling (ROS) to solve class imbalance). Our optimized ensemble model (Random Forest + ExtraTrees + XGBoost) performed exceptionally well, obtaining a strong 99.09% accuracy on the Stroke Prediction Dataset (SPD). We improved the model's transparency and clinical applicability by identifying three important clinical variables using LIME-based interpretability analysis: age, hypertension, and glucose levels. Through early prediction, this study highlights how combining ensemble learning with explainable AI (XAI) can deliver highly accurate and interpretable stroke risk assessment. By enabling data-driven prevention and personalized clinical decisions, our framework has the potential to transform stroke prediction and cardiovascular risk management.

### [160] [AlignVid: Training-Free Attention Scaling for Semantic Fidelity in Text-Guided Image-to-Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01334)
*Yexin Liu,Wen-Jie Shu,Zile Huang,Haoze Zheng,Yueze Wang,Manyuan Zhang,Ser-Nam Lim,Harry Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AlignVid is a training-free framework that improves semantic adherence in text-guided image-to-video generation by using attention scaling modulation and guidance scheduling to reduce semantic negligence when prompts require substantial image transformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TI2V methods struggle with semantic negligence - they fail to properly adhere to fine-grained prompt semantics when prompts require substantial transformations of input images (object addition, deletion, or modification). A pilot study showed that Gaussian blur improves semantic adherence by creating clearer foreground-background separation and lower-entropy cross-attention distributions.

Method: AlignVid consists of two components: 1) Attention Scaling Modulation (ASM) - directly reweights attention via lightweight Q or K scaling, and 2) Guidance Scheduling (GS) - applies ASM selectively across transformer blocks and denoising steps to reduce visual quality degradation. The framework also introduces OmitI2V, a new evaluation dataset with 367 human-annotated samples spanning addition, deletion, and modification scenarios.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that AlignVid can enhance semantic fidelity in TI2V generation while limiting aesthetic degradation. The method improves adherence to prompt semantics when substantial image transformations are required.

Conclusion: AlignVid provides a training-free solution to address semantic negligence in TI2V generation through minimal intervention in attention mechanisms, offering improved prompt adherence while maintaining visual quality. The OmitI2V dataset enables better evaluation of semantic negligence in TI2V systems.

Abstract: Text-guided image-to-video (TI2V) generation has recently achieved remarkable progress, particularly in maintaining subject consistency and temporal coherence. However, existing methods still struggle to adhere to fine-grained prompt semantics, especially when prompts entail substantial transformations of the input image (e.g., object addition, deletion, or modification), a shortcoming we term semantic negligence. In a pilot study, we find that applying a Gaussian blur to the input image improves semantic adherence. Analyzing attention maps, we observe clearer foreground-background separation. From an energy perspective, this corresponds to a lower-entropy cross-attention distribution. Motivated by this, we introduce AlignVid, a training-free framework with two components: (i) Attention Scaling Modulation (ASM), which directly reweights attention via lightweight Q or K scaling, and (ii) Guidance Scheduling (GS), which applies ASM selectively across transformer blocks and denoising steps to reduce visual quality degradation. This minimal intervention improves prompt adherence while limiting aesthetic degradation. In addition, we introduce OmitI2V to evaluate semantic negligence in TI2V generation, comprising 367 human-annotated samples that span addition, deletion, and modification scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AlignVid can enhance semantic fidelity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces THQA-MT, the first large-scale dataset for Multi-Talker-generated Talking Human quality assessment, and proposes EvalTalker, a novel framework for evaluating the quality of multiple talking human animations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Multi-Talker systems (animating multiple subjects simultaneously) suffer from noticeable quality degradation due to technical limitations, leading to suboptimal user experiences. There's a need for better quality assessment methods to advance multi-subject talking human generation.

Method: 1) Constructed THQA-MT dataset with 5,492 Multi-Talker-generated THs from 15 representative Multi-Talkers using 400 real portraits. 2) Conducted subjective experiments to analyze perceptual discrepancies and identify 12 common distortion types. 3) Developed EvalTalker framework that perceives global quality, human characteristics, identity consistency, and integrates Qwen-Sync for multimodal synchrony perception.

Result: EvalTalker achieves superior correlation with subjective scores compared to existing methods, providing a robust foundation for evaluating Multi-Talker quality. The dataset and framework enable better assessment of multi-subject talking human animations.

Conclusion: The proposed THQA-MT dataset and EvalTalker framework address the quality assessment challenge in Multi-Talker generation, offering valuable tools for future research on high-quality multi-subject talking human animation and evaluation.

Abstract: Speech-driven Talking Human (TH) generation, commonly known as "Talker," currently faces limitations in multi-subject driving capabilities. Extending this paradigm to "Multi-Talker," capable of animating multiple subjects simultaneously, introduces richer interactivity and stronger immersion in audiovisual communication. However, current Multi-Talkers still exhibit noticeable quality degradation caused by technical limitations, resulting in suboptimal user experiences. To address this challenge, we construct THQA-MT, the first large-scale Multi-Talker-generated Talking Human Quality Assessment dataset, consisting of 5,492 Multi-Talker-generated THs (MTHs) from 15 representative Multi-Talkers using 400 real portraits collected online. Through subjective experiments, we analyze perceptual discrepancies among different Multi-Talkers and identify 12 common types of distortion. Furthermore, we introduce EvalTalker, a novel TH quality assessment framework. This framework possesses the ability to perceive global quality, human characteristics, and identity consistency, while integrating Qwen-Sync to perceive multimodal synchrony. Experimental results demonstrate that EvalTalker achieves superior correlation with subjective scores, providing a robust foundation for future research on high-quality Multi-Talker generation and evaluation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InternVideo-Next introduces a two-stage pretraining framework with Encoder-Predictor-Decoder architecture to bridge the gap between text-supervised methods and masked video modeling by creating semantically consistent latent spaces while preserving visual details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video-text pretraining relies on noisy synthetic captions with limited semantic coverage, while masked video modeling struggles with convergence and semantic abstraction. There's a need to combine the strengths of both approaches for better video representation learning.

Method: Proposes Encoder-Predictor-Decoder framework with two-stage pretraining: Stage 1 uses conditional diffusion decoder with image-level semantic priors to enhance semantics and convergence; Stage 2 learns world knowledge by predicting frozen Stage 1 targets to mitigate shortcut learning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results across benchmarks when trained on public, unlabeled videos, demonstrating superior video representation learning capabilities.

Conclusion: InternVideo-Next provides a scalable path toward general video representation learning by effectively bridging pixel-level fidelity with high-level semantic abstraction through a novel two-stage pretraining approach.

Abstract: Large-scale video-text pretraining achieves strong performance but depends on noisy, synthetic captions with limited semantic coverage, often overlooking implicit world knowledge such as object motion, 3D geometry, and physical cues. In contrast, masked video modeling (MVM) directly exploits spatiotemporal structures but trails text-supervised methods on general tasks. We find this gap arises from overlooked architectural issues: pixel-level reconstruction struggles with convergence and its low-level requirement often conflicts with semantics, while latent prediction often encourages shortcut learning. To address these, we disentangle the traditional encoder-decoder design into an Encoder-Predictor-Decoder (EPD) framework, where the predictor acts as a latent world model, and propose InternVideo-Next, a two-stage pretraining scheme that builds a semantically consistent yet detail-preserving latent space for this world model. First, conventional linear decoder in pixel MVM enforces the predictor output latent to be linearly projected to, thus separable in pixel space, causing the conflict with semantic abstraction. Our Stage 1 proposes a conditional diffusion decoder and injects reliable image-level semantic priors to enhance semantics and convergence, thus bridging pixel-level fidelity with high-level semantic abstraction. Stage 2 further learns world knowledge by predicting frozen Stage 1 targets within this space, mitigating shortcut learning. Trained on public, unlabeled videos, InternVideo-Next achieves state-of-the-art results across benchmarks and provides a scalable path toward general video representation learning.

TL;DR: BharatOCR: A segmentation-free paragraph-level handwritten text recognition system for Hindi and Urdu using ViT-Transformer Decoder-LM architecture with implicit line segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Paragraph-level handwritten text recognition remains challenging for low-resource languages like Hindi and Urdu that lack comprehensive linguistic resources, requiring robust OCR systems for these scripts.

Method: Proposes a ViT-Transformer Decoder-LM architecture: Vision Transformer (ViT/DeiT) extracts visual features, Transformer decoder generates text sequences, and pre-trained RoBERTa language model refines output. Uses implicit line segmentation to process paragraphs line by line without explicit segmentation.

Result: Achieved benchmark results: 96.24% character recognition rate on NUST-UHWR, 92.05% on PUCIT-OUHL, 94.80% on Parimal-Urdu, and 80.64% on Hindi dataset. Outperformed several state-of-the-art Urdu text recognition methods.

Conclusion: BharatOCR demonstrates effective segmentation-free paragraph-level handwritten text recognition for Hindi and Urdu using a combined vision-language architecture with implicit line segmentation, achieving superior performance on multiple datasets.

Abstract: Despite considerable progress in handwritten text recognition, paragraph-level handwritten text recognition, especially in low-resource languages, such as Hindi, Urdu and similar scripts, remains a challenging problem. These languages, often lacking comprehensive linguistic resources, require special attention to develop robust systems for accurate optical character recognition (OCR). This paper introduces BharatOCR, a novel segmentation-free paragraph-level handwritten Hindi and Urdu text recognition. We propose a ViT-Transformer Decoder-LM architecture for handwritten text recognition, where a Vision Transformer (ViT) extracts visual features, a Transformer decoder generates text sequences, and a pre-trained language model (LM) refines the output to improve accuracy, fluency, and coherence. Our model utilizes a Data-efficient Image Transformer (DeiT) model proposed for masked image modeling in this research work. In addition, we adopt a RoBERTa architecture optimized for masked language modeling (MLM) to enhance the linguistic comprehension and generative capabilities of the proposed model. The transformer decoder generates text sequences from visual embeddings. This model is designed to iteratively process a paragraph image line by line, called implicit line segmentation. The proposed model was evaluated using our custom dataset ('Parimal Urdu') and ('Parimal Hindi'), introduced in this research work, as well as two public datasets. The proposed model achieved benchmark results in the NUST-UHWR, PUCIT-OUHL, and Parimal-Urdu datasets, achieving character recognition rates of 96.24%, 92.05%, and 94.80%, respectively. The model also provided benchmark results using the Hindi dataset achieving a character recognition rate of 80.64%. The results obtained from our proposed model indicated that it outperformed several state-of-the-art Urdu text recognition methods.

TL;DR: OpenBox: A two-stage automatic annotation pipeline using 2D vision foundation models for unsupervised open-vocabulary 3D object detection, eliminating need for self-training iterations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unsupervised 3D object detection methods have limitations: uniform bounding box annotation ignores object physical states, require multiple self-training iterations leading to suboptimal quality and high computational cost, and need to reduce annotation costs while recognizing unseen objects for autonomous driving safety and scalability.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: 1) Cross-modal instance alignment associates 2D image instance cues from vision foundation models with 3D point clouds; 2) Categorizes instances by rigidity and motion state, then generates adaptive bounding boxes using class-specific size statistics.

Result: Demonstrates improved accuracy and efficiency over baselines on Waymo Open Dataset, Lyft Level 5 Perception dataset, and nuScenes dataset. Produces high-quality 3D bounding box annotations without requiring self-training.

Conclusion: OpenBox provides an effective solution for unsupervised open-vocabulary 3D object detection that addresses limitations of existing methods by leveraging 2D vision foundation models and adaptive annotation strategies, achieving better performance with reduced computational overhead.

Abstract: Unsupervised and open-vocabulary 3D object detection has recently gained attention, particularly in autonomous driving, where reducing annotation costs and recognizing unseen objects are critical for both safety and scalability. However, most existing approaches uniformly annotate 3D bounding boxes, ignore objects' physical states, and require multiple self-training iterations for annotation refinement, resulting in suboptimal quality and substantial computational overhead. To address these challenges, we propose OpenBox, a two-stage automatic annotation pipeline that leverages a 2D vision foundation model. In the first stage, OpenBox associates instance-level cues from 2D images processed by a vision foundation model with the corresponding 3D point clouds via cross-modal instance alignment. In the second stage, it categorizes instances by rigidity and motion state, then generates adaptive bounding boxes with class-specific size statistics. As a result, OpenBox produces high-quality 3D bounding box annotations without requiring self-training. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset, the Lyft Level 5 Perception dataset, and the nuScenes dataset demonstrate improved accuracy and efficiency over baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Failing to be aware of speeding vehicles approaching from behind poses a huge threat to road safety for pedestrians and cyclists, creating a need for reliable hazard detection systems.

Method: Uses a single earbud and paired phone with a novel 3D object tracking algorithm combining Kalman filter trajectory estimation and reinforcement learning-based optimal image sampling. Corrects for user head movements using estimated pitch/yaw angles to align coordinate systems.

Result: System achieves ultra-low power consumption (29.8 mW on earbud, 702.6 mW on smartphone) with low false positive ratio (4.90%) and false negative ratio (1.47%) in real-world experiments.

Conclusion: BlinkBud provides an effective, lightweight solution for detecting approaching hazards from behind, significantly enhancing road safety for vulnerable road users with minimal power requirements.

Abstract: Failing to be aware of speeding vehicles approaching from behind poses a huge threat to the road safety of pedestrians and cyclists. In this paper, we propose BlinkBud, which utilizes a single earbud and a paired phone to online detect hazardous objects approaching from behind of a user. The core idea is to accurately track visually identified objects utilizing a small number of sampled camera images taken from the earbud. To minimize the power consumption of the earbud and the phone while guaranteeing the best tracking accuracy, a novel 3D object tracking algorithm is devised, integrating both a Kalman filter based trajectory estimation scheme and an optimal image sampling strategy based on reinforcement learning. Moreover, the impact of constant user head movements on the tracking accuracy is significantly eliminated by leveraging the estimated pitch and yaw angles to correct the object depth estimation and align the camera coordinate system to the user's body coordinate system, respectively. We implement a prototype BlinkBud system and conduct extensive real-world experiments. Results show that BlinkBud is lightweight with ultra-low mean power consumptions of 29.8 mW and 702.6 mW on the earbud and smartphone, respectively, and can accurately detect hazards with a low average false positive ratio (FPR) and false negative ratio (FNR) of 4.90% and 1.47%, respectively.

*Sheng Liu,Tianyu Luan,Phani Nuney,Xuelu Feng,Junsong Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Shape-Realism Alignment Metric (SRAM) using LLMs to evaluate 3D shape realism without ground truth, with new RealismGrading dataset and validation showing strong correlation with human perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3D shape evaluation requires ground truth references, but realism assessment often doesn't need ground truth. There's a need for metrics that evaluate shape realism based on human perception without requiring reference shapes.

Method: 1) Use mesh encoding to convert 3D shapes into language token space; 2) Leverage LLM as bridge between shape information and realism evaluation; 3) Design dedicated realism decoder to align LLM output with human perception; 4) Create RealismGrading dataset with human-annotated realism scores for shapes from 16 algorithms across dozen+ objects; 5) Validate using k-fold cross-validation across different objects.

Result: The proposed metric correlates well with human perceptions, outperforms existing methods, and demonstrates good generalizability across different objects and shape generation algorithms.

Conclusion: The Shape-Realism Alignment Metric provides an effective way to evaluate 3D shape realism without ground truth, bridging the gap between computational shape analysis and human perceptual judgment through LLM-based alignment.

Abstract: 3D generation and reconstruction techniques have been widely used in computer games, film, and other content creation areas. As the application grows, there is a growing demand for 3D shapes that look truly realistic. Traditional evaluation methods rely on a ground truth to measure mesh fidelity. However, in many practical cases, a shape's realism does not depend on having a ground truth reference. In this work, we propose a Shape-Realism Alignment Metric that leverages a large language model (LLM) as a bridge between mesh shape information and realism evaluation. To achieve this, we adopt a mesh encoding approach that converts 3D shapes into the language token space. A dedicated realism decoder is designed to align the language model's output with human perception of realism. Additionally, we introduce a new dataset, RealismGrading, which provides human-annotated realism scores without the need for ground truth shapes. Our dataset includes shapes generated by 16 different algorithms on over a dozen objects, making it more representative of practical 3D shape distributions. We validate our metric's performance and generalizability through k-fold cross-validation across different objects. Experimental results show that our metric correlates well with human perceptions and outperforms existing methods, and has good generalizability.

TL;DR: TGE is a new 3D mesh fidelity evaluation method that uses both geometry and color information directly on textured meshes, outperforming rendering-based approaches on real-world distortions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D evaluation metrics (Chamfer Distance, rendering-based methods) don't align well with human perception, have incomplete structural coverage, are sensitive to viewpoint choices, and suffer from domain gaps due to training on synthetic distortions.

Method: Textured Geometry Evaluation (TGE) directly analyzes 3D meshes with texture without rendering, jointly using geometry and color information to calculate fidelity compared to a reference colored shape. Trained on a human-annotated dataset with real-world distortions.

Result: TGE outperforms both rendering-based and geometry-only methods on real-world distortion datasets, showing better alignment with human evaluation of 3D shape fidelity.

Conclusion: Direct 3D mesh analysis with joint geometry-color evaluation using real-world distortion data provides superior fidelity assessment compared to existing rendering-based approaches.

Abstract: Textured high-fidelity 3D models are crucial for games, AR/VR, and film, but human-aligned evaluation methods still fall behind despite recent advances in 3D reconstruction and generation. Existing metrics, such as Chamfer Distance, often fail to align with how humans evaluate the fidelity of 3D shapes. Recent learning-based metrics attempt to improve this by relying on rendered images and 2D image quality metrics. However, these approaches face limitations due to incomplete structural coverage and sensitivity to viewpoint choices. Moreover, most methods are trained on synthetic distortions, which differ significantly from real-world distortions, resulting in a domain gap. To address these challenges, we propose a new fidelity evaluation method that is based directly on 3D meshes with texture, without relying on rendering. Our method, named Textured Geometry Evaluation TGE, jointly uses the geometry and color information to calculate the fidelity of the input textured mesh with comparison to a reference colored shape. To train and evaluate our metric, we design a human-annotated dataset with real-world distortions. Experiments show that TGE outperforms rendering-based and geometry-only methods on real-world distortion dataset.

TL;DR: ReInversion: A training-free, two-stage denoising method for exemplar-guided image editing that improves quality and efficiency over standard inversion techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing EIE methods require expensive pre-training or use sub-optimal standard inversion techniques that lead to poor quality and inefficiency. There's a need for effective training-free alternatives.

Method: Reversible Inversion (ReInversion) - a two-stage denoising process: first conditioned on source image, then on reference. Plus Mask-Guided Selective Denoising (MSD) to constrain edits to target regions while preserving background structure.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art EIE performance with the lowest computational overhead, as demonstrated through both qualitative and quantitative comparisons.

Conclusion: ReInversion provides an effective and efficient training-free solution for exemplar-guided image editing, overcoming limitations of existing inversion techniques.

Abstract: Exemplar-guided Image Editing (EIE) aims to modify a source image according to a visual reference. Existing approaches often require large-scale pre-training to learn relationships between the source and reference images, incurring high computational costs. As a training-free alternative, inversion techniques can be used to map the source image into a latent space for manipulation. However, our empirical study reveals that standard inversion is sub-optimal for EIE, leading to poor quality and inefficiency. To tackle this challenge, we introduce \textbf{Reversible Inversion ({ReInversion})} for effective and efficient EIE. Specifically, ReInversion operates as a two-stage denoising process, which is first conditioned on the source image and subsequently on the reference. Besides, we introduce a Mask-Guided Selective Denoising (MSD) strategy to constrain edits to target regions, preserving the structural consistency of the background. Both qualitative and quantitative comparisons demonstrate that our ReInversion method achieves state-of-the-art EIE performance with the lowest computational overhead.

Conclusion: PointNet4D provides an efficient 4D backbone optimized for both online and offline settings, enabling real-time processing of dynamic 4D environments with applications in robotics and interactive systems.

Abstract: Understanding dynamic 4D environments-3D space evolving over time-is critical for robotic and interactive systems. These applications demand systems that can process streaming point cloud video in real-time, often under resource constraints, while also benefiting from past and present observations when available. However, current 4D backbone networks rely heavily on spatiotemporal convolutions and Transformers, which are often computationally intensive and poorly suited to real-time applications. We propose PointNet4D, a lightweight 4D backbone optimized for both online and offline settings. At its core is a Hybrid Mamba-Transformer temporal fusion block, which integrates the efficient state-space modeling of Mamba and the bidirectional modeling power of Transformers. This enables PointNet4D to handle variable-length online sequences efficiently across different deployment scenarios. To enhance temporal understanding, we introduce 4DMAP, a frame-wise masked auto-regressive pretraining strategy that captures motion cues across frames. Our extensive evaluations across 9 tasks on 7 datasets, demonstrating consistent improvements across diverse domains. We further demonstrate PointNet4D's utility by building two robotic application systems: 4D Diffusion Policy and 4D Imitation Learning, achieving substantial gains on the RoboTwin and HandoverSim benchmarks.

*Seungho Choi,Jeahun Sung,Jihyong Oh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FRAMER is a plug-and-play training scheme for diffusion-based Real-ISR that addresses high-frequency detail under-reconstruction by using final-layer features to teach intermediate layers through frequency-band decomposition and contrastive losses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models for Real-ISR surpass GANs in perceptual quality but under-reconstruct high-frequency details due to low-frequency bias and a "low-first, high-later" hierarchy in their depth-wise processing.

Method: FRAMER uses final-layer feature maps as teachers for intermediate layers, decomposing features into LF/HF bands via FFT masks. It employs Intra Contrastive Loss for LF stability and Inter Contrastive Loss for HF sharpening with random-layer/in-batch negatives, plus adaptive modulators (FAW and FAM) for per-layer signal reweighting.

Result: FRAMER consistently improves PSNR/SSIM and perceptual metrics (LPIPS, NIQE, MANIQA, MUSIQ) across U-Net and DiT backbones including Stable Diffusion 2 and 3, with ablations validating the final-layer teacher and random-layer negatives.

Conclusion: FRAMER effectively addresses the high-frequency detail reconstruction problem in diffusion-based Real-ISR through frequency-aware feature distillation and contrastive learning, achieving better quantitative and perceptual performance without modifying backbone architectures or inference.

Abstract: Real-image super-resolution (Real-ISR) seeks to recover HR images from LR inputs with mixed, unknown degradations. While diffusion models surpass GANs in perceptual quality, they under-reconstruct high-frequency (HF) details due to a low-frequency (LF) bias and a depth-wise "low-first, high-later" hierarchy. We introduce FRAMER, a plug-and-play training scheme that exploits diffusion priors without changing the backbone or inference. At each denoising step, the final-layer feature map teaches all intermediate layers. Teacher and student feature maps are decomposed into LF/HF bands via FFT masks to align supervision with the model's internal frequency hierarchy. For LF, an Intra Contrastive Loss (IntraCL) stabilizes globally shared structure. For HF, an Inter Contrastive Loss (InterCL) sharpens instance-specific details using random-layer and in-batch negatives. Two adaptive modulators, Frequency-based Adaptive Weight (FAW) and Frequency-based Alignment Modulation (FAM), reweight per-layer LF/HF signals and gate distillation by current similarity. Across U-Net and DiT backbones (e.g., Stable Diffusion 2, 3), FRAMER consistently improves PSNR/SSIM and perceptual metrics (LPIPS, NIQE, MANIQA, MUSIQ). Ablations validate the final-layer teacher and random-layer negatives.

Motivation: VLMs exhibit Western-centric biases that limit their effectiveness in culturally diverse regions like Southeast Asia, creating a need for culturally inclusive evaluation benchmarks.

Method: Created RICE-VL benchmark with 28,000+ human-curated VQA samples (True/False, Fill-in-Blank, open-ended) and 1,000 image-bounding box pairs for Visual Grounding across 14 cultural categories, annotated by culturally informed experts. Proposed SEA-LAVE metric extension for assessing textual accuracy, cultural alignment, and country identification.

Result: Evaluation of six open- and closed-source VLMs revealed significant performance gaps in low-resource countries and abstract cultural domains. Visual Grounding task showed limitations in localizing culturally significant elements in complex scenes.

Conclusion: RICE-VL exposes VLMs' cultural comprehension limitations and highlights the need for inclusive model development to better serve diverse global populations, particularly in underrepresented regions like Southeast Asia.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel in multimodal tasks but often exhibit Western-centric biases, limiting their effectiveness in culturally diverse regions like Southeast Asia (SEA). To address this, we introduce RICE-VL, a novel benchmark evaluating VLM cultural understanding across 11 ASEAN countries. RICE-VL includes over 28,000 human-curated Visual Question Answering (VQA) samples -- covering True or False, Fill-in-the-Blank, and open-ended formats -- and 1,000 image-bounding box pairs for Visual Grounding, annotated by culturally informed experts across 14 sub-ground categories. We propose SEA-LAVE, an extension of the LAVE metric, assessing textual accuracy, cultural alignment, and country identification. Evaluations of six open- and closed-source VLMs reveal significant performance gaps in low-resource countries and abstract cultural domains. The Visual Grounding task tests models' ability to localize culturally significant elements in complex scenes, probing spatial and contextual accuracy. RICE-VL exposes limitations in VLMs' cultural comprehension and highlights the need for inclusive model development to better serve diverse global populations.

*Yongkun Du,Miaomiao Zhao,Songlin Fan,Zhineng Chen,Caiyan Jia,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MDiff4STR introduces Mask Diffusion Models to Scene Text Recognition, outperforming auto-regressive models in accuracy while maintaining fast inference with only three denoising steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mask Diffusion Models offer flexible efficiency-accuracy balance for vision-language tasks, but vanilla MDMs lag behind auto-regressive models in STR accuracy despite better efficiency. The paper aims to bridge this gap by adapting MDMs specifically for STR.

Method: Proposes MDiff4STR with two key strategies: 1) Six noising strategies to align training-inference behavior and address noising gap, 2) Token-replacement noise mechanism to prevent overconfident predictions by providing non-mask noise types that encourage reconsideration of incorrect predictions.

Result: MDiff4STR consistently outperforms popular STR models across diverse benchmarks (irregular, artistic, occluded, Chinese text, with/without pretraining), surpassing state-of-the-art ARMs in accuracy while maintaining fast inference with only three denoising steps.

Conclusion: MDiff4STR successfully adapts Mask Diffusion Models to Scene Text Recognition, achieving superior accuracy over auto-regressive models while maintaining efficiency, demonstrating the viability of diffusion models for STR tasks through tailored noise strategies.

Abstract: Mask Diffusion Models (MDMs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative to auto-regressive models (ARMs) for vision-language tasks, owing to their flexible balance of efficiency and accuracy. In this paper, for the first time, we introduce MDMs into the Scene Text Recognition (STR) task. We show that vanilla MDM lags behind ARMs in terms of accuracy, although it improves recognition efficiency. To bridge this gap, we propose MDiff4STR, a Mask Diffusion model enhanced with two key improvement strategies tailored for STR. Specifically, we identify two key challenges in applying MDMs to STR: noising gap between training and inference, and overconfident predictions during inference. Both significantly hinder the performance of MDMs. To mitigate the first issue, we develop six noising strategies that better align training with inference behavior. For the second, we propose a token-replacement noise mechanism that provides a non-mask noise type, encouraging the model to reconsider and revise overly confident but incorrect predictions. We conduct extensive evaluations of MDiff4STR on both standard and challenging STR benchmarks, covering diverse scenarios including irregular, artistic, occluded, and Chinese text, as well as whether the use of pretraining. Across these settings, MDiff4STR consistently outperforms popular STR models, surpassing state-of-the-art ARMs in accuracy, while maintaining fast inference with only three denoising steps.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViRectify is a benchmark for evaluating multimodal LLMs' ability to identify and correct video reasoning errors, featuring 30K+ instances across perception, scientific reasoning, and decision-making domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal LLMs frequently make errors in complex video reasoning, but existing benchmarks lack systematic evaluation of their error correction capabilities, creating a gap in understanding their weaknesses and improvement opportunities.

Method: Created ViRectify benchmark with AI-assisted annotation pipeline and human verification; introduced trajectory evidence-driven correction framework with step-wise error trajectory and reward modeling on visual evidence-grounded correction.

Result: Evaluation of 16 advanced MLLMs shows ViRectify is challenging (GPT-5 achieves only 31.94% accuracy); their framework enables Qwen2.5-VL-7B to outperform 72B variants, revealing systematic asymmetries in error correction across models.

Conclusion: ViRectify provides a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating MLLMs' video reasoning error correction capabilities, offering a new direction for assessment and serving as valuable data for reflection learning.

Abstract: As multimodal large language models (MLLMs) frequently exhibit errors in complex video reasoning scenarios, correcting these errors is critical for uncovering their weaknesses and improving performance. However, existing benchmarks lack systematic evaluation of MLLMs' ability to identify and correct these video reasoning errors. To bridge this gap, we propose \textit{ViRectify}, a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate their fine-grained correction capability. Through an AI-assisted annotation pipeline with human verification, we construct a dataset of over 30\textit{K} instances spanning dynamic perception, scientific reasoning, and embodied decision-making domains. In \textit{ViRectify}, we challenge MLLMs to perform step-wise error identification and generate rationales with key video evidence grounding. In addition, we further propose the trajectory evidence-driven correction framework, comprising step-wise error trajectory and reward modeling on visual evidence-grounded correction. It encourages the model to explicitly concentrate on error propagation and key timestamps for correction. Extensive evaluation across 16 advanced MLLMs demonstrates that our \textit{ViRectify} serves as a challenging testbed, where GPT-5 achieves only 31.94\% correction accuracy. Our framework enables a Qwen2.5-VL-7B to consistently outperform the variants of 72B on \textit{ViRectify}, showing the effectiveness of our approach. Further analysis uncovers systematic asymmetries in error correction across models, and our dataset is also a valuable data resource to perform reflection learning. We believe \textit{ViRectify} provides a new direction for comprehensively evaluating the advanced MLLMs in video reasoning.

*Yiyang Ma,Feng Zhou,Xuedan Yin,Pu Cao,Yonghao Dang,Jianqin Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ResDiT is a training-free method that enables high-resolution image synthesis using pre-trained Diffusion Transformers by fixing position embedding scaling issues and adding local enhancement mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-trained Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) suffer from spatial layout collapse and degraded texture fidelity when scaled to high-resolution image synthesis. Existing methods require complex pipelines with base-resolution denoising guidance, which is inefficient.

Method: 1) Identifies position embeddings as the core factor for spatial layout and introduces PE scaling to correct positional encoding under resolution changes. 2) Develops local-enhancement mechanism using base-resolution local attention. 3) Designs patch-level fusion module to aggregate global and local cues. 4) Uses Gaussian-weighted splicing strategy to eliminate grid artifacts.

Result: ResDiT consistently delivers high-fidelity, high-resolution image synthesis and integrates seamlessly with downstream tasks including spatially controlled generation, without requiring additional training.

Conclusion: ResDiT provides an efficient, training-free solution for scaling pre-trained DiTs to high-resolution image synthesis by addressing fundamental issues with position embeddings and enhancing local details, outperforming complex pipeline-based approaches.

Abstract: Leveraging pre-trained Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) for high-resolution (HR) image synthesis often leads to spatial layout collapse and degraded texture fidelity. Prior work mitigates these issues with complex pipelines that first perform a base-resolution (i.e., training-resolution) denoising process to guide HR generation. We instead explore the intrinsic generative mechanisms of DiTs and propose ResDiT, a training-free method that scales resolution efficiently. We identify the core factor governing spatial layout, position embeddings (PEs), and show that the original PEs encode incorrect positional information when extrapolated to HR, which triggers layout collapse. To address this, we introduce a PE scaling technique that rectifies positional encoding under resolution changes. To further remedy low-fidelity details, we develop a local-enhancement mechanism grounded in base-resolution local attention. We design a patch-level fusion module that aggregates global and local cues, together with a Gaussian-weighted splicing strategy that eliminates grid artifacts. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that ResDiT consistently delivers high-fidelity, high-resolution image synthesis and integrates seamlessly with downstream tasks, including spatially controlled generation.

*Klara Reichard,Nikolas Brasch,Nassir Navab,Federico Tombari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Clipomaly: First CLIP-based open-world anomaly segmentation for autonomous driving that segments unknown objects and assigns human-interpretable names without anomaly training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing open-world/anomaly segmentation methods fail to assign semantically meaningful labels to unknown regions and struggle with learning representations for unknown classes. Open-vocabulary methods require fixed inference vocabularies and cannot handle unconstrained unknown classes in anomaly segmentation.

Method: Zero-shot approach leveraging CLIP's shared image-text embedding space to segment unknown objects and assign human-interpretable names. Unlike open-vocabulary methods, it dynamically extends vocabulary at inference time without retraining.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on established anomaly segmentation benchmarks while providing interpretability and flexibility essential for practical deployment.

Conclusion: Clipomaly enables robust detection and naming of anomalies beyond common class definitions, making it suitable for practical autonomous driving deployment.

Abstract: Open-world and anomaly segmentation methods seek to enable autonomous driving systems to detect and segment both known and unknown objects in real-world scenes. However, existing methods do not assign semantically meaningful labels to unknown regions, and distinguishing and learning representations for unknown classes remains difficult. While open-vocabulary segmentation methods show promise in generalizing to novel classes, they require a fixed inference vocabulary and thus cannot be directly applied to anomaly segmentation where unknown classes are unconstrained. We propose Clipomaly, the first CLIP-based open-world and anomaly segmentation method for autonomous driving. Our zero-shot approach requires no anomaly-specific training data and leverages CLIP's shared image-text embedding space to both segment unknown objects and assign human-interpretable names to them. Unlike open-vocabulary methods, our model dynamically extends its vocabulary at inference time without retraining, enabling robust detection and naming of anomalies beyond common class definitions such as those in Cityscapes. Clipomaly achieves state-of-the-art performance on established anomaly segmentation benchmarks while providing interpretability and flexibility essential for practical deployment.

*Jian Shu,Nanjie Yao,Gangjian Zhang,Junlong Ren,Yu Feng,Hao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified learning framework for 3D human avatar animation that addresses template construction inefficiencies and deformation artifacts in a two-phase approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D human avatar animation methods have two main problems: 1) template construction requires extensive skeletal rigging and produces artifacts for specific poses, and 2) target pose deformation suffers from structural distortions caused by Linear Blend Skinning (LBS), which undermines animation realism.

Method: A two-phase unified learning framework: 1) For template construction, uses a U-Net architecture to decouple texture and pose information in a feed-forward process for fast template generation. 2) For target pose deformation, proposes a data-driven refinement technique to enhance structural integrity.

Result: Extensive experiments show the model delivers consistent performance across diverse poses with optimal balance between efficiency and quality, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed unified framework effectively addresses both template construction inefficiencies and deformation artifacts, providing a more efficient and realistic solution for 3D human avatar animation.

Abstract: 3D human avatar animation aims at transforming a human avatar from an arbitrary initial pose to a specified target pose using deformation algorithms. Existing approaches typically divide this task into two stages: canonical template construction and target pose deformation. However, current template construction methods demand extensive skeletal rigging and often produce artifacts for specific poses. Moreover, target pose deformation suffers from structural distortions caused by Linear Blend Skinning (LBS), which significantly undermines animation realism. To address these problems, we propose a unified learning-based framework to address both challenges in two phases. For the former phase, to overcome the inefficiencies and artifacts during template construction, we leverage a U-Net architecture that decouples texture and pose information in a feed-forward process, enabling fast generation of a human template. For the latter phase, we propose a data-driven refinement technique that enhances structural integrity. Extensive experiments show that our model delivers consistent performance across diverse poses with an optimal balance between efficiency and quality,surpassing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

*Omer Sela,Michael Chertok,Lior Wolf*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CourtMotion is a spatiotemporal framework using skeletal tracking data with Graph Neural Networks and Transformers to predict basketball events, achieving 35% better trajectory prediction than position-only models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional basketball analysis using only player positions misses crucial motion details like body orientation, defensive stance, and shooting preparation. There's a need to capture both physical motion patterns and their semantic significance in game context for better event prediction.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Graph Neural Networks process skeletal tracking data to capture nuanced motion patterns, 2) Transformer architecture with specialized attention mechanisms models player interactions. Event projection heads explicitly connect movements to basketball events (passes, shots, steals).

Result: 35% reduction in trajectory prediction error compared to state-of-the-art position-based models. Consistent performance gains across key basketball analytics tasks including pick detection, shot taker identification, assist prediction, shot location classification, and shot type recognition.

Conclusion: CourtMotion demonstrates that incorporating skeletal motion data with specialized neural architectures significantly improves basketball event prediction, providing a powerful pretrained foundation for multiple downstream basketball analytics tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents CourtMotion, a spatiotemporal modeling framework for analyzing and predicting game events and plays as they develop in professional basketball. Anticipating basketball events requires understanding both physical motion patterns and their semantic significance in the context of the game. Traditional approaches that use only player positions fail to capture crucial indicators such as body orientation, defensive stance, or shooting preparation motions. Our two-stage approach first processes skeletal tracking data through Graph Neural Networks to capture nuanced motion patterns, then employs a Transformer architecture with specialized attention mechanisms to model player interactions. We introduce event projection heads that explicitly connect player movements to basketball events like passes, shots, and steals, training the model to associate physical motion patterns with their tactical purposes. Experiments on NBA tracking data demonstrate significant improvements over position-only baselines: 35% reduction in trajectory prediction error compared to state-of-the-art position-based models and consistent performance gains across key basketball analytics tasks. The resulting pretrained model serves as a powerful foundation for multiple downstream tasks, with pick detection, shot taker identification, assist prediction, shot location classification, and shot type recognition demonstrating substantial improvements over existing methods.

TL;DR: ChronosObserver is a training-free method for generating 3D-consistent, time-synchronized multi-view videos from camera-controlled diffusion models without additional training or fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing camera-controlled video generation models struggle with 3D consistency and time synchronization across multiple views, which is essential for 4D world creation. Current solutions using data augmentation or test-time optimization have limited generalization and scalability issues.

Method: Two key components: 1) World State Hyperspace to represent spatiotemporal constraints of 4D scenes, and 2) Hyperspace Guided Sampling to synchronize diffusion sampling trajectories across multiple views using the hyperspace representation.

Result: The method successfully generates high-fidelity, 3D-consistent, time-synchronized multi-view videos without requiring any training or fine-tuning of the underlying diffusion models.

Conclusion: ChronosObserver provides an effective training-free solution for 4D world generation by leveraging hyperspace representations to synchronize multi-view video generation while maintaining 3D consistency and temporal alignment.

Abstract: Although prevailing camera-controlled video generation models can produce cinematic results, lifting them directly to the generation of 3D-consistent and high-fidelity time-synchronized multi-view videos remains challenging, which is a pivotal capability for taming 4D worlds. Some works resort to data augmentation or test-time optimization, but these strategies are constrained by limited model generalization and scalability issues. To this end, we propose ChronosObserver, a training-free method including World State Hyperspace to represent the spatiotemporal constraints of a 4D world scene, and Hyperspace Guided Sampling to synchronize the diffusion sampling trajectories of multiple views using the hyperspace. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves high-fidelity and 3D-consistent time-synchronized multi-view videos generation without training or fine-tuning for diffusion models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an automated, mostly unsupervised method for extracting curves and 1D structures from images, addressing the challenge of finding optimal paths between endpoints while handling curvature constraints.

Method: Uses variational approach with energy discretization and Smirnov's decomposition theorem for vector fields; employs bi-level minimization for curve extraction; extends to curvature-dependent energies by lifting curves to position-orientation space with sub-Riemannian/Finslerian metrics.

Result: Proposes a framework for automatic curve extraction from images that can handle both simple and curvature-constrained path finding problems in a mostly unsupervised manner.

Conclusion: The variational approach provides an effective method for extracting 1D structures from images, with extensions to curvature-dependent energies offering broader applicability to complex geometric constraints.

Abstract: We introduce a variational approach for extracting curves between a list of possible endpoints, based on the discretization of an energy and Smirnov's decomposition theorem for vector fields. It is used to design a bi-level minimization approach to automatically extract curves and 1D structures from an image, which is mostly unsupervised. We extend then the method to curvature-dependent energies, using a now classical lifting of the curves in the space of positions and orientations equipped with an appropriate sub-Riemanian or Finslerian metric.

TL;DR: ELVIS is a framework for video instance segmentation in low-light conditions, featuring an unsupervised synthetic pipeline for temporal degradations and enhancement modules to adapt VIS models to low-light scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video instance segmentation in low-light is challenging due to noise, blur, low-contrast, lack of annotated datasets, and limitations of existing synthetic pipelines that don't properly model temporal degradations. Current VIS methods are not robust to low-light degradations.

Method: ELVIS framework includes: 1) unsupervised synthetic low-light video pipeline modeling spatial and temporal degradations, 2) calibration-free degradation profile synthesis network (VDP-Net), and 3) enhancement decoder head that disentangles degradations from content features.

Result: Improves performance by up to +3.7AP on synthetic low-light YouTube-VIS 2019 dataset compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: ELVIS enables effective domain adaptation of state-of-the-art VIS models to low-light scenarios through its comprehensive approach to modeling and handling low-light degradations.

Abstract: Video instance segmentation (VIS) for low-light content remains highly challenging for both humans and machines alike, due to adverse imaging conditions including noise, blur and low-contrast. The lack of large-scale annotated datasets and the limitations of current synthetic pipelines, particularly in modeling temporal degradations, further hinder progress. Moreover, existing VIS methods are not robust to the degradations found in low-light videos and, as a result, perform poorly even when finetuned on low-light data. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{ELVIS} (\textbf{E}nhance \textbf{L}ow-light for \textbf{V}ideo \textbf{I}nstance \textbf{S}egmentation), a novel framework that enables effective domain adaptation of state-of-the-art VIS models to low-light scenarios. ELVIS comprises an unsupervised synthetic low-light video pipeline that models both spatial and temporal degradations, a calibration-free degradation profile synthesis network (VDP-Net) and an enhancement decoder head that disentangles degradations from content features. ELVIS improves performances by up to \textbf{+3.7AP} on the synthetic low-light YouTube-VIS 2019 dataset. Code will be released upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SRCSM: A novel method for single-source domain generalization in medical image segmentation that uses semantic-aware random convolution during training and intensity mapping at test-time to bridge domain gaps between different imaging modalities and centers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenging problem of single-source domain generalization for medical image segmentation, where models trained on one domain (e.g., CT) need to generalize to different domains (e.g., MR) without adaptation or access to target domain data during training.

Method: SRCSM uses semantic-aware random convolution during training to diversify the source domain by applying different augmentations to different regions based on annotation labels. At test-time, it maps target domain image intensities to resemble source domain data.

Result: Outperforms previous DG techniques in most experiments across abdominal, whole-heart, and prostate segmentation tasks in cross-modality and cross-center settings. Achieves segmentation performance matching in-domain baselines in several settings and shows promise in challenging cine MR phase generalization.

Conclusion: SRCSM establishes a new state-of-the-art for domain generalization in medical image segmentation, effectively bridging domain gaps between different imaging modalities and centers without requiring target domain data during training.

Abstract: We tackle the challenging problem of single-source domain generalization (DG) for medical image segmentation. To this end, we aim for training a network on one domain (e.g., CT) and directly apply it to a different domain (e.g., MR) without adapting the model and without requiring images or annotations from the new domain during training. We propose a novel method for promoting DG when training deep segmentation networks, which we call SRCSM. During training, our method diversifies the source domain through semantic-aware random convolution, where different regions of a source image are augmented differently, based on their annotation labels. At test-time, we complement the randomization of the training domain via mapping the intensity of target domain images, making them similar to source domain data. We perform a comprehensive evaluation on a variety of cross-modality and cross-center generalization settings for abdominal, whole-heart and prostate segmentation, where we outperform previous DG techniques in a vast majority of experiments. Additionally, we also investigate our method when training on whole-heart CT or MR data and testing on the diastolic and systolic phase of cine MR data captured with different scanner hardware, where we make a step towards closing the domain gap in this even more challenging setting. Overall, our evaluation shows that SRCSM can be considered a new state-of-the-art in DG for medical image segmentation and, moreover, even achieves a segmentation performance that matches the performance of the in-domain baseline in several settings.

TL;DR: QuantumCanvas is a multimodal benchmark dataset focusing on two-body quantum systems as fundamental units of matter, using image representations of orbital physics to enable transferable quantum learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current molecular and materials machine learning models lack physical transferability because they learn correlations across whole molecules/crystals rather than fundamental quantum interactions between atomic pairs. Bonding, charge redistribution, orbital hybridization, and electronic coupling all emerge from these two-body interactions.

Method: Created a large-scale multimodal benchmark spanning 2,850 element-element pairs with 18 electronic, thermodynamic, and geometric properties. Each pair has ten-channel image representations derived from l- and m-resolved orbital densities, angular field transforms, co-occupancy maps, and charge-density projections that encode spatial, angular, and electrostatic symmetries without explicit coordinates.

Result: Benchmarked eight architectures: GATv2 achieved 0.201 eV MAE on energy gap, EGNN achieved 0.265 eV on HOMO and 0.274 eV on LUMO, DimeNet attained 2.27 eV total-energy MAE and 0.132 eV repulsive-energy MAE, and multimodal fusion achieved 2.15 eV Mermin free-energy MAE. Pretraining on QuantumCanvas improved convergence stability and generalization when fine-tuned on larger datasets like QM9, MD17, and CrysMTM.

Conclusion: QuantumCanvas provides a principled and interpretable basis for learning transferable quantum interactions by unifying orbital physics with vision-based representation learning through coupled visual and numerical modalities, enabling more physically grounded machine learning models.

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in molecular and materials machine learning, most models still lack physical transferability: they fit correlations across whole molecules or crystals rather than learning the quantum interactions between atomic pairs. Yet bonding, charge redistribution, orbital hybridization, and electronic coupling all emerge from these two-body interactions that define local quantum fields in many-body systems. We introduce QuantumCanvas, a large-scale multimodal benchmark that treats two-body quantum systems as foundational units of matter. The dataset spans 2,850 element-element pairs, each annotated with 18 electronic, thermodynamic, and geometric properties and paired with ten-channel image representations derived from l- and m-resolved orbital densities, angular field transforms, co-occupancy maps, and charge-density projections. These physically grounded images encode spatial, angular, and electrostatic symmetries without explicit coordinates, providing an interpretable visual modality for quantum learning. Benchmarking eight architectures across 18 targets, we report mean absolute errors of 0.201 eV on energy gap using GATv2, 0.265 eV on HOMO and 0.274 eV on LUMO using EGNN. For energy-related quantities, DimeNet attains 2.27 eV total-energy MAE and 0.132 eV repulsive-energy MAE, while a multimodal fusion model achieves a 2.15 eV Mermin free-energy MAE. Pretraining on QuantumCanvas further improves convergence stability and generalization when fine-tuned on larger datasets such as QM9, MD17, and CrysMTM. By unifying orbital physics with vision-based representation learning, QuantumCanvas provides a principled and interpretable basis for learning transferable quantum interactions through coupled visual and numerical modalities.

*Hailong Yang,Te Zhang,Kup-sze Choi,Zhaohong Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DFS is a fuzzy rule-guided multi-path diffusion model that improves feature learning and coordination while reducing computational costs for image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models struggle with image collections having significant feature differences, failing to capture complex features and producing conflicting results. Existing multi-path approaches suffer from inefficient coordination and high computational costs.

Method: DFS uses multiple diffusion paths each dedicated to specific image features, rule-chain-based reasoning for dynamic coordination, and fuzzy membership-based latent-space compression to reduce computational costs.

Result: DFS achieves more stable training and faster convergence than existing models on LSUN Bedroom, LSUN Church, and MS COCO datasets. It surpasses baselines in image quality, text-image alignment, and accuracy when comparing generated images to target references.

Conclusion: DFS effectively addresses the limitations of traditional diffusion models in handling heterogeneous image features through fuzzy rule-guided multi-path coordination with reduced computational overhead.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a leading technique for generating images due to their ability to create high-resolution and realistic images. Despite their strong performance, diffusion models still struggle in managing image collections with significant feature differences. They often fail to capture complex features and produce conflicting results. Research has attempted to address this issue by learning different regions of an image through multiple diffusion paths and then combining them. However, this approach leads to inefficient coordination among multiple paths and high computational costs. To tackle these issues, this paper presents a Diffusion Fuzzy System (DFS), a latent-space multi-path diffusion model guided by fuzzy rules. DFS offers several advantages. First, unlike traditional multi-path diffusion methods, DFS uses multiple diffusion paths, each dedicated to learning a specific class of image features. By assigning each path to a different feature type, DFS overcomes the limitations of multi-path models in capturing heterogeneous image features. Second, DFS employs rule-chain-based reasoning to dynamically steer the diffusion process and enable efficient coordination among multiple paths. Finally, DFS introduces a fuzzy membership-based latent-space compression mechanism to reduce the computational costs of multi-path diffusion effectively. We tested our method on three public datasets: LSUN Bedroom, LSUN Church, and MS COCO. The results show that DFS achieves more stable training and faster convergence than existing single-path and multi-path diffusion models. Additionally, DFS surpasses baseline models in both image quality and alignment between text and images, and also shows improved accuracy when comparing generated images to target references.

TL;DR: Large-scale benchmark study evaluating deep unsupervised anomaly detection in brain MRI across multiple centers, scanners, and clinical cohorts, revealing substantial performance variability and systematic biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fragmented evaluations, heterogeneous datasets, and inconsistent metrics have hindered progress in clinical translation of deep unsupervised anomaly detection for brain MRI, necessitating a comprehensive benchmark.

Method: Large-scale multi-center benchmark with 2,976 T1 and 2,972 T2-weighted healthy training scans, 92 validation scans, and 2,221 T1w/1,262 T2w test scans across diverse clinical cohorts. Systematic evaluation of algorithm robustness to scanners, lesion types/sizes, and demographics.

Result: Dice-based segmentation performance ranged 0.03-0.65 across algorithms. Reconstruction-based methods (especially diffusion-inspired) achieved best lesion segmentation, while feature-based methods showed better robustness to distribution shifts. Systematic biases observed: scanner effects, missed small/low-contrast lesions, false positives varying with age/sex.

Conclusion: Current unsupervised anomaly detection frameworks are algorithmically limited rather than data-limited. Future priorities include image-native pretraining, principled deviation measures, fairness-aware modeling, and robust domain adaptation for clinical translation.

Abstract: Deep unsupervised anomaly detection in brain magnetic resonance imaging offers a promising route to identify pathological deviations without requiring lesion-specific annotations. Yet, fragmented evaluations, heterogeneous datasets, and inconsistent metrics have hindered progress toward clinical translation. Here, we present a large-scale, multi-center benchmark of deep unsupervised anomaly detection for brain imaging. The training cohort comprised 2,976 T1 and 2,972 T2-weighted scans from healthy individuals across six scanners, with ages ranging from 6 to 89 years. Validation used 92 scans to tune hyperparameters and estimate unbiased thresholds. Testing encompassed 2,221 T1w and 1,262 T2w scans spanning healthy datasets and diverse clinical cohorts. Across all algorithms, the Dice-based segmentation performance varied between 0.03 and 0.65, indicating substantial variability. To assess robustness, we systematically evaluated the impact of different scanners, lesion types and sizes, as well as demographics (age, sex). Reconstruction-based methods, particularly diffusion-inspired approaches, achieved the strongest lesion segmentation performance, while feature-based methods showed greater robustness under distributional shifts. However, systematic biases, such as scanner-related effects, were observed for the majority of algorithms, including that small and low-contrast lesions were missed more often, and that false positives varied with age and sex. Increasing healthy training data yields only modest gains, underscoring that current unsupervised anomaly detection frameworks are limited algorithmically rather than by data availability. Our benchmark establishes a transparent foundation for future research and highlights priorities for clinical translation, including image native pretraining, principled deviation measures, fairness-aware modeling, and robust domain adaptation.

### [185] [FlashVGGT: Efficient and Scalable Visual Geometry Transformers with Compressed Descriptor Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01540)
*Zipeng Wang,Dan Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlashVGGT is an efficient 3D reconstruction method that replaces VGGT's quadratic self-attention with descriptor-based attention, achieving similar accuracy with 9.3% inference time for 1000 images and scaling to 3000+ images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art 3D reconstruction methods like VGGT use full self-attention over all image tokens, which suffers from poor scalability due to quadratic complexity and large token counts in long image sequences.

Method: FlashVGGT introduces a descriptor-based attention mechanism that compresses spatial information from each frame into compact descriptor tokens, then computes global attention as cross-attention between image tokens and the smaller descriptor set. It also uses a chunk-recursive mechanism for online inference over long sequences.

Result: FlashVGGT achieves reconstruction accuracy competitive with VGGT while reducing inference time to just 9.3% of VGGT for 1,000 images, and scales efficiently to sequences exceeding 3,000 images.

Conclusion: FlashVGGT provides an efficient alternative to VGGT that maintains reconstruction quality while dramatically improving scalability through descriptor-based attention and chunk-recursive processing.

Abstract: 3D reconstruction from multi-view images is a core challenge in computer vision. Recently, feed-forward methods have emerged as efficient and robust alternatives to traditional per-scene optimization techniques. Among them, state-of-the-art models like the Visual Geometry Grounding Transformer (VGGT) leverage full self-attention over all image tokens to capture global relationships. However, this approach suffers from poor scalability due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention and the large number of tokens generated in long image sequences. In this work, we introduce FlashVGGT, an efficient alternative that addresses this bottleneck through a descriptor-based attention mechanism. Instead of applying dense global attention across all tokens, FlashVGGT compresses spatial information from each frame into a compact set of descriptor tokens. Global attention is then computed as cross-attention between the full set of image tokens and this smaller descriptor set, significantly reducing computational overhead. Moreover, the compactness of the descriptors enables online inference over long sequences via a chunk-recursive mechanism that reuses cached descriptors from previous chunks. Experimental results show that FlashVGGT achieves reconstruction accuracy competitive with VGGT while reducing inference time to just 9.3% of VGGT for 1,000 images, and scaling efficiently to sequences exceeding 3,000 images.

Abstract: Head and neck masses are space-occupying lesions that can compress the airway and esophagus and may affect nerves and blood vessels. Available public datasets primarily focus on malignant lesions and often overlook other space-occupying conditions in this region. To address this gap, we introduce MasHeNe, an initial dataset of 3,779 contrast-enhanced CT slices that includes both tumors and cysts with pixel-level annotations. We also establish a benchmark using standard segmentation baselines and report common metrics to enable fair comparison. In addition, we propose the Windowing-Enhanced Mamba with Frequency integration (WEMF) model. WEMF applies tri-window enhancement to enrich the input appearance before feature extraction. It further uses multi-frequency attention to fuse information across skip connections within a U-shaped Mamba backbone. On MasHeNe, WEMF attains the best performance among evaluated methods, with a Dice of 70.45%, IoU of 66.89%, NSD of 72.33%, and HD95 of 5.12 mm. This model indicates stable and strong results on this challenging task. MasHeNe provides a benchmark for head-and-neck mass segmentation beyond malignancy-only datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Depth misalignment persists between upper and lower pad sets in OBM microresistivity imagers even after velocity correction, requiring better alignment methods.

Method: Shape Dynamic Time Warping (ShapeDTW) algorithm with local shape features, using a combined feature set of one-dimensional Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG1D) and original signal as shape descriptor.

Result: Field tests show precise alignment for images with complex textures, depth shifts, or local scaling, and the method provides a flexible framework for feature extension.

Conclusion: The ShapeDTW-based method effectively solves depth misalignment in OBM microresistivity images and offers extensibility for specific geological features.

Abstract: In well logging operations using the oil-based mud (OBM) microresistivity imager, which employs an interleaved design with upper and lower pad sets, depth misalignment issues persist between the pad images even after velocity correction. This paper presents a depth matching method for borehole images based on the Shape Dynamic Time Warping (ShapeDTW) algorithm. The method extracts local shape features to construct a morphologically sensitive distance matrix, better preserving structural similarity between sequences during alignment. We implement this by employing a combined feature set of the one-dimensional Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG1D) and the original signal as the shape descriptor. Field test examples demonstrate that our method achieves precise alignment for images with complex textures, depth shifts, or local scaling. Furthermore, it provides a flexible framework for feature extension, allowing the integration of other descriptors tailored to specific geological features.

Abstract: Articulated 3D objects are critical for embodied AI, robotics, and interactive scene understanding, yet creating simulation-ready assets remains labor-intensive and requires expert modeling of part hierarchies and motion structures. We introduce SPARK, a framework for reconstructing physically consistent, kinematic part-level articulated objects from a single RGB image. Given an input image, we first leverage VLMs to extract coarse URDF parameters and generate part-level reference images. We then integrate the part-image guidance and the inferred structure graph into a generative diffusion transformer to synthesize consistent part and complete shapes of articulated objects. To further refine the URDF parameters, we incorporate differentiable forward kinematics and differentiable rendering to optimize joint types, axes, and origins under VLM-generated open-state supervision. Extensive experiments show that SPARK produces high-quality, simulation-ready articulated assets across diverse categories, enabling downstream applications such as robotic manipulation and interaction modeling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fusion-Diff is a novel generative editing framework for zero-shot composed image retrieval that uses multimodal fusion features and a lightweight Control-Adapter to achieve state-of-the-art performance with minimal training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised CIR methods require costly triplet annotations, motivating zero-shot solutions. Existing zero-shot approaches struggle with the vision-language modality gap, creating a need for more effective and data-efficient methods.

Method: Proposes Fusion-Diff with two key innovations: 1) multimodal fusion feature editing strategy in joint vision-language space to narrow modality gap, and 2) lightweight Control-Adapter that enables SOTA performance with only 200K synthetic samples for fine-tuning.

Result: Significantly outperforms prior zero-shot approaches on standard CIR benchmarks (CIRR, FashionIQ, and CIRCO). Achieves state-of-the-art performance with high data efficiency using only limited synthetic data.

Conclusion: Fusion-Diff effectively addresses the modality gap challenge in zero-shot CIR through multimodal fusion and achieves superior performance with remarkable data efficiency, making it a practical solution for fine-grained visual search without expensive annotations.

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) enables fine-grained visual search by combining a reference image with a textual modification. While supervised CIR methods achieve high accuracy, their reliance on costly triplet annotations motivates zero-shot solutions. The core challenge in zero-shot CIR (ZS-CIR) stems from a fundamental dilemma: existing text-centric or diffusion-based approaches struggle to effectively bridge the vision-language modality gap. To address this, we propose Fusion-Diff, a novel generative editing framework with high effectiveness and data efficiency designed for multimodal alignment. First, it introduces a multimodal fusion feature editing strategy within a joint vision-language (VL) space, substantially narrowing the modality gap. Second, to maximize data efficiency, the framework incorporates a lightweight Control-Adapter, enabling state-of-the-art performance through fine-tuning on only a limited-scale synthetic dataset of 200K samples. Extensive experiments on standard CIR benchmarks (CIRR, FashionIQ, and CIRCO) demonstrate that Fusion-Diff significantly outperforms prior zero-shot approaches. We further enhance the interpretability of our model by visualizing the fused multimodal representations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Test-Time Training (TTT) shows promise for efficient sequence modeling but lacks comprehensive understanding and practical guidelines for visual applications. The paper aims to bridge this gap through systematic empirical study.

Method: Conducted systematic empirical study of TTT designs for visual sequence modeling, distilled six practical insights, and developed ViT³ - a pure TTT architecture with linear complexity and parallelizable computation.

Result: ViT³ consistently matches or outperforms advanced linear-complexity models (Mamba, linear attention variants) across diverse visual tasks (image classification, generation, detection, segmentation), narrowing the gap to optimized vision Transformers.

Conclusion: The study establishes design principles for effective visual TTT and provides ViT³ as a strong baseline to facilitate future work on efficient visual sequence modeling with linear complexity.

Abstract: Test-Time Training (TTT) has recently emerged as a promising direction for efficient sequence modeling. TTT reformulates attention operation as an online learning problem, constructing a compact inner model from key-value pairs at test time. This reformulation opens a rich and flexible design space while achieving linear computational complexity. However, crafting a powerful visual TTT design remains challenging: fundamental choices for the inner module and inner training lack comprehensive understanding and practical guidelines. To bridge this critical gap, in this paper, we present a systematic empirical study of TTT designs for visual sequence modeling. From a series of experiments and analyses, we distill six practical insights that establish design principles for effective visual TTT and illuminate paths for future improvement. These findings culminate in the Vision Test-Time Training (ViT$^3$) model, a pure TTT architecture that achieves linear complexity and parallelizable computation. We evaluate ViT$^3$ across diverse visual tasks, including image classification, image generation, object detection, and semantic segmentation. Results show that ViT$^3$ consistently matches or outperforms advanced linear-complexity models (e.g., Mamba and linear attention variants) and effectively narrows the gap to highly optimized vision Transformers. We hope this study and the ViT$^3$ baseline can facilitate future work on visual TTT models. Code is available at https://github.com/LeapLabTHU/ViTTT.

Conclusion: DB-KAUNet effectively addresses the limitations of traditional CNNs by combining CNN and Transformer architectures with innovative modules, resulting in superior retinal vessel segmentation for clinical applications.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of retinal vessels is crucial for the clinical diagnosis of numerous ophthalmic and systemic diseases. However, traditional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) methods exhibit inherent limitations, struggling to capture long-range dependencies and complex nonlinear relationships. To address the above limitations, an Adaptive Dual Branch Kolmogorov-Arnold UNet (DB-KAUNet) is proposed for retinal vessel segmentation. In DB-KAUNet, we design a Heterogeneous Dual-Branch Encoder (HDBE) that features parallel CNN and Transformer pathways. The HDBE strategically interleaves standard CNN and Transformer blocks with novel KANConv and KAT blocks, enabling the model to form a comprehensive feature representation. To optimize feature processing, we integrate several critical components into the HDBE. First, a Cross-Branch Channel Interaction (CCI) module is embedded to facilitate efficient interaction of channel features between the parallel pathways. Second, an attention-based Spatial Feature Enhancement (SFE) module is employed to enhance spatial features and fuse the outputs from both branches. Building upon the SFE module, an advanced Spatial Feature Enhancement with Geometrically Adaptive Fusion (SFE-GAF) module is subsequently developed. In the SFE-GAF module, adaptive sampling is utilized to focus on true vessel morphology precisely. The adaptive process strengthens salient vascular features while significantly reducing background noise and computational overhead. Extensive experiments on the DRIVE, STARE, and CHASE_DB1 datasets validate that DB-KAUNet achieves leading segmentation performance and demonstrates exceptional robustness.

TL;DR: ScaleBridge-Det is the first large detection framework designed for tiny object detection in remote sensing imagery, achieving balanced performance across diverse scales through scale-adaptive expert routing and density-guided query allocation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tiny object detection in remote sensing faces challenges with balanced performance across diverse object scales, especially when dense tiny objects and large objects coexist. While large foundation models have revolutionized general vision tasks, they haven't been effectively applied to tiny object detection due to extreme scale variation and density distribution in remote sensing imagery.

Method: Proposes ScaleBridge-Det with two key modules: 1) Routing-Enhanced Mixture Attention (REM) that dynamically selects and fuses scale-specific expert features via adaptive routing to address MoE models' tendency to favor dominant scales, and 2) Density-Guided Dynamic Query (DGQ) module that predicts object density to adaptively adjust query positions and numbers for efficient resource allocation across scales.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on AI-TOD-V2 and DTOD datasets, while exhibiting superior cross-domain robustness on VisDrone dataset. The framework simultaneously optimizes performance for both dense tiny and general objects without trade-offs.

Conclusion: ScaleBridge-Det successfully bridges the scale gap in remote sensing object detection, providing the first large detection framework specifically designed for tiny objects that achieves balanced performance across diverse scales through innovative scale-adaptive mechanisms.

Abstract: Tiny object detection in remote sensing imagery has attracted significant research interest in recent years. Despite recent progress, achieving balanced detection performance across diverse object scales remains a formidable challenge, particularly in scenarios where dense tiny objects and large objects coexist. Although large foundation models have revolutionized general vision tasks, their application to tiny object detection remains unexplored due to the extreme scale variation and density distribution inherent to remote sensing imagery. To bridge this scale gap, we propose ScaleBridge-Det, to the best of our knowledge, the first large detection framework designed for tiny objects, which could achieve balanced performance across diverse scales through scale-adaptive expert routing and density-guided query allocation. Specifically, we introduce a Routing-Enhanced Mixture Attention (REM) module that dynamically selects and fuses scale-specific expert features via adaptive routing to address the tendency of standard MoE models to favor dominant scales. REM generates complementary and discriminative multi-scale representations suitable for both tiny and large objects. Furthermore, we present a Density-Guided Dynamic Query (DGQ) module that predicts object density to adaptively adjust query positions and numbers, enabling efficient resource allocation for objects of varying scales. The proposed framework allows ScaleBridge-Det to simultaneously optimize performance for both dense tiny and general objects without trade-offs. Extensive experiments on benchmark and cross-domain datasets demonstrate that ScaleBridge-Det achieves state-of-the-art performance on AI-TOD-V2 and DTOD, while exhibiting superior cross-domain robustness on VisDrone.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRASP addresses mode collapse in text-to-image diffusion models for long-tail medical imaging by using guided residual adapters with sample-wise partitioning to resolve gradient conflicts between frequent and rare classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models struggle with long-tail distributions like medical imaging where rare pathologies have limited data, causing mode collapse where tail-class outputs lack quality and diversity, undermining synthetic data augmentation for underrepresented conditions.

Method: GRASP (Guided Residual Adapters with Sample-wise Partitioning) uses external priors to statically partition samples into clusters minimizing intra-group gradient clashes, then fine-tunes pre-trained models by injecting cluster-specific residual adapters into transformer feedforward layers, bypassing learned gating for stability and efficiency.

Result: On MIMIC-CXR-LT dataset, GRASP yields superior FID and diversity metrics, especially for rare classes, outperforming baselines like vanilla fine-tuning and Mixture of Experts variants. Downstream classification on NIH-CXR-LT improves considerably for tail labels. Generalization to ImageNet-LT confirms broad applicability.

Conclusion: GRASP effectively resolves gradient conflicts in long-tail settings, producing high-quality diverse outputs for rare classes while being lightweight, scalable, and readily integrable with diffusion pipelines.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image diffusion models enable high-fidelity generation across diverse prompts. However, these models falter in long-tail settings, such as medical imaging, where rare pathologies comprise a small fraction of data. This results in mode collapse: tail-class outputs lack quality and diversity, undermining the goal of synthetic data augmentation for underrepresented conditions. We pinpoint gradient conflicts between frequent head and rare tail classes as the primary culprit, a factor unaddressed by existing sampling or conditioning methods that mainly steer inference without altering the learned distribution. To resolve this, we propose GRASP: Guided Residual Adapters with Sample-wise Partitioning. GRASP uses external priors to statically partition samples into clusters that minimize intra-group gradient clashes. It then fine-tunes pre-trained models by injecting cluster-specific residual adapters into transformer feedforward layers, bypassing learned gating for stability and efficiency. On the long-tail MIMIC-CXR-LT dataset, GRASP yields superior FID and diversity metrics, especially for rare classes, outperforming baselines like vanilla fine-tuning and Mixture of Experts variants. Downstream classification on NIH-CXR-LT improves considerably for tail labels. Generalization to ImageNet-LT confirms broad applicability.

Motivation: Current methods for hand-object interaction video generation face a dilemma between 2D and 3D representations - 2D lacks interaction fidelity while 3D lacks scalability. Existing HOI representations cannot simultaneously guarantee both scalability and interaction fidelity.

Method: Proposes a structure and contact-aware representation (SCAR) that captures hand-object contact, occlusion, and holistic structure context without 3D annotations. Introduces a joint-generation paradigm with share-and-specialization strategy that generates both interaction-oriented representations and videos.

Conclusion: The proposed SCAR representation and joint-generation paradigm effectively address the scalability-fidelity trade-off in HOI video generation, enabling learning of fine-grained interaction physics and generalization to open-world scenarios without 3D annotations.

Abstract: Generating realistic hand-object interactions (HOI) videos is a significant challenge due to the difficulty of modeling physical constraints (e.g., contact and occlusion between hands and manipulated objects). Current methods utilize HOI representation as an auxiliary generative objective to guide video synthesis. However, there is a dilemma between 2D and 3D representations that cannot simultaneously guarantee scalability and interaction fidelity. To address this limitation, we propose a structure and contact-aware representation that captures hand-object contact, hand-object occlusion, and holistic structure context without 3D annotations. This interaction-oriented and scalable supervision signal enables the model to learn fine-grained interaction physics and generalize to open-world scenarios. To fully exploit the proposed representation, we introduce a joint-generation paradigm with a share-and-specialization strategy that generates interaction-oriented representations and videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two real-world datasets in generating physics-realistic and temporally coherent HOI videos. Furthermore, our approach exhibits strong generalization to challenging open-world scenarios, highlighting the benefit of our scalable design. Our project page is https://hgzn258.github.io/SCAR/.

Method: Train a self-supervised encoder on resection tissue images, then apply it to biopsy material to extract meaningful morphological patterns for analysis

Result: The model successfully captures morphological patterns from biopsies and can predict patient survival and classify tumor subtypes

Conclusion: AI-driven tools trained on resection tissue can be effectively applied to biopsy material, demonstrating potential for supporting mesothelioma diagnosis and treatment planning in real clinical settings

Abstract: Accurate subtype classification and outcome prediction in mesothelioma are essential for guiding therapy and patient care. Most computational pathology models are trained on large tissue images from resection specimens, limiting their use in real-world settings where small biopsies are common. We show that a self-supervised encoder trained on resection tissue can be applied to biopsy material, capturing meaningful morphological patterns. Using these patterns, the model can predict patient survival and classify tumor subtypes. This approach demonstrates the potential of AI-driven tools to support diagnosis and treatment planning in mesothelioma.

*Patrick Kwon,Chen Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DreamingComics is a layout-aware story visualization framework that improves artistic consistency and spatial accuracy by integrating layout control with a pretrained video diffusion-transformer model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current story visualization methods position subjects solely by text and struggle with maintaining artistic consistency, lacking proper layout control for comic-style storytelling.

Method: Builds on pretrained video DiT model for spatiotemporal priors; proposes RegionalRoPE for layout-based position control; uses masked condition loss for regional feature constraints; integrates LLM-based layout generator for comic-style layouts from natural language.

Result: Achieves 29.2% increase in character consistency and 36.2% increase in style similarity compared to previous methods, with high spatial accuracy.

Conclusion: DreamingComics successfully addresses layout control and artistic consistency challenges in story visualization, enabling flexible comic-style generation from natural language scripts.

Abstract: Current story visualization methods tend to position subjects solely by text and face challenges in maintaining artistic consistency. To address these limitations, we introduce DreamingComics, a layout-aware story visualization framework. We build upon a pretrained video diffusion-transformer (DiT) model, leveraging its spatiotemporal priors to enhance identity and style consistency. For layout-based position control, we propose RegionalRoPE, a region-aware positional encoding scheme that re-indexes embeddings based on the target layout. Additionally, we introduce a masked condition loss to further constrain each subject's visual features to their designated region. To infer layouts from natural language scripts, we integrate an LLM-based layout generator trained to produce comic-style layouts, enabling flexible and controllable layout conditioning. We present a comprehensive evaluation of our approach, showing a 29.2% increase in character consistency and a 36.2% increase in style similarity compared to previous methods, while displaying high spatial accuracy.

*Xiuli Bi,Die Xiao,Junchao Fan,Bin Xiao*

TL;DR: SSR method addresses over-activation issues in CLIP-based WSSS using semantic and spatial rectification, achieving state-of-the-art performance on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CLIP-based weakly supervised semantic segmentation approaches suffer from over-activation in non-target foreground regions and background areas, limiting their segmentation accuracy.

Method: Proposes Semantic and Spatial Rectification (SSR) with two components: 1) Cross-Modal Prototype Alignment (CMPA) for semantic-level contrastive learning to align feature spaces across modalities and reduce inter-class overlap; 2) Superpixel-Guided Correction (SGC) for spatial-level filtering using superpixel-based priors to remove non-target region interference during affinity propagation.

Result: Outperforms all single-stage and more complex multi-stage approaches, achieving mIoU scores of 79.5% on PASCAL VOC and 50.6% on MS COCO datasets.

Conclusion: The SSR method effectively addresses over-activation problems in CLIP-based WSSS through semantic and spatial rectification, demonstrating superior performance and establishing new state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: In recent years, Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has been widely applied to Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) tasks due to its powerful cross-modal semantic understanding capabilities. This paper proposes a novel Semantic and Spatial Rectification (SSR) method to address the limitations of existing CLIP-based weakly supervised semantic segmentation approaches: over-activation in non-target foreground regions and background areas. Specifically, at the semantic level, the Cross-Modal Prototype Alignment (CMPA) establishes a contrastive learning mechanism to enforce feature space alignment across modalities, reducing inter-class overlap while enhancing semantic correlations, to rectify over-activation in non-target foreground regions effectively; at the spatial level, the Superpixel-Guided Correction (SGC) leverages superpixel-based spatial priors to precisely filter out interference from non-target regions during affinity propagation, significantly rectifying background over-activation. Extensive experiments on the PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms all single-stage approaches, as well as more complex multi-stage approaches, achieving mIoU scores of 79.5% and 50.6%, respectively.

TL;DR: StreamGaze is the first benchmark to evaluate MLLMs' ability to use human gaze signals for temporal and proactive reasoning in streaming videos, revealing significant performance gaps between models and humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing streaming benchmarks evaluate temporal reasoning but don't measure whether MLLMs can interpret or leverage human gaze signals, which is crucial for realistic applications like AR glasses that need to anticipate user intentions.

Method: Developed a gaze-video QA generation pipeline that aligns egocentric videos with raw gaze trajectories via fixation extraction, region-specific visual prompting, and scanpath construction to produce spatio-temporally grounded QA pairs reflecting human perceptual dynamics.

Result: Substantial performance gaps between state-of-the-art MLLMs and human performance across all StreamGaze tasks, revealing fundamental limitations in gaze-based temporal reasoning, intention modeling, and proactive prediction.

Conclusion: Current MLLMs struggle with gaze-guided streaming video understanding, and the benchmark provides detailed analyses of failure modes to guide development of future models with better gaze-based temporal reasoning and intention anticipation capabilities.

Abstract: Streaming video understanding requires models not only to process temporally incoming frames, but also to anticipate user intention for realistic applications like AR glasses. While prior streaming benchmarks evaluate temporal reasoning, none measure whether MLLMs can interpret or leverage human gaze signals within a streaming setting. To fill this gap, we introduce StreamGaze, the first benchmark designed to evaluate how effectively MLLMs use gaze for temporal and proactive reasoning in streaming videos. StreamGaze introduces gaze-guided past, present, and proactive tasks that comprehensively evaluate streaming video understanding. These tasks assess whether models can use real-time gaze to follow shifting attention and infer user intentions from only past and currently observed frames. To build StreamGaze, we develop a gaze-video QA generation pipeline that aligns egocentric videos with raw gaze trajectories via fixation extraction, region-specific visual prompting, and scanpath construction. This pipeline produces spatio-temporally grounded QA pairs that closely reflect human perceptual dynamics. Across all StreamGaze tasks, we observe substantial performance gaps between state-of-the-art MLLMs and human performance, revealing fundamental limitations in gaze-based temporal reasoning, intention modeling, and proactive prediction. We further provide detailed analyses of gaze-prompting strategies, reasoning behaviors, and task-specific failure modes, offering deeper insight into why current MLLMs struggle and what capabilities future models must develop. All data and code will be publicly released to support continued research in gaze-guided streaming video understanding.

*Yucheng Liao,Jiajun Liang,Kaiqian Cui,Baoquan Zhao,Haoran Xie,Wei Liu,Qing Li,Xudong Mao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreqEdit is a training-free framework that addresses quality degradation in multi-turn image editing by preserving high-frequency information through reference velocity field injection, adaptive spatial modulation, and path compensation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current instruction-based image editing models perform well on single edits but suffer severe quality degradation during multi-turn editing due to progressive loss of high-frequency information.

Method: FreqEdit uses three components: 1) high-frequency feature injection from reference velocity fields to preserve details, 2) adaptive injection strategy for spatial modulation of injection strength, and 3) path compensation mechanism to periodically recalibrate editing trajectory.

Result: FreqEdit enables stable editing across 10+ consecutive iterations and outperforms seven state-of-the-art baselines in both identity preservation and instruction following.

Conclusion: The paper presents an effective training-free solution to multi-turn image editing degradation by addressing high-frequency information loss, achieving superior performance through synergistic components.

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing through natural language has emerged as a powerful paradigm for intuitive visual manipulation. While recent models achieve impressive results on single edits, they suffer from severe quality degradation under multi-turn editing. Through systematic analysis, we identify progressive loss of high-frequency information as the primary cause of this quality degradation. We present FreqEdit, a training-free framework that enables stable editing across 10+ consecutive iterations. Our approach comprises three synergistic components: (1) high-frequency feature injection from reference velocity fields to preserve fine-grained details, (2) an adaptive injection strategy that spatially modulates injection strength for precise region-specific control, and (3) a path compensation mechanism that periodically recalibrates the editing trajectory to prevent over-constraint. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FreqEdit achieves superior performance in both identity preservation and instruction following compared to seven state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiconAgent is a GUI agent with History Context-aware Policy Optimization (HCPO) that efficiently uses historical context through dynamic sampling and compression techniques, achieving better performance with less computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GUI agents need historical context for sequential navigation, but naive use of full history causes computational overhead and distraction from irrelevant information.

Method: History Context-aware Policy Optimization (HCPO) with two components: 1) Dynamic Context Sampling (DCS) for variable length histories during sampling, and 2) Anchor-guided History Compression (AHC) with dual branches (compressed and uncompressed) coupled via history-enhanced alignment loss.

Result: HiconAgent-3B outperforms GUI-R1-7B by +8.46% grounding accuracy and +11.32% step success rate on GUI-Odyssey, achieves comparable results on AndroidControl and AITW with 2.47x speedup and 60% FLOPs reduction.

Conclusion: HCPO enables efficient and effective historical context utilization in GUI agents, delivering superior performance with reduced computational costs through adaptive context sampling and compression techniques.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents require effective use of historical context to perform sequential navigation tasks. While incorporating past actions and observations can improve decision making, naive use of full history leads to excessive computational overhead and distraction from irrelevant information. To address this, we introduce HiconAgent, a GUI agent trained with History Context-aware Policy Optimization (HCPO) for efficient and effective utilization of historical information. HCPO optimizes history usage in both sampling and policy updates through two complementary components: (1) Dynamic Context Sampling (DCS) presents the agent with variable length histories during sampling, enabling adaptive use of the most relevant context; (2) Anchor-guided History Compression (AHC) refines the policy update phase with a dual branch strategy where the compressed branch removes history observations while keeping history actions as information flow anchors. The compressed and uncompressed branches are coupled through a history-enhanced alignment loss to enforce consistent history usage while maintaining efficiency. Experiments on mainstream GUI navigation benchmarks demonstrate strong performance. Despite being smaller, HiconAgent-3B outperforms GUI-R1-7B by +8.46 percent grounding accuracy and +11.32 percent step success rate on GUI-Odyssey, while achieving comparable results on AndroidControl and AITW with up to 2.47x computational speedup and 60 percent FLOPs reduction.

### [203] [VideoScoop: A Non-Traditional Domain-Independent Framework For Video Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01769)
*Hafsa Billah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A general-purpose Video Situation Analysis framework using both relational and graph models to detect meaningful activities across domains like surveillance and assisted living.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video analysis focuses on content extraction but struggles with identifying meaningful activities/situations. Manual analysis is error-prone and labor-intensive, while existing algorithms are domain-specific and not general-purpose.

Method: Extract video contents using state-of-the-art techniques, represent them using extended relational model (R++) and graph models. Use Continuous Query Language for relational analysis and graph algorithms for complex situation detection. Create parameterized templates for domain independence.

Result: Extensive experiments across assisted living, civic monitoring, and surveillance domains show the approach is accurate, efficient, and robust with videos of varying lengths.

Conclusion: The proposed framework overcomes limitations of manual analysis and domain-specific algorithms by providing a general-purpose solution for video situation analysis across multiple domains.

Abstract: Automatically understanding video contents is important for several applications in Civic Monitoring (CM), general Surveillance (SL), Assisted Living (AL), etc. Decades of Image and Video Analysis (IVA) research have advanced tasks such as content extraction (e.g., object recognition and tracking). Identifying meaningful activities or situations (e.g., two objects coming closer) remains difficult and cannot be achieved by content extraction alone. Currently, Video Situation Analysis (VSA) is done manually with a human in the loop, which is error-prone and labor-intensive, or through custom algorithms designed for specific video types or situations. These algorithms are not general-purpose and require a new algorithm/software for each new situation or video from a new domain.
  This report proposes a general-purpose VSA framework that overcomes the above limitations. Video contents are extracted once using state-of-the-art Video Content Extraction technologies. They are represented using two alternative models -- the extended relational model (R++) and graph models. When represented using R++, the extracted contents can be used as data streams, enabling Continuous Query Processing via the proposed Continuous Query Language for Video Analysis. The graph models complement this by enabling the detection of situations that are difficult or impossible to detect using the relational model alone. Existing graph algorithms and newly developed algorithms support a wide variety of situation detection. To support domain independence, primitive situation variants across domains are identified and expressed as parameterized templates. Extensive experiments were conducted across several interesting situations from three domains -- AL, CM, and SL-- to evaluate the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of the proposed approach using a dataset of videos of varying lengths from these domains.

TL;DR: Proposes a medical image registration method using learnable edge kernels with rigid and non-rigid registration, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image registration faces challenges with contrast differences, spatial distortions, and modality-specific variations. Traditional methods struggle with these issues, requiring improved techniques for better multi-modal alignment in clinical applications.

Method: Integrates learnable edge kernels with learning-based rigid and non-rigid registration. Uses predefined edge detection kernels perturbed with random noise, which are learned during training to extract optimal edge features. Introduces four variant models for both rigid and non-rigid registration to analyze component contributions.

Result: Method consistently outperformed state-of-the-art techniques across all experiments: rigid registration (with/without skull removal), non-rigid registration on Medical University dataset, and two publicly available datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach with adaptive edge detection effectively improves multi-modal medical image alignment and anatomical structure analysis, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Medical image registration is crucial for various clinical and research applications including disease diagnosis or treatment planning which require alignment of images from different modalities, time points, or subjects. Traditional registration techniques often struggle with challenges such as contrast differences, spatial distortions, and modality-specific variations. To address these limitations, we propose a method that integrates learnable edge kernels with learning-based rigid and non-rigid registration techniques. Unlike conventional layers that learn all features without specific bias, our approach begins with a predefined edge detection kernel, which is then perturbed with random noise. These kernels are learned during training to extract optimal edge features tailored to the task. This adaptive edge detection enhances the registration process by capturing diverse structural features critical in medical imaging. To provide clearer insight into the contribution of each component in our design, we introduce four variant models for rigid registration and four variant models for non-rigid registration. We evaluated our approach using a dataset provided by the Medical University across three setups: rigid registration without skull removal, with skull removal, and non-rigid registration. Additionally, we assessed performance on two publicly available datasets. Across all experiments, our method consistently outperformed state-of-the-art techniques, demonstrating its potential to improve multi-modal image alignment and anatomical structure analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Extending SAM2 for Video Semantic Segmentation using two approaches: 1) using SAM2 to extract object masks with segmentation network refinement, and 2) extracting feature vectors from masks for classification, then combining results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM2 excels at video object segmentation but extending it to dense Video Semantic Segmentation (VSS) is challenging due to requirements for spatial accuracy, temporal consistency, and handling multiple objects with complex boundaries and varying scales.

Method: Two approaches: 1) Use SAM2 to extract unique object masks from images, with a segmentation network generating and refining initial predictions in parallel. 2) Extract feature vectors from predicted masks and feed them into a simple classification network, then combine classifications with masks for final segmentation.

Result: Experiments show that leveraging SAM2 enhances overall VSS performance, primarily due to its precise predictions of object boundaries.

Conclusion: SAM2 can be effectively extended for Video Semantic Segmentation, with its boundary prediction capabilities providing significant performance improvements despite the challenges of spatial accuracy and temporal consistency in dense VSS.

Abstract: The Segmentation Anything Model 2 (SAM2) has proven to be a powerful foundation model for promptable visual object segmentation in both images and videos, capable of storing object-aware memories and transferring them temporally through memory blocks. While SAM2 excels in video object segmentation by providing dense segmentation masks based on prompts, extending it to dense Video Semantic Segmentation (VSS) poses challenges due to the need for spatial accuracy, temporal consistency, and the ability to track multiple objects with complex boundaries and varying scales. This paper explores the extension of SAM2 for VSS, focusing on two primary approaches and highlighting firsthand observations and common challenges faced during this process. The first approach involves using SAM2 to extract unique objects as masks from a given image, with a segmentation network employed in parallel to generate and refine initial predictions. The second approach utilizes the predicted masks to extract unique feature vectors, which are then fed into a simple network for classification. The resulting classifications and masks are subsequently combined to produce the final segmentation. Our experiments suggest that leveraging SAM2 enhances overall performance in VSS, primarily due to its precise predictions of object boundaries.

TL;DR: Learned compression outperforms JPEG 2000 for large multi-channel EO imagery but traditional codecs remain competitive for small single-channel thermal data. Joint optimization doesn't improve over standalone models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of satellite Earth observation data creates challenges in transmission and storage, requiring efficient compression methods that preserve task-critical information.

Method: Compared traditional JPEG 2000 compression with learned compression (Discretized Mixed Gaussian Likelihood) on three EO segmentation tasks: fire, cloud, and building detection. Evaluated both standalone and joint end-to-end optimization approaches.

Result: Learned compression significantly outperforms JPEG 2000 for large-scale, multi-channel optical imagery in both reconstruction quality (PSNR) and segmentation accuracy. Traditional codecs remain competitive for smaller, single-channel thermal infrared datasets due to limited data and architectural constraints. Joint optimization doesn't improve performance over standalone models.

Conclusion: Learned compression is effective for large multi-channel EO data but traditional methods still have value for specific data types. Standalone optimization of compression and segmentation models is sufficient; joint optimization doesn't provide additional benefits.

Abstract: The rapid growth of data from satellite-based Earth observation (EO) systems poses significant challenges in data transmission and storage. We evaluate the potential of task-specific learned compression algorithms in this context to reduce data volumes while retaining crucial information. In detail, we compare traditional compression (JPEG 2000) versus a learned compression approach (Discretized Mixed Gaussian Likelihood) on three EO segmentation tasks: Fire, cloud, and building detection. Learned compression notably outperforms JPEG 2000 for large-scale, multi-channel optical imagery in both reconstruction quality (PSNR) and segmentation accuracy. However, traditional codecs remain competitive on smaller, single-channel thermal infrared datasets due to limited data and architectural constraints. Additionally, joint end-to-end optimization of compression and segmentation models does not improve performance over standalone optimization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel evaluation metric for video generation that uses learned latent space of real-world human actions to assess visual and temporal correctness, addressing appearance bias in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video evaluation metrics using vision encoders and MLLMs are appearance-biased and lack temporal understanding, struggling to assess complex human action dynamics and anatomical plausibility in generated videos.

Method: Fuses appearance-agnostic human skeletal geometry features with appearance-based features to capture real-world motion nuances, constraints, and temporal smoothness. Measures distance between generated video representations and learned real-world action distribution.

Result: Achieves over 68% improvement compared to state-of-the-art methods on their new benchmark, performs competitively on established external benchmarks, and shows stronger correlation with human perception.

Conclusion: The metric addresses critical limitations in current video generative models and establishes a new standard for advanced video generation research by providing robust evaluation of human action fidelity.

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in video generative models, robust metrics for evaluating visual and temporal correctness of complex human actions remain elusive. Critically, existing pure-vision encoders and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are strongly appearance-biased, lack temporal understanding, and thus struggle to discern intricate motion dynamics and anatomical implausibilities in generated videos. We tackle this gap by introducing a novel evaluation metric derived from a learned latent space of real-world human actions. Our method first captures the nuances, constraints, and temporal smoothness of real-world motion by fusing appearance-agnostic human skeletal geometry features with appearance-based features. We posit that this combined feature space provides a robust representation of action plausibility. Given a generated video, our metric quantifies its action quality by measuring the distance between its underlying representations and this learned real-world action distribution. For rigorous validation, we develop a new multi-faceted benchmark specifically designed to probe temporally challenging aspects of human action fidelity. Through extensive experiments, we show that our metric achieves substantial improvement of more than 68% compared to existing state-of-the-art methods on our benchmark, performs competitively on established external benchmarks, and has a stronger correlation with human perception. Our in-depth analysis reveals critical limitations in current video generative models and establishes a new standard for advanced research in video generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Envision, a benchmark for evaluating text-to-multi-image generation models on causal event progression, revealing that current models overfit to static pattern matching and struggle with dynamic world modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal models rely on static, single-image generation tasks which lead to overfitting to static pattern matching and semantic fusion, fundamentally limiting their ability to model dynamic processes that unfold over time. This focus on causally-isolated single images impedes multi-frame reasoning and generation.

Method: Proposed Envision - a causal event progression benchmark for chained text-to-multi-image generation, grounded in world knowledge and structured by spatiotemporal causality. Includes 1,000 four-stage prompts across six scientific and humanities domains. Introduced Envision-Score, a holistic metric integrating multi-dimensional consistency, physicality, and aesthetics for evaluating sequential frames.

Result: Evaluation of 15 models (10 specialized T2I, 5 unified) shows: specialized T2I models excel in aesthetic rendering but lack intrinsic world knowledge; unified multimodal models outperform specialized ones in causal narrative coherence but still lag behind closed-source models and struggle with spatiotemporal consistency.

Conclusion: Focus on static single-image generation promotes pattern matching over dynamic world modeling, limiting world knowledge internalization and generation. The benchmark reveals fundamental limitations in current models' ability to handle causal-temporal constraints and dynamic processes.

Abstract: Current multimodal models aim to transcend the limitations of single-modality representations by unifying understanding and generation, often using text-to-image (T2I) tasks to calibrate semantic consistency. However, their reliance on static, single-image generation in training and evaluation leads to overfitting to static pattern matching and semantic fusion, while fundamentally hindering their ability to model dynamic processes that unfold over time. To address these constraints, we propose Envision-a causal event progression benchmark for chained text-to-multi-image generation. Grounded in world knowledge and structured by spatiotemporal causality, it reorganizes existing evaluation dimensions and includes 1,000 four-stage prompts spanning six scientific and humanities domains. To transition evaluation from single images to sequential frames and assess whether models truly internalize world knowledge while adhering to causal-temporal constraints, we introduce Envision-Score, a holistic metric integrating multi-dimensional consistency, physicality, and aesthetics. Comprehensive evaluation of 15 models (10 specialized T2I models, 5 unified models) uncovers: specialized T2I models demonstrate proficiency in aesthetic rendering yet lack intrinsic world knowledge. Unified multimodal models bridge this gap, consistently outperforming specialized counterparts in causal narrative coherence. However, even these unified architectures remain subordinate to closed-source models and struggle to overcome the core challenge of spatiotemporal consistency. This demonstrates that a focus on causally-isolated single images impedes multi-frame reasoning and generation, promoting static pattern matching over dynamic world modeling-ultimately limiting world knowledge internalization, generation.

TL;DR: MILO introduces an implicit spatial world modeling paradigm with visual generator feedback and RePE encoding to improve MLLMs' spatial reasoning by grounding symbolic reasoning in perceptual experience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs suffer from visual illiteracy in spatial reasoning - they learn spatial concepts through textual symbols alone without connection to visual manifestations, limiting their ability to understand 3D structure.

Method: MILO integrates a visual generator for geometry-aware feedback to implicitly ground symbolic reasoning in perception. RePE (Relative Positional Encoding) captures relative camera-pose transformations instead of absolute coordinates. GeoGen dataset with 2,241 videos and 67,827 observation-action-outcome triplets supports training.

Result: The approach significantly enhances spatial reasoning capabilities across multiple baselines and benchmarks, offering more holistic understanding of 3D space.

Conclusion: MILO's implicit spatial world modeling paradigm successfully bridges the gap between symbolic reasoning and visual perception in MLLMs, advancing spatial reasoning capabilities through geometry-aware feedback and relative positional encoding.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning, the ability to understand and interpret the 3D structure of the world, is a critical yet underdeveloped capability in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Current methods predominantly rely on verbal descriptive tuning, which suffers from visual illiteracy, i.e., they learn spatial concepts through textual symbols alone, devoid of connection to their visual manifestations. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces MILO, an Implicit spatIaL wOrld modeling paradigm that simulates human-like spatial imagination. MILO integrates a visual generator to provide geometry-aware feedback, thereby implicitly grounding the MLLM's symbolic reasoning in perceptual experience. Complementing this paradigm, we propose RePE (Relative Positional Encoding), a novel encoding scheme that captures relative camera-pose transformations, offering superior performance over absolute coordinate systems. To support the training, we construct GeoGen, a large-scale Geometry-aware Generative dataset with approximately 2,241 videos and 67,827 observation-action-outcome triplets. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances spatial reasoning capabilities across multiple baselines and benchmarks, offering a more holistic understanding of 3D space.

Abstract: Causal thinking enables humans to understand not just what is seen, but why it happens. To replicate this capability in modern AI systems, we introduce the task of visual causal discovery. It requires models to infer cause-and-effect relations among visual entities across diverse scenarios instead of merely perceiving their presence. To this end, we first construct the Visual Causal Graph dataset (VCG-32K), a large-scale collection of over 32,000 images annotated with entity-level causal graphs, and further develop CauSight, a novel vision-language model to perform visual causal discovery through causally aware reasoning. Our training recipe integrates three components: (1) training data curation from VCG-32K, (2) Tree-of-Causal-Thought (ToCT) for synthesizing reasoning trajectories, and (3) reinforcement learning with a designed causal reward to refine the reasoning policy. Experiments show that CauSight outperforms GPT-4.1 on visual causal discovery, achieving over a threefold performance boost (21% absolute gain). Our code, model, and dataset are fully open-sourced at project page: https://github.com/OpenCausaLab/CauSight.

### [212] [OpenREAD: Reinforced Open-Ended Reasoing for End-to-End Autonomous Driving with LLM-as-Critic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01830)
*Songyan Zhang,Wenhui Huang,Zhan Chen,Chua Jiahao Collister,Qihang Huang,Chen Lv*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OpenREAD is an end-to-end reinforcement fine-tuning framework for vision-language autonomous driving models that addresses limitations in reasoning generalization and reward quantification for open-ended scene understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current two-stage fine-tuning approaches for autonomous driving have limitations: SFT restricts reasoning generalization, and RFT is difficult to apply to open-ended scene understanding problems due to challenges in quantifying rewards for reasoning quality.

Method: Proposes OpenREAD framework with: 1) Large-scale Chain-of-Thought annotations on driving knowledge datasets, 2) Using Qwen3 LLM as critic in RFT to quantify reasoning quality for open-ended questions, 3) End-to-end RFT from high-level reasoning to low-level trajectory planning.

Result: Extensive experiments show joint end-to-end RFT yields substantial improvements in both upstream and downstream tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on reasoning and planning benchmarks.

Conclusion: OpenREAD successfully enables end-to-end reinforcement fine-tuning across the full spectrum of autonomous driving tasks, overcoming limitations of current approaches and demonstrating superior performance through joint optimization of reasoning and planning.

Abstract: Recently, two-stage fine-tuning strategies, e.g., acquiring essential driving knowledge through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and further enhancing decision-making and planning via reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), have shown strong potential in advancing the knowledge-driven autonomous driving (AD) paradigm. However, the learning nature of SFT still limits the generalization of reasoning, thereby constraining the full potential of driving performance. Meanwhile, current RFT approaches are primarily applied to downstream tasks, since scene understanding is an open-ended problem where corresponding rewards are difficult to quantify. To address these limitations, we propose OpenREAD, an OPEN-ended REasoning reinforced vision-language model (VLM)-based autonomous driving (AD) framework that enables end-to-end RFT across the full spectrum from high-level reasoning to low-level trajectory planning. Specifically, we begin by constructing large-scale Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations on open-source driving-related knowledge datasets, and employ the powerful Qwen3 large language model (LLM) as the critic in RFT to quantify reasoning quality for open-ended questions during reward modeling. Extensive experiments confirm that joint end-to-end RFT yields substantial improvements in both upstream and downstream tasks, enabling OpenREAD to achieve state-of-the-art performance on reasoning and planning benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PhyDetEx, a fine-tuned Vision-Language Model for detecting physical implausibility in Text-to-Video generation and providing explanations of violated physical principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While T2V models have improved in quality and scale, their ability to understand physics and generate physically plausible videos remains questionable. Current VLMs struggle to identify physically impossible content, creating a need for better evaluation methods.

Method: Constructed a PID dataset with 500 annotated test videos and 2,588 training pairs where implausible videos are created by rewriting captions to induce physical violations. Fine-tuned VLMs to detect implausibility and explain violated physical principles.

Result: Created PhyDetEx, a lightweight fine-tuned VLM that serves as both detector and explainer. Benchmarking shows T2V models still struggle with physical plausibility, especially open-source models, despite recent progress.

Conclusion: Understanding and adhering to physical laws remains challenging for T2V models. The proposed PhyDetEx provides a valuable tool for evaluating physical plausibility, with dataset and code publicly available for further research.

Abstract: Driven by the growing capacity and training scale, Text-to-Video (T2V) generation models have recently achieved substantial progress in video quality, length, and instruction-following capability. However, whether these models can understand physics and generate physically plausible videos remains a question. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been widely used as general-purpose evaluators in various applications, they struggle to identify the physically impossible content from generated videos. To investigate this issue, we construct a \textbf{PID} (\textbf{P}hysical \textbf{I}mplausibility \textbf{D}etection) dataset, which consists of a \textit{test split} of 500 manually annotated videos and a \textit{train split} of 2,588 paired videos, where each implausible video is generated by carefully rewriting the caption of its corresponding real-world video to induce T2V models producing physically implausible content. With the constructed dataset, we introduce a lightweight fine-tuning approach, enabling VLMs to not only detect physically implausible events but also generate textual explanations on the violated physical principles. Taking the fine-tuned VLM as a physical plausibility detector and explainer, namely \textbf{PhyDetEx}, we benchmark a series of state-of-the-art T2V models to assess their adherence to physical laws. Our findings show that although recent T2V models have made notable progress toward generating physically plausible content, understanding and adhering to physical laws remains a challenging issue, especially for open-source models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel point cloud registration method that treats registration as conditional generation, using learned velocity fields to transport noisy points to registered scenes, achieving SOTA results especially with low overlap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional registration methods rely on correspondence matching and pairwise transformation optimization, which can be suboptimal for multi-view registration and challenging low-overlap scenarios. The authors propose a more direct approach.

Method: Cast registration as conditional generation: learn a continuous, point-wise velocity field that transports noisy points to a registered scene, then recover poses from the generated scene. Uses lightweight local feature extractor and test-time rigidity enforcement.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on pairwise and multi-view registration benchmarks, particularly with low overlap. Generalizes across scales and sensor modalities, and supports downstream tasks like relocalization, multi-robot SLAM, and map merging.

Conclusion: The conditional generation approach to point cloud registration offers superior performance over traditional correspondence-based methods, especially in challenging low-overlap scenarios, with broad applicability across various 3D vision tasks.

Abstract: Point cloud registration aligns multiple unposed point clouds into a common frame, and is a core step for 3D reconstruction and robot localization. In this work, we cast registration as conditional generation: a learned continuous, point-wise velocity field transports noisy points to a registered scene, from which the pose of each view is recovered. Unlike previous methods that conduct correspondence matching to estimate the transformation between a pair of point clouds and then optimize the pairwise transformations to realize multi-view registration, our model directly generates the registered point cloud. With a lightweight local feature extractor and test-time rigidity enforcement, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on pairwise and multi-view registration benchmarks, particularly with low overlap, and generalizes across scales and sensor modalities. It further supports downstream tasks including relocalization, multi-robot SLAM, and multi-session map merging. Source code available at: https://github.com/PRBonn/RAP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing end-to-end models struggle with temporal hierarchy in sports video analysis, lacking generalization, having high development costs for new tasks, and poor interpretability.

Method: Proposes a reconfigurable Multi-Agent System where each agent functions as a specialized "cognitive tool" for specific analysis aspects, using iterative invocation and flexible composition to create adaptive pipelines.

Result: Demonstrated adaptability using two representative badminton analysis tasks, showing ability to bridge fine-grained event detection and global semantic organization.

Conclusion: Presents a paradigm shift toward flexible, scalable, and interpretable systems for robust, cross-task sports video intelligence.

Abstract: Intelligent sports video analysis demands a comprehensive understanding of temporal context, from micro-level actions to macro-level game strategies. Existing end-to-end models often struggle with this temporal hierarchy, offering solutions that lack generalization, incur high development costs for new tasks, and suffer from poor interpretability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a reconfigurable Multi-Agent System (MAS) as a foundational framework for sports video understanding. In our system, each agent functions as a distinct "cognitive tool" specializing in a specific aspect of analysis. The system's architecture is not confined to a single temporal dimension or task. By leveraging iterative invocation and flexible composition of these agents, our framework can construct adaptive pipelines for both short-term analytic reasoning (e.g., Rally QA) and long-term generative summarization (e.g., match summaries). We demonstrate the adaptability of this framework using two representative tasks in badminton analysis, showcasing its ability to bridge fine-grained event detection and global semantic organization. This work presents a paradigm shift towards a flexible, scalable, and interpretable system for robust, cross-task sports video intelligence.The project homepage is available at https://aiden1020.github.io/COACH-project-page

TL;DR: TransientTrack is a deep learning framework for cell tracking in multi-channel microscopy videos with transient fluorescent signals, capable of detecting cell division and death events to build complete cell lineages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current cell tracking methods are limited to videos with constant signals and cannot detect critical events like cell death, making them inadequate for studying dynamic cellular processes like circadian rhythms or drug responses.

Method: Uses deep learning with Transformer Networks for cell detection embeddings, performs multi-stage matching using all detection boxes, and interpolates missing tracklets with Kalman Filter. Lightweight approach matches directly on embeddings without tracking-specific feature quantification.

Result: Achieves strong performance across diverse conditions, effectively tracks cells while capturing cell division and death events. Demonstrated in single-cell analysis of chemotherapeutic drug efficacy.

Conclusion: TransientTrack enables detailed quantitative studies of cancer cell dynamics, characterization of treatment responses and resistance mechanisms, advancing single-cell analysis capabilities.

Abstract: Tracking cells in time-lapse videos is an essential technique for monitoring cell population dynamics at a single-cell level. Current methods for cell tracking are developed on videos with mostly single, constant signals and do not detect pivotal events such as cell death. Here, we present TransientTrack, a deep learning-based framework for cell tracking in multi-channel microscopy video data with transient fluorescent signals that fluctuate over time following processes such as the circadian rhythm of cells. By identifying key cellular events - mitosis (cell division) and apoptosis (cell death) our method allows us to build complete trajectories, including cell lineage information. TransientTrack is lightweight and performs matching on cell detection embeddings directly, without the need for quantification of tracking-specific cell features. Furthermore, our approach integrates Transformer Networks, multi-stage matching using all detection boxes, and the interpolation of missing tracklets with the Kalman Filter. This unified framework achieves strong performance across diverse conditions, effectively tracking cells and capturing cell division and death. We demonstrate the use of TransientTrack in an analysis of the efficacy of a chemotherapeutic drug at a single-cell level. The proposed framework could further advance quantitative studies of cancer cell dynamics, enabling detailed characterization of treatment response and resistance mechanisms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SLAM systems often require depth sensors, offline calibration, or lack robustness in dynamic scenes. There's a need for systems that can operate online with uncalibrated monocular cameras while handling moving objects, especially for ego-centric applications and harvesting internet-scale video data.

Method: KM-ViPE tightly couples DINO visual features with geometric constraints using a high-level features based adaptive robust kernel. It handles both moving objects and movable static objects by fusing geometric and deep visual features aligned with language embeddings for simultaneous online localization and open-vocabulary semantic mapping.

Result: The system achieves competitive results with state-of-the-art approaches while operating online with uncalibrated monocular input. It uniquely combines online operation, uncalibrated monocular input, and robust handling of dynamic scenes.

Conclusion: KM-ViPE advances practical spatial intelligence for embodied AI, making it suitable for autonomous robotics and AR/VR applications by enabling real-time SLAM in dynamic environments without requiring depth sensors or offline calibration.

Abstract: We present KM-ViPE (Knowledge Mapping Video Pose Engine), a real-time open-vocabulary SLAM framework for uncalibrated monocular cameras in dynamic environments. Unlike systems requiring depth sensors and offline calibration, KM-ViPE operates directly on raw RGB streams, making it ideal for ego-centric applications and harvesting internet-scale video data for training. KM-ViPE tightly couples DINO visual features with geometric constraints through a high-level features based adaptive robust kernel that handles both moving objects and movable static objects (e.g., moving furniture in ego-centric views). The system performs simultaneous online localization and open-vocabulary semantic mapping by fusing geometric and deep visual features aligned with language embeddings. Our results are competitive with state-of-the-art approaches, while existing solutions either operate offline, need depth data and/or odometry estimation, or lack dynamic scene robustness. KM-ViPE benefits from internet-scale training and uniquely combines online operation, uncalibrated monocular input, and robust handling of dynamic scenes, which makes it a good fit for autonomous robotics and AR/VR applications and advances practical spatial intelligence capabilities for embodied AI.

Motivation: Existing methods for cross-domain face retargeting either fail to generalize across domains, require test-time optimizations, or need fine-tuning with carefully curated multi-style datasets to achieve domain-invariant identity representations.

Method: Proposes an efficient data augmentation strategy alongside a dual-encoder framework to extract domain-invariant identity cues and capture domain-specific stylistic variations, then conditions a diffusion model with these disentangled control signals for retargeting facial expressions across domains.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that StyleYourSmile achieves superior identity preservation and retargeting fidelity across a wide range of visual domains.

Conclusion: StyleYourSmile provides an effective solution for cross-domain face retargeting that eliminates the need for curated multi-style paired data while maintaining strong performance across diverse domains.

Abstract: Cross-domain face retargeting requires disentangled control over identity, expressions, and domain-specific stylistic attributes.

### [219] [SARL: Spatially-Aware Self-Supervised Representation Learning for Visuo-Tactile Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01908)
*Gurmeher Khurana,Lan Wei,Dandan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SARL is a spatially-aware self-supervised learning framework for fused visual-tactile data that preserves spatial structure through map-level objectives, outperforming existing SSL methods on robotic manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contact-rich robotic manipulation needs representations that preserve local geometry. While fused visual-tactile sensors provide aligned inputs, most SSL frameworks compress spatial features into global vectors, losing the spatial structure crucial for manipulation tasks.

Method: SARL extends BYOL architecture with three map-level objectives: Saliency Alignment (SAL) for attentional focus consistency, Patch-Prototype Distribution Alignment (PPDA) for part composition consistency, and Region Affinity Matching (RAM) for geometric relation consistency across views.

Result: SARL outperforms nine SSL baselines across six downstream tasks. On geometry-sensitive edge-pose regression, it achieves 0.3955 MAE (30% improvement over next-best SSL method at 0.5682 MAE), approaching supervised upper bound performance.

Conclusion: For fused visual-tactile data, structured spatial equivariance (features varying predictably with object geometry) is the most effective signal for robotic perception, enabling more capable manipulation through preservation of spatial structure.

Abstract: Contact-rich robotic manipulation requires representations that encode local geometry. Vision provides global context but lacks direct measurements of properties such as texture and hardness, whereas touch supplies these cues. Modern visuo-tactile sensors capture both modalities in a single fused image, yielding intrinsically aligned inputs that are well suited to manipulation tasks requiring visual and tactile information. Most self-supervised learning (SSL) frameworks, however, compress feature maps into a global vector, discarding spatial structure and misaligning with the needs of manipulation. To address this, we propose SARL, a spatially-aware SSL framework that augments the Bootstrap Your Own Latent (BYOL) architecture with three map-level objectives, including Saliency Alignment (SAL), Patch-Prototype Distribution Alignment (PPDA), and Region Affinity Matching (RAM), to keep attentional focus, part composition, and geometric relations consistent across views. These losses act on intermediate feature maps, complementing the global objective. SARL consistently outperforms nine SSL baselines across six downstream tasks with fused visual-tactile data. On the geometry-sensitive edge-pose regression task, SARL achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.3955, a 30% relative improvement over the next-best SSL method (0.5682 MAE) and approaching the supervised upper bound. These findings indicate that, for fused visual-tactile data, the most effective signal is structured spatial equivariance, in which features vary predictably with object geometry, which enables more capable robotic perception.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Med-VCD is a sparse visual-contrastive decoding method that reduces hallucinations in medical vision-language models without slowing inference, improving factual accuracy by 13% and hallucination accuracy by 6% across medical domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical LVLMs suffer from hallucination problems where they generate plausible but incorrect outputs. Existing solutions from natural image domains are slow (require secondary decoding) and may not transfer well to medical domains, potentially causing modality misalignment.

Method: Med-VCD uses sparse visual-contrastive decoding with a novel token-sparsification strategy that dynamically selects visually informed tokens during generation. This approach trims redundancy while preserving critical visual context, balancing efficiency with reliability without secondary decoding overhead.

Result: Evaluated on eight medical datasets spanning ophthalmology, radiology, and pathology tasks (VQA, report generation, hallucination benchmarks). Med-VCD improves factual accuracy by average 13% and hallucination accuracy by 6% compared to baseline medical LVLMs.

Conclusion: Med-VCD effectively mitigates hallucinations in medical LVLMs without inference slowdown, demonstrating significant accuracy improvements across diverse medical imaging tasks while maintaining efficiency through token-sparsification.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are now central to healthcare applications such as medical visual question answering and imaging report generation. Yet, these models remain vulnerable to hallucination outputs that appear plausible but are in fact incorrect. In the natural image domain, several decoding strategies have been proposed to mitigate hallucinations by reinforcing visual evidence, but most rely on secondary decoding or rollback procedures that substantially slow inference. Moreover, existing solutions are often domain-specific and may introduce misalignment between modalities or between generated and ground-truth content. We introduce Med-VCD, a sparse visual-contrastive decoding method that mitigates hallucinations in medical LVLMs without the time overhead of secondary decoding. Med-VCD incorporates a novel token-sparsification strategy that selects visually informed tokens on the fly, trimming redundancy while retaining critical visual context and thus balancing efficiency with reliability. Evaluations on eight medical datasets, spanning ophthalmology, radiology, and pathology tasks in visual question answering, report generation, and dedicated hallucination benchmarks, show that Med-VCD raises factual accuracy by an average of 13\% and improves hallucination accuracy by 6\% relative to baseline medical LVLMs.

TL;DR: AdvTraj: First online physical ID-manipulation attack against MOT using adversarial trajectories to transfer attacker's ID to targeted objects, bypassing object detection vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous MOT attacks were limited to hijacking individual trackers or attacking object detection modules, being model-specific, non-robust, and only effective on offline datasets. There's a need to explore vulnerabilities in the object association phase of MOT systems.

Method: AdvTraj uses adversarial trajectories to transfer attacker's ID to targeted objects without attacking object detection. It generates attack patterns that can be performed by human walkers/drivers in daily scenarios, focusing on the tracking-by-detection MOT framework.

Result: 100% success rate in white-box attacks against SORT in CARLA simulations, with high transferability (up to 93% success) against SOTA MOT algorithms. Identified two universal adversarial maneuvers that can be executed in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: The work reveals unexplored weaknesses in object association phases of MOT systems, demonstrating that adversarial trajectories can effectively manipulate ID assignments, providing insights for enhancing MOT robustness against such attacks.

Abstract: Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) is a critical task in computer vision, with applications ranging from surveillance systems to autonomous driving. However, threats to MOT algorithms have yet been widely studied. In particular, incorrect association between the tracked objects and their assigned IDs can lead to severe consequences, such as wrong trajectory predictions. Previous attacks against MOT either focused on hijacking the trackers of individual objects, or manipulating the tracker IDs in MOT by attacking the integrated object detection (OD) module in the digital domain, which are model-specific, non-robust, and only able to affect specific samples in offline datasets. In this paper, we present AdvTraj, the first online and physical ID-manipulation attack against tracking-by-detection MOT, in which an attacker uses adversarial trajectories to transfer its ID to a targeted object to confuse the tracking system, without attacking OD. Our simulation results in CARLA show that AdvTraj can fool ID assignments with 100% success rate in various scenarios for white-box attacks against SORT, which also have high attack transferability (up to 93% attack success rate) against state-of-the-art (SOTA) MOT algorithms due to their common design principles. We characterize the patterns of trajectories generated by AdvTraj and propose two universal adversarial maneuvers that can be performed by a human walker/driver in daily scenarios. Our work reveals under-explored weaknesses in the object association phase of SOTA MOT systems, and provides insights into enhancing the robustness of such systems.

TL;DR: Script is a plug-and-play pruning method for MLLMs that removes redundant visual tokens without retraining, achieving up to 6.8x speedup and 10x FLOP reduction while maintaining 96.88% of original performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal large language models suffer from excessive memory consumption and inference latency due to rapid growth of visual tokens, especially with high-resolution images and videos. Existing token pruning methods ignore query relevance or suffer from attention mechanism limitations.

Method: Script uses two modules: (1) graph-structured pruning module that removes visually redundant tokens, and (2) query-conditioned semantic pruning module that preserves query-relevant visual information. It's plug-and-play, requires no retraining, and generalizes across diverse MLLMs.

Result: Experiments on 14 benchmarks across image and video understanding tasks show Script consistently achieves higher efficiency and accuracy than existing pruning methods. On LLaVA-NeXT-7B: up to 6.8x prefill speedup, 10x FLOP reduction, while retaining 96.88% of original performance.

Conclusion: Script effectively addresses visual token redundancy in MLLMs through dual pruning modules, offering significant efficiency improvements without performance degradation, making it a practical solution for real-world multimodal applications.

Abstract: The rapid growth of visual tokens in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) leads to excessive memory consumption and inference latency, especially when handling high-resolution images and videos. Token pruning is a technique used to mitigate this issue by removing redundancy, but existing methods often ignore relevance to the user query or suffer from the limitations of attention mechanisms, reducing their adaptability and effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose Script, a plug-and-play pruning method that requires no retraining and generalizes across diverse MLLMs. Script comprises two modules: a graph-structured pruning module that removes visually redundant tokens, and a query-conditioned semantic pruning module that preserves query-relevant visual information. Together, they enhance performance on multimodal tasks. Experiments on fourteen benchmarks across image and video understanding tasks show that Script consistently achieves higher model efficiency and predictive accuracy compared to existing pruning methods. On LLaVA-NeXT-7B, it achieves up to 6.8x prefill speedup and 10x FLOP reduction, while retaining 96.88% of the original performance.

TL;DR: RLWG is a self-supervised post-training framework that aligns pretrained video world models with geometric grounding using verifiable rewards, enabling better spatial coherence and navigation stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video world models lack geometric grounding despite high visual fidelity, limiting their usefulness in navigation tasks that require spatial coherence and long-horizon stability.

Method: Reinforcement Learning with World Grounding (RLWG) uses self-supervised post-training with geometric and perceptual rewards (pose cycle-consistency, depth reprojection, temporal coherence). GrndCtrl implements this using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for reward-aligned adaptation.

Result: The approach yields world models that maintain stable trajectories, consistent geometry, and reliable rollouts for embodied navigation, achieving superior spatial coherence and navigation stability over supervised fine-tuning in outdoor environments.

Conclusion: RLWG bridges generative pretraining and grounded behavior through verifiable rewards, analogous to RLVR in language models, enabling geometrically grounded world models for navigation tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in video world modeling have enabled large-scale generative models to simulate embodied environments with high visual fidelity, providing strong priors for prediction, planning, and control. Yet, despite their realism, these models often lack geometric grounding, limiting their use in navigation tasks that require spatial coherence and long-horizon stability. We introduce Reinforcement Learning with World Grounding (RLWG), a self-supervised post-training framework that aligns pretrained world models with a physically verifiable structure through geometric and perceptual rewards. Analogous to reinforcement learning from verifiable feedback (RLVR) in language models, RLWG can use multiple rewards that measure pose cycle-consistency, depth reprojection, and temporal coherence. We instantiate this framework with GrndCtrl, a reward-aligned adaptation method based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), yielding world models that maintain stable trajectories, consistent geometry, and reliable rollouts for embodied navigation. Like post-training alignment in large language models, GrndCtrl leverages verifiable rewards to bridge generative pretraining and grounded behavior, achieving superior spatial coherence and navigation stability over supervised fine-tuning in outdoor environments.

TL;DR: SpriteHand is an autoregressive video generation framework for real-time synthesis of hand-object interaction videos across diverse object types, using static object images and hand video streams as input.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current simulation-based approaches are inadequate for capturing dynamic interactions with non-rigid or articulated entities like deformable fabrics, elastic materials, hinge-based structures, furry surfaces, or living creatures, as they rely on explicitly defined rigid object models and pre-scripted hand gestures.

Method: SpriteHand employs a causal inference architecture for autoregressive generation and leverages a hybrid post-training approach to enhance visual realism and temporal coherence. It takes as input a static object image and a video stream where hands are imagined to interact with the virtual object embedded in a real-world scene.

Result: The 1.3B model supports real-time streaming generation at around 18 FPS and 640x368 resolution, with approximately 150 ms latency on a single NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPU, and more than a minute of continuous output. Experiments show superior visual quality, physical plausibility, and interaction fidelity compared to both generative and engine-based baselines.

Conclusion: SpriteHand presents a novel autoregressive video generation framework that enables real-time synthesis of versatile hand-object interactions across diverse object types, overcoming limitations of conventional simulation-based approaches.

Abstract: Modeling and synthesizing complex hand-object interactions remains a significant challenge, even for state-of-the-art physics engines. Conventional simulation-based approaches rely on explicitly defined rigid object models and pre-scripted hand gestures, making them inadequate for capturing dynamic interactions with non-rigid or articulated entities such as deformable fabrics, elastic materials, hinge-based structures, furry surfaces, or even living creatures. In this paper, we present SpriteHand, an autoregressive video generation framework for real-time synthesis of versatile hand-object interaction videos across a wide range of object types and motion patterns. SpriteHand takes as input a static object image and a video stream in which the hands are imagined to interact with the virtual object embedded in a real-world scene, and generates corresponding hand-object interaction effects in real time. Our model employs a causal inference architecture for autoregressive generation and leverages a hybrid post-training approach to enhance visual realism and temporal coherence. Our 1.3B model supports real-time streaming generation at around 18 FPS and 640x368 resolution, with an approximate 150 ms latency on a single NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPU, and more than a minute of continuous output. Experiments demonstrate superior visual quality, physical plausibility, and interaction fidelity compared to both generative and engine-based baselines.

*Xu Zhang,Jin Yuan,Hanwang Zhang,Guojin Zhong,Yongsheng Zang,Jiacheng Lin,Zhiyong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SegCaptioning: A new task that translates simple prompts (like bounding boxes) into diverse (caption, mask) pairs, enabling flexible semantic interpretation with minimal user input.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current controllable image understanding tasks require expensive prompt inputs (text/boxes) but output limited information. There's a need for a system that can generate diverse semantic interpretations from minimal prompts, allowing users to select preferred results.

Method: Proposes Scene Graph Guided Diffusion Model (SGDiff): 1) Prompt-Centric Scene Graph Adaptor maps user prompts to scene graphs to capture intention; 2) Diffusion process with Scene Graph Guided Bimodal Transformer predicts correlated caption-mask pairs; 3) Multi-Entities Contrastive Learning loss aligns visual and textual entities for accurate alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments on two datasets show SGDiff achieves superior performance in SegCaptioning, producing promising results for both captioning and segmentation tasks with minimal prompt input.

Conclusion: The proposed SegCaptioning task and SGDiff model successfully enable diverse semantic interpretation from simple prompts, addressing challenges of intention capture and correlated multimodal prediction while maintaining alignment between captions and masks.

Abstract: Controllable image semantic understanding tasks, such as captioning or segmentation, necessitate users to input a prompt (e.g., text or bounding boxes) to predict a unique outcome, presenting challenges such as high-cost prompt input or limited information output. This paper introduces a new task ``Image Collaborative Segmentation and Captioning'' (SegCaptioning), which aims to translate a straightforward prompt, like a bounding box around an object, into diverse semantic interpretations represented by (caption, masks) pairs, allowing flexible result selection by users. This task poses significant challenges, including accurately capturing a user's intention from a minimal prompt while simultaneously predicting multiple semantically aligned caption words and masks. Technically, we propose a novel Scene Graph Guided Diffusion Model that leverages structured scene graph features for correlated mask-caption prediction. Initially, we introduce a Prompt-Centric Scene Graph Adaptor to map a user's prompt to a scene graph, effectively capturing his intention. Subsequently, we employ a diffusion process incorporating a Scene Graph Guided Bimodal Transformer to predict correlated caption-mask pairs by uncovering intricate correlations between them. To ensure accurate alignment, we design a Multi-Entities Contrastive Learning loss to explicitly align visual and textual entities by considering inter-modal similarity, resulting in well-aligned caption-mask pairs. Extensive experiments conducted on two datasets demonstrate that SGDiff achieves superior performance in SegCaptioning, yielding promising results for both captioning and segmentation tasks with minimal prompt input.

### [226] [Artemis: Structured Visual Reasoning for Perception Policy Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01988)
*Wei Tang,Yanpeng Sun,Shan Zhang,Xiaofan Li,Piotr Koniusz,Wei Li,Na Zhao,Zechao Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Artemis introduces structured proposal-based reasoning for visual perception policies, replacing ambiguous linguistic reasoning with verifiable (label, bounding-box) pairs to improve spatial reasoning and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reinforcement learning frameworks for visual perception use natural language intermediate reasoning, which reduces performance because visual perception requires spatial and object-centric reasoning, not unstructured linguistic reasoning.

Method: Artemis uses structured proposal-based reasoning where each intermediate step is represented as a (label, bounding-box) pair, enabling explicit state tracking, direct supervision for proposal quality, and avoiding language ambiguity. Built on Qwen2.5-VL-3B.

Result: Achieves strong performance on grounding and detection tasks, substantial generalization to counting and geometric-perception tasks, and competitive performance on general MLLM benchmarks.

Conclusion: Aligning reasoning with spatial representations enhances perception-policy learning, and spatially grounded reasoning provides a principled route toward scalable and general perception policies.

Abstract: Recent reinforcement-learning frameworks for visual perception policy have begun to incorporate intermediate reasoning chains expressed in natural language. Empirical observations indicate that such purely linguistic intermediate reasoning often reduces performance on perception tasks. We argue that the core issue lies not in reasoning per se but in the form of reasoning: while these chains perform semantic reasoning in an unstructured linguistic space, visual perception requires reasoning in a spatial and object-centric space. In response, we introduce Artemis, a perception-policy learning framework that performs structured proposal-based reasoning, where each intermediate step is represented as a (label, bounding-box) pair capturing a verifiable visual state. This design enables explicit tracking of intermediate states, direct supervision for proposal quality, and avoids ambiguity introduced by language-based reasoning. Artemis is built on Qwen2.5-VL-3B, achieves strong performance on grounding and detection task and exhibits substantial generalization to counting and geometric-perception tasks. The consistent improvements across these diverse settings confirm that aligning reasoning with spatial representations enhances perception-policy learning. Owing to its strengthened visual reasoning, Artemis also achieves competitive performance on general MLLM benchmarks, illustrating that spatially grounded reasoning provides a principled route toward scalable and general perception policies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PAI-Bench is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating Physical AI capabilities across video generation and understanding tasks, revealing current models struggle with physically coherent dynamics and causal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-modal LLMs and video generative models' abilities in perceiving and predicting real-world physical dynamics are not well understood, necessitating a systematic evaluation framework.

Method: Developed PAI-Bench with 2,808 real-world cases across video generation, conditional video generation, and video understanding tasks, using task-aligned metrics to assess physical plausibility and domain-specific reasoning.

Result: Video generative models show strong visual fidelity but poor physical coherence; multi-modal LLMs have limited forecasting and causal interpretation capabilities, indicating early-stage Physical AI development.

Conclusion: PAI-Bench provides a realistic foundation for evaluating Physical AI and identifies critical gaps in physical dynamics coherence and causal reasoning that future systems must address.

Abstract: Physical AI aims to develop models that can perceive and predict real-world dynamics; yet, the extent to which current multi-modal large language models and video generative models support these abilities is insufficiently understood. We introduce Physical AI Bench (PAI-Bench), a unified and comprehensive benchmark that evaluates perception and prediction capabilities across video generation, conditional video generation, and video understanding, comprising 2,808 real-world cases with task-aligned metrics designed to capture physical plausibility and domain-specific reasoning. Our study provides a systematic assessment of recent models and shows that video generative models, despite strong visual fidelity, often struggle to maintain physically coherent dynamics, while multi-modal large language models exhibit limited performance in forecasting and causal interpretation. These observations suggest that current systems are still at an early stage in handling the perceptual and predictive demands of Physical AI. In summary, PAI-Bench establishes a realistic foundation for evaluating Physical AI and highlights key gaps that future systems must address.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches rely on textual instructions or demonstration videos which suffer from ambiguity or occlusion. Audio provides real-time, semantically rich, and visually independent cues for affordance grounding, enabling more intuitive understanding of interaction regions.

Method: Constructed the first AV-AG dataset with action sounds, object images, and pixel-level affordance annotations. Proposed AVAGFormer model with semantic-conditioned cross-modal mixer and dual-head decoder to fuse audio and visual signals for mask prediction.

Conclusion: Audio provides effective cues for affordance grounding, and the proposed AVAGFormer model successfully fuses audio-visual signals for interaction region segmentation. The work establishes a new task direction with released code and dataset.

Abstract: We introduce Audio-Visual Affordance Grounding (AV-AG), a new task that segments object interaction regions from action sounds. Unlike existing approaches that rely on textual instructions or demonstration videos, which often limited by ambiguity or occlusion, audio provides real-time, semantically rich, and visually independent cues for affordance grounding, enabling more intuitive understanding of interaction regions. To support this task, we construct the first AV-AG dataset, comprising a large collection of action sounds, object images, and pixel-level affordance annotations. The dataset also includes an unseen subset to evaluate zero-shot generalization. Furthermore, we propose AVAGFormer, a model equipped with a semantic-conditioned cross-modal mixer and a dual-head decoder that effectively fuses audio and visual signals for mask prediction. Experiments show that AVAGFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on AV-AG, surpassing baselines from related tasks. Comprehensive analyses highlight the distinctions between AV-AG and AVS, the benefits of end-to-end modeling, and the contribution of each component.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The field of 360-degree omnidirectional understanding lacks large-scale and diverse data, which limits progress in spatial intelligence. Existing simulators don't systematically model the 4D real world under omnidirectional settings.

Method: Developed a simulation platform with three key components: 1) render-aligned data and labeling paradigm for pixel-level geometric, semantic, and entity-level understanding; 2) interactive pedestrian-aware system for modeling human behavior; 3) automated trajectory generation paradigm for navigation tasks.

Result: Collected over 60K panoramic samples and conducted extensive experiments across various tasks, demonstrating the simulator's effectiveness. The platform is the first to systematically model the 4D real world under omnidirectional settings.

*Zhengyang Geng,Yiyang Lu,Zongze Wu,Eli Shechtman,J. Zico Kolter,Kaiming He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Improved MeanFlow (iMF) addresses training stability and flexibility issues in one-step generative modeling, achieving 1.72 FID on ImageNet 256×256 with single function evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Original MeanFlow has two key challenges: 1) training objective depends on both ground-truth fields and the network itself, causing instability, and 2) classifier-free guidance scale is fixed during training, sacrificing flexibility at test time.

Method: 1) Recast training objective as loss on instantaneous velocity v, re-parameterized by network predicting average velocity u for more stable regression. 2) Formulate guidance as explicit conditioning variables with in-context conditioning to maintain test-time flexibility while reducing model size.

Result: iMF achieves 1.72 FID on ImageNet 256×256 with single function evaluation (1-NFE), substantially outperforming prior one-step methods and closing gap with multi-step methods without distillation.

Conclusion: Improved MeanFlow advances fastforward generative modeling as a standalone paradigm by solving key training stability and flexibility issues, enabling high-quality one-step generation competitive with multi-step approaches.

Abstract: MeanFlow (MF) has recently been established as a framework for one-step generative modeling. However, its ``fastforward'' nature introduces key challenges in both the training objective and the guidance mechanism. First, the original MF's training target depends not only on the underlying ground-truth fields but also on the network itself. To address this issue, we recast the objective as a loss on the instantaneous velocity $v$, re-parameterized by a network that predicts the average velocity $u$. Our reformulation yields a more standard regression problem and improves the training stability. Second, the original MF fixes the classifier-free guidance scale during training, which sacrifices flexibility. We tackle this issue by formulating guidance as explicit conditioning variables, thereby retaining flexibility at test time. The diverse conditions are processed through in-context conditioning, which reduces model size and benefits performance. Overall, our $\textbf{improved MeanFlow}$ ($\textbf{iMF}$) method, trained entirely from scratch, achieves $\textbf{1.72}$ FID with a single function evaluation (1-NFE) on ImageNet 256$\times$256. iMF substantially outperforms prior methods of this kind and closes the gap with multi-step methods while using no distillation. We hope our work will further advance fastforward generative modeling as a stand-alone paradigm.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TUNA is a unified multimodal model that creates a single continuous visual representation space for both understanding and generation tasks, outperforming decoupled approaches and achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior unified multimodal models use decoupled representations that create format mismatches between separate encoders for understanding and generation. The authors aim to build a truly unified framework that avoids these mismatches and enables better performance across both types of tasks.

Method: TUNA builds a unified continuous visual representation by cascading a VAE encoder with a representation encoder. This creates a single representation space that allows end-to-end processing of images and videos for both understanding and generation tasks, with joint training on both types of data.

Result: TUNA outperforms decoupled alternatives in both understanding and generation tasks. Stronger pretrained representation encoders consistently yield better performance across all multimodal tasks. Joint training on understanding and generation data allows the two tasks to benefit from each other rather than interfere.

Conclusion: TUNA demonstrates the effectiveness and scalability of unified representation design, achieving state-of-the-art results in image/video understanding, image/video generation, and image editing across extensive experiments.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models (UMMs) aim to jointly perform multimodal understanding and generation within a single framework. We present TUNA, a native UMM that builds a unified continuous visual representation by cascading a VAE encoder with a representation encoder. This unified representation space allows end-to-end processing of images and videos for both understanding and generation tasks. Compared to prior UMMs with decoupled representations, TUNA's unified visual space avoids representation format mismatches introduced by separate encoders, outperforming decoupled alternatives in both understanding and generation. Moreover, we observe that stronger pretrained representation encoders consistently yield better performance across all multimodal tasks, highlighting the importance of the representation encoder. Finally, in this unified setting, jointly training on both understanding and generation data allows the two tasks to benefit from each other rather than interfere. Our extensive experiments on multimodal understanding and generation benchmarks show that TUNA achieves state-of-the-art results in image and video understanding, image and video generation, and image editing, demonstrating the effectiveness and scalability of its unified representation design.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A track-conditioned video-to-video framework for joint editing of camera and object motion using 3D point tracks to transfer rich context while preserving spatiotemporal coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current motion editing methods have limitations: I2V approaches lack full-scene context, while V2V methods offer only basic viewpoint changes or object translation with limited fine-grained control over complex object motions.

Method: A track-conditioned V2V framework that conditions a video generation model on source video and paired 3D point tracks representing source and target motions. Uses 3D tracks (vs 2D) for explicit depth cues to resolve depth order and handle occlusions. Trained in two stages on synthetic and real data.

Result: Enables diverse motion edits including joint camera/object manipulation, motion transfer, and non-rigid deformation. Provides precise motion editing with preserved spatiotemporal coherence.

Conclusion: The framework unlocks new creative potential in video editing by enabling joint editing of camera and object motion with precise control, overcoming limitations of existing methods through 3D track conditioning.

Abstract: Camera and object motions are central to a video's narrative. However, precisely editing these captured motions remains a significant challenge, especially under complex object movements. Current motion-controlled image-to-video (I2V) approaches often lack full-scene context for consistent video editing, while video-to-video (V2V) methods provide viewpoint changes or basic object translation, but offer limited control over fine-grained object motion. We present a track-conditioned V2V framework that enables joint editing of camera and object motion. We achieve this by conditioning a video generation model on a source video and paired 3D point tracks representing source and target motions. These 3D tracks establish sparse correspondences that transfer rich context from the source video to new motions while preserving spatiotemporal coherence. Crucially, compared to 2D tracks, 3D tracks provide explicit depth cues, allowing the model to resolve depth order and handle occlusions for precise motion editing. Trained in two stages on synthetic and real data, our model supports diverse motion edits, including joint camera/object manipulation, motion transfer, and non-rigid deformation, unlocking new creative potential in video editing.

*Varun Varma Thozhiyoor,Shivam Tripathi,Venkatesh Babu Radhakrishnan,Anand Bhattad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video generators fail to accurately represent gravity, showing objects falling too slowly, but targeted fine-tuning with minimal data can partially correct this physical gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether video generators can serve as world models by testing their representation of fundamental physical laws like gravity, and to understand if observed physical errors are artifacts of ambiguous metric scale rather than true physical misunderstandings.

Method: 1) Tested out-of-the-box video generators on gravity representation; 2) Investigated if errors are due to ambiguous metric scale (frame rate assumptions); 3) Introduced unit-free, two-object protocol testing timing ratio t₁²/t₂² = h₁/h₂ independent of g, focal length, and scale; 4) Fine-tuned lightweight low-rank adaptor on only 100 single-ball clips to correct physical gap.

Result: Video generators consistently generate objects falling at slower acceleration (g_eff = 1.81 m/s² vs. terrestrial 9.8 m/s²). Temporal rescaling cannot correct high-variance gravity artifacts. Unit-free protocol reveals violations of Galileo's equivalence principle. Fine-tuning raises g_eff to 6.43 m/s² (65% of terrestrial gravity). Specialist adaptor generalizes zero-shot to two-ball drops and inclined planes.

Conclusion: Video generators have significant gaps in representing fundamental physical laws like gravity, but these can be partially corrected with minimal targeted fine-tuning, suggesting specific physical laws can be learned with small datasets and that video generators have potential as world models if physical understanding is improved.

Abstract: Video generators are increasingly evaluated as potential world models, which requires them to encode and understand physical laws. We investigate their representation of a fundamental law: gravity. Out-of-the-box video generators consistently generate objects falling at an effectively slower acceleration. However, these physical tests are often confounded by ambiguous metric scale. We first investigate if observed physical errors are artifacts of these ambiguities (e.g., incorrect frame rate assumptions). We find that even temporal rescaling cannot correct the high-variance gravity artifacts. To rigorously isolate the underlying physical representation from these confounds, we introduce a unit-free, two-object protocol that tests the timing ratio $t_1^2/t_2^2 = h_1/h_2$, a relationship independent of $g$, focal length, and scale. This relative test reveals violations of Galileo's equivalence principle. We then demonstrate that this physical gap can be partially mitigated with targeted specialization. A lightweight low-rank adaptor fine-tuned on only 100 single-ball clips raises $g_{\mathrm{eff}}$ from $1.81\,\mathrm{m/s^2}$ to $6.43\,\mathrm{m/s^2}$ (reaching $65\%$ of terrestrial gravity). This specialist adaptor also generalizes zero-shot to two-ball drops and inclined planes, offering initial evidence that specific physical laws can be corrected with minimal data.

*Shaowei Liu,David Yifan Yao,Saurabh Gupta,Shenlong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisualSync is an optimization framework that synchronizes multiple unsynchronized videos at millisecond accuracy using multi-view dynamics and epipolar constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: People can easily record events with multiple cameras, but synchronizing these cross-camera streams remains challenging. Existing methods require controlled settings, specific targets, manual correction, or expensive hardware.

Method: VisualSync uses multi-view dynamics optimization that leverages epipolar constraints: any moving 3D point visible in two cameras must obey epipolar constraints when properly synchronized. The framework uses off-the-shelf 3D reconstruction, feature matching, and dense tracking to extract tracklets, relative poses, and cross-view correspondences, then jointly minimizes epipolar error to estimate each camera's time offset.

Result: Experiments on four diverse, challenging datasets show VisualSync outperforms baseline methods, achieving median synchronization error below 50 ms.

Conclusion: VisualSync provides an effective solution for synchronizing unposed, unsynchronized videos without requiring controlled settings, manual intervention, or specialized hardware, enabling practical multi-camera synchronization for consumer recordings.

Abstract: Today, people can easily record memorable moments, ranging from concerts, sports events, lectures, family gatherings, and birthday parties with multiple consumer cameras. However, synchronizing these cross-camera streams remains challenging. Existing methods assume controlled settings, specific targets, manual correction, or costly hardware. We present VisualSync, an optimization framework based on multi-view dynamics that aligns unposed, unsynchronized videos at millisecond accuracy. Our key insight is that any moving 3D point, when co-visible in two cameras, obeys epipolar constraints once properly synchronized. To exploit this, VisualSync leverages off-the-shelf 3D reconstruction, feature matching, and dense tracking to extract tracklets, relative poses, and cross-view correspondences. It then jointly minimizes the epipolar error to estimate each camera's time offset. Experiments on four diverse, challenging datasets show that VisualSync outperforms baseline methods, achieving an median synchronization error below 50 ms.

TL;DR: Hybrid pipeline combining real and virtual data generation for robust bubble detection in self-driving laboratory pipetting workflows, achieving 99%+ accuracy while reducing data collection burden.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-driving laboratories need robust models but face data scarcity, especially for negative samples. Pipetting is critical and precision-sensitive, requiring reliable detection of issues like bubbles.

Method: Two-track approach: 1) Real track with human-in-the-loop automated acquisition and selective human verification; 2) Virtual track using reference-conditioned, prompt-guided image generation with screening/validation. Combines both for class-balanced dataset.

Result: Model trained on real images: 99.6% accuracy on held-out test set. Model trained on mixed real+generated data: 99.4% accuracy while reducing collection and review load.

Conclusion: Hybrid real-virtual data generation offers scalable, cost-effective solution for visual feedback in SDLs, addressing data scarcity in rare event detection and broader vision tasks.

Abstract: Self-driving laboratories offer a promising path toward reducing the labor-intensive, time-consuming, and often irreproducible workflows in the biological sciences. Yet their stringent precision requirements demand highly robust models whose training relies on large amounts of annotated data. However, this kind of data is difficult to obtain in routine practice, especially negative samples. In this work, we focus on pipetting, the most critical and precision sensitive action in SDLs. To overcome the scarcity of training data, we build a hybrid pipeline that fuses real and virtual data generation. The real track adopts a human-in-the-loop scheme that couples automated acquisition with selective human verification to maximize accuracy with minimal effort. The virtual track augments the real data using reference-conditioned, prompt-guided image generation, which is further screened and validated for reliability. Together, these two tracks yield a class-balanced dataset that enables robust bubble detection training. On a held-out real test set, a model trained entirely on automatically acquired real images reaches 99.6% accuracy, and mixing real and generated data during training sustains 99.4% accuracy while reducing collection and review load. Our approach offers a scalable and cost-effective strategy for supplying visual feedback data to SDL workflows and provides a practical solution to data scarcity in rare event detection and broader vision tasks.
