*Nelson Alves Ferreira Neto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes CMSNet framework for real-time semantic segmentation of drivable terrain and obstacles in off-road environments, validated on new Kamino dataset with 12,000 images from mining operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for low-latency intelligent systems for autonomous driving on non-uniform terrain in mining and developing countries, particularly for unpaved roads without predefined trails.

Method: Configurable Modular Segmentation Network (CMSNet) with different architectural arrangements, trained for obstacle and trafficable ground segmentation. Optimized for real-time inference using TensorRT, C++, and CUDA by methodically removing and fusing CNN layers.

Result: System capable of navigating rough terrain without explicit track boundaries, tested under adverse conditions (night, rain, dust). New Kamino dataset with extensive labeling and off-road proving ground images.

Conclusion: Empirical experiments validated the effectiveness of the proposed real-time perception system for autonomous vehicles in challenging off-road environments.

Abstract: Low-latency intelligent systems are required for autonomous driving on
non-uniform terrain in open-pit mines and developing countries. This work
proposes a perception system for autonomous vehicles on unpaved roads and
off-road environments, capable of navigating rough terrain without a predefined
trail. The Configurable Modular Segmentation Network (CMSNet) framework is
proposed, facilitating different architectural arrangements. CMSNet
configurations were trained to segment obstacles and trafficable ground on new
images from unpaved/off-road scenarios with adverse conditions (night, rain,
dust). We investigated applying deep learning to detect drivable regions
without explicit track boundaries, studied algorithm behavior under visibility
impairment, and evaluated field tests with real-time semantic segmentation. A
new dataset, Kamino, is presented with almost 12,000 images from an operating
vehicle with eight synchronized cameras. The Kamino dataset has a high number
of labeled pixels compared to similar public collections and includes images
from an off-road proving ground emulating a mine under adverse visibility. To
achieve real-time inference, CMSNet CNN layers were methodically removed and
fused using TensorRT, C++, and CUDA. Empirical experiments on two datasets
validated the proposed system's effectiveness.

### [2] [Overview of LifeCLEF Plant Identification task 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19402)
*Herve Goeau,Pierre Bonnet,Alexis Joly*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents the LifeCLEF 2020 Plant Identification challenge (PlantCLEF 2020), which evaluates automated plant identification in biodiversity-rich but data-deficient tropical regions using herbarium collections to supplement limited field photos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automated plant identification systems are biased toward North America and Western Europe due to abundant training data, while biodiversity-rich tropical regions lack sufficient field photos. Herbarium collections containing millions of digitized specimens from these regions could help bridge this data gap.

Method: The challenge used a cross-domain classification approach where training combined hundreds of thousands of herbarium sheets with thousands of field photos to learn mapping between domains. The test set consisted exclusively of field photos from South America's Guiana Shield region with about 1,000 species.

Result: The evaluation assessed how herbarium collections can improve automated identification for data-deficient tropical flora. Various research groups participated with different approaches to solve the cross-domain classification problem.

Conclusion: Herbarium collections show promise for enhancing automated plant identification in biodiversity-rich but data-poor tropical regions, though challenges remain in effectively mapping between herbarium specimens and field photos.

Abstract: Automated identification of plants has improved considerably thanks to the
recent progress in deep learning and the availability of training data with
more and more photos in the field. However, this profusion of data only
concerns a few tens of thousands of species, mostly located in North America
and Western Europe, much less in the richest regions in terms of biodiversity
such as tropical countries. On the other hand, for several centuries, botanists
have collected, catalogued and systematically stored plant specimens in
herbaria, particularly in tropical regions, and the recent efforts by the
biodiversity informatics community made it possible to put millions of
digitized sheets online. The LifeCLEF 2020 Plant Identification challenge (or
"PlantCLEF 2020") was designed to evaluate to what extent automated
identification on the flora of data deficient regions can be improved by the
use of herbarium collections. It is based on a dataset of about 1,000 species
mainly focused on the South America's Guiana Shield, an area known to have one
of the greatest diversity of plants in the world. The challenge was evaluated
as a cross-domain classification task where the training set consist of several
hundred thousand herbarium sheets and few thousand of photos to enable learning
a mapping between the two domains. The test set was exclusively composed of
photos in the field. This paper presents the resources and assessments of the
conducted evaluation, summarizes the approaches and systems employed by the
participating research groups, and provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

### [3] [iFinder: Structured Zero-Shot Vision-Based LLM Grounding for Dash-Cam Video Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19552)
*Manyi Yao,Bingbing Zhuang,Sparsh Garg,Amit Roy-Chowdhury,Christian Shelton,Manmohan Chandraker,Abhishek Aich*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: iFinder is a structured semantic grounding framework that translates dash-cam videos into hierarchical, interpretable data structures to enhance LLMs' spatial reasoning and causal inference for driving video analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models struggle with spatial reasoning and explainability in dash-cam video analysis due to lack of domain-specific inductive biases and structured representations.

Method: A modular, training-free pipeline using pretrained vision models to extract object pose, lane positions, and trajectories, organized hierarchically with a three-block prompting strategy for step-wise reasoning.

Result: Outperforms end-to-end V-VLMs on four zero-shot driving benchmarks with up to 39% gains in accident reasoning accuracy.

Conclusion: iFinder provides a zero-shot, interpretable, and reliable alternative to end-to-end V-VLMs for post-hoc driving video understanding through domain-specific grounding.

Abstract: Grounding large language models (LLMs) in domain-specific tasks like post-hoc
dash-cam driving video analysis is challenging due to their general-purpose
training and lack of structured inductive biases. As vision is often the sole
modality available for such analysis (i.e., no LiDAR, GPS, etc.), existing
video-based vision-language models (V-VLMs) struggle with spatial reasoning,
causal inference, and explainability of events in the input video. To this end,
we introduce iFinder, a structured semantic grounding framework that decouples
perception from reasoning by translating dash-cam videos into a hierarchical,
interpretable data structure for LLMs. iFinder operates as a modular,
training-free pipeline that employs pretrained vision models to extract
critical cues -- object pose, lane positions, and object trajectories -- which
are hierarchically organized into frame- and video-level structures. Combined
with a three-block prompting strategy, it enables step-wise, grounded reasoning
for the LLM to refine a peer V-VLM's outputs and provide accurate reasoning.
Evaluations on four public dash-cam video benchmarks show that iFinder's
proposed grounding with domain-specific cues, especially object orientation and
global context, significantly outperforms end-to-end V-VLMs on four zero-shot
driving benchmarks, with up to 39% gains in accident reasoning accuracy. By
grounding LLMs with driving domain-specific representations, iFinder offers a
zero-shot, interpretable, and reliable alternative to end-to-end V-VLMs for
post-hoc driving video understanding.

### [4] [CURE: Centroid-guided Unsupervised Representation Erasure for Facial Recognition Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19562)
*Fnu Shivam,Nima Najafzadeh,Yenumula Reddy,Prashnna Gyawali*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CURE is the first unsupervised machine unlearning framework for facial recognition that removes targeted user data without identity labels, outperforming existing methods and introducing a novel evaluation metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Facial recognition systems raise privacy concerns requiring data removal, but existing unlearning methods depend on supervised techniques with identity labels that are often unavailable in privacy-constrained or noisy datasets.

Method: CURE (Centroid-guided Unsupervised Representation Erasure) uses an unsupervised approach without identity labels, and introduces the Unlearning Efficiency Score (UES) metric to balance forgetting and retention stability.

Result: CURE significantly outperforms unsupervised variants of existing unlearning methods and demonstrates quality-aware unlearning by effectively removing low-quality images while preserving overall model performance.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses the critical gap in unsupervised unlearning for facial recognition, highlighting the importance of image quality in machine unlearning processes.

Abstract: In the current digital era, facial recognition systems offer significant
utility and have been widely integrated into modern technological
infrastructures; however, their widespread use has also raised serious privacy
concerns, prompting regulations that mandate data removal upon request. Machine
unlearning has emerged as a powerful solution to address this issue by
selectively removing the influence of specific user data from trained models
while preserving overall model performance. However, existing machine
unlearning techniques largely depend on supervised techniques requiring
identity labels, which are often unavailable in privacy-constrained situations
or in large-scale, noisy datasets. To address this critical gap, we introduce
CURE (Centroid-guided Unsupervised Representation Erasure), the first
unsupervised unlearning framework for facial recognition systems that operates
without the use of identity labels, effectively removing targeted samples while
preserving overall performance. We also propose a novel metric, the Unlearning
Efficiency Score (UES), which balances forgetting and retention stability,
addressing shortcomings in the current evaluation metrics. CURE significantly
outperforms unsupervised variants of existing unlearning methods. Additionally,
we conducted quality-aware unlearning by designating low-quality images as the
forget set, demonstrating its usability and benefits, and highlighting the role
of image quality in machine unlearning.

### [5] [Synthesizing Artifact Dataset for Pixel-level Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19589)
*Dennis Menn,Feng Liang,Diana Marculescu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an artifact corruption pipeline that automatically injects artifacts into clean synthetic images to generate pixel-level annotations, eliminating the need for expensive manual labeling while improving artifact detector performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training artifact detectors requires expensive pixel-level human annotations, and existing pseudo-labeling approaches suffer from noisy labels that limit detector performance.

Method: An artifact corruption pipeline that automatically injects artifacts into clean, high-quality synthetic images on predetermined regions to generate pixel-level annotations without manual labeling.

Result: Achieves performance improvements of 13.2% for ConvNeXt and 3.7% for Swin-T compared to baseline approaches, as verified on human-labeled data.

Conclusion: Represents an initial step toward scalable pixel-level artifact annotation datasets that integrate world knowledge into artifact detection.

Abstract: Artifact detectors have been shown to enhance the performance of
image-generative models by serving as reward models during fine-tuning. These
detectors enable the generative model to improve overall output fidelity and
aesthetics. However, training the artifact detector requires expensive
pixel-level human annotations that specify the artifact regions. The lack of
annotated data limits the performance of the artifact detector. A naive
pseudo-labeling approach-training a weak detector and using it to annotate
unlabeled images-suffers from noisy labels, resulting in poor performance. To
address this, we propose an artifact corruption pipeline that automatically
injects artifacts into clean, high-quality synthetic images on a predetermined
region, thereby producing pixel-level annotations without manual labeling. The
proposed method enables training of an artifact detector that achieves
performance improvements of 13.2% for ConvNeXt and 3.7% for Swin-T, as verified
on human-labeled data, compared to baseline approaches. This work represents an
initial step toward scalable pixel-level artifact annotation datasets that
integrate world knowledge into artifact detection.

### [6] [Parameter-Efficient Multi-Task Learning via Progressive Task-Specific Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19602)
*Neeraj Gangwar,Anshuka Rangi,Rishabh Deshmukh,Holakou Rahmanian,Yesh Dattatreya,Nickvash Kani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Progressive task-specific multi-task adaptation is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that introduces adapter modules that are shared across tasks in early layers and become progressively more task-specific in later layers, with task similarity-based allocation to reduce interference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address task interference and negative transfer in parameter-efficient multi-task learning by allowing shared learning in initial layers and task-specific adaptation in later layers.

Method: Introduces adapter modules in pre-trained models that start as shared across all tasks and become progressively task-specific toward the output heads, with gradient-based task similarity computation for optimal adapter allocation.

Result: Outperforms fully fine-tuned multi-task models on PASCAL and NYUD-v2 datasets using only one-fifth of trainable parameters, achieving better improvement over single-task fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The approach effectively reduces task conflicts in multi-task learning while maintaining parameter efficiency, surpassing current state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods have emerged as a promising solution
for adapting pre-trained models to various downstream tasks. While these
methods perform well in single-task learning, extending them to multi-task
learning exacerbates common challenges, such as task interference and negative
transfer, due to the limited number of trainable parameters. To address these
issues, we introduce progressive task-specific multi-task adaptation, a novel
parameter-efficient approach for multi-task learning. This approach introduces
adapter modules in a pre-trained model such that these modules are shared
across all tasks in the initial layers and become progressively more
task-specific in the later layers. The motivation is to reduce the conflicts
among tasks by allowing transfer learning across all tasks in the initial
layers and enabling task-specific learning toward the prediction heads.
Additionally, we propose a gradient-based approach for computing task
similarity and use this measure to allocate similar tasks to the shared adapter
modules. Our task similarity method introduces minimal overhead in the
pipeline. We evaluate our approach by adapting the Swin Transformer for dense
prediction tasks. Experiments on the PASCAL and NYUD-v2 datasets demonstrate
that our approach outperforms a fully fine-tuned multi-task model while
requiring only one-fifth of the trainable parameters. This approach achieves
better relative improvement to single-task fine-tuning while reducing the
number of trainable parameters and surpasses the current state-of-the-art
methods for parameter-efficient multi-task learning.

### [7] [Raw-JPEG Adapter: Efficient Raw Image Compression with JPEG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19624)
*Mahmoud Afifi,Ran Zhang,Michael S. Brown*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RawJPEG Adapter is a learnable, invertible preprocessing pipeline that adapts raw images for standard JPEG compression, enabling accurate raw reconstruction while maintaining high compression efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Raw data preserves full sensor information but requires large storage (DNG format), while JPEG offers high compression but is unsuitable for raw storage. There's a need for a solution that combines raw data benefits with JPEG's compression efficiency.

Method: A lightweight preprocessing pipeline that applies spatial and optional frequency-domain transforms to raw images before JPEG compression. Compact parameters are stored in JPEG comment field to enable accurate reconstruction.

Result: Experiments show higher fidelity than direct JPEG storage, support for other codecs, and favorable trade-off between compression ratio and reconstruction accuracy across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: RawJPEG Adapter provides an effective solution for storing raw-like information in JPEG format, offering practical benefits for constrained scenarios while maintaining reconstruction accuracy.

Abstract: Digital cameras digitize scene light into linear raw representations, which
the image signal processor (ISP) converts into display-ready outputs. While raw
data preserves full sensor information--valuable for editing and vision
tasks--formats such as Digital Negative (DNG) require large storage, making
them impractical in constrained scenarios. In contrast, JPEG is a widely
supported format, offering high compression efficiency and broad compatibility,
but it is not well-suited for raw storage. This paper presents RawJPEG Adapter,
a lightweight, learnable, and invertible preprocessing pipeline that adapts raw
images for standard JPEG compression. Our method applies spatial and optional
frequency-domain transforms, with compact parameters stored in the JPEG comment
field, enabling accurate raw reconstruction. Experiments across multiple
datasets show that our method achieves higher fidelity than direct JPEG
storage, supports other codecs, and provides a favorable trade-off between
compression ratio and reconstruction accuracy.

### [8] [The Impact of 2D Segmentation Backbones on Point Cloud Predictions Using 4D Radar](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19644)
*William L. Muckelroy III,Mohammed Alsakabi,John M. Dolan,Ozan K. Tonguz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Investigating the impact of higher-capacity segmentation backbones on LiDAR-like 3D point cloud generation from 4D Radars, finding that optimal backbone selection can provide 23.7% improvement over state-of-the-art.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR's high cost restricts broad adoption of autonomous driving systems. Prior research shows neural networks can generate LiDAR-like point clouds using cheaper 4D Radars, but the impact of segmentation backbone capacity on quality needs investigation.

Method: Building on prior work that uses modular 2D CNN backbone and temporal coherence network, this study systematically evaluates different segmentation backbone capacities for generating 3D point clouds from 4D Radar data using the RaDelft dataset.

Result: While very high-capacity models can hurt performance, an optimal segmentation backbone provides 23.7% improvement over state-of-the-art methods for generating LiDAR-like point clouds from 4D Radars.

Conclusion: Careful selection of segmentation backbone capacity is crucial for optimal performance in generating cost-effective LiDAR alternatives from 4D Radars, with significant quality improvements achievable through proper architecture choices.

Abstract: LiDAR's dense, sharp point cloud (PC) representations of the surrounding
environment enable accurate perception and significantly improve road safety by
offering greater scene awareness and understanding. However, LiDAR's high cost
continues to restrict the broad adoption of high-level Autonomous Driving (AD)
systems in commercially available vehicles. Prior research has shown progress
towards circumventing the need for LiDAR by training a neural network, using
LiDAR point clouds as ground truth (GT), to produce LiDAR-like 3D point clouds
using only 4D Radars. One of the best examples is a neural network created to
train a more efficient radar target detector with a modular 2D convolutional
neural network (CNN) backbone and a temporal coherence network at its core that
uses the RaDelft dataset for training (see arXiv:2406.04723). In this work, we
investigate the impact of higher-capacity segmentation backbones on the quality
of the produced point clouds. Our results show that while very high-capacity
models may actually hurt performance, an optimal segmentation backbone can
provide a 23.7% improvement over the state-of-the-art (SOTA).

### [9] [Bias in the Picture: Benchmarking VLMs with Social-Cue News Images and LLM-as-Judge Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19659)
*Aravind Narayanan,Vahid Reza Khazaie,Shaina Raza*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Researchers created a news-image benchmark to evaluate how large vision-language models (VLMs) reproduce harmful social stereotypes based on visual cues like age, gender, race, clothing, and occupation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large VLMs can jointly interpret images and text but are prone to absorbing and reproducing harmful social stereotypes when visual demographic cues are present, creating risks that need systematic investigation.

Method: Developed a benchmark of 1,343 image-question pairs from diverse news outlets, annotated with ground-truth answers and demographic attributes. Evaluated state-of-the-art VLMs using an LLM as judge with human verification.

Result: Visual context systematically shifts model outputs in open-ended settings; bias prevalence varies across attributes and models (particularly high risk for gender and occupation); higher faithfulness doesn't necessarily correspond to lower bias.

Conclusion: The study reveals systematic bias risks in VLMs and releases the benchmark, evaluation rubric, and code to support reproducible fairness-aware multimodal assessment.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) can jointly interpret images and text,
but they are also prone to absorbing and reproducing harmful social stereotypes
when visual cues such as age, gender, race, clothing, or occupation are
present. To investigate these risks, we introduce a news-image benchmark
consisting of 1,343 image-question pairs drawn from diverse outlets, which we
annotated with ground-truth answers and demographic attributes (age, gender,
race, occupation, and sports). We evaluate a range of state-of-the-art VLMs and
employ a large language model (LLM) as judge, with human verification. Our
findings show that: (i) visual context systematically shifts model outputs in
open-ended settings; (ii) bias prevalence varies across attributes and models,
with particularly high risk for gender and occupation; and (iii) higher
faithfulness does not necessarily correspond to lower bias. We release the
benchmark prompts, evaluation rubric, and code to support reproducible and
fairness-aware multimodal assessment.

### [10] [MoTiC: Momentum Tightness and Contrast for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19664)
*Zeyu He,Shuai Huang,Yuwu Lu,Ming Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes MoTiC, a novel framework for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) that addresses prototype estimation bias in new classes through Bayesian prior alignment, contrastive learning, and momentum self-supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FSCIL methods suffer from significant estimation bias in new-class prototypes due to extreme data scarcity, while base-class prototypes benefit from sufficient data. This imbalance leads to suboptimal performance in incremental learning scenarios.

Method: The authors propose MoTiC framework that: 1) Aligns new-class priors with old-class statistics using Bayesian analysis to reduce variance, 2) Uses large-scale contrastive learning for cross-category feature tightness, 3) Integrates momentum self-supervision and virtual categories to enrich feature diversity and inject prior information.

Result: Experiments on three FSCIL benchmarks show state-of-the-art performance, particularly on the fine-grained CUB-200 task, demonstrating the method's effectiveness in reducing estimation bias and improving incremental learning robustness.

Conclusion: MoTiC successfully addresses the dual challenge of learning new classes from scarce samples while preserving old class knowledge by leveraging Bayesian prior alignment and contrastive feature learning, achieving superior performance in few-shot incremental learning scenarios.

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) must contend with the dual
challenge of learning new classes from scarce samples while preserving old
class knowledge. Existing methods use the frozen feature extractor and
class-averaged prototypes to mitigate against catastrophic forgetting and
overfitting. However, new-class prototypes suffer significant estimation bias
due to extreme data scarcity, whereas base-class prototypes benefit from
sufficient data. In this work, we theoretically demonstrate that aligning the
new-class priors with old-class statistics via Bayesian analysis reduces
variance and improves prototype accuracy. Furthermore, we propose large-scale
contrastive learning to enforce cross-category feature tightness. To further
enrich feature diversity and inject prior information for new-class prototypes,
we integrate momentum self-supervision and virtual categories into the Momentum
Tightness and Contrast framework (MoTiC), constructing a feature space with
rich representations and enhanced interclass cohesion. Experiments on three
FSCIL benchmarks produce state-of-the-art performances, particularly on the
fine-grained task CUB-200, validating our method's ability to reduce estimation
bias and improve incremental learning robustness.

### [11] [Deep Learning for Clouds and Cloud Shadow Segmentation in Methane Satellite and Airborne Imaging Spectroscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19665)
*Manuel Perez-Carrasco,Maya Nasr,Sebastien Roche,Chris Chan Miller,Zhan Zhang,Core Francisco Park,Eleanor Walker,Cecilia Garraffo,Douglas Finkbeiner,Ritesh Gautam,Steven Wofsy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Machine learning methods for cloud and cloud shadow detection in hyperspectral remote sensing data, comparing conventional techniques with deep learning architectures to improve methane emission quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effective cloud detection is critical for accurate atmospheric methane retrieval in hyperspectral remote sensing, especially for MethaneSAT and MethaneAIR missions, as clouds bias methane retrievals and impact emission quantification.

Method: Evaluated conventional methods (Iterative Logistic Regression and Multilayer Perceptron) against deep learning architectures (UNet and Spectral Channel Attention Network) for cloud and cloud shadow detection in high-resolution hyperspectral data.

Result: Deep learning models substantially outperform conventional methods: UNet excels at preserving spatial structure while SCAN captures fine boundary details better, with SCAN particularly effective on MethaneSAT data due to spectral attention mechanisms.

Conclusion: Advanced deep learning architectures provide robust, scalable solutions for cloud screening, enhancing methane emission quantification capabilities for current and future hyperspectral missions.

Abstract: Effective cloud and cloud shadow detection is a critical prerequisite for
accurate retrieval of concentrations of atmospheric methane or other trace
gases in hyperspectral remote sensing. This challenge is especially pertinent
for MethaneSAT and for its airborne companion mission, MethaneAIR. In this
study, we use machine learning methods to address the cloud and cloud shadow
detection problem for sensors with these high spatial resolutions instruments.
Cloud and cloud shadows in remote sensing data need to be effectively screened
out as they bias methane retrievals in remote sensing imagery and impact the
quantification of emissions. We deploy and evaluate conventional techniques
including Iterative Logistic Regression (ILR) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP),
with advanced deep learning architectures, namely UNet and a Spectral Channel
Attention Network (SCAN) method. Our results show that conventional methods
struggle with spatial coherence and boundary definition, affecting the
detection of clouds and cloud shadows. Deep learning models substantially
improve detection quality: UNet performs best in preserving spatial structure,
while SCAN excels at capturing fine boundary details. Notably, SCAN surpasses
UNet on MethaneSAT data, underscoring the benefits of incorporating spectral
attention for satellite specific features. This in depth assessment of various
disparate machine learning techniques demonstrates the strengths and
effectiveness of advanced deep learning architectures in providing robust,
scalable solutions for clouds and cloud shadow screening towards enhancing
methane emission quantification capacity of existing and next generation
hyperspectral missions. Our data and code is publicly available at

*Sumit Mamtani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Two lightweight optimization techniques (STA and ANF) are proposed to reduce structured noise artifacts in Vision Transformers, improving feature map quality for downstream tasks like segmentation and depth estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers suffer from structured noise artifacts in their feature maps that hinder performance in downstream applications such as segmentation and depth estimation.

Method: Proposed Structured Token Augmentation (STA) to enhance token diversity through spatial perturbations during tokenization, and Adaptive Noise Filtering (ANF) to apply learnable inline denoising between transformer layers.

Result: Experimental results across ImageNet, Ade20k, and NYUv2 benchmarks show consistent improvements in visual quality and task performance.

Conclusion: The proposed methods are architecture-agnostic and practically effective for improving Vision Transformer interpretability and mitigating feature map artifacts.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated superior performance across a
wide range of computer vision tasks. However, structured noise artifacts in
their feature maps hinder downstream applications such as segmentation and
depth estimation. We propose two novel and lightweight optimisation techniques-
Structured Token Augmentation (STA) and Adaptive Noise Filtering (ANF)- to
improve interpretability and mitigate these artefacts. STA enhances token
diversity through spatial perturbations during tokenisation, while ANF applies
learnable inline denoising between transformer layers. These methods are
architecture-agnostic and evaluated across standard benchmarks, including
ImageNet, Ade20k, and NYUv2. Experimental results show consistent improvements
in visual quality and task performance, highlighting the practical
effectiveness of our approach.

### [13] [From Prompt to Progression: Taming Video Diffusion Models for Seamless Attribute Transition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19690)
*Ling Lo,Kelvin C. K. Chan,Wen-Huang Cheng,Ming-Hsuan Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method to improve video generation with smooth attribute transitions by introducing frame-wise guidance during denoising, along with a new benchmark and metrics for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models struggle with complex temporal changes and gradual attribute transitions, often producing inconsistencies when using prompt interpolation for motion transitions.

Method: Proposes frame-wise guidance during denoising process, constructing data-specific transitional directions for each noisy latent to guide gradual attribute shifts while preserving motion dynamics.

Result: Experimental results show the approach outperforms existing baselines, achieving visual fidelity, text prompt alignment, and seamless attribute transitions.

Conclusion: The method effectively extends existing models for smooth attribute transitions, with code and CAT-Bench benchmark released publicly.

Abstract: Existing models often struggle with complex temporal changes, particularly
when generating videos with gradual attribute transitions. The most common
prompt interpolation approach for motion transitions often fails to handle
gradual attribute transitions, where inconsistencies tend to become more
pronounced. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective method to extend
existing models for smooth and consistent attribute transitions, through
introducing frame-wise guidance during the denoising process. Our approach
constructs a data-specific transitional direction for each noisy latent,
guiding the gradual shift from initial to final attributes frame by frame while
preserving the motion dynamics of the video. Moreover, we present the
Controlled-Attribute-Transition Benchmark (CAT-Bench), which integrates both
attribute and motion dynamics, to comprehensively evaluate the performance of
different models. We further propose two metrics to assess the accuracy and
smoothness of attribute transitions. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach performs favorably against existing baselines, achieving visual
fidelity, maintaining alignment with text prompts, and delivering seamless
attribute transitions. Code and CATBench are released:

### [14] [Anatomically Constrained Transformers for Cardiac Amyloidosis Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19691)
*Alexander Thorley,Agis Chartsias,Jordan Strom,Roberto Lang,Jeremy Slivnick,Jamie O'Driscoll,Rajan Sharma,Dipak Kotecha,Jinming Duan,Alberto Gomez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A transformer model constrained to the myocardium region for cardiac amyloidosis classification, using anatomical embeddings and masked autoencoder pre-training focused on myocardial patches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural networks for cardiac amyloidosis detection process entire echocardiogram videos without ensuring classification is based on clinically relevant features. The authors aim to constrain models to anatomical regions where CA abnormalities occur.

Method: Developed a transformer model explicitly constrained to the myocardium by embedding it as deforming points and corresponding image patches. Applied anatomical constraints to self-supervised masked autoencoder pre-training by masking and reconstructing only anatomical patches.

Result: The anatomically constrained model achieved increased performance on CA classification compared to full video transformers, with explicit guarantee that classification focuses only on anatomical regions.

Conclusion: Constraining both transformer architecture and pre-training to the myocardium where CA imaging features are localized improves classification performance while ensuring clinical relevance and enabling visualization of attention scores.

Abstract: Cardiac amyloidosis (CA) is a rare cardiomyopathy, with typical abnormalities
in clinical measurements from echocardiograms such as reduced global
longitudinal strain of the myocardium. An alternative approach for detecting CA
is via neural networks, using video classification models such as convolutional
neural networks. These models process entire video clips, but provide no
assurance that classification is based on clinically relevant features known to
be associated with CA. An alternative paradigm for disease classification is to
apply models to quantitative features such as strain, ensuring that the
classification relates to clinically relevant features. Drawing inspiration
from this approach, we explicitly constrain a transformer model to the
anatomical region where many known CA abnormalities occur -- the myocardium,
which we embed as a set of deforming points and corresponding sampled image
patches into input tokens. We show that our anatomical constraint can also be
applied to the popular self-supervised learning masked autoencoder
pre-training, where we propose to mask and reconstruct only anatomical patches.
We show that by constraining both the transformer and pre-training task to the
myocardium where CA imaging features are localized, we achieve increased
performance on a CA classification task compared to full video transformers.
Our model provides an explicit guarantee that the classification is focused on
only anatomical regions of the echo, and enables us to visualize transformer
attention scores over the deforming myocardium.

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning method for selecting optimal echocardiogram clip subsets to maximize disease classification performance while reducing computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current echocardiogram analysis methods either use single clips (losing complementary information) or all clips (computationally expensive), creating a need for intelligent clip selection.

Method: Reinforcement learning agent that learns to either keep processing clips to reduce classification uncertainty or stop when confidence is sufficient, plus attention-based aggregation for fusing information.

Result: Achieved AUC of 0.91 for detecting cardiac amyloidosis using only 30% of all clips, outperforming methods using all clips and other benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides an efficient way to select optimal clip subsets for echocardiogram analysis, balancing computational efficiency with classification performance.

Abstract: Guidelines for transthoracic echocardiographic examination recommend the
acquisition of multiple video clips from different views of the heart,
resulting in a large number of clips. Typically, automated methods, for
instance disease classifiers, either use one clip or average predictions from
all clips. Relying on one clip ignores complementary information available from
other clips, while using all clips is computationally expensive and may be
prohibitive for clinical adoption.
  To select the optimal subset of clips that maximize performance for a
specific task (image-based disease classification), we propose a method
optimized through reinforcement learning. In our method, an agent learns to
either keep processing view-specific clips to reduce the disease classification
uncertainty, or stop processing if the achieved classification confidence is
sufficient. Furthermore, we propose a learnable attention-based aggregation
method as a flexible way of fusing information from multiple clips. The
proposed method obtains an AUC of 0.91 on the task of detecting cardiac
amyloidosis using only 30% of all clips, exceeding the performance achieved
from using all clips and from other benchmarks.

TL;DR: SynthICL is a novel data synthesis framework that uses domain randomization to generate diverse medical image data for In-Context Learning segmentation, addressing data scarcity while maintaining realism through anatomical priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of In-Context Learning for medical image segmentation creates unprecedented demand for large-scale diverse datasets, exacerbating data scarcity issues. Existing synthesis methods fail to achieve both high diversity and suitable domain distribution for medical data.

Method: Built on domain randomization, SynthICL leverages anatomical priors from real-world datasets to ensure realism, generates diverse anatomical structures for broad data distribution, and explicitly models inter-subject variations to create suitable ICL data cohorts.

Result: Extensive experiments on four held-out datasets show models trained with SynthICL data achieve up to 63% average Dice improvement and substantially enhanced generalization to unseen anatomical domains.

Conclusion: SynthICL helps mitigate the data bottleneck for ICL-based segmentation, paving the way for robust models. The framework effectively bridges the gap between data diversity and domain distribution suitability in medical data synthesis.

Abstract: The rise of In-Context Learning (ICL) for universal medical image
segmentation has introduced an unprecedented demand for large-scale, diverse
datasets for training, exacerbating the long-standing problem of data scarcity.
While data synthesis offers a promising solution, existing methods often fail
to simultaneously achieve both high data diversity and a domain distribution
suitable for medical data. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{SynthICL}, a
novel data synthesis framework built upon domain randomization. SynthICL
ensures realism by leveraging anatomical priors from real-world datasets,
generates diverse anatomical structures to cover a broad data distribution, and
explicitly models inter-subject variations to create data cohorts suitable for
ICL. Extensive experiments on four held-out datasets validate our framework's
effectiveness, showing that models trained with our data achieve performance
gains of up to 63\% in average Dice and substantially enhanced generalization
to unseen anatomical domains. Our work helps mitigate the data bottleneck for
ICL-based segmentation, paving the way for robust models. Our code and the
generated dataset are publicly available at

*Saimouli Katragadda,Guoquan Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VIMD is a monocular visual-inertial motion and depth learning framework that estimates dense metric depth by leveraging MSCKF-based motion tracking and iteratively refining per-pixel scale using multi-view information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate and efficient dense metric depth estimation is crucial for 3D visual perception in robotics and XR applications, especially in resource-constrained settings.

Method: Uses MSCKF-based monocular visual-inertial motion tracking to exploit multi-view information for iterative per-pixel scale refinement, rather than globally fitting an invariant affine model. The framework is modular and compatible with various depth estimation backbones.

Result: Achieves exceptional accuracy and robustness with extremely sparse points (10-20 metric depth points per image), demonstrating strong zero-shot generalization on TartanAir, VOID, and AR Table datasets.

Conclusion: VIMD provides a practical solution for deployment in resource-constrained settings with robust performance and strong generalization capabilities across various scenarios.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient dense metric depth estimation is crucial for 3D visual
perception in robotics and XR. In this paper, we develop a monocular
visual-inertial motion and depth (VIMD) learning framework to estimate dense
metric depth by leveraging accurate and efficient MSCKF-based monocular
visual-inertial motion tracking. At the core the proposed VIMD is to exploit
multi-view information to iteratively refine per-pixel scale, instead of
globally fitting an invariant affine model as in the prior work. The VIMD
framework is highly modular, making it compatible with a variety of existing
depth estimation backbones. We conduct extensive evaluations on the TartanAir
and VOID datasets and demonstrate its zero-shot generalization capabilities on
the AR Table dataset. Our results show that VIMD achieves exceptional accuracy
and robustness, even with extremely sparse points as few as 10-20 metric depth
points per image. This makes the proposed VIMD a practical solution for
deployment in resource constrained settings, while its robust performance and
strong generalization capabilities offer significant potential across a wide
range of scenarios.

### [18] [Frequency-domain Multi-modal Fusion for Language-guided Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19719)
*Bo Yu,Jianhua Yang,Zetao Du,Yan Huang,Chenglong Li,Liang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FMISeg is a frequency-domain multi-modal interaction model for language-guided medical image segmentation that improves segmentation of pulmonary infectious diseases by fusing linguistic features with frequency-domain visual features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with complex lesion morphological changes and the semantic gap between vision-language modalities, leading to suboptimal segmentation performance in medical imaging.

Method: Proposes FMISeg with two key modules: Frequency-domain Feature Bidirectional Interaction (FFBI) for enhanced visual representation, and Language-guided Frequency-domain Feature Interaction (LFFI) to suppress irrelevant visual features using linguistic guidance.

Result: Experiments on QaTa-COV19 and MosMedData+ datasets show FMISeg outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Conclusion: The frequency-domain approach effectively bridges the vision-language gap and improves medical image segmentation accuracy for pulmonary infectious diseases.

Abstract: Automatically segmenting infected areas in radiological images is essential
for diagnosing pulmonary infectious diseases. Recent studies have demonstrated
that the accuracy of the medical image segmentation can be improved by
incorporating clinical text reports as semantic guidance. However, the complex
morphological changes of lesions and the inherent semantic gap between
vision-language modalities prevent existing methods from effectively enhancing
the representation of visual features and eliminating semantically irrelevant
information, ultimately resulting in suboptimal segmentation performance. To
address these problems, we propose a Frequency-domain Multi-modal Interaction
model (FMISeg) for language-guided medical image segmentation. FMISeg is a late
fusion model that establishes interaction between linguistic features and
frequency-domain visual features in the decoder. Specifically, to enhance the
visual representation, our method introduces a Frequency-domain Feature
Bidirectional Interaction (FFBI) module to effectively fuse frequency-domain
features. Furthermore, a Language-guided Frequency-domain Feature Interaction
(LFFI) module is incorporated within the decoder to suppress semantically
irrelevant visual features under the guidance of linguistic information.
Experiments on QaTa-COV19 and MosMedData+ demonstrated that our method
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods qualitatively and quantitatively.

TL;DR: PolGS integrates polarimetric constraints into 3D Gaussian Splatting to enable fast (10-minute) reconstruction of surfaces with complex reflective properties by separating specular and diffuse components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3DGS methods lag behind implicit neural representations in reconstructing surfaces with complex reflective properties, which is crucial for real-time virtual reality applications.

Method: Proposes PolGS, a Polarimetric Gaussian Splatting model that integrates polarimetric constraints into the 3DGS framework to effectively separate specular and diffuse reflectance components.

Result: Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the method's effectiveness in enhancing reconstruction quality for challenging reflective materials.

Conclusion: PolGS enables fast reflective surface reconstruction in just 10 minutes while improving quality over standard 3DGS approaches for complex reflectance properties.

Abstract: Efficient shape reconstruction for surfaces with complex reflectance
properties is crucial for real-time virtual reality. While 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS)-based methods offer fast novel view rendering by leveraging
their explicit surface representation, their reconstruction quality lags behind
that of implicit neural representations, particularly in the case of recovering
surfaces with complex reflective reflectance. To address these problems, we
propose PolGS, a Polarimetric Gaussian Splatting model allowing fast reflective
surface reconstruction in 10 minutes. By integrating polarimetric constraints
into the 3DGS framework, PolGS effectively separates specular and diffuse
components, enhancing reconstruction quality for challenging reflective
materials. Experimental results on the synthetic and real-world dataset
validate the effectiveness of our method.

*Hyunseung Kim,Chiho Choi,Srikanth Malla,Sai Prahladh Padmanabhan,Saurabh Bagchi,Joon Hee Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAMILA is a context-aware image editing method that validates instruction feasibility and applies only relevant edits, outperforming state-of-the-art models in handling infeasible or contradictory instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image editing models naively follow all user instructions, even infeasible or contradictory ones, leading to nonsensical outputs. There's a need for systems that can validate instruction coherence with image context.

Method: Proposed CAMILA (Context-Aware Masking for Image Editing with Language Alignment) that validates contextual coherence between instructions and images, applying edits only to relevant regions while ignoring non-executable instructions.

Result: CAMILA achieves better performance and higher semantic alignment than state-of-the-art models, effectively handling complex instruction challenges while preserving image integrity.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates effectiveness in addressing the challenge of infeasible instructions in text-guided image editing, providing a more robust and context-aware editing framework.

Abstract: Text-guided image editing has been allowing users to transform and synthesize
images through natural language instructions, offering considerable
flexibility. However, most existing image editing models naively attempt to
follow all user instructions, even if those instructions are inherently
infeasible or contradictory, often resulting in nonsensical output. To address
these challenges, we propose a context-aware method for image editing named as
CAMILA (Context-Aware Masking for Image Editing with Language Alignment).
CAMILA is designed to validate the contextual coherence between instructions
and the image, ensuring that only relevant edits are applied to the designated
regions while ignoring non-executable instructions. For comprehensive
evaluation of this new method, we constructed datasets for both single- and
multi-instruction image editing, incorporating the presence of infeasible
requests. Our method achieves better performance and higher semantic alignment
than state-of-the-art models, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling
complex instruction challenges while preserving image integrity.

*Hongtao Yang,Bineng Zhong,Qihua Liang,Zhiruo Zhu,Yaozong Zheng,Ning Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VFPTrack is an efficient RGB-Thermal tracking method that combines spatial and frequency-domain information using Fast Fourier Transform to learn modality-related prompts, achieving superior performance through bidirectional interaction prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PEFT-based RGB-T tracking methods rely solely on spatial domain information as prompts, overlooking the crucial role of frequency-domain information in prompt learning, which limits their performance.

Method: The method uses symmetric feature extraction with shared parameters, visual Fourier prompts via FFT, and a Modality Fusion Prompt Generator. It combines spatial domain prompts with frequency domain prompts from FFT, then generates fused modality prompts that interact bidirectionally with individual modalities.

Result: Extensive experiments on three popular RGB-T tracking benchmarks show that the method demonstrates outstanding performance compared to previous approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed VFPTrack method effectively leverages both spatial and frequency domain information through Fourier-based prompts and bidirectional modality interaction, achieving superior RGB-T tracking performance.

Abstract: Recently, visual prompt tuning is introduced to RGB-Thermal (RGB-T) tracking
as a parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) method. However, these PEFT-based
RGB-T tracking methods typically rely solely on spatial domain information as
prompts for feature extraction. As a result, they often fail to achieve optimal
performance by overlooking the crucial role of frequency-domain information in
prompt learning. To address this issue, we propose an efficient Visual Fourier
Prompt Tracking (named VFPTrack) method to learn modality-related prompts via
Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Our method consists of symmetric feature
extraction encoder with shared parameters, visual fourier prompts, and Modality
Fusion Prompt Generator that generates bidirectional interaction prompts
through multi-modal feature fusion. Specifically, we first use a frozen feature
extraction encoder to extract RGB and thermal infrared (TIR) modality features.
Then, we combine the visual prompts in the spatial domain with the frequency
domain prompts obtained from the FFT, which allows for the full extraction and
understanding of modality features from different domain information. Finally,
unlike previous fusion methods, the modality fusion prompt generation module we
use combines features from different modalities to generate a fused modality
prompt. This modality prompt is interacted with each individual modality to
fully enable feature interaction across different modalities. Extensive
experiments conducted on three popular RGB-T tracking benchmarks show that our
method demonstrates outstanding performance.

*Xinhao Zhong,Shuoyang Sun,Xulin Gu,Chenyang Zhu,Bin Chen,Yaowei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RD³ proposes a standardized evaluation framework for decoupled dataset distillation, revealing that performance differences in existing methods stem from inconsistent evaluation protocols rather than methodological superiority.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inconsistent post-evaluation protocols in decoupled dataset distillation methods that hinder fair comparisons and progress in the field.

Method: Rectified Decoupled Dataset Distillation (RD³) systematically investigates how different post-evaluation settings affect test accuracy and establishes a standardized benchmark.

Result: Analysis shows performance variations are largely due to evaluation discrepancies rather than intrinsic synthetic data quality differences.

Conclusion: RD³ provides a foundation for fair and reproducible comparisons in dataset distillation research through standardized evaluation protocols.

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to generate compact synthetic datasets that enable
models trained on them to achieve performance comparable to those trained on
full real datasets, while substantially reducing storage and computational
costs. Early bi-level optimization methods (e.g., MTT) have shown promising
results on small-scale datasets, but their scalability is limited by high
computational overhead. To address this limitation, recent decoupled dataset
distillation methods (e.g., SRe$^2$L) separate the teacher model pre-training
from the synthetic data generation process. These methods also introduce random
data augmentation and epoch-wise soft labels during the post-evaluation phase
to improve performance and generalization. However, existing decoupled
distillation methods suffer from inconsistent post-evaluation protocols, which
hinders progress in the field. In this work, we propose Rectified Decoupled
Dataset Distillation (RD$^3$), and systematically investigate how different
post-evaluation settings affect test accuracy. We further examine whether the
reported performance differences across existing methods reflect true
methodological advances or stem from discrepancies in evaluation procedures.
Our analysis reveals that much of the performance variation can be attributed
to inconsistent evaluation rather than differences in the intrinsic quality of
the synthetic data. In addition, we identify general strategies that improve
the effectiveness of distilled datasets across settings. By establishing a
standardized benchmark and rigorous evaluation protocol, RD$^3$ provides a
foundation for fair and reproducible comparisons in future dataset distillation
research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel semi-supervised learning framework called nnFilterMatch that integrates SSL with entropy-based pseudo-label filtering within nnU-Net, achieving comparable performance to fully supervised models with only 5-20% labeled data while eliminating retraining loops.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional SSL-AL hybrid approaches require iterative retraining cycles after each annotation round, which incurs significant computational overhead and limits scalability in clinical applications.

Method: Integrates SSL with entropy-based pseudo-label filtering (FilterMatch) within the single-pass nnU-Net training framework, selectively excluding high-confidence pseudo-labels during training to avoid retraining loops while preserving uncertainty-guided learning benefits.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to or exceeding fully supervised models across multiple clinical segmentation benchmarks with only 5-20% labeled data.

Conclusion: Presents a scalable, end-to-end learning strategy for reducing annotation demands in medical image segmentation without compromising accuracy, eliminating the need for computationally expensive retraining loops.

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising paradigm in medical
image segmentation, offering competitive performance while substantially
reducing the need for extensive manual annotation. When combined with active
learning (AL), these strategies further minimize annotation burden by
selectively incorporating the most informative samples. However, conventional
SSL_AL hybrid approaches often rely on iterative and loop-based retraining
cycles after each annotation round, incurring significant computational
overhead and limiting scalability in clinical applications. In this study, we
present a novel, annotation-efficient, and self-adaptive deep segmentation
framework that integrates SSL with entropy-based pseudo-label filtering
(FilterMatch), an AL-inspired mechanism, within the single-pass nnU-Net
training segmentation framework (nnFilterMatch). By selectively excluding
high-confidence pseudo-labels during training, our method circumvents the need
for retraining loops while preserving the benefits of uncertainty-guided
learning. We validate the proposed framework across multiple clinical
segmentation benchmarks and demonstrate that it achieves performance comparable
to or exceeding fully supervised models, even with only 5\%--20\% labeled data.
This work introduces a scalable, end-to-end learning strategy for reducing
annotation demands in medical image segmentation without compromising accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage framework for audio-driven talking head generation with explicit facial Action Unit (AU) control that maps AUs to 2D landmarks for fine-grained expression control, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve fine-grained expression control in talking head generation using physically grounded, per-frame control via explicit mapping of facial Action Units (AUs) to landmarks, addressing limitations of prior methods that rely on emotion labels or implicit AU conditioning.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Variational motion generator predicts temporally coherent landmark sequences from audio and AU intensities; 2) Diffusion-based synthesizer generates realistic videos conditioned on landmarks and reference image. Separates motion and appearance modeling.

Result: Experiments on MEAD dataset show superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics, demonstrating improved expression accuracy, temporal stability, and visual realism.

Conclusion: Explicit AU-to-landmark modeling is effective for expressive talking head generation, with the two-stage separation of motion and appearance yielding better results than previous approaches.

Abstract: We propose a two-stage framework for audio-driven talking head generation
with fine-grained expression control via facial Action Units (AUs). Unlike
prior methods relying on emotion labels or implicit AU conditioning, our model
explicitly maps AUs to 2D facial landmarks, enabling physically grounded,
per-frame expression control. In the first stage, a variational motion
generator predicts temporally coherent landmark sequences from audio and AU
intensities. In the second stage, a diffusion-based synthesizer generates
realistic, lip-synced videos conditioned on these landmarks and a reference
image. This separation of motion and appearance improves expression accuracy,
temporal stability, and visual realism. Experiments on the MEAD dataset show
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics,
demonstrating the effectiveness of explicit AU-to-landmark modeling for
expressive talking head generation.

*Jinhui Zheng,Xueyuan Gong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ExpFace is a new margin-based softmax loss that uses an angular exponential term to penalize noisy samples less than clean samples, achieving state-of-the-art face recognition performance by focusing on high-quality samples in the center region of angular space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing margin-based softmax losses (SphereFace, CosFace, ArcFace) enhance intra-class compactness but ignore noisy samples, which tend to cluster in peripheral regions while clean samples cluster in center regions of angular space.

Method: Proposes Exponential Angular Margin Loss (ExpFace) with an angular exponential term that applies larger penalties in center regions and smaller penalties in peripheral regions, emphasizing clean samples while suppressing noisy samples.

Result: ExpFace achieves state-of-the-art performance, avoids training instability of SphereFace and non-monotonicity of ArcFace, and exhibits similarity curves that align with decision boundaries in angular space.

Conclusion: ExpFace provides an effective solution for handling noisy samples in face recognition by adaptively penalizing samples based on their angular position, with released source code for future research.

Abstract: Face recognition is an open-set problem requiring high discriminative power
to ensure that intra-class distances remain smaller than inter-class distances.
Margin-based softmax losses, such as SphereFace, CosFace, and ArcFace, have
been widely adopted to enhance intra-class compactness and inter-class
separability, yet they overlook the impact of noisy samples. By examining the
distribution of samples in the angular space, we observe that clean samples
predominantly cluster in the center region, whereas noisy samples tend to shift
toward the peripheral region. Motivated by this observation, we propose the
Exponential Angular Margin Loss (ExpFace), which introduces an angular
exponential term as the margin. This design applies a larger penalty in the
center region and a smaller penalty in the peripheral region within the angular
space, thereby emphasizing clean samples while suppressing noisy samples. We
present a unified analysis of ExpFace and classical margin-based softmax losses
in terms of margin embedding forms, similarity curves, and gradient curves,
showing that ExpFace not only avoids the training instability of SphereFace and
the non-monotonicity of ArcFace, but also exhibits a similarity curve that
applies penalties in the same manner as the decision boundary in the angular
space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ExpFace achieves state-of-the-art
performance. To facilitate future research, we have released the source code

TL;DR: Logics-Parsing is an end-to-end LVLM-based model enhanced with reinforcement learning for document parsing, addressing layout analysis and reading order challenges in complex documents like multi-column newspapers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLM-based document parsing methods lack explicit analytical stages for document layouts and reading orders, limiting their capability to handle complex document types such as multi-column newspapers or posters.

Method: Proposes Logics-Parsing: an end-to-end LVLM model augmented with reinforcement learning using carefully designed reward mechanisms to optimize layout analysis and reading order inference. Also incorporates diverse data types (chemical formulas, handwritten Chinese characters) in supervised fine-tuning.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on LogicsParsingBench (1,078 page-level PDF images across 9 categories) validated the model's efficacy and State-of-the-art performance across diverse document analysis scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed Logics-Parsing model successfully addresses limitations of current LVLM approaches by incorporating reinforcement learning for layout analysis and reading order optimization, demonstrating SOTA performance on complex document parsing tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Vision-Language models (LVLM) have spurred
significant progress in document parsing task. Compared to traditional
pipeline-based methods, end-to-end paradigms have shown their excellence in
converting PDF images into structured outputs through integrated Optical
Character Recognition (OCR), table recognition, mathematical formula
recognition and so on. However, the absence of explicit analytical stages for
document layouts and reading orders limits the LVLM's capability in handling
complex document types such as multi-column newspapers or posters. To address
this limitation, we propose in this report Logics-Parsing: an end-to-end
LVLM-based model augmented with reinforcement learning. Our model incorporates
meticulously designed reward mechanisms to optimize complex layout analysis and
reading order inference. In addition, we expand the model's versatility by
incorporating diverse data types such as chemical formulas and handwritten
Chinese characters into supervised fine-tuning. Finally, to enable rigorous
evaluation of our approach, we introduce LogicsParsingBench, a curated set of
1,078 page-level PDF images spanning nine major categories and over twenty
sub-categories, which will be released later. Comprehensive experiments
conducted on LogicsParsingBench have validated the efficacy and
State-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of our proposed model across diverse

### [27] [Sex-based Bias Inherent in the Dice Similarity Coefficient: A Model Independent Analysis for Multiple Anatomical Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19778)
*Hartmut Häntze,Myrthe Buser,Alessa Hering,Lisa C. Adams,Keno K. Bressem*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study reveals that the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) metric inherently introduces sex-based bias in medical image segmentation evaluation due to organ size differences, with smaller structures showing systematic DSC differences between men and women even for identical segmentation errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether the DSC metric itself introduces sex-based bias in medical image segmentation evaluation, independent of specific models or datasets, since organ size differences between sexes could lead to unfair comparisons when using overlap-based metrics.

Method: Applied equally-sized synthetic errors to manual MRI annotations from 50 participants to ensure sex-based comparability, testing minimal errors like 1 mm boundary shifts in an idealized setting independent of specific segmentation models.

Result: Even minimal errors produced systematic DSC differences between sexes: average differences around 0.03 for small structures, 0.01 for medium-sized structures, with only large structures (lungs and liver) showing near-zero sex-based differences.

Conclusion: The DSC metric itself introduces sex-based bias, meaning fairness studies using DSC should not expect identical scores between sexes, and segmentation models may perform equally well across sexes in error magnitude even if DSC values suggest otherwise.

Abstract: Overlap-based metrics such as the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) penalize
segmentation errors more heavily in smaller structures. As organ size differs
by sex, this implies that a segmentation error of equal magnitude may result in
lower DSCs in women due to their smaller average organ volumes compared to men.
While previous work has examined sex-based differences in models or datasets,
no study has yet investigated the potential bias introduced by the DSC itself.
This study quantifies sex-based differences of the DSC and the normalized DSC
in an idealized setting independent of specific models. We applied
equally-sized synthetic errors to manual MRI annotations from 50 participants
to ensure sex-based comparability. Even minimal errors (e.g., a 1 mm boundary
shift) produced systematic DSC differences between sexes. For small structures,
average DSC differences were around 0.03; for medium-sized structures around
0.01. Only large structures (i.e., lungs and liver) were mostly unaffected,
with sex-based DSC differences close to zero. These findings underline that
fairness studies using the DSC as an evaluation metric should not expect
identical scores between men and women, as the metric itself introduces bias. A
segmentation model may perform equally well across sexes in terms of error
magnitude, even if observed DSC values suggest otherwise. Importantly, our work
raises awareness of a previously underexplored source of sex-based differences
in segmentation performance. One that arises not from model behavior, but from
the metric itself. Recognizing this factor is essential for more accurate and
fair evaluations in medical image analysis.

TL;DR: A lightweight Vision Transformer architecture for High Dynamic Range (HDR) imaging on edge devices, achieving ghost-free results with significantly reduced computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the dual bottlenecks of high computational costs and ghosting artifacts in existing Multi-Exposure Fusion (HDR) methods, enabling practical deployment on resource-constrained edge devices for applications like intelligent surveillance and autonomous driving.

Method: Uses Context-Aware Vision Transformer with YCbCr color space conversion, Intersection-Aware Adaptive Fusion (IAAF) module for ghost suppression, and lightweight components including Inverted Residual Embedding (IRE), Dynamic Tanh (DyT), and Enhanced Multi-Scale Dilated Convolution (E-MSDC).

Result: Main version reduces FLOPS by ~67% and increases inference speed by 5x on CPU and 2.5x on edge devices compared to baseline, while maintaining high visual quality.

Conclusion: The method provides an efficient and ghost-free HDR imaging solution for edge devices, demonstrating versatility and practicality across various dynamic scenarios with excellent balance between performance and image quality.

Abstract: Achieving high-quality High Dynamic Range (HDR) imaging on
resource-constrained edge devices is a critical challenge in computer vision,
as its performance directly impacts downstream tasks such as intelligent
surveillance and autonomous driving. Multi-Exposure Fusion (MEF) is a
mainstream technique to achieve this goal; however, existing methods generally
face the dual bottlenecks of high computational costs and ghosting artifacts,
hindering their widespread deployment. To this end, this study proposes a
light-weight Vision Transformer architecture designed explicitly for HDR
reconstruction to overcome these limitations. This study is based on the
Context-Aware Vision Transformer and begins by converting input images to the
YCbCr color space to separate luminance and chrominance information. It then
employs an Intersection-Aware Adaptive Fusion (IAAF) module to suppress
ghosting effectively. To further achieve a light-weight design, we introduce
Inverted Residual Embedding (IRE), Dynamic Tanh (DyT), and propose Enhanced
Multi-Scale Dilated Convolution (E-MSDC) to reduce computational complexity at
multiple levels. Our study ultimately contributes two model versions: a main
version for high visual quality and a light-weight version with advantages in
computational efficiency, both of which achieve an excellent balance between
performance and image quality. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared
to the baseline, the main version reduces FLOPS by approximately 67% and
increases inference speed by more than fivefold on CPU and 2.5 times on an edge
device. These results confirm that our method provides an efficient and

### [29] [BiTAA: A Bi-Task Adversarial Attack for Object Detection and Depth Estimation via 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19793)
*Yixun Zhang,Feng Zhou,Jianqin Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BiTAA is a bi-task adversarial attack using 3D Gaussian Splatting that simultaneously degrades object detection and biases monocular depth estimation in autonomous driving perception systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 2D/3D adversarial attacks operate in task silos, lack controllable depth bias mechanisms, and have no standardized protocols for quantifying cross-task transfer between detection and depth estimation.

Method: A dual-model attack framework with composite loss that couples detection suppression with signed, magnitude-controlled log-depth bias within ROIs, supporting full-image/patch settings and optional EOT for physical reality.

Result: Consistent cross-task degradation with clear asymmetry between detection-to-depth and depth-to-detection transfer, demonstrating practical risks for multi-task camera-only perception.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for cross-task-aware defenses in autonomous driving due to the demonstrated vulnerabilities in multi-task camera perception systems.

Abstract: Camera-based perception is critical to autonomous driving yet remains
vulnerable to task-specific adversarial manipulations in object detection and
monocular depth estimation. Most existing 2D/3D attacks are developed in task
silos, lack mechanisms to induce controllable depth bias, and offer no
standardized protocol to quantify cross-task transfer, leaving the interaction
between detection and depth underexplored. We present BiTAA, a bi-task
adversarial attack built on 3D Gaussian Splatting that yields a single
perturbation capable of simultaneously degrading detection and biasing
monocular depth. Specifically, we introduce a dual-model attack framework that
supports both full-image and patch settings and is compatible with common
detectors and depth estimators, with optional expectation-over-transformation
(EOT) for physical reality. In addition, we design a composite loss that
couples detection suppression with a signed, magnitude-controlled log-depth
bias within regions of interest (ROIs) enabling controllable near or far
misperception while maintaining stable optimization across tasks. We also
propose a unified evaluation protocol with cross-task transfer metrics and
real-world evaluations, showing consistent cross-task degradation and a clear
asymmetry between Det to Depth and from Depth to Det transfer. The results
highlight practical risks for multi-task camera-only perception and motivate
cross-task-aware defenses in autonomous driving scenarios.

*Shantanusinh Parmar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StrCGAN is a generative model that enhances low-resolution astrophotography images using 3D convolutions, multi-spectral fusion, and astrophysical regularization to produce high-fidelity celestial object reconstructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional models like CycleGAN are limited to 2D mappings and often distort star/galaxy morphology in astrophotography. The goal is to overcome these limitations for small-telescope observations like the MobilTelesco dataset.

Method: Extends CycleGAN with three innovations: 3D convolutional layers for volumetric spatial correlations, multi-spectral fusion for optical-NIR domain alignment, and astrophysical regularization modules to preserve stellar morphology.

Result: StrCGAN generates reconstructions that are visually sharper and physically consistent across spectral bands, outperforming standard GAN models in astrophysical image enhancement.

Conclusion: The proposed StrCGAN framework successfully addresses limitations of traditional GANs for astrophotography enhancement, producing high-quality, physically accurate celestial object reconstructions.

Abstract: We introduce StrCGAN (Stellar Cyclic GAN), a generative model designed to
enhance low-resolution astrophotography images. Our goal is to reconstruct
high-fidelity ground truth-like representations of celestial objects, a task
that is challenging due to the limited resolution and quality of
small-telescope observations such as the MobilTelesco dataset. Traditional
models such as CycleGAN provide a foundation for image-to-image translation but
are restricted to 2D mappings and often distort the morphology of stars and
galaxies. To overcome these limitations, we extend the CycleGAN framework with
three key innovations: 3D convolutional layers to capture volumetric spatial
correlations, multi-spectral fusion to align optical and near-infrared (NIR)
domains, and astrophysical regularization modules to preserve stellar
morphology. Ground-truth references from multi-mission all-sky surveys spanning
optical to NIR guide the training process, ensuring that reconstructions remain
consistent across spectral bands. Together, these components allow StrCGAN to
generate reconstructions that are not only visually sharper but also physically
consistent, outperforming standard GAN models in the task of astrophysical
image enhancement.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Meta-weight-ensembler is a meta-learning approach that adaptively generates layer-specific mixing coefficients for model ensemble in continual learning, addressing knowledge conflicts at both task and layer levels to alleviate catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing model ensemble methods in continual learning suffer from knowledge conflict issues at task and layer levels, which compromise learning performance in both old and new tasks.

Method: Uses a mixing coefficient generator trained via meta-learning to generate appropriate mixing coefficients for model ensemble, with coefficients individually generated for each layer to address both task-level and layer-level knowledge conflicts.

Result: Experiments on multiple continual learning datasets show that meta-weight-ensembler effectively alleviates catastrophic forgetting and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The proposed method can be flexibly combined with existing continual learning methods to boost their ability to alleviate catastrophic forgetting through adaptive knowledge fusion.

Abstract: Model ensemble is an effective strategy in continual learning, which
alleviates catastrophic forgetting by interpolating model parameters, achieving
knowledge fusion learned from different tasks. However, existing model ensemble
methods usually encounter the knowledge conflict issue at task and layer
levels, causing compromised learning performance in both old and new tasks. To
solve this issue, we propose meta-weight-ensembler that adaptively fuses
knowledge of different tasks for continual learning. Concretely, we employ a
mixing coefficient generator trained via meta-learning to generate appropriate
mixing coefficients for model ensemble to address the task-level knowledge
conflict. The mixing coefficient is individually generated for each layer to
address the layer-level knowledge conflict. In this way, we learn the prior
knowledge about adaptively accumulating knowledge of different tasks in a fused
model, achieving efficient learning in both old and new tasks.
Meta-weight-ensembler can be flexibly combined with existing continual learning
methods to boost their ability of alleviating catastrophic forgetting.
Experiments on multiple continual learning datasets show that
meta-weight-ensembler effectively alleviates catastrophic forgetting and
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying embodied AI agents in realistic human-centered scenarios remains challenging due to difficulty modeling individual human preferences and behaviors

Method: Created a comprehensive benchmark with over 2,000 high-quality episodes across 30+ photorealistic homes from HM3D dataset, featuring natural-language scene descriptions with explicit object-owner associations

Result: Experiments with state-of-the-art baselines show substantial performance gap compared to human performance

Conclusion: Highlights the need for embodied agents capable of perceiving, reasoning, and memorizing personalized information, paving the way for real-world assistive robots

Abstract: Recent advances in Embodied AI have enabled agents to perform increasingly
complex tasks and adapt to diverse environments. However, deploying such agents
in realistic human-centered scenarios, such as domestic households, remains
challenging, particularly due to the difficulty of modeling individual human
preferences and behaviors. In this work, we introduce PersONAL (PERSonalized
Object Navigation And Localization, a comprehensive benchmark designed to study
personalization in Embodied AI. Agents must identify, retrieve, and navigate to
objects associated with specific users, responding to natural-language queries
such as "find Lily's backpack". PersONAL comprises over 2,000 high-quality
episodes across 30+ photorealistic homes from the HM3D dataset. Each episode
includes a natural-language scene description with explicit associations
between objects and their owners, requiring agents to reason over user-specific
semantics. The benchmark supports two evaluation modes: (1) active navigation
in unseen environments, and (2) object grounding in previously mapped scenes.
Experiments with state-of-the-art baselines reveal a substantial gap to human
performance, highlighting the need for embodied agents capable of perceiving,
reasoning, and memorizing over personalized information; paving the way towards

TL;DR: FreezeVLA is a novel attack framework that generates adversarial images to "freeze" Vision-Language-Action models, causing them to ignore subsequent instructions and potentially leading to dangerous inaction in robotics applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA models are advancing robotics but their safety against adversarial attacks remains underexplored. The paper identifies a critical vulnerability where adversarial images can disconnect the robot's decision-making from physical actions.

Method: Proposes FreezeVLA attack framework using min-max bi-level optimization to generate action-freezing attacks. Evaluated on three state-of-the-art VLA models and four robotic benchmarks.

Result: FreezeVLA achieves 76.2% average attack success rate, significantly outperforming existing methods. Adversarial images show strong transferability, with single images reliably paralyzing models across diverse language prompts.

Conclusion: The findings expose critical safety risks in VLA models and highlight the urgent need for robust defense mechanisms against such adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are driving rapid progress in robotics by
enabling agents to interpret multimodal inputs and execute complex,
long-horizon tasks. However, their safety and robustness against adversarial
attacks remain largely underexplored. In this work, we identify and formalize a
critical adversarial vulnerability in which adversarial images can "freeze" VLA
models and cause them to ignore subsequent instructions. This threat
effectively disconnects the robot's digital mind from its physical actions,
potentially inducing inaction during critical interventions. To systematically
study this vulnerability, we propose FreezeVLA, a novel attack framework that
generates and evaluates action-freezing attacks via min-max bi-level
optimization. Experiments on three state-of-the-art VLA models and four robotic
benchmarks show that FreezeVLA attains an average attack success rate of 76.2%,
significantly outperforming existing methods. Moreover, adversarial images
generated by FreezeVLA exhibit strong transferability, with a single image
reliably inducing paralysis across diverse language prompts. Our findings
expose a critical safety risk in VLA models and highlight the urgent need for
robust defense mechanisms.

*Yunqing Hu,Zheming Yang,Chang Zhao,Wen Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an adaptive edge-cloud collaborative object detection method using MLLMs to enhance semantic understanding in complex scenes, achieving 79% latency reduction and 70% computational cost savings while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional object detection methods degrade in complex scenarios like low-light conditions and heavy occlusions due to insufficient high-level semantic understanding.

Method: Uses instruction fine-tuning on MLLMs to generate structured scene descriptions, adaptive mapping to convert semantics into parameter adjustment signals for edge detectors, and edge-cloud collaborative inference with confidence-based routing.

Result: Achieves significant improvements: over 79% latency reduction and 70% computational cost savings in low-light and highly occluded scenes while maintaining detection accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively balances accuracy and efficiency in complex detection scenarios through semantic enhancement and adaptive edge-cloud collaboration.

Abstract: Traditional object detection methods face performance degradation challenges
in complex scenarios such as low-light conditions and heavy occlusions due to a
lack of high-level semantic understanding. To address this, this paper proposes
an adaptive guidance-based semantic enhancement edge-cloud collaborative object
detection method leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM), achieving
an effective balance between accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, the method
first employs instruction fine-tuning to enable the MLLM to generate structured
scene descriptions. It then designs an adaptive mapping mechanism that
dynamically converts semantic information into parameter adjustment signals for
edge detectors, achieving real-time semantic enhancement. Within an edge-cloud
collaborative inference framework, the system automatically selects between
invoking cloud-based semantic guidance or directly outputting edge detection
results based on confidence scores. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed
method effectively enhances detection accuracy and efficiency in complex
scenes. Specifically, it can reduce latency by over 79% and computational cost
by 70% in low-light and highly occluded scenes while maintaining accuracy.

*Rémi Giraud,Rodrigo Borba Pinheiro,Yannick Berthoumieu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SphSPS is a new superpixel method for 360° spherical images that respects 3D spherical geometry, improving segmentation accuracy and shape regularity compared to planar methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard superpixel methods are designed for 2D planar images but fail to properly handle wide-angle 360° spherical images with distortion, requiring dedicated approaches that respect spherical geometry.

Method: The method generalizes shortest path computation between pixels and superpixel centers to the spherical space, using 3D spherical acquisition geometry to extract relevant clustering features efficiently.

Result: SphSPS significantly outperforms both planar and spherical state-of-the-art methods in segmentation accuracy, noise robustness, and regularity on 360° spherical panorama datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides an effective tool for superpixel-based applications on 360° images by properly accounting for spherical geometry, addressing limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: The growing use of wide angle image capture devices and the need for fast and
accurate image analysis in computer visions have enforced the need for
dedicated under-representation approaches. Most recent decomposition methods
segment an image into a small number of irregular homogeneous regions, called
superpixels. Nevertheless, these approaches are generally designed to segment
standard 2D planar images, i.e., captured with a 90o angle view without
distortion. In this work, we introduce a new general superpixel method called
SphSPS (for Spherical Shortest Path-based Superpixels)1 , dedicated to wide
360o spherical or omnidirectional images. Our method respects the geometry of
the 3D spherical acquisition space and generalizes the notion of shortest path
between a pixel and a superpixel center, to fastly extract relevant clustering
features. We demonstrate that considering the geometry of the acquisition space
to compute the shortest path enables to jointly improve the segmentation
accuracy and the shape regularity of superpixels. To evaluate this regularity
aspect, we also generalize a global regularity metric to the spherical space,
addressing the limitations of the only existing spherical compactness measure.
Finally, the proposed SphSPS method is validated on the reference 360o
spherical panorama segmentation dataset and on synthetic road omnidirectional
images. Our method significantly outperforms both planar and spherical
state-of-the-art approaches in terms of segmentation accuracy,robustness to
noise and regularity, providing a very interesting tool for superpixel-based
applications on 360o images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CWA-MSN is a novel representation learning framework that learns batch-robust cell painting representations by aligning embeddings of cells with the same perturbation across different wells, achieving state-of-the-art performance with significantly less data and smaller model size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of extracting biologically meaningful and batch-robust cell painting representations for drug discovery, as conventional self-supervised and contrastive learning approaches struggle with batch effects and require large-scale models/huge datasets.

Method: Cross-Well Aligned Masked Siamese Network (CWA-MSN) - a representation learning framework that aligns embeddings of cells subjected to the same perturbation across different wells, enforcing semantic consistency despite batch effects, integrated into a masked siamese architecture.

Result: CWA-MSN outperforms state-of-the-art methods (OpenPhenom and CellCLIP) by +29% and +9% respectively in gene-gene relationship retrieval, while using substantially fewer data (0.2M vs 2.2M images) and smaller model size (22M vs 1.48B parameters).

Conclusion: CWA-MSN is a simple and effective way to learn cell image representation that enables efficient phenotype modeling even under limited data and parameter budgets.

Abstract: Computational models that predict cellular phenotypic responses to chemical
and genetic perturbations can accelerate drug discovery by prioritizing
therapeutic hypotheses and reducing costly wet-lab iteration. However,
extracting biologically meaningful and batch-robust cell painting
representations remains challenging. Conventional self-supervised and
contrastive learning approaches often require a large-scale model and/or a huge
amount of carefully curated data, still struggling with batch effects. We
present Cross-Well Aligned Masked Siamese Network (CWA-MSN), a novel
representation learning framework that aligns embeddings of cells subjected to
the same perturbation across different wells, enforcing semantic consistency
despite batch effects. Integrated into a masked siamese architecture, this
alignment yields features that capture fine-grained morphology while remaining
data- and parameter-efficient. For instance, in a gene-gene relationship
retrieval benchmark, CWA-MSN outperforms the state-of-the-art publicly
available self-supervised (OpenPhenom) and contrastive learning (CellCLIP)
methods, improving the benchmark scores by +29\% and +9\%, respectively, while
training on substantially fewer data (e.g., 0.2M images for CWA-MSN vs. 2.2M
images for OpenPhenom) or smaller model size (e.g., 22M parameters for CWA-MSN
vs. 1.48B parameters for CellCLIP). Extensive experiments demonstrate that
CWA-MSN is a simple and effective way to learn cell image representation,
enabling efficient phenotype modeling even under limited data and parameter

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A feature matching algorithm for aerial and ground images using intermediate views generated via 3D Gaussian Splatting to bridge viewpoint differences and improve matching reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The integration of aerial and ground images for 3D modeling is challenging due to perspective distortions from extensive viewpoint changes, requiring reliable correspondences between these different image types.

Method: Three-step approach: 1) Reconstruct sparse models from aerial images using incremental SfM; 2) Generate intermediate views using 3D Gaussian Splatting with render viewpoint determination; 3) Perform feature matching through intermediate images to connect aerial and ground images.

Result: Experimental results show significant increase in initial and refined matches compared to existing methods, enabling accurate ISfM reconstruction and complete 3DGS-based scene rendering.

Conclusion: The proposed solution effectively bridges the gap between aerial and ground images by generating intermediate views, providing reliable feature matches for complex 3D scene modeling applications.

Abstract: The integration of aerial and ground images has been a promising solution in
3D modeling of complex scenes, which is seriously restricted by finding
reliable correspondences. The primary contribution of this study is a feature
matching algorithm for aerial and ground images, whose core idea is to generate
intermediate views to alleviate perspective distortions caused by the extensive
viewpoint changes. First, by using aerial images only, sparse models are
reconstructed through an incremental SfM (Structure from Motion) engine due to
their large scene coverage. Second, 3D Gaussian Splatting is then adopted for
scene rendering by taking as inputs sparse points and oriented images. For
accurate view rendering, a render viewpoint determination algorithm is designed
by using the oriented camera poses of aerial images, which is used to generate
high-quality intermediate images that can bridge the gap between aerial and
ground images. Third, with the aid of intermediate images, reliable feature
matching is conducted for match pairs from render-aerial and render-ground
images, and final matches can be generated by transmitting correspondences
through intermediate views. By using real aerial and ground datasets, the
validation of the proposed solution has been verified in terms of feature
matching and scene rendering and compared comprehensively with widely used
methods. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed solution can
provide reliable feature matches for aerial and ground images with an obvious
increase in the number of initial and refined matches, and it can provide
enough matches to achieve accurate ISfM reconstruction and complete 3DGS-based
scene rendering.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GS-RoadPatching is a 3D Gaussian Splatting-based inpainting method for driving scene completion that performs substitutional scene editing directly in 3DGS space, eliminating the need for 2D diffusion models and retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGS inpainting methods rely on 2D perspective-view-based generative models which struggle with spatial-temporal consistency and require time-intensive retraining. Driving scenes have highly repetitive patterns that can be leveraged for structural matching in 3D space.

Method: Constructs feature-embedded 3DGS scenes with patch measurement for local context abstraction, proposes structural search for finding candidate patches in 3D space, and uses substitution-and-fusion optimization for visual harmony.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple datasets show state-of-the-art performance in driving scenes, with superior quality and interoperability compared to baselines. Additional experiments demonstrate applicability in general scenes.

Conclusion: The method enables effective 3DGS-based substitutional inpainting directly through the 3DGS modality, achieving efficient and high-quality scene completion without requiring cross-modal consistency or retraining.

Abstract: This paper presents GS-RoadPatching, an inpainting method for driving scene
completion by referring to completely reconstructed regions, which are
represented by 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Unlike existing 3DGS inpainting
methods that perform generative completion relying on 2D perspective-view-based
diffusion or GAN models to predict limited appearance or depth cues for missing
regions, our approach enables substitutional scene inpainting and editing
directly through the 3DGS modality, extricating it from requiring
spatial-temporal consistency of 2D cross-modals and eliminating the need for
time-intensive retraining of Gaussians. Our key insight is that the highly
repetitive patterns in driving scenes often share multi-modal similarities
within the implicit 3DGS feature space and are particularly suitable for
structural matching to enable effective 3DGS-based substitutional inpainting.
Practically, we construct feature-embedded 3DGS scenes to incorporate a patch
measurement method for abstracting local context at different scales and,
subsequently, propose a structural search method to find candidate patches in
3D space effectively. Finally, we propose a simple yet effective
substitution-and-fusion optimization for better visual harmony. We conduct
extensive experiments on multiple publicly available datasets to demonstrate
the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method in driving scenes, and
the results validate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
compared to the baseline methods in terms of both quality and interoperability.
Additional experiments in general scenes also demonstrate the applicability of
the proposed 3D inpainting strategy. The project page and code are available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel technique for interpreting CLIP-ResNet neurons by decomposing their contributions into individual computation paths through neuron-head pairs, which can be approximated by single directions in the embedding space and used for semantic segmentation and dataset monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand and interpret the internal representations of CLIP-ResNet by analyzing how individual neurons contribute to the output through specific computation paths, moving beyond neuron-level analysis to path-level interpretation.

Method: Analyze pairwise combinations of neurons and attention heads in CLIP's attention-pooling layer, approximating neuron-head pairs as single directions in the image-text embedding space, and interpreting them through text associations.

Result: Discovered that only a sparse set of neuron-head pairs significantly contribute to outputs, some pairs represent sub-concepts of neurons, and these pairs can be effectively used for training-free semantic segmentation and monitoring dataset distribution shifts.

Conclusion: Examining individual computation paths in neural networks reveals interpretable units that are useful for downstream tasks, providing a more granular understanding of model behavior beyond traditional neuron-level analysis.

Abstract: We present a novel technique for interpreting the neurons in CLIP-ResNet by
decomposing their contributions to the output into individual computation
paths. More specifically, we analyze all pairwise combinations of neurons and
the following attention heads of CLIP's attention-pooling layer. We find that
these neuron-head pairs can be approximated by a single direction in
CLIP-ResNet's image-text embedding space. Leveraging this insight, we interpret
each neuron-head pair by associating it with text. Additionally, we find that
only a sparse set of the neuron-head pairs have a significant contribution to
the output value, and that some neuron-head pairs, while polysemantic,
represent sub-concepts of their corresponding neurons. We use these
observations for two applications. First, we employ the pairs for training-free
semantic segmentation, outperforming previous methods for CLIP-ResNet. Second,
we utilize the contributions of neuron-head pairs to monitor dataset
distribution shifts. Our results demonstrate that examining individual
computation paths in neural networks uncovers interpretable units, and that
such units can be utilized for downstream tasks.

express their complaints clearly in text but can easily upload videos depicting
product defects (e.g., vague text such as `worst product' paired with a
5-second video depicting a broken headphone with the right earcup). This paper
formulates a new task in the field of complaint mining to aid the common users'
need to write an expressive complaint, which is Complaint Description from
Videos (CoD-V) (e.g., to help the above user articulate her complaint about the
defective right earcup). To this end, we introduce ComVID, a video complaint
dataset containing 1,175 complaint videos and the corresponding descriptions,
also annotated with the emotional state of the complainer. Additionally, we
present a new complaint retention (CR) evaluation metric that discriminates the
proposed (CoD-V) task against standard video summary generation and description
tasks. To strengthen this initiative, we introduce a multimodal
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) embedded VideoLLaMA2-7b model, designed to
generate complaints while accounting for the user's emotional state. We conduct
a comprehensive evaluation of several Video Language Models on several tasks
(pre-trained and fine-tuned versions) with a range of established evaluation
metrics, including METEOR, perplexity, and the Coleman-Liau readability score,
among others. Our study lays the foundation for a new research direction to
provide a platform for users to express complaints through video. Dataset and

### [43] [SynchroRaMa : Lip-Synchronized and Emotion-Aware Talking Face Generation via Multi-Modal Emotion Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19965)
*Phyo Thet Yee,Dimitrios Kollias,Sudeepta Mishra,Abhinav Dhall*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SynchroRaMa is a novel framework for audio-driven talking face generation that integrates multi-modal emotion embedding from text and audio, uses an audio-to-motion module for natural head motion and lip sync, and incorporates LLM-generated scene descriptions for dynamic actions and temporal consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing emotion-aware talking face generation methods rely on single modality emotion embedding and condition on single reference images, limiting their ability to capture nuanced affective cues and represent dynamic changes over time.

Method: Combines emotional signals from text (sentiment analysis) and audio (speech emotion recognition, valence-arousal features), includes audio-to-motion module for motion generation, and uses LLM-generated scene descriptions as additional textual input for dynamic actions.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in quantitative and qualitative experiments, achieving improvements in image quality, expression preservation, and motion realism. User study confirms higher subjective ratings in naturalness, motion diversity, and video smoothness.

Conclusion: SynchroRaMa successfully addresses limitations of existing methods by integrating multi-modal emotion embedding and dynamic scene conditioning, enabling generation of talking face videos with richer emotional expressiveness, fidelity, and temporal consistency.

Abstract: Audio-driven talking face generation has received growing interest,
particularly for applications requiring expressive and natural human-avatar
interaction. However, most existing emotion-aware methods rely on a single
modality (either audio or image) for emotion embedding, limiting their ability
to capture nuanced affective cues. Additionally, most methods condition on a
single reference image, restricting the model's ability to represent dynamic
changes in actions or attributes across time. To address these issues, we
introduce SynchroRaMa, a novel framework that integrates a multi-modal emotion
embedding by combining emotional signals from text (via sentiment analysis) and
audio (via speech-based emotion recognition and audio-derived valence-arousal
features), enabling the generation of talking face videos with richer and more
authentic emotional expressiveness and fidelity. To ensure natural head motion
and accurate lip synchronization, SynchroRaMa includes an audio-to-motion (A2M)
module that generates motion frames aligned with the input audio. Finally,
SynchroRaMa incorporates scene descriptions generated by Large Language Model
(LLM) as additional textual input, enabling it to capture dynamic actions and
high-level semantic attributes. Conditioning the model on both visual and
textual cues enhances temporal consistency and visual realism. Quantitative and
qualitative experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SynchroRaMa
outperforms the state-of-the-art, achieving improvements in image quality,
expression preservation, and motion realism. A user study further confirms that
SynchroRaMa achieves higher subjective ratings than competing methods in
overall naturalness, motion diversity, and video smoothness. Our project page

### [44] [OmniScene: Attention-Augmented Multimodal 4D Scene Understanding for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19973)
*Pei Liu,Hongliang Lu,Haichao Liu,Haipeng Liu,Xin Liu,Ruoyu Yao,Shengbo Eben Li,Jun Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniScene is a novel human-like framework for autonomous driving that integrates multi-view and temporal perception with vision-language modeling for holistic 4D scene understanding, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autonomous driving systems lack true scene understanding capabilities similar to human vision, relying instead on depth-based 3D reconstruction. The goal is to bridge this gap by developing a more human-like perception-understanding-action architecture.

Method: Proposes OmniScene with OmniVLM (Vision-Language Model) that integrates multi-view and temporal perception. Uses teacher-student architecture with knowledge distillation to embed textual representations into 3D instance features. Introduces Hierarchical Fusion Strategy (HFS) to adaptively calibrate geometric and semantic features at multiple abstraction levels for multimodal integration.

Result: Comprehensive evaluation on nuScenes dataset shows superior performance against over ten state-of-the-art models across perception, prediction, planning, and visual question answering tasks, establishing new benchmarks.

Conclusion: OmniScene successfully bridges the gap between current autonomous driving systems and human-like scene understanding capabilities, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating vision-language modeling with multi-view temporal perception for holistic 4D scene understanding.

Abstract: Human vision is capable of transforming two-dimensional observations into an
egocentric three-dimensional scene understanding, which underpins the ability
to translate complex scenes and exhibit adaptive behaviors. This capability,
however, remains lacking in current autonomous driving systems, where
mainstream approaches primarily rely on depth-based 3D reconstruction rather
than true scene understanding. To address this limitation, we propose a novel
human-like framework called OmniScene. First, we introduce the OmniScene
Vision-Language Model (OmniVLM), a vision-language framework that integrates
multi-view and temporal perception for holistic 4D scene understanding. Then,
harnessing a teacher-student OmniVLM architecture and knowledge distillation,
we embed textual representations into 3D instance features for semantic
supervision, enriching feature learning, and explicitly capturing human-like
attentional semantics. These feature representations are further aligned with
human driving behaviors, forming a more human-like
perception-understanding-action architecture. In addition, we propose a
Hierarchical Fusion Strategy (HFS) to address imbalances in modality
contributions during multimodal integration. Our approach adaptively calibrates
the relative significance of geometric and semantic features at multiple
abstraction levels, enabling the synergistic use of complementary cues from
visual and textual modalities. This learnable dynamic fusion enables a more
nuanced and effective exploitation of heterogeneous information. We evaluate
OmniScene comprehensively on the nuScenes dataset, benchmarking it against over
ten state-of-the-art models across various tasks. Our approach consistently
achieves superior results, establishing new benchmarks in perception,
prediction, planning, and visual question answering.

TL;DR: CamPVG is the first diffusion-based framework for panoramic video generation guided by precise camera poses, addressing challenges in panoramic pose representation and spherical projection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on camera control in perspective projection video generation, but geometrically consistent panoramic video generation remains challenging due to complexities in panoramic pose representation and spherical projection.

Method: Proposes panoramic Plücker embedding for camera position encoding and spherical epipolar module for cross-view feature aggregation. The pose encoder captures panoramic geometry through spherical coordinate transformation, while the epipolar module enforces geometric constraints through adaptive attention masking along epipolar lines.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that the method generates high-quality panoramic videos consistent with camera trajectories, far surpassing existing methods in panoramic video generation.

Conclusion: CamPVG effectively overcomes limitations of traditional methods for equirectangular projections and enables fine-grained cross-view feature aggregation, substantially enhancing the quality and consistency of generated panoramic videos.

Abstract: Recently, camera-controlled video generation has seen rapid development,
offering more precise control over video generation. However, existing methods
predominantly focus on camera control in perspective projection video
generation, while geometrically consistent panoramic video generation remains
challenging. This limitation is primarily due to the inherent complexities in
panoramic pose representation and spherical projection. To address this issue,
we propose CamPVG, the first diffusion-based framework for panoramic video
generation guided by precise camera poses. We achieve camera position encoding
for panoramic images and cross-view feature aggregation based on spherical
projection. Specifically, we propose a panoramic Pl\"ucker embedding that
encodes camera extrinsic parameters through spherical coordinate
transformation. This pose encoder effectively captures panoramic geometry,
overcoming the limitations of traditional methods when applied to
equirectangular projections. Additionally, we introduce a spherical epipolar
module that enforces geometric constraints through adaptive attention masking
along epipolar lines. This module enables fine-grained cross-view feature
aggregation, substantially enhancing the quality and consistency of generated
panoramic videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method generates
high-quality panoramic videos consistent with camera trajectories, far
surpassing existing methods in panoramic video generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pomelo detection is crucial for automated harvesting and maturity analysis, but faces challenges like multi-scale issues, obstructions from trunks/leaves, and small object detection in complex orchard environments.

Conclusion: SDE-DET provides a reliable method for Shatian pomelo detection, laying the foundation for developing automatic harvest robots in agricultural applications.

Abstract: Pomelo detection is an essential process for their localization, automated
robotic harvesting, and maturity analysis. However, detecting Shatian pomelo in
complex orchard environments poses significant challenges, including
multi-scale issues, obstructions from trunks and leaves, small object
detection, etc. To address these issues, this study constructs a custom dataset
STP-AgriData and proposes the SDE-DET model for Shatian pomelo detection.
SDE-DET first utilizes the Star Block to effectively acquire high-dimensional
information without increasing the computational overhead. Furthermore, the
presented model adopts Deformable Attention in its backbone, to enhance its
ability to detect pomelos under occluded conditions. Finally, multiple
Efficient Multi-Scale Attention mechanisms are integrated into our model to
reduce the computational overhead and extract deep visual representations,
thereby improving the capacity for small object detection. In the experiment,
we compared SDE-DET with the Yolo series and other mainstream detection models
in Shatian pomelo detection. The presented SDE-DET model achieved scores of
0.883, 0.771, 0.838, 0.497, and 0.823 in Precision, Recall, mAP@0.5,
mAP@0.5:0.95 and F1-score, respectively. SDE-DET has achieved state-of-the-art
performance on the STP-AgriData dataset. Experiments indicate that the SDE-DET
provides a reliable method for Shatian pomelo detection, laying the foundation
for the further development of automatic harvest robots.

### [47] [Improving Generalizability and Undetectability for Targeted Adversarial Attacks on Multimodal Pre-trained Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19994)
*Zhifang Zhang,Jiahan Zhang,Shengjie Zhou,Qi Wei,Shuo He,Feng Liu,Lei Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Proxy Targeted Attack (PTA), a novel method to improve targeted adversarial attacks on multimodal pre-trained models by addressing limitations in generalizability and undetectability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing targeted adversarial attacks on multimodal pre-trained models have limitations in generalizability (limited effectiveness against partially known or semantically similar targets) and undetectability (easily detected by simple anomaly detection methods).

Method: PTA leverages multiple source-modal and target-modal proxies to optimize targeted adversarial examples, ensuring they remain evasive to defenses while aligning with multiple potential targets. The method includes theoretical analyses to optimize generalizability while meeting undetectability requirements.

Result: Experimental results show that PTA achieves high success rates across various related targets and remains undetectable against multiple anomaly detection methods.

Conclusion: PTA effectively addresses the limitations of existing targeted adversarial attacks on multimodal pre-trained models, providing improved generalizability and undetectability through proxy-based optimization.

Abstract: Multimodal pre-trained models (e.g., ImageBind), which align distinct data
modalities into a shared embedding space, have shown remarkable success across
downstream tasks. However, their increasing adoption raises serious security
concerns, especially regarding targeted adversarial attacks. In this paper, we
show that existing targeted adversarial attacks on multimodal pre-trained
models still have limitations in two aspects: generalizability and
undetectability. Specifically, the crafted targeted adversarial examples (AEs)
exhibit limited generalization to partially known or semantically similar
targets in cross-modal alignment tasks (i.e., limited generalizability) and can
be easily detected by simple anomaly detection methods (i.e., limited
undetectability). To address these limitations, we propose a novel method
called Proxy Targeted Attack (PTA), which leverages multiple source-modal and
target-modal proxies to optimize targeted AEs, ensuring they remain evasive to
defenses while aligning with multiple potential targets. We also provide
theoretical analyses to highlight the relationship between generalizability and
undetectability and to ensure optimal generalizability while meeting the
specified requirements for undetectability. Furthermore, experimental results
demonstrate that our PTA can achieve a high success rate across various related
targets and remain undetectable against multiple anomaly detection methods.

### [48] [Anomaly Detection by Clustering DINO Embeddings using a Dirichlet Process Mixture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19997)
*Nico Schulthess,Ender Konukoglu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes using DINOv2 embeddings with Dirichlet Process Mixture Model for unsupervised anomaly detection in medical imaging, achieving competitive performance while reducing computational burden.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing memory-bank approaches for anomaly detection become computationally expensive for large medical datasets, requiring a more efficient method.

Method: Models normative DINOv2 embeddings with Dirichlet Process Mixture Model (DPMM) instead of memory bank, using similarity between component centers and embeddings as anomaly score.

Result: DPMM with DINOv2 embeddings achieves competitive anomaly detection performance on medical benchmarks while halving computation time at inference. Normalized embeddings show better alignment with anatomical structures.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides an efficient and effective approach for unsupervised anomaly detection in medical imaging using foundational model embeddings with non-parametric mixture modeling.

Abstract: In this work, we leverage informative embeddings from foundational models for
unsupervised anomaly detection in medical imaging. For small datasets, a
memory-bank of normative features can directly be used for anomaly detection
which has been demonstrated recently. However, this is unsuitable for large
medical datasets as the computational burden increases substantially.
Therefore, we propose to model the distribution of normative DINOv2 embeddings
with a Dirichlet Process Mixture model (DPMM), a non-parametric mixture model
that automatically adjusts the number of mixture components to the data at
hand. Rather than using a memory bank, we use the similarity between the
component centers and the embeddings as anomaly score function to create a
coarse anomaly segmentation mask. Our experiments show that through DPMM
embeddings of DINOv2, despite being trained on natural images, achieve very
competitive anomaly detection performance on medical imaging benchmarks and can
do this while at least halving the computation time at inference. Our analysis
further indicates that normalized DINOv2 embeddings are generally more aligned
with anatomical structures than unnormalized features, even in the presence of
anomalies, making them great representations for anomaly detection. The code is

TL;DR: Active learning approach combining uncertainty and diversity strategies for efficient data annotation in table detection tasks, achieving better performance than random sampling with limited annotation budget.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient data annotation is critical for machine learning, especially in object detection tasks that require extensive labeled data. Active learning can minimize annotation costs by selecting the most informative samples.

Method: Proposes an active learning approach that incorporates both uncertainty-based and diversity-based selection strategies for table detection. Evaluated on TableBank-LaTeX and TableBank-Word datasets using CascadeTabNet and YOLOv9 architectures.

Result: AL-based example selection significantly outperforms random sampling, reducing annotation effort while maintaining comparable performance to fully supervised models. Achieves higher mAP scores within the same annotation budget.

Conclusion: The proposed active learning method effectively reduces annotation costs for table detection tasks while maintaining high performance, demonstrating the value of combining uncertainty and diversity strategies in sample selection.

Abstract: Efficient data annotation remains a critical challenge in machine learning,
particularly for object detection tasks requiring extensive labeled data.
Active learning (AL) has emerged as a promising solution to minimize annotation
costs by selecting the most informative samples. While traditional AL
approaches primarily rely on uncertainty-based selection, recent advances
suggest that incorporating diversity-based strategies can enhance sampling
efficiency in object detection tasks. Our approach ensures the selection of
representative examples that improve model generalization. We evaluate our
method on two benchmark datasets (TableBank-LaTeX, TableBank-Word) using
state-of-the-art table detection architectures, CascadeTabNet and YOLOv9. Our
results demonstrate that AL-based example selection significantly outperforms
random sampling, reducing annotation effort given a limited budget while
maintaining comparable performance to fully supervised models. Our method
achieves higher mAP scores within the same annotation budget.

*Xuekang Zhu,Ji-Zhe Zhou,Kaiwen Feng,Chenfan Qu,Yunfei Wang,Liting Zhou,Jian liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RITA reformulates image manipulation localization as a conditional sequence prediction task, predicting manipulated regions layer-by-layer to model temporal dependencies and hierarchical structures of editing operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image manipulation localization methods are manipulation-process-agnostic, using one-shot prediction that compresses the high-dimensional compositional space into a single binary mask, causing dimensional collapse and fundamental mismatch with the intrinsic nature of the task.

Method: Proposes RITA framework that predicts manipulated regions in an ordered, layer-by-layer manner using each step's prediction as condition for the next. Constructs HSIM benchmark with multi-step manipulation data and introduces HSS metric for sequential order and hierarchical alignment evaluation.

Result: RITA achieves state-of-the-art performance on traditional benchmarks and provides solid foundation for hierarchical localization task, validating its potential as general and effective paradigm.

Conclusion: The sequential prediction approach effectively addresses limitations of one-shot methods by modeling the inherent sequentiality and hierarchical characteristics of image manipulation processes.

Abstract: Image manipulations often entail a complex manipulation process, comprising a
series of editing operations to create a deceptive image, exhibiting
sequentiality and hierarchical characteristics. However, existing IML methods
remain manipulation-process-agnostic, directly producing localization masks in
a one-shot prediction paradigm without modeling the underlying editing steps.
This one-shot paradigm compresses the high-dimensional compositional space into
a single binary mask, inducing severe dimensional collapse, thereby creating a
fundamental mismatch with the intrinsic nature of the IML task.
  To address this, we are the first to reformulate image manipulation
localization as a conditional sequence prediction task, proposing the RITA
framework. RITA predicts manipulated regions layer-by-layer in an ordered
manner, using each step's prediction as the condition for the next, thereby
explicitly modeling temporal dependencies and hierarchical structures among
editing operations.
  To enable training and evaluation, we synthesize multi-step manipulation data
and construct a new benchmark HSIM. We further propose the HSS metric to assess
sequential order and hierarchical alignment. Extensive experiments show RITA
achieves SOTA on traditional benchmarks and provides a solid foundation for the
novel hierarchical localization task, validating its potential as a general and
effective paradigm. The code and dataset will be publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PS3 is a multimodal fusion model that integrates pathology reports, whole slide images, and transcriptomic data for improved cancer survival prediction using prototype-based representations and Transformer architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal approaches focus on histology-genomic integration, but pathology reports contain valuable complementary information. However, modality heterogeneity (high-dimensional WSIs vs. concise text reports) creates imbalance challenges that need addressing.

Method: Proposes PS3: (1) Diagnostic prototypes from pathology reports using self-attention, (2) Histological prototypes for WSIs, (3) Biological pathway prototypes for transcriptomics. Uses Transformer to model intra-modal and cross-modal interactions across the three modalities.

Result: PS3 outperforms state-of-the-art clinical, unimodal, and multimodal baselines on six TCGA datasets, demonstrating enhanced prognostic performance.

Conclusion: The prototype-based approach effectively addresses modality imbalance and successfully integrates three heterogeneous modalities, providing a robust framework for multimodal survival prediction in computational oncology.

Abstract: Current multimodal fusion approaches in computational oncology primarily
focus on integrating multi-gigapixel histology whole slide images (WSIs) with
genomic or transcriptomic data, demonstrating improved survival prediction. We
hypothesize that incorporating pathology reports can further enhance prognostic
performance. Pathology reports, as essential components of clinical workflows,
offer readily available complementary information by summarizing
histopathological findings and integrating expert interpretations and clinical
context. However, fusing these modalities poses challenges due to their
heterogeneous nature. WSIs are high-dimensional, each containing several
billion pixels, whereas pathology reports consist of concise text summaries of
varying lengths, leading to potential modality imbalance. To address this, we
propose a prototype-based approach to generate balanced representations, which
are then integrated using a Transformer-based fusion model for survival
prediction that we term PS3 (Predicting Survival from Three Modalities).
Specifically, we present: (1) Diagnostic prototypes from pathology reports,
leveraging self-attention to extract diagnostically relevant sections and
standardize text representation; (2) Histological prototypes to compactly
represent key morphological patterns in WSIs; and (3) Biological pathway
prototypes to encode transcriptomic expressions, accurately capturing cellular
functions. PS3, the three-modal transformer model, processes the resulting
prototype-based multimodal tokens and models intra-modal and cross-modal
interactions across pathology reports, WSIs and transcriptomic data. The
proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods when evaluated against
clinical, unimodal and multimodal baselines on six datasets from The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA). The code is available at: https://github.com/manahilr/PS3.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A privacy-preserving authentication method using GANs to transform face images into visually private domains (e.g., flowers/shoes) while maintaining authentication utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional biometric systems lack user control over data usage and are vulnerable to data leaks and misuse without user knowledge.

Method: Use GANs to translate face images to visually private domains, then train classifiers on these transformed images for authentication.

Result: The method is robust against attacks and provides meaningful utility for authentication purposes.

Conclusion: The proposed GAN-based approach effectively preserves privacy while maintaining authentication functionality.

Abstract: Biometric-based authentication systems are getting broadly adopted in many
areas. However, these systems do not allow participating users to influence the
way their data is used. Furthermore, the data may leak and can be misused
without the users' knowledge. In this paper, we propose a new authentication
method that preserves the privacy of individuals and is based on a generative
adversarial network (GAN). Concretely, we suggest using the GAN for translating
images of faces to a visually private domain (e.g., flowers or shoes).
Classifiers, which are used for authentication purposes, are then trained on
the images from the visually private domain. Based on our experiments, the
method is robust against attacks and still provides meaningful utility.

TL;DR: A framework for predicting image quality specifically for secure graphic verification tasks, using a lightweight model to select suitable frames for verification to address reliability issues in smartphone captures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Poor image acquisition on smartphones causes high false rejection rates in secure graphic verification, creating a reliability gap that traditional perceptual IQA methods fail to address.

Method: Propose a lightweight model to predict quality scores for video frames, determining their suitability for resource-intensive verification. Validated using FNMR and ISRR metrics on 32,000+ images from 105 smartphones, with cross-domain analysis across different printing technologies.

Result: Key finding: a lightweight probe on a frozen ImageNet-pretrained network generalizes better to unseen printing technology than fully fine-tuned models, showing frozen general-purpose backbones are more robust to domain shifts from physical manufacturing.

Conclusion: For domain shifts in physical manufacturing, frozen general-purpose backbones provide better real-world generalization than full fine-tuning, which can overfit to source-domain artifacts.

Abstract: The reliability of secure graphic verification, a key anti-counterfeiting
tool, is undermined by poor image acquisition on smartphones. Uncontrolled user
captures of these high-entropy patterns cause high false rejection rates,
creating a significant 'reliability gap'. To bridge this gap, we depart from
traditional perceptual IQA and introduce a framework that predictively
estimates a frame's utility for the downstream verification task. We propose a
lightweight model to predict a quality score for a video frame, determining its
suitability for a resource-intensive oracle model. Our framework is validated
using re-contextualized FNMR and ISRR metrics on a large-scale dataset of
32,000+ images from 105 smartphones. Furthermore, a novel cross-domain analysis
on graphics from different industrial printing presses reveals a key finding: a
lightweight probe on a frozen, ImageNet-pretrained network generalizes better
to an unseen printing technology than a fully fine-tuned model. This provides a
key insight for real-world generalization: for domain shifts from physical
manufacturing, a frozen general-purpose backbone can be more robust than full
fine-tuning, which can overfit to source-domain artifacts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SHMoAReg is a novel deformable image registration network that uses Mixture of Experts (MoE) mechanism in both encoder and decoder, with Mixture of Attention heads for specialized feature extraction and Spatial Heterogeneous MoE for direction-specific deformation prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current encoder-decoder architectures for deformable image registration lack specialized feature extraction for registration tasks and predict deformation fields homogeneously across all three directions, limiting performance and interpretability.

Method: Proposes SHMoAReg with Mixture of Attention heads (MoA) in encoder layers for dynamic attention head selection, and Spatial Heterogeneous Mixture of Experts (SHMoE) in decoder layers for heterogeneous deformation prediction using experts with varying kernel sizes per voxel direction.

Result: Experiments on two public datasets show consistent improvements, with Dice score increasing from 60.58% to 65.58% on abdominal CT dataset. The method also enhances interpretability by differentiating expert utilities across resolution layers.

Conclusion: SHMoAReg is the first to introduce MoE mechanism into DIR tasks, achieving superior performance and improved interpretability compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Encoder-Decoder architectures are widely used in deep learning-based
Deformable Image Registration (DIR), where the encoder extracts multi-scale
features and the decoder predicts deformation fields by recovering spatial
locations. However, current methods lack specialized extraction of features
(that are useful for registration) and predict deformation jointly and
homogeneously in all three directions. In this paper, we propose a novel
expert-guided DIR network with Mixture of Experts (MoE) mechanism applied in
both encoder and decoder, named SHMoAReg. Specifically, we incorporate Mixture
of Attention heads (MoA) into encoder layers, while Spatial Heterogeneous
Mixture of Experts (SHMoE) into the decoder layers. The MoA enhances the
specialization of feature extraction by dynamically selecting the optimal
combination of attention heads for each image token. Meanwhile, the SHMoE
predicts deformation fields heterogeneously in three directions for each voxel
using experts with varying kernel sizes. Extensive experiments conducted on two
publicly available datasets show consistent improvements over various methods,
with a notable increase from 60.58% to 65.58% in Dice score for the abdominal
CT dataset. Furthermore, SHMoAReg enhances model interpretability by
differentiating experts' utilities across/within different resolution layers.
To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce MoE mechanism into
DIR tasks. The code will be released soon.

*Zizheng Yang,Hu Yu,Bing Li,Jinghao Zhang,Jie Huang,Feng Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffLI²D is a novel image dehazing method that leverages pre-trained diffusion models' latent representations without retraining or iterative sampling, achieving superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the computational burden of retraining diffusion models and their extensive sampling steps in image dehazing applications.

Method: Utilizes semantic latent space of frozen pre-trained diffusion models to represent content and haze characteristics, integrating diffusion latent representations at different time-steps into a dehazing network.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate superior performance compared to existing image dehazing methods.

Conclusion: The approach effectively utilizes pre-trained diffusion models' representations for image dehazing, offering a novel perspective while avoiding computational costs.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently been investigated as powerful generative
solvers for image dehazing, owing to their remarkable capability to model the
data distribution. However, the massive computational burden imposed by the
retraining of diffusion models, coupled with the extensive sampling steps
during the inference, limit the broader application of diffusion models in
image dehazing. To address these issues, we explore the properties of hazy
images in the semantic latent space of frozen pre-trained diffusion models, and
propose a Diffusion Latent Inspired network for Image Dehazing, dubbed
DiffLI$^2$D. Specifically, we first reveal that the semantic latent space of
pre-trained diffusion models can represent the content and haze characteristics
of hazy images, as the diffusion time-step changes. Building upon this insight,
we integrate the diffusion latent representations at different time-steps into
a delicately designed dehazing network to provide instructions for image
dehazing. Our DiffLI$^2$D avoids re-training diffusion models and iterative
sampling process by effectively utilizing the informative representations
derived from the pre-trained diffusion models, which also offers a novel
perspective for introducing diffusion models to image dehazing. Extensive
experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
superior performance to existing image dehazing methods. Code is available at

*JuanaJuana Valeria Hurtado,Rohit Mohan,Abhinav Valada*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel hyperspectral adapter that leverages pretrained vision foundation models to achieve state-of-the-art semantic segmentation performance using hyperspectral imaging inputs for autonomous driving applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current HSI semantic segmentation methods underperform because they rely on architectures optimized for RGB inputs. Hyperspectral imaging's rich spectral content has potential for robust robotic perception in challenging environments, but existing methods fail to effectively utilize this spectral information.

Method: Proposes a hyperspectral adapter with spectral transformer and spectrum-aware spatial prior module to extract spatial-spectral features. Includes modality-aware interaction block that integrates hyperspectral representations with frozen vision Transformer features through dedicated extraction and injection mechanisms.

Result: Extensive evaluations on three benchmark autonomous driving datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art semantic segmentation performance, outperforming both vision-based and hyperspectral segmentation methods.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture effectively leverages pretrained vision foundation models to learn from hyperspectral data, achieving superior performance for semantic segmentation tasks in autonomous driving scenarios.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) captures spatial information along with dense
spectral measurements across numerous narrow wavelength bands. This rich
spectral content has the potential to facilitate robust robotic perception,
particularly in environments with complex material compositions, varying
illumination, or other visually challenging conditions. However, current HSI
semantic segmentation methods underperform due to their reliance on
architectures and learning frameworks optimized for RGB inputs. In this work,
we propose a novel hyperspectral adapter that leverages pretrained vision
foundation models to effectively learn from hyperspectral data. Our
architecture incorporates a spectral transformer and a spectrum-aware spatial
prior module to extract rich spatial-spectral features. Additionally, we
introduce a modality-aware interaction block that facilitates effective
integration of hyperspectral representations and frozen vision Transformer
features through dedicated extraction and injection mechanisms. Extensive
evaluations on three benchmark autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that our
architecture achieves state-of-the-art semantic segmentation performance while
directly using HSI inputs, outperforming both vision-based and hyperspectral
segmentation methods. We make the code available at

### [57] [A Simple Data Augmentation Strategy for Text-in-Image Scientific VQA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20119)
*Belal Shoer,Yova Kementchedjhieva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in scientific visual question answering by proposing a method to synthesize training data in 'text-in-image' format, improving performance of multilingual multimodal models across 13 languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientific visual question answering is difficult for vision-language models due to complex figures and multimodal context. Existing approaches treat visual and textual content separately, and even state-of-the-art models perform poorly in zero-shot settings on the EXAMS-V benchmark, highlighting the need for task-specific fine-tuning and addressing data scarcity in the text-in-image format.

Method: To overcome the scarcity of training data in text-in-image format, the authors synthesize a new dataset by converting existing separate image-text pairs into unified images. They then fine-tune a small multilingual multimodal model on a combination of their synthetic data and the EXAMS-V dataset.

Result: Fine-tuning on the mixed dataset yields notable gains across 13 languages, demonstrating strong average improvements and effective cross-lingual transfer capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed approach of synthesizing text-in-image training data and fine-tuning multilingual multimodal models effectively addresses the challenges of scientific visual question answering, achieving significant performance improvements across multiple languages.

Abstract: Scientific visual question answering poses significant challenges for
vision-language models due to the complexity of scientific figures and their
multimodal context. Traditional approaches treat the figure and accompanying
text (e.g., questions and answer options) as separate inputs. EXAMS-V
introduced a new paradigm by embedding both visual and textual content into a
single image. However, even state-of-the-art proprietary models perform poorly
on this setup in zero-shot settings, underscoring the need for task-specific
fine-tuning. To address the scarcity of training data in this "text-in-image"
format, we synthesize a new dataset by converting existing separate image-text
pairs into unified images. Fine-tuning a small multilingual multimodal model on
a mix of our synthetic data and EXAMS-V yields notable gains across 13
languages, demonstrating strong average improvements and cross-lingual
transfer.

### [58] [EchoBench: Benchmarking Sycophancy in Medical Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20146)
*Botai Yuan,Yutian Zhou,Yingjie Wang,Fushuo Huo,Yongcheng Jing,Li Shen,Ying Wei,Zhiqi Shen,Ziwei Liu,Tianwei Zhang,Jie Yang,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EchoBench is a new benchmark that evaluates sycophancy (uncritical echoing of user-provided information) in medical Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), revealing significant reliability and safety issues across all tested models despite their accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical LVLM benchmarks focus primarily on accuracy while overlooking critical reliability and safety concerns, particularly sycophancy in high-stakes clinical settings where uncritical echoing of biased inputs could have serious consequences.

Method: The authors created EchoBench with 2,122 medical images across 18 departments and 20 modalities, using 90 prompts that simulate biased inputs from patients, medical students, and physicians. They evaluated medical-specific, open-source, and proprietary LVLMs and conducted fine-grained analyses by bias type, department, perceptual granularity, and modality.

Result: All tested models exhibited substantial sycophancy, with the best proprietary model (Claude 3.7 Sonnet) showing 45.98% sycophancy and GPT-4.1 reaching 59.15%. Many medical-specific models exceeded 95% sycophancy despite only moderate accuracy. Higher data quality/diversity and stronger domain knowledge were found to reduce sycophancy without harming unbiased accuracy.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the critical need for robust evaluation beyond accuracy in medical LVLMs and provide actionable guidance for developing safer, more trustworthy models through prompt-level interventions and improved training strategies.

Abstract: Recent benchmarks for medical Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) emphasize
leaderboard accuracy, overlooking reliability and safety. We study sycophancy
-- models' tendency to uncritically echo user-provided information -- in
high-stakes clinical settings. We introduce EchoBench, a benchmark to
systematically evaluate sycophancy in medical LVLMs. It contains 2,122 images
across 18 departments and 20 modalities with 90 prompts that simulate biased
inputs from patients, medical students, and physicians. We evaluate
medical-specific, open-source, and proprietary LVLMs. All exhibit substantial
sycophancy; the best proprietary model (Claude 3.7 Sonnet) still shows 45.98%
sycophancy, and GPT-4.1 reaches 59.15%. Many medical-specific models exceed 95%
sycophancy despite only moderate accuracy. Fine-grained analyses by bias type,
department, perceptual granularity, and modality identify factors that increase
susceptibility. We further show that higher data quality/diversity and stronger
domain knowledge reduce sycophancy without harming unbiased accuracy. EchoBench
also serves as a testbed for mitigation: simple prompt-level interventions
(negative prompting, one-shot, few-shot) produce consistent reductions and
motivate training- and decoding-time strategies. Our findings highlight the
need for robust evaluation beyond accuracy and provide actionable guidance
toward safer, more trustworthy medical LVLMs.

*Sanish Suwal,Shaurya Garg,Dipkamal Bhusal,Michael Clifford,Nidhi Rastogi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pruning significantly enhances the comprehensibility and faithfulness of post-hoc explanations for traffic sign classifiers, making it a promising strategy for transparent deep learning in autonomous vehicles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Connected and autonomous vehicles rely on AI systems where transparency and security are critical. Post-hoc explanations provide transparency but their quality is often questioned due to inconsistencies and lack of faithfulness in representing model decisions.

Method: Systematic examination of three training approaches (natural training, adversarial training, and pruning) on traffic sign classifiers, using extensive empirical evaluation with saliency maps to assess explanation quality.

Result: Pruning significantly enhances the comprehensibility and faithfulness of explanations. Pruning improves model efficiency and enforces sparsity in learned representation, leading to more interpretable and reliable decisions.

Conclusion: Pruning is a promising strategy for developing transparent deep learning models, especially in resource-constrained vehicular AI systems, as it enhances both model efficiency and explanation quality.

Abstract: Connected and autonomous vehicles continue to heavily rely on AI systems,
where transparency and security are critical for trust and operational safety.
Post-hoc explanations provide transparency to these black-box like AI models
but the quality and reliability of these explanations is often questioned due
to inconsistencies and lack of faithfulness in representing model decisions.
This paper systematically examines the impact of three widely used training
approaches, namely natural training, adversarial training, and pruning, affect
the quality of post-hoc explanations for traffic sign classifiers. Through
extensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that pruning significantly
enhances the comprehensibility and faithfulness of explanations (using saliency
maps). Our findings reveal that pruning not only improves model efficiency but
also enforces sparsity in learned representation, leading to more interpretable
and reliable decisions. Additionally, these insights suggest that pruning is a
promising strategy for developing transparent deep learning models, especially
in resource-constrained vehicular AI systems.

*Min Cen,Zhenfeng Zhuang,Yuzhe Zhang,Min Zeng,Baptiste Magnier,Lequan Yu,Hong Zhang,Liansheng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: C²MIL is a novel dual causal graph-based MIL model that addresses semantic bias and topological noise in survival analysis with WSIs through semantic causal intervention and topological causal discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Variations in staining/scanning introduce semantic bias, while irrelevant topological subgraphs create noise, leading to biased slide-level representations that hinder interpretability and generalization in graph-based MIL for survival analysis.

Method: Proposes a dual structural causal model with: 1) cross-scale adaptive feature disentangling module for semantic causal intervention, 2) Bernoulli differentiable causal subgraph sampling for topological causal discovery, and 3) joint optimization combining disentangling supervision and contrastive learning.

Result: Experiments show C²MIL consistently improves generalization and interpretability over existing methods and can serve as a causal enhancement for diverse MIL baselines.

Conclusion: C²MIL effectively addresses semantic and topological biases in graph-based MIL through causal modeling, providing both improved performance and enhanced interpretability for survival analysis with WSIs.

Abstract: Graph-based Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is widely used in survival
analysis with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H\&E)-stained whole slide images (WSIs)
due to its ability to capture topological information. However, variations in
staining and scanning can introduce semantic bias, while topological subgraphs
that are not relevant to the causal relationships can create noise, resulting
in biased slide-level representations. These issues can hinder both the
interpretability and generalization of the analysis. To tackle this, we
introduce a dual structural causal model as the theoretical foundation and
propose a novel and interpretable dual causal graph-based MIL model, C$^2$MIL.
C$^2$MIL incorporates a novel cross-scale adaptive feature disentangling module
for semantic causal intervention and a new Bernoulli differentiable causal
subgraph sampling method for topological causal discovery. A joint optimization
strategy combining disentangling supervision and contrastive learning enables
simultaneous refinement of both semantic and topological causalities.
Experiments demonstrate that C$^2$MIL consistently improves generalization and
interpretability over existing methods and can serve as a causal enhancement
for diverse MIL baselines. The code is available at

### [61] [U-Mamba2-SSL for Semi-Supervised Tooth and Pulp Segmentation in CBCT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20154)
*Zhi Qin Tan,Xiatian Zhu,Owen Addison,Yunpeng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: U-Mamba2-SSL is a semi-supervised learning framework for automated teeth and pulp segmentation in CBCT images, achieving high accuracy with limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual segmentation of teeth and pulp in CBCT images requires extensive expertise and is time-consuming, creating a need for automated algorithms that can effectively utilize unlabeled data.

Method: The framework builds on U-Mamba2 model with multi-stage training: self-supervised pre-training using disruptive autoencoder, consistency regularization with input/feature perturbations, and pseudo-labeling with reduced loss weighting.

Result: Achieved an average score of 0.872 and DSC of 0.969 on validation dataset, demonstrating superior performance.

Conclusion: U-Mamba2-SSL provides an effective semi-supervised approach for medical image segmentation that leverages unlabeled data to achieve high accuracy in teeth and pulp segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of teeth and pulp in Cone-Beam Computed Tomography
(CBCT) is vital for clinical applications like treatment planning and
diagnosis. However, this process requires extensive expertise and is
exceptionally time-consuming, highlighting the critical need for automated
algorithms that can effectively utilize unlabeled data. In this paper, we
propose U-Mamba2-SSL, a novel semi-supervised learning framework that builds on
the U-Mamba2 model and employs a multi-stage training strategy. The framework
first pre-trains U-Mamba2 in a self-supervised manner using a disruptive
autoencoder. It then leverages unlabeled data through consistency
regularization, where we introduce input and feature perturbations to ensure
stable model outputs. Finally, a pseudo-labeling strategy is implemented with a
reduced loss weighting to minimize the impact of potential errors. U-Mamba2-SSL
achieved an average score of 0.872 and a DSC of 0.969 on the validation
dataset, demonstrating the superior performance of our approach. The code is

### [62] [Optical Ocean Recipes: Creating Realistic Datasets to Facilitate Underwater Vision Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20171)
*Patricia Schöntag,David Nakath,Judith Fischer,Rüdiger Röttgers,Kevin Köser*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Optical Ocean Recipes is a framework for creating realistic underwater datasets with controlled conditions to address the lack of generalizable machine vision testing in underwater environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine vision evaluations in underwater environments lack generalizability due to specific optical water types and imaging conditions, making exhaustive testing impractical.

Method: The framework uses calibrated color and scattering additives to create realistic, repeatable datasets under controlled underwater conditions, enabling ground-truth data creation for various vision tasks.

Result: A demonstration dataset was generated using Optical Ocean Recipes, showing its utility for water parameter estimation, image restoration, segmentation, visual SLAM, and underwater image synthesis.

Conclusion: Optical Ocean Recipes provides a unique framework for analyzing machine vision in realistic yet controlled underwater scenarios, with the dataset and evaluation code to be made available.

Abstract: The development and evaluation of machine vision in underwater environments
remains challenging, often relying on trial-and-error-based testing tailored to
specific applications. This is partly due to the lack of controlled,
ground-truthed testing environments that account for the optical challenges,
such as color distortion from spectrally variant light attenuation, reduced
contrast and blur from backscatter and volume scattering, and dynamic light
patterns from natural or artificial illumination. Additionally, the appearance
of ocean water in images varies significantly across regions, depths, and
seasons. However, most machine vision evaluations are conducted under specific
optical water types and imaging conditions, therefore often lack
generalizability. Exhaustive testing across diverse open-water scenarios is
technically impractical. To address this, we introduce the \textit{Optical
Ocean Recipes}, a framework for creating realistic datasets under controlled
underwater conditions. Unlike synthetic or open-water data, these recipes,
using calibrated color and scattering additives, enable repeatable and
controlled testing of the impact of water composition on image appearance.
Hence, this provides a unique framework for analyzing machine vision in
realistic, yet controlled underwater scenarios. The controlled environment
enables the creation of ground-truth data for a range of vision tasks,
including water parameter estimation, image restoration, segmentation, visual
SLAM, and underwater image synthesis. We provide a demonstration dataset
generated using the Optical Ocean Recipes and briefly demonstrate the use of
our system for two underwater vision tasks. The dataset and evaluation code
will be made available.

### [63] [Universal Camouflage Attack on Vision-Language Models for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20196)
*Dehong Kong,Sifan Yu,Siyuan Liang,Jiawei Liang,Jianhou Gan,Aishan Liu,Wenqi Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes the first Universal Camouflage Attack (UCA) framework for Visual Language Modeling in Automated Driving (VLM-AD), addressing vulnerabilities in current systems through feature-space optimization and physically realizable camouflage textures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial attacks on VLM-AD systems face challenges: physical attacks target low-level vision modules and don't transfer well, while current VLM-AD attacks are mostly digital. The observed vulnerability of encoder and projection layers in VLM-AD motivates a feature-space approach.

Method: UCA operates in feature space rather than logit layer, using a feature divergence loss (FDL) to maximize representational discrepancy between clean and adversarial images. It incorporates multi-scale learning and adjusts sampling ratio for better adaptability to real-world scale/viewpoint changes.

Result: Extensive experiments show UCA can induce incorrect driving commands across various VLM-AD models and scenarios, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods (30% improvement in 3-P metrics). It demonstrates strong robustness under diverse viewpoints and dynamic conditions.

Conclusion: UCA represents the first universal camouflage attack framework for VLM-AD with high practical deployment potential, effectively addressing the limitations of existing attack methods through feature-space optimization and enhanced real-world adaptability.

Abstract: Visual language modeling for automated driving is emerging as a promising
research direction with substantial improvements in multimodal reasoning
capabilities. Despite its advanced reasoning abilities, VLM-AD remains
vulnerable to serious security threats from adversarial attacks, which involve
misleading model decisions through carefully crafted perturbations. Existing
attacks have obvious challenges: 1) Physical adversarial attacks primarily
target vision modules. They are difficult to directly transfer to VLM-AD
systems because they typically attack low-level perceptual components. 2)
Adversarial attacks against VLM-AD have largely concentrated on the digital
level. To address these challenges, we propose the first Universal Camouflage
Attack (UCA) framework for VLM-AD. Unlike previous methods that focus on
optimizing the logit layer, UCA operates in the feature space to generate
physically realizable camouflage textures that exhibit strong generalization
across different user commands and model architectures. Motivated by the
observed vulnerability of encoder and projection layers in VLM-AD, UCA
introduces a feature divergence loss (FDL) that maximizes the representational
discrepancy between clean and adversarial images. In addition, UCA incorporates
a multi-scale learning strategy and adjusts the sampling ratio to enhance its
adaptability to changes in scale and viewpoint diversity in real-world
scenarios, thereby improving training stability. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that UCA can induce incorrect driving commands across various
VLM-AD models and driving scenarios, significantly surpassing existing
state-of-the-art attack methods (improving 30\% in 3-P metrics). Furthermore,
UCA exhibits strong attack robustness under diverse viewpoints and dynamic
conditions, indicating high potential for practical deployment.

*Mahmoud Khater,Mona Strauss,Philipp von Olshausen,Alexander Reiterer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PU-Gaussian is a novel point cloud upsampling method that uses anisotropic 3D Gaussian distributions to model local geometry and performs explicit sampling for dense point cloud generation, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing point cloud upsampling methods often sacrifice geometric interpretability or robustness to input sparsity. Sparse and noisy point clouds from 3D sensors need dense, high-fidelity representations for downstream tasks.

Method: Models local neighborhoods using anisotropic 3D Gaussian distributions, performs explicit point sampling in the geometric domain to generate coarse dense point clouds, then refines with a network for uniform distribution and sharp edges.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on PU1K and PUGAN datasets, demonstrating superior upsampling quality compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: PU-Gaussian provides an effective solution for point cloud upsampling that maintains geometric interpretability while being robust to input sparsity, with publicly available code and models.

Abstract: Point clouds produced by 3D sensors are often sparse and noisy, posing
challenges for tasks requiring dense and high-fidelity 3D representations.
Prior work has explored both implicit feature-based upsampling and
distance-function learning to address this, but often at the expense of
geometric interpretability or robustness to input sparsity. To overcome these
limitations, we propose PU-Gaussian, a novel upsampling network that models the
local neighborhood around each point using anisotropic 3D Gaussian
distributions. These Gaussians capture the underlying geometric structure,
allowing us to perform upsampling explicitly in the local geometric domain by
direct point sampling. The sampling process generates a dense, but coarse,
point cloud. A subsequent refinement network adjusts the coarse output to
produce a more uniform distribution and sharper edges. We perform extensive
testing on the PU1K and PUGAN datasets, demonstrating that PU-Gaussian achieves
state-of-the-art performance. We make code and model weights publicly available
at https://github.com/mvg-inatech/PU-Gaussian.git.

*Tom Burgert,Oliver Stoll,Paolo Rota,Begüm Demir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper challenges the established hypothesis that CNNs are inherently texture-biased by proposing a new domain-agnostic framework to quantify feature reliance through systematic cue suppression, revealing that CNNs actually rely more on local shape features than texture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To revisit and challenge the widely accepted hypothesis that Convolutional Neural Networks are inherently texture-biased, addressing limitations in previous cue-conflict experiments and providing a more comprehensive understanding of feature reliance in deep learning models.

Method: Proposed a domain-agnostic framework that systematically suppresses shape, texture, and color cues to quantify feature reliance without forced-choice conflicts. Evaluated both humans and neural networks under controlled suppression conditions across computer vision, medical imaging, and remote sensing domains.

Result: Found that CNNs are not inherently texture-biased but predominantly rely on local shape features. This reliance can be mitigated through modern training strategies or architectures. Domain-specific analysis revealed systematic differences: computer vision models prioritize shape, medical imaging emphasizes color, and remote sensing relies more on texture.

Conclusion: The texture-bias hypothesis for CNNs is oversimplified; models exhibit domain-specific feature reliance patterns that can be modified through architectural choices and training strategies, providing a more nuanced understanding of feature use in deep learning.

Abstract: The hypothesis that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are inherently
texture-biased has shaped much of the discourse on feature use in deep
learning. We revisit this hypothesis by examining limitations in the
cue-conflict experiment by Geirhos et al. To address these limitations, we
propose a domain-agnostic framework that quantifies feature reliance through
systematic suppression of shape, texture, and color cues, avoiding the
confounds of forced-choice conflicts. By evaluating humans and neural networks
under controlled suppression conditions, we find that CNNs are not inherently
texture-biased but predominantly rely on local shape features. Nonetheless,
this reliance can be substantially mitigated through modern training strategies
or architectures (ConvNeXt, ViTs). We further extend the analysis across
computer vision, medical imaging, and remote sensing, revealing that reliance
patterns differ systematically: computer vision models prioritize shape,
medical imaging models emphasize color, and remote sensing models exhibit a
stronger reliance towards texture. Code is available at

### [66] [An Anisotropic Cross-View Texture Transfer with Multi-Reference Non-Local Attention for CT Slice Interpolation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20242)
*Kwang-Hyun Uhm,Hyunjun Cho,Sung-Hoo Hong,Seung-Won Jung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel cross-view texture transfer approach for CT slice interpolation that leverages anisotropic CT volumes by transferring high-resolution in-plane texture details to low-resolution through-plane images using multi-reference non-local attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CT images are often acquired with large slice thicknesses due to cost constraints, resulting in anisotropic volumes with poor inter-slice resolution that can hinder disease diagnosis. Existing methods don't fully exploit the anisotropic nature of 3D CT volumes.

Method: Proposes a cross-view texture transfer framework that uses high-resolution in-plane texture as reference to enhance low-resolution through-plane images. Introduces a multi-reference non-local attention module to extract meaningful features for reconstructing through-plane high-frequency details from multiple in-plane images.

Result: The method performs significantly better than existing competing methods on public CT datasets including a real-paired benchmark, demonstrating superior CT slice interpolation performance.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively utilizes the anisotropic characteristic of 3D CT volumes and verifies the effectiveness of cross-view texture transfer for improving CT slice interpolation quality.

Abstract: Computed tomography (CT) is one of the most widely used non-invasive imaging
modalities for medical diagnosis. In clinical practice, CT images are usually
acquired with large slice thicknesses due to the high cost of memory storage
and operation time, resulting in an anisotropic CT volume with much lower
inter-slice resolution than in-plane resolution. Since such inconsistent
resolution may lead to difficulties in disease diagnosis, deep learning-based
volumetric super-resolution methods have been developed to improve inter-slice
resolution. Most existing methods conduct single-image super-resolution on the
through-plane or synthesize intermediate slices from adjacent slices; however,
the anisotropic characteristic of 3D CT volume has not been well explored. In
this paper, we propose a novel cross-view texture transfer approach for CT
slice interpolation by fully utilizing the anisotropic nature of 3D CT volume.
Specifically, we design a unique framework that takes high-resolution in-plane
texture details as a reference and transfers them to low-resolution
through-plane images. To this end, we introduce a multi-reference non-local
attention module that extracts meaningful features for reconstructing
through-plane high-frequency details from multiple in-plane images. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method performs significantly
better in CT slice interpolation than existing competing methods on public CT
datasets including a real-paired benchmark, verifying the effectiveness of the
proposed framework. The source code of this work is available at

TL;DR: PhiGenesis is a unified framework for 4D scene generation that bridges video generation and novel view synthesis, producing temporally continuous 4D Gaussian splatting representations from multi-view inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative models struggle to synthesize dynamic 4D driving scenes that support both temporal extrapolation and spatial novel view synthesis without per-scene optimization.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Pre-trained video VAE with range-view adapter for feed-forward 4D reconstruction; 2) Geometric-guided video diffusion model using rendered historical scenes as priors for future view generation, with Stereo Forcing conditioning strategy to address geometric exposure bias.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in appearance/geometric reconstruction, temporal generation, and novel view synthesis tasks, with competitive downstream evaluation performance.

Conclusion: PhiGenesis successfully bridges generation and novel view synthesis for dynamic 4D scenes, enabling temporally coherent synthesis without per-scene optimization.

Abstract: Current generative models struggle to synthesize dynamic 4D driving scenes
that simultaneously support temporal extrapolation and spatial novel view
synthesis (NVS) without per-scene optimization. Bridging generation and novel
view synthesis remains a major challenge. We present PhiGenesis, a unified
framework for 4D scene generation that extends video generation techniques with
geometric and temporal consistency. Given multi-view image sequences and camera
parameters, PhiGenesis produces temporally continuous 4D Gaussian splatting
representations along target 3D trajectories. In its first stage, PhiGenesis
leverages a pre-trained video VAE with a novel range-view adapter to enable
feed-forward 4D reconstruction from multi-view images. This architecture
supports single-frame or video inputs and outputs complete 4D scenes including
geometry, semantics, and motion. In the second stage, PhiGenesis introduces a
geometric-guided video diffusion model, using rendered historical 4D scenes as
priors to generate future views conditioned on trajectories. To address
geometric exposure bias in novel views, we propose Stereo Forcing, a novel
conditioning strategy that integrates geometric uncertainty during denoising.
This method enhances temporal coherence by dynamically adjusting generative
influence based on uncertainty-aware perturbations. Our experimental results
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
appearance and geometric reconstruction, temporal generation and novel view
synthesis (NVS) tasks, while simultaneously delivering competitive performance
in downstream evaluations. Homepage is at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VersaMammo is a versatile foundation model for mammograms that addresses limitations in current models by using a two-stage pre-training strategy and comprehensive evaluation across 92 clinical tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current foundation models for mammogram analysis have fundamental limitations including insufficient training data diversity, limited generalizability, and lack of comprehensive clinical evaluation, which constrain their clinical translation for breast cancer detection.

Method: Curated the largest multi-institutional mammogram dataset (706,239 images from 21 sources) and developed a two-stage pre-training strategy: 1) self-supervised learning for a teacher model to extract transferable features, 2) supervised learning with knowledge distillation to transfer features and clinical knowledge into VersaMammo.

Result: VersaMammo achieved state-of-the-art performance, ranking first in 50/68 internal tasks and 20/24 external validation tasks, with average ranks of 1.5 and 1.2 respectively across 5 clinical task categories (lesion detection, segmentation, classification, image retrieval, and visual question answering).

Conclusion: VersaMammo demonstrates superior generalization and clinical utility, representing a substantial advancement toward reliable and scalable breast cancer screening and diagnosis.

Abstract: Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of
cancer-related mortality in women globally. Mammography is essential for the
early detection and diagnosis of breast lesions. Despite recent progress in
foundation models (FMs) for mammogram analysis, their clinical translation
remains constrained by several fundamental limitations, including insufficient
diversity in training data, limited model generalizability, and a lack of
comprehensive evaluation across clinically relevant tasks. Here, we introduce
VersaMammo, a versatile foundation model for mammograms, designed to overcome
these limitations. We curated the largest multi-institutional mammogram dataset
to date, comprising 706,239 images from 21 sources. To improve generalization,
we propose a two-stage pre-training strategy to develop VersaMammo, a mammogram
foundation model. First, a teacher model is trained via self-supervised
learning to extract transferable features from unlabeled mammograms. Then,
supervised learning combined with knowledge distillation transfers both
features and clinical knowledge into VersaMammo. To ensure a comprehensive
evaluation, we established a benchmark comprising 92 specific tasks, including
68 internal tasks and 24 external validation tasks, spanning 5 major clinical
task categories: lesion detection, segmentation, classification, image
retrieval, and visual question answering. VersaMammo achieves state-of-the-art

Abstract: Agentic AI is rapidly advancing in healthcare and biomedical research.
However, in medical image analysis, their performance and adoption remain
limited due to the lack of a robust ecosystem, insufficient toolsets, and the
absence of real-time interactive expert feedback. Here we present "TissueLab",
a co-evolving agentic AI system that allows researchers to ask direct
questions, automatically plan and generate explainable workflows, and conduct
real-time analyses where experts can visualize intermediate results and refine
them. TissueLab integrates tool factories across pathology, radiology, and
spatial omics domains. By standardizing inputs, outputs, and capabilities of
diverse tools, the system determines when and how to invoke them to address
research and clinical questions. Across diverse tasks with clinically
meaningful quantifications that inform staging, prognosis, and treatment
planning, TissueLab achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with
end-to-end vision-language models (VLMs) and other agentic AI systems such as
GPT-5. Moreover, TissueLab continuously learns from clinicians, evolving toward
improved classifiers and more effective decision strategies. With active
learning, it delivers accurate results in unseen disease contexts within
minutes, without requiring massive datasets or prolonged retraining. Released
as a sustainable open-source ecosystem, TissueLab aims to accelerate
computational research and translational adoption in medical imaging while
establishing a foundation for the next generation of medical AI.

*Dayu Tan,Zhenpeng Xu,Yansen Su,Xin Peng,Chunhou Zheng,Weimin Zhong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiPerformer is a novel medical image segmentation method that addresses feature inconsistency issues in CNN-Transformer hybrid architectures through modular hierarchical design, Local-Global Feature Fusion, and Progressive Pyramid Aggregation modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CNN-Transformer hybrid methods use simple fusion techniques (serial stacking, concatenation, addition) that struggle with feature inconsistencies, leading to information conflict and loss between local details and global context.

Method: Proposes HiPerformer with: 1) Modular hierarchical encoder for parallel dynamic fusion of multi-source features, 2) LGFF module for precise local-global integration, 3) PPA module replacing skip connections for multi-scale feature aggregation and noise suppression.

Result: Experiments on 11 public datasets show superior performance over existing segmentation techniques, demonstrating higher accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: HiPerformer effectively addresses feature inconsistency problems in medical image segmentation through innovative architectural designs, achieving comprehensive feature representation and improved segmentation performance.

Abstract: Both local details and global context are crucial in medical image
segmentation, and effectively integrating them is essential for achieving high
accuracy. However, existing mainstream methods based on CNN-Transformer hybrid
architectures typically employ simple feature fusion techniques such as serial
stacking, endpoint concatenation, or pointwise addition, which struggle to
address the inconsistencies between features and are prone to information
conflict and loss. To address the aforementioned challenges, we innovatively
propose HiPerformer. The encoder of HiPerformer employs a novel modular
hierarchical architecture that dynamically fuses multi-source features in
parallel, enabling layer-wise deep integration of heterogeneous information.
The modular hierarchical design not only retains the independent modeling
capability of each branch in the encoder, but also ensures sufficient
information transfer between layers, effectively avoiding the degradation of
features and information loss that come with traditional stacking methods.
Furthermore, we design a Local-Global Feature Fusion (LGFF) module to achieve
precise and efficient integration of local details and global semantic
information, effectively alleviating the feature inconsistency problem and
resulting in a more comprehensive feature representation. To further enhance
multi-scale feature representation capabilities and suppress noise
interference, we also propose a Progressive Pyramid Aggregation (PPA) module to
replace traditional skip connections. Experiments on eleven public datasets
demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing segmentation
techniques, demonstrating higher segmentation accuracy and robustness. The code
is available at https://github.com/xzphappy/HiPerformer.

*Haruka Kumagai,Leslie Wöhler,Satoshi Ikehata,Kiyoharu Aizawa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a human-perception-based face similarity metric to address the limitations of existing binary identity classification methods in face anonymization, enabling more nuanced similarity measurements for better balance between anonymity and naturalness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing face anonymization models use binary identity classification which cannot measure nuanced similarities needed for optimal balance between anonymity and naturalness in face swapping applications.

Method: Created a dataset of 6,400 triplet annotations and used metric learning to predict human-perceived face similarity, developing a more sophisticated similarity measurement approach.

Result: Experimental results show significant improvements in both face similarity prediction and attribute-based face classification tasks compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed human-perception-based face similarity metric effectively addresses the limitations of binary classification and enables better face anonymization by capturing nuanced similarity relationships.

Abstract: In response to rising societal awareness of privacy concerns, face
anonymization techniques have advanced, including the emergence of
face-swapping methods that replace one identity with another. Achieving a
balance between anonymity and naturalness in face swapping requires careful
selection of identities: overly similar faces compromise anonymity, while
dissimilar ones reduce naturalness. Existing models, however, focus on binary
identity classification "the same person or not", making it difficult to
measure nuanced similarities such as "completely different" versus "highly
similar but different." This paper proposes a human-perception-based face
similarity metric, creating a dataset of 6,400 triplet annotations and metric
learning to predict the similarity. Experimental results demonstrate
significant improvements in both face similarity prediction and attribute-based
face classification tasks over existing methods.

### [72] [FAST: Foreground-aware Diffusion with Accelerated Sampling Trajectory for Segmentation-oriented Anomaly Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20295)
*Xichen Xu,Yanshu Wang,Jinbao Wang,Xiaoning Lei,Guoyang Xie,Guannan Jiang,Zhichao Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FAST is a foreground-aware diffusion framework for industrial anomaly segmentation that uses novel AIAS and FARM modules to efficiently generate high-quality, structure-specific anomalies in as few as 10 sampling steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial anomaly segmentation faces challenges with scarce, diverse, and costly pixel-level annotations. Existing anomaly synthesis methods struggle to balance efficiency and quality, and treat all spatial regions uniformly, ignoring statistical differences between anomaly and background areas.

Method: Proposes FAST framework with two modules: AIAS (training-free sampling algorithm for segmentation-oriented anomaly synthesis using coarse-to-fine aggregation) and FARM (adaptively adjusts anomaly-aware noise in masked foreground regions during denoising).

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple industrial benchmarks show FAST consistently outperforms existing anomaly synthesis methods in downstream segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: FAST enables efficient synthesis of high-quality, controllable anomalies tailored for segmentation tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal sampling steps.

Abstract: Industrial anomaly segmentation relies heavily on pixel-level annotations,
yet real-world anomalies are often scarce, diverse, and costly to label.
Segmentation-oriented industrial anomaly synthesis (SIAS) has emerged as a
promising alternative; however, existing methods struggle to balance sampling
efficiency and generation quality. Moreover, most approaches treat all spatial
regions uniformly, overlooking the distinct statistical differences between
anomaly and background areas. This uniform treatment hinders the synthesis of
controllable, structure-specific anomalies tailored for segmentation tasks. In
this paper, we propose FAST, a foreground-aware diffusion framework featuring
two novel modules: the Anomaly-Informed Accelerated Sampling (AIAS) and the
Foreground-Aware Reconstruction Module (FARM). AIAS is a training-free sampling
algorithm specifically designed for segmentation-oriented industrial anomaly
synthesis, which accelerates the reverse process through coarse-to-fine
aggregation and enables the synthesis of state-of-the-art segmentation-oriented
anomalies in as few as 10 steps. Meanwhile, FARM adaptively adjusts the
anomaly-aware noise within the masked foreground regions at each sampling step,
preserving localized anomaly signals throughout the denoising trajectory.
Extensive experiments on multiple industrial benchmarks demonstrate that FAST
consistently outperforms existing anomaly synthesis methods in downstream
segmentation tasks. We release the code at:

*Bishal Adhikari,Jiajia Li,Eric S. Michel,Jacob Dykes,Te-Ming Paul Tseng,Mary Love Tagert,Dong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of deep learning models for deer detection in agriculture, introducing a curated dataset and benchmarking 12 YOLO variants on edge computing platforms to address the lack of practical deer detection systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional deer mitigation strategies are labor-intensive, costly, and ineffective for modern farming, causing hundreds of millions in annual losses. There's a critical need for intelligent autonomous solutions, but progress is impeded by lack of domain-specific datasets and limited study on field deployability.

Method: The study introduces a curated dataset of 3,095 annotated deer images and conducts extensive comparative analysis of 12 model variants across four YOLO architectures (v8, v9, v10, v11). Performance is benchmarked on high-end GPU and two edge computing platforms (Raspberry Pi 5 and NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier).

Result: Real-time detection is not feasible on Raspberry Pi without hardware optimization, while NVIDIA Jetson achieves >30 FPS with GPU acceleration. Smaller advanced models like YOLOv11n, YOLOv8s, and YOLOv9s offer optimal balance of high accuracy (AP@.5 > 0.85) and computational efficiency (FPS > 30).

Conclusion: The study provides practical insights for deploying deer detection systems in agriculture, demonstrating that architecturally advanced smaller models are most suitable for real-world applications. The publicly available dataset and code support further research in this domain.

Abstract: The escalating economic losses in agriculture due to deer intrusion,
estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars annually in the U.S.,
highlight the inadequacy of traditional mitigation strategies since these
methods are often labor-intensive, costly, and ineffective for modern farming
systems. To overcome this, there is a critical need for intelligent, autonomous
solutions which require accurate and efficient deer detection. But the progress
in this field is impeded by a significant gap in the literature, mainly the
lack of a domain-specific, practical dataset and limited study on the on-field
deployability of deer detection systems. Addressing this gap, this study
presents a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art deep learning models
for deer detection in challenging real-world scenarios. The contributions of
this work are threefold. First, we introduce a curated, publicly available
dataset of 3,095 annotated images with bounding-box annotations of deer,
derived from the Idaho Cameratraps project. Second, we provide an extensive
comparative analysis of 12 model variants across four recent YOLO
architectures(v8, v9, v10, and v11). Finally, we benchmarked performance on a
high-end NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPU and evaluated on two representative edge computing
platforms: Raspberry Pi 5 and NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier. Results show that the
real-time detection is not feasible in Raspberry Pi without hardware-specific
model optimization, while NVIDIA Jetson provides greater than 30 FPS with
GPU-accelerated inference on 's' and 'n' series models. This study also reveals
that smaller, architecturally advanced models such as YOLOv11n, YOLOv8s, and
YOLOv9s offer the optimal balance of high accuracy (AP@.5 > 0.85) and
computational efficiency (FPS > 30). To support further research, both the
source code and datasets are publicly available at

*Qi Li,Shuwen Qiu,Julien Han,Xingzi Xu,Mehmet Saygin Seyfioglu,Kee Kiat Koo,Karim Bouyarmane*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes methods to incorporate pose control into Virtual Try-On (VTON) models using pure concatenation paradigm with pose maps and skeletons, without adding extra parameters, and introduces mixed-mask training for flexible product integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing demand for VTON technology requires effective pose control to ensure accurate product alignment with user's body while supporting diverse orientations for immersive experience, but current methods face challenges in pose representation selection and integration.

Method: Built on baseline VTON model with concatenation approach, the study spatially concatenates pose data using pose maps and skeletons without additional parameters. Introduces mixed-mask training strategy combining fine-grained and bounding box masks.

Result: Pose stitching with pose maps yields best results, enhancing both pose preservation and output realism. Mixed-mask training enables flexible product integration across varied poses and conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed pure concatenation approach with pose maps and mixed-mask training effectively addresses pose control challenges in VTON, providing accurate alignment and realistic outputs without increasing model complexity.

Abstract: As online shopping continues to grow, the demand for Virtual Try-On (VTON)
technology has surged, allowing customers to visualize products on themselves
by overlaying product images onto their own photos. An essential yet
challenging condition for effective VTON is pose control, which ensures
accurate alignment of products with the user's body while supporting diverse
orientations for a more immersive experience. However, incorporating pose
conditions into VTON models presents several challenges, including selecting
the optimal pose representation, integrating poses without additional
parameters, and balancing pose preservation with flexible pose control.
  In this work, we build upon a baseline VTON model that concatenates the
reference image condition without external encoder, control network, or complex
attention layers. We investigate methods to incorporate pose control into this
pure concatenation paradigm by spatially concatenating pose data, comparing
performance using pose maps and skeletons, without adding any additional
parameters or module to the baseline model. Our experiments reveal that pose
stitching with pose maps yields the best results, enhancing both pose
preservation and output realism. Additionally, we introduce a mixed-mask
training strategy using fine-grained and bounding box masks, allowing the model
to support flexible product integration across varied poses and conditions.

TL;DR: PhysCtrl is a physics-grounded framework for image-to-video generation that incorporates physical parameters and force control to produce physically plausible 3D-controllable videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation models lack physical plausibility and 3D controllability, limiting their realism and practical applications in scenarios requiring accurate physical dynamics.

Method: Uses a generative physics network with diffusion models conditioned on physics parameters and forces, representing dynamics as 3D point trajectories. Includes spatiotemporal attention blocks for particle interactions and physics-based constraints during training on 550K synthetic animations.

Result: Generates realistic physics-grounded motion trajectories that drive image-to-video models to produce high-fidelity, controllable videos superior to existing methods in both visual quality and physical plausibility.

Conclusion: PhysCtrl successfully bridges the gap between video generation and physical realism, enabling controllable physics-based video synthesis across multiple materials with improved plausibility over current approaches.

Abstract: Existing video generation models excel at producing photo-realistic videos
from text or images, but often lack physical plausibility and 3D
controllability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce PhysCtrl, a novel
framework for physics-grounded image-to-video generation with physical
parameters and force control. At its core is a generative physics network that
learns the distribution of physical dynamics across four materials (elastic,
sand, plasticine, and rigid) via a diffusion model conditioned on physics
parameters and applied forces. We represent physical dynamics as 3D point
trajectories and train on a large-scale synthetic dataset of 550K animations
generated by physics simulators. We enhance the diffusion model with a novel
spatiotemporal attention block that emulates particle interactions and
incorporates physics-based constraints during training to enforce physical
plausibility. Experiments show that PhysCtrl generates realistic,
physics-grounded motion trajectories which, when used to drive image-to-video
models, yield high-fidelity, controllable videos that outperform existing
methods in both visual quality and physical plausibility. Project Page:

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing open-source and commercial models; exhibits emergent editing and generation abilities across modalities; validated through extensive experiments and user studies.

Conclusion: EditVerse successfully demonstrates that unified frameworks can effectively handle both image and video generation/editing tasks, overcoming previous fragmentation and data scarcity challenges through innovative architectural design and data curation.

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models highlight a clear trend toward
unification and scaling, showing emergent capabilities across diverse domains.
While image generation and editing have rapidly transitioned from task-specific
to unified frameworks, video generation and editing remain fragmented due to
architectural limitations and data scarcity. In this work, we introduce
EditVerse, a unified framework for image and video generation and editing
within a single model. By representing all modalities, i.e., text, image, and
video, as a unified token sequence, EditVerse leverages self-attention to
achieve robust in-context learning, natural cross-modal knowledge transfer, and
flexible handling of inputs and outputs with arbitrary resolutions and
durations. To address the lack of video editing training data, we design a
scalable data pipeline that curates 232K video editing samples and combines
them with large-scale image and video datasets for joint training. Furthermore,
we present EditVerseBench, the first benchmark for instruction-based video
editing covering diverse tasks and resolutions. Extensive experiments and user
studies demonstrate that EditVerse achieves state-of-the-art performance,
surpassing existing open-source and commercial models, while exhibiting
emergent editing and generation abilities across modalities.
