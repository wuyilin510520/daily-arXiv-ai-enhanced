### [1] [Class-invariant Test-Time Augmentation for Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14420)
*Zhicheng Lin,Xiaolin Wu,Xi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Class-Invariant Test-Time Augmentation (CI-TTA) - a lightweight method using elastic and grid deformations to create class-preserving image variants, with confidence-guided filtering to aggregate reliable predictions for better domain generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep models suffer performance degradation under distribution shifts. Existing domain generalization methods rely on multi-domain training or computationally intensive test-time adaptation, so a lightweight complementary strategy is needed.

Method: CI-TTA generates multiple variants of each input image through elastic and grid deformations that preserve class identity. Uses confidence-guided filtering to remove unreliable predictions and aggregate consistent outputs.

Result: Extensive experiments on PACS and Office-Home datasets show consistent gains across different DG algorithms and backbones, demonstrating effectiveness and generality.

Conclusion: The proposed CI-TTA technique provides an effective and lightweight test-time augmentation approach that complements existing domain generalization methods and improves model robustness to distribution shifts.

Abstract: Deep models often suffer significant performance degradation under
distribution shifts. Domain generalization (DG) seeks to mitigate this
challenge by enabling models to generalize to unseen domains. Most prior
approaches rely on multi-domain training or computationally intensive test-time
adaptation. In contrast, we propose a complementary strategy: lightweight
test-time augmentation. Specifically, we develop a novel Class-Invariant
Test-Time Augmentation (CI-TTA) technique. The idea is to generate multiple
variants of each input image through elastic and grid deformations that
nevertheless belong to the same class as the original input. Their predictions
are aggregated through a confidence-guided filtering scheme that remove
unreliable outputs, ensuring the final decision relies on consistent and
trustworthy cues. Extensive Experiments on PACS and Office-Home datasets
demonstrate consistent gains across different DG algorithms and backbones,
highlighting the effectiveness and generality of our approach.

### [2] [AToken: A Unified Tokenizer for Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14476)
*Jiasen Lu,Liangchen Song,Mingze Xu,Byeongjoo Ahn,Yanjun Wang,Chen Chen,Afshin Dehghan,Yinfei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AToken is the first unified visual tokenizer that handles images, videos, and 3D assets in a shared 4D latent space, achieving both high-fidelity reconstruction and semantic understanding through a transformer architecture with 4D rotary position embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tokenizers specialize in either reconstruction or understanding for single modalities, lacking a unified approach that can handle diverse visual inputs across different modalities while performing both tasks effectively.

Method: A pure transformer architecture with 4D rotary position embeddings to process arbitrary resolutions and temporal durations. Uses adversarial-free training with perceptual and Gram matrix losses, and progressive training curriculum from single images to videos and 3D. Supports both continuous and discrete latent tokens.

Result: Achieves 0.21 rFID with 82.2% ImageNet accuracy for images, 3.01 rFVD with 32.6% MSRVTT retrieval for videos, and 28.19 PSNR with 90.9% classification accuracy for 3D. Enables various generation and understanding tasks with competitive performance.

Conclusion: AToken demonstrates successful unification of visual tokenization across modalities and tasks, paving the way for next-generation multimodal AI systems built upon unified visual representation learning.

Abstract: We present AToken, the first unified visual tokenizer that achieves both
high-fidelity reconstruction and semantic understanding across images, videos,
and 3D assets. Unlike existing tokenizers that specialize in either
reconstruction or understanding for single modalities, AToken encodes these
diverse visual inputs into a shared 4D latent space, unifying both tasks and
modalities in a single framework. Specifically, we introduce a pure transformer
architecture with 4D rotary position embeddings to process visual inputs of
arbitrary resolutions and temporal durations. To ensure stable training, we
introduce an adversarial-free training objective that combines perceptual and
Gram matrix losses, achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction quality. By
employing a progressive training curriculum, AToken gradually expands from
single images, videos, and 3D, and supports both continuous and discrete latent
tokens. AToken achieves 0.21 rFID with 82.2% ImageNet accuracy for images, 3.01
rFVD with 32.6% MSRVTT retrieval for videos, and 28.19 PSNR with 90.9%
classification accuracy for 3D. In downstream applications, AToken enables both
visual generation tasks (e.g., image generation with continuous and discrete
tokens, text-to-video generation, image-to-3D synthesis) and understanding
tasks (e.g., multimodal LLMs), achieving competitive performance across all
benchmarks. These results shed light on the next-generation multimodal AI
systems built upon unified visual tokenization.

### [3] [MemEvo: Memory-Evolving Incremental Multi-view Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14544)
*Zisen Kong,Bo Zhong,Pengyuan Li,Dongxia Chang,Yiming Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MemEvo is a neuroscience-inspired incremental multi-view clustering method that balances stability and plasticity using hippocampus-prefrontal cortex memory mechanisms to prevent catastrophic forgetting while adapting to new views.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the stability-plasticity dilemma in incremental multi-view clustering where models need to adapt to new data while maintaining long-term knowledge and preventing catastrophic forgetting.

Method: Proposes three modules: 1) Hippocampus-inspired view alignment for capturing new view information, 2) Cognitive forgetting mechanism simulating human memory decay patterns, 3) Prefrontal cortex-inspired knowledge consolidation using temporal tensor stability.

Result: Extensive experiments show MemEvo achieves strong knowledge retention capabilities and exhibits remarkable advantages over state-of-the-art methods in scenarios with growing number of views.

Conclusion: MemEvo successfully balances stability and plasticity in incremental multi-view clustering by mimicking human memory mechanisms, providing effective knowledge retention while adapting to new data streams.

Abstract: Incremental multi-view clustering aims to achieve stable clustering results
while addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma (SPD) in incremental views.
At the core of SPD is the challenge that the model must have enough plasticity
to quickly adapt to new data, while maintaining sufficient stability to
consolidate long-term knowledge and prevent catastrophic forgetting. Inspired
by the hippocampal-prefrontal cortex collaborative memory mechanism in
neuroscience, we propose a Memory-Evolving Incremental Multi-view Clustering
method (MemEvo) to achieve this balance. First, we propose a
hippocampus-inspired view alignment module that captures the gain information
of new views by aligning structures in continuous representations. Second, we
introduce a cognitive forgetting mechanism that simulates the decay patterns of
human memory to modulate the weights of historical knowledge. Additionally, we
design a prefrontal cortex-inspired knowledge consolidation memory module that
leverages temporal tensor stability to gradually consolidate historical
knowledge. By integrating these modules, MemEvo achieves strong knowledge
retention capabilities in scenarios with a growing number of views. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MemEvo exhibits remarkable advantages over
existing state-of-the-art methods.

### [4] [Edge-Aware Normalized Attention for Efficient and Detail-Preserving Single Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14550)
*Penghao Rao,Tieyong Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel edge-guided attention mechanism for single-image super-resolution that uses adaptive modulation from edge features to enhance structural sharpness and perceptual quality without complex architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing edge-aware SISR methods often use ad hoc fusion that introduces redundancy, unstable optimization, or limited structural gains. The paper aims to address these limitations with a more principled approach.

Method: Proposes an edge-guided attention mechanism that creates adaptive modulation maps from jointly encoded edge features and intermediate activations, integrated into a lightweight residual design trained with composite loss (pixel-wise, perceptual, adversarial).

Result: Shows consistent improvements in structural sharpness and perceptual quality over SRGAN, ESRGAN, and prior edge-attention baselines at comparable model complexity.

Conclusion: The method provides parameter-efficient edge prior injection, stabilized adversarial refinement, and enhanced edge fidelity without deeper architectures, demonstrating effectiveness of principled edge-conditioned modulation for perceptual super-resolution.

Abstract: Single-image super-resolution (SISR) remains highly ill-posed because
recovering structurally faithful high-frequency content from a single
low-resolution observation is ambiguous. Existing edge-aware methods often
attach edge priors or attention branches onto increasingly complex backbones,
yet ad hoc fusion frequently introduces redundancy, unstable optimization, or
limited structural gains. We address this gap with an edge-guided attention
mechanism that derives an adaptive modulation map from jointly encoded edge
features and intermediate feature activations, then applies it to normalize and
reweight responses, selectively amplifying structurally salient regions while
suppressing spurious textures. In parallel, we integrate this mechanism into a
lightweight residual design trained under a composite objective combining
pixel-wise, perceptual, and adversarial terms to balance fidelity, perceptual
realism, and training stability. Extensive experiments on standard SISR
benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in structural sharpness and
perceptual quality over SRGAN, ESRGAN, and prior edge-attention baselines at
comparable model complexity. The proposed formulation provides (i) a
parameter-efficient path to inject edge priors, (ii) stabilized adversarial
refinement through a tailored multiterm loss, and (iii) enhanced edge fidelity
without resorting to deeper or heavily overparameterized architectures. These
results highlight the effectiveness of principled edge-conditioned modulation
for advancing perceptual super-resolution.

### [5] [Adaptive and Iterative Point Cloud Denoising with Score-Based Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14560)
*Zhaonan Wang,Manyi Li,ShiQing Xin,Changhe Tu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an adaptive iterative point cloud denoising method using score-based diffusion model with noise estimation and adaptive scheduling for better handling of different noise levels and patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods require empirical repetition of denoising processes without clear efficiency for different noise levels/patterns, needing adaptive scheduling.

Method: Uses score-based diffusion model with noise variation estimation, adaptive denoising schedule, two-stage sampling strategy for feature and gradient fusion in iterative denoising.

Result: Produces clean, smooth denoised point clouds with better shape boundary and detail preservation, outperforms state-of-the-art methods qualitatively and quantitatively on both synthetic and real-scanned datasets.

Conclusion: The adaptive iterative approach with score-based diffusion model effectively handles various noise patterns and levels while preserving geometric details better than existing methods.

Abstract: Point cloud denoising task aims to recover the clean point cloud from the
scanned data coupled with different levels or patterns of noise. The recent
state-of-the-art methods often train deep neural networks to update the point
locations towards the clean point cloud, and empirically repeat the denoising
process several times in order to obtain the denoised results. It is not clear
how to efficiently arrange the iterative denoising processes to deal with
different levels or patterns of noise. In this paper, we propose an adaptive
and iterative point cloud denoising method based on the score-based diffusion
model. For a given noisy point cloud, we first estimate the noise variation and
determine an adaptive denoising schedule with appropriate step sizes, then
invoke the trained network iteratively to update point clouds following the
adaptive schedule. To facilitate this adaptive and iterative denoising process,
we design the network architecture and a two-stage sampling strategy for the
network training to enable feature fusion and gradient fusion for iterative
denoising. Compared to the state-of-the-art point cloud denoising methods, our
approach obtains clean and smooth denoised point clouds, while preserving the
shape boundary and details better. Our results not only outperform the other
methods both qualitatively and quantitatively, but also are preferable on the
synthetic dataset with different patterns of noises, as well as the
real-scanned dataset.

### [6] [DiffVL: Diffusion-Based Visual Localization on 2D Maps via BEV-Conditioned GPS Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14565)
*Li Gao,Hongyang Sun,Liu Liu,Yunhao Li,Yang Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffVL is a diffusion-based framework that treats visual localization as a GPS denoising task, achieving sub-meter accuracy using standard maps and noisy GPS without HD maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual localization methods face a scalability dilemma - HD maps provide precision but are costly, while SD maps are scalable but current approaches overlook noisy GPS signals that are ubiquitously available but suffer from urban multipath errors.

Method: Reformulates visual localization as GPS denoising using diffusion models. Jointly models GPS, SD map, and visual BEV features to reverse GPS noise perturbations through iterative diffusion refinement, learning the true pose distribution from noisy GPS trajectories.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art sub-meter accuracy on multiple datasets, outperforming BEV-matching baselines like OrienterNet and transformer-based registration approaches.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that diffusion models can enable scalable localization by treating noisy GPS as a generative prior, representing a paradigm shift from traditional matching-based methods.

Abstract: Accurate visual localization is crucial for autonomous driving, yet existing
methods face a fundamental dilemma: While high-definition (HD) maps provide
high-precision localization references, their costly construction and
maintenance hinder scalability, which drives research toward
standard-definition (SD) maps like OpenStreetMap. Current SD-map-based
approaches primarily focus on Bird's-Eye View (BEV) matching between images and
maps, overlooking a ubiquitous signal-noisy GPS. Although GPS is readily
available, it suffers from multipath errors in urban environments. We propose
DiffVL, the first framework to reformulate visual localization as a GPS
denoising task using diffusion models. Our key insight is that noisy GPS
trajectory, when conditioned on visual BEV features and SD maps, implicitly
encode the true pose distribution, which can be recovered through iterative
diffusion refinement. DiffVL, unlike prior BEV-matching methods (e.g.,
OrienterNet) or transformer-based registration approaches, learns to reverse
GPS noise perturbations by jointly modeling GPS, SD map, and visual signals,
achieving sub-meter accuracy without relying on HD maps. Experiments on
multiple datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
accuracy compared to BEV-matching baselines. Crucially, our work proves that
diffusion models can enable scalable localization by treating noisy GPS as a
generative prior-making a paradigm shift from traditional matching-based
methods.

### [7] [DICE: Diffusion Consensus Equilibrium for Sparse-view CT Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14566)
*Leon Suarez-Rodriguez,Roman Jacome,Romario Gualdron-Hurtado,Ana Mantilla-Dulcey,Henry Arguello*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DICE integrates diffusion models with consensus equilibrium for sparse-view CT reconstruction, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by balancing data consistency and generative priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse-view CT reconstruction is ill-posed due to undersampling. Traditional methods struggle with complex medical image structures, while diffusion models offer powerful generative priors but need better integration with measurement consistency.

Method: DICE framework combines two-agent consensus equilibrium: (1) data-consistency agent via proximal operator for measurement consistency, and (2) prior agent using diffusion model for clean image estimation at each sampling step. Alternates between these agents iteratively.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in reconstructing high-quality CT images under both uniform and non-uniform sparse-view settings (15, 30, 60 views out of 180).

Conclusion: DICE effectively combines strong generative prior capabilities with measurement consistency, demonstrating both effectiveness and robustness for sparse-view CT reconstruction.

Abstract: Sparse-view computed tomography (CT) reconstruction is fundamentally
challenging due to undersampling, leading to an ill-posed inverse problem.
Traditional iterative methods incorporate handcrafted or learned priors to
regularize the solution but struggle to capture the complex structures present
in medical images. In contrast, diffusion models (DMs) have recently emerged as
powerful generative priors that can accurately model complex image
distributions. In this work, we introduce Diffusion Consensus Equilibrium
(DICE), a framework that integrates a two-agent consensus equilibrium into the
sampling process of a DM. DICE alternates between: (i) a data-consistency
agent, implemented through a proximal operator enforcing measurement
consistency, and (ii) a prior agent, realized by a DM performing a clean image
estimation at each sampling step. By balancing these two complementary agents
iteratively, DICE effectively combines strong generative prior capabilities
with measurement consistency. Experimental results show that DICE significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in reconstructing high-quality CT images
under uniform and non-uniform sparse-view settings of 15, 30, and 60 views (out
of a total of 180), demonstrating both its effectiveness and robustness.

### [8] [Domain Adaptation for Ulcerative Colitis Severity Estimation Using Patient-Level Diagnoses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14573)
*Takamasa Yamaguchi,Brian Kenji Iwana,Ryoma Bise,Shota Harada,Takumi Okuo,Kiyohito Tanaka,Kaito Shiku*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel weakly supervised domain adaptation method for UC severity estimation that uses patient-level diagnostic results as weak supervision to address domain shifts across hospitals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UC severity estimation methods suffer from domain shifts due to differences in imaging devices and clinical settings across hospitals, and current domain adaptation methods struggle with lack of supervision or high annotation costs in target domains.

Method: Proposes a Weakly Supervised Domain Adaptation method using patient-level diagnostic results as weak supervision. Uses Shared Aggregation Tokens and Max-Severity Triplet Loss to align class-wise distributions across domains, leveraging that patient diagnoses are determined by the most severe region.

Result: Experimental results show the method outperforms comparative domain adaptation approaches, improving UC severity estimation in domain-shifted settings.

Conclusion: The proposed weakly supervised approach effectively addresses domain shift challenges in UC severity estimation by utilizing routinely recorded patient-level diagnostic results as supervision, achieving better performance than existing methods.

Abstract: The development of methods to estimate the severity of Ulcerative Colitis
(UC) is of significant importance. However, these methods often suffer from
domain shifts caused by differences in imaging devices and clinical settings
across hospitals. Although several domain adaptation methods have been proposed
to address domain shift, they still struggle with the lack of supervision in
the target domain or the high cost of annotation. To overcome these challenges,
we propose a novel Weakly Supervised Domain Adaptation method that leverages
patient-level diagnostic results, which are routinely recorded in UC diagnosis,
as weak supervision in the target domain. The proposed method aligns class-wise
distributions across domains using Shared Aggregation Tokens and a Max-Severity
Triplet Loss, which leverages the characteristic that patient-level diagnoses
are determined by the most severe region within each patient. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method outperforms comparative DA approaches,
improving UC severity estimation in a domain-shifted setting.

### [9] [Do Vision-Language Models See Urban Scenes as People Do? An Urban Perception Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14574)
*Rashid Mushkani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A benchmark for evaluating vision-language models on urban perception using 100 Montreal street images (50 real photos, 50 synthetic) with human annotations across 30 dimensions, showing models perform better on objective properties than subjective appraisals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how people read city scenes and inform urban design/planning by creating a standardized benchmark for testing VLMs on urban perception tasks.

Method: Used 100 street images from Montreal (50 real, 50 synthetic), collected 230 annotation forms from 12 participants across 7 community groups covering 30 physical and subjective dimensions. Evaluated 7 VLMs in zero-shot setup with structured prompts and deterministic parsing.

Result: Models showed stronger alignment on visible, objective properties than subjective appraisals. Top system (claude-sonnet) achieved macro 0.31 and mean Jaccard 0.48 on multi-label items. Higher human agreement correlated with better model scores. Synthetic images slightly lowered performance.

Conclusion: The benchmark enables reproducible, uncertainty-aware evaluation of VLMs for participatory urban analysis, with models performing better on objective urban features than subjective perceptions.

Abstract: Understanding how people read city scenes can inform design and planning. We
introduce a small benchmark for testing vision-language models (VLMs) on urban
perception using 100 Montreal street images, evenly split between photographs
and photorealistic synthetic scenes. Twelve participants from seven community
groups supplied 230 annotation forms across 30 dimensions mixing physical
attributes and subjective impressions. French responses were normalized to
English. We evaluated seven VLMs in a zero-shot setup with a structured prompt
and deterministic parser. We use accuracy for single-choice items and Jaccard
overlap for multi-label items; human agreement uses Krippendorff's alpha and
pairwise Jaccard. Results suggest stronger model alignment on visible,
objective properties than subjective appraisals. The top system (claude-sonnet)
reaches macro 0.31 and mean Jaccard 0.48 on multi-label items. Higher human
agreement coincides with better model scores. Synthetic images slightly lower
scores. We release the benchmark, prompts, and harness for reproducible,
uncertainty-aware evaluation in participatory urban analysis.

### [10] [Feature-aligned Motion Transformation for Efficient Dynamic Point Cloud Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14591)
*Xuan Deng,Xiandong Meng,Longguang Wang,Tiange Zhang,Xiaopeng Fan,Debin Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FMT framework replaces explicit motion vectors with spatiotemporal alignment for dynamic point cloud compression, achieving significant BD-Rate reductions and improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic point clouds have irregular structure and significant local variations that make motion estimation challenging. Current methods using explicit motion vectors struggle to capture intricate dynamics and fail to fully exploit temporal correlations.

Method: Feature-aligned Motion Transformation (FMT) framework with spatiotemporal alignment strategy that implicitly models continuous temporal variations, using aligned features as temporal context within latent-space conditional encoding. Includes random access reference strategy for bidirectional motion referencing and layered encoding.

Result: Surpasses D-DPCC and AdaDPCC in both encoding and decoding efficiency, achieving BD-Rate reductions of 20% and 9.4% respectively.

Conclusion: FMT effectively improves compression efficiency and processing performance for dynamic point clouds through implicit motion modeling and advanced reference strategies.

Abstract: Dynamic point clouds are widely used in applications such as immersive
reality, robotics, and autonomous driving. Efficient compression largely
depends on accurate motion estimation and compensation, yet the irregular
structure and significant local variations of point clouds make this task
highly challenging. Current methods often rely on explicit motion estimation,
whose encoded vectors struggle to capture intricate dynamics and fail to fully
exploit temporal correlations. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a
Feature-aligned Motion Transformation (FMT) framework for dynamic point cloud
compression. FMT replaces explicit motion vectors with a spatiotemporal
alignment strategy that implicitly models continuous temporal variations, using
aligned features as temporal context within a latent-space conditional encoding
framework. Furthermore, we design a random access (RA) reference strategy that
enables bidirectional motion referencing and layered encoding, thereby
supporting frame-level parallel compression. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method surpasses D-DPCC and AdaDPCC in both encoding and decoding
efficiency, while also achieving BD-Rate reductions of 20% and 9.4%,
respectively. These results highlight the effectiveness of FMT in jointly
improving compression efficiency and processing performance.

### [11] [HybridMamba: A Dual-domain Mamba for 3D Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14609)
*Weitong Wu,Zhaohu Xing,Jing Gong,Qin Peng,Lei Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HybridMamba is a novel 3D medical image segmentation architecture that combines dual complementary mechanisms to balance global context modeling with local structural preservation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on MRI and CT datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While Mamba addresses CNN's limitations in long-range dependencies and Transformer's computational overhead, it may compromise local structural information, leading to boundary ambiguity and regional distortion in segmentation outputs.

Method: Proposes HybridMamba with: 1) feature scanning strategy integrating axial-traversal and local-adaptive pathways to harmonize local-global representations, and 2) gated module combining spatial-frequency analysis for comprehensive contextual modeling. Collected multi-center CT dataset for lung cancer.

Result: Experiments on MRI and CT datasets demonstrate that HybridMamba significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in 3D medical image segmentation.

Conclusion: HybridMamba effectively balances global context modeling with local structural preservation, achieving superior performance in 3D biomedical image segmentation while addressing limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: In the domain of 3D biomedical image segmentation, Mamba exhibits the
superior performance for it addresses the limitations in modeling long-range
dependencies inherent to CNNs and mitigates the abundant computational overhead
associated with Transformer-based frameworks when processing high-resolution
medical volumes. However, attaching undue importance to global context modeling
may inadvertently compromise critical local structural information, thus
leading to boundary ambiguity and regional distortion in segmentation outputs.
Therefore, we propose the HybridMamba, an architecture employing dual
complementary mechanisms: 1) a feature scanning strategy that progressively
integrates representations both axial-traversal and local-adaptive pathways to
harmonize the relationship between local and global representations, and 2) a
gated module combining spatial-frequency analysis for comprehensive contextual
modeling. Besides, we collect a multi-center CT dataset related to lung cancer.
Experiments on MRI and CT datasets demonstrate that HybridMamba significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in 3D medical image segmentation.

### [12] [Enhancing Feature Fusion of U-like Networks with Dynamic Skip Connections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14610)
*Yue Cao,Quansong He,Kaishen Wang,Jianlong Xiong,Tao He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Dynamic Skip Connection (DSC) block to overcome limitations of traditional skip connections in U-like networks for medical image segmentation, featuring adaptive feature fusion and multi-scale integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional skip connections in U-like networks suffer from inter-feature constraints (static feature fusion) and intra-feature constraints (insufficient multi-scale feature interactions), limiting effective global context aggregation.

Method: Introduces DSC block with two components: Test-Time Training (TTT) module for dynamic adaptation during inference, and Dynamic Multi-Scale Kernel (DMSK) module for adaptive kernel size selection based on global context.

Result: The DSC block demonstrates plug-and-play effectiveness across various U-like network architectures including CNN-based, Transformer-based, hybrid CNN-Transformer, and Mamba-based networks.

Conclusion: The proposed DSC block fundamentally enhances cross-layer connectivity through adaptive mechanisms, providing a versatile solution to improve medical image segmentation performance in diverse U-like network architectures.

Abstract: U-like networks have become fundamental frameworks in medical image
segmentation through skip connections that bridge high-level semantics and
low-level spatial details. Despite their success, conventional skip connections
exhibit two key limitations: inter-feature constraints and intra-feature
constraints. The inter-feature constraint refers to the static nature of
feature fusion in traditional skip connections, where information is
transmitted along fixed pathways regardless of feature content. The
intra-feature constraint arises from the insufficient modeling of multi-scale
feature interactions, thereby hindering the effective aggregation of global
contextual information. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel
Dynamic Skip Connection (DSC) block that fundamentally enhances cross-layer
connectivity through adaptive mechanisms. The DSC block integrates two
complementary components. (1) Test-Time Training (TTT) module. This module
addresses the inter-feature constraint by enabling dynamic adaptation of hidden
representations during inference, facilitating content-aware feature
refinement. (2) Dynamic Multi-Scale Kernel (DMSK) module. To mitigate the
intra-feature constraint, this module adaptively selects kernel sizes based on
global contextual cues, enhancing the network capacity for multi-scale feature
integration. The DSC block is architecture-agnostic and can be seamlessly
incorporated into existing U-like network structures. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the plug-and-play effectiveness of the proposed DSC block across
CNN-based, Transformer-based, hybrid CNN-Transformer, and Mamba-based U-like
networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address two key challenges in skeleton-based action recognition: scarcity of labeled training data and difficulty modeling both short- and long-range temporal dependencies.

Method: Proposes Long-Short Term Temporal Convolution (LSTC) module with parallel short/long-term branches fused adaptively, and extends Joint Mixing Data Augmentation with Additive Mixup restricted to same camera view.

Result: Achieves 94.1% on NTU 60 X-Sub, 97.5% on NTU 60 X-View, 90.4% on NTU 120 X-Sub, 92.0% on NTU 120 X-Set, and 97.2% on NW-UCLA datasets.

Conclusion: The unified LSTC-MDA framework effectively addresses temporal modeling limitations and data scarcity, demonstrating superior performance across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Skeleton-based action recognition faces two longstanding challenges: the
scarcity of labeled training samples and difficulty modeling short- and
long-range temporal dependencies. To address these issues, we propose a unified
framework, LSTC-MDA, which simultaneously improves temporal modeling and data
diversity. We introduce a novel Long-Short Term Temporal Convolution (LSTC)
module with parallel short- and long-term branches, these two feature branches
are then aligned and fused adaptively using learned similarity weights to
preserve critical long-range cues lost by conventional stride-2 temporal
convolutions. We also extend Joint Mixing Data Augmentation (JMDA) with an
Additive Mixup at the input level, diversifying training samples and
restricting mixup operations to the same camera view to avoid distribution
shifts. Ablation studies confirm each component contributes. LSTC-MDA achieves
state-of-the-art results: 94.1% and 97.5% on NTU 60 (X-Sub and X-View), 90.4%
and 92.0% on NTU 120 (X-Sub and X-Set),97.2% on NW-UCLA. Code:

*Mingsong Li,Lin Liu,Hongjun Wang,Haoxing Chen,Xijun Gu,Shizhan Liu,Dong Gong,Junbo Zhao,Zhenzhong Lan,Jianguo Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MultiEdit is a comprehensive 107K+ image editing dataset addressing limitations of current instruction-based image editing methods by covering 6 challenging tasks, 18 non-style-transfer editing types, and 38 style transfer operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current IBIE methods struggle with challenging editing tasks due to limited dataset editing types and sample counts, and noisy image-caption pairs that introduce biases and limit model capabilities.

Method: A novel dataset construction pipeline using two multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to generate visual-adaptive editing instructions and produce high-fidelity edited images.

Result: Fine-tuning foundational models with MultiEdit-Train set substantially improves performance on sophisticated editing tasks in the proposed MultiEdit-Test benchmark while preserving capabilities on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: MultiEdit provides a valuable resource for advancing research into more diverse and challenging IBIE capabilities, with the dataset publicly available.

Abstract: Current instruction-based image editing (IBIE) methods struggle with
challenging editing tasks, as both editing types and sample counts of existing
datasets are limited. Moreover, traditional dataset construction often contains
noisy image-caption pairs, which may introduce biases and limit model
capabilities in complex editing scenarios. To address these limitations, we
introduce MultiEdit, a comprehensive dataset featuring over 107K high-quality
image editing samples. It encompasses 6 challenging editing tasks through a
diverse collection of 18 non-style-transfer editing types and 38 style transfer
operations, covering a spectrum from sophisticated style transfer to complex
semantic operations like person reference editing and in-image text editing. We
employ a novel dataset construction pipeline that utilizes two multi-modal
large language models (MLLMs) to generate visual-adaptive editing instructions
and produce high-fidelity edited images, respectively. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that fine-tuning foundational open-source models with our
MultiEdit-Train set substantially improves models' performance on sophisticated
editing tasks in our proposed MultiEdit-Test benchmark, while effectively

### [15] [Attention Lattice Adapter: Visual Explanation Generation for Visual Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14664)
*Shinnosuke Hirano,Yuiga Wada,Tsumugi Iida,Komei Sugiura*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel visual explanation generation method with Attention Lattice Adapter and Alternating Epoch Architect mechanisms that improves adaptability and interpretability in visual foundation models, achieving significant performance gains over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing explanation methods lack adaptability for complex visual foundation models and often require manual layer selection, limiting their practical application and interpretability.

Method: Proposed two novel mechanisms: Attention Lattice Adapter (ALA) for automatic layer selection without manual intervention, and Alternating Epoch Architect (AEA) that updates ALA parameters every other epoch to address small attention region issues.

Result: Outperformed baseline methods on CUB-200-2011 and ImageNet-S datasets across multiple metrics (mean IoU, insertion, deletion, insertion-deletion scores), with 53.2-point improvement in mean IoU on CUB-200-2011.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully enhances both explanation generation and model interpretability in visual foundation models through automated adaptation mechanisms, demonstrating superior performance over existing approaches.

Abstract: In this study, we consider the problem of generating visual explanations in
visual foundation models. Numerous methods have been proposed for this purpose;
however, they often cannot be applied to complex models due to their lack of
adaptability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel explanation
generation method in visual foundation models that is aimed at both generating
explanations and partially updating model parameters to enhance
interpretability. Our approach introduces two novel mechanisms: Attention
Lattice Adapter (ALA) and Alternating Epoch Architect (AEA). ALA mechanism
simplifies the process by eliminating the need for manual layer selection, thus
enhancing the model's adaptability and interpretability. Moreover, the AEA
mechanism, which updates ALA's parameters every other epoch, effectively
addresses the common issue of overly small attention regions. We evaluated our
method on two benchmark datasets, CUB-200-2011 and ImageNet-S. Our results
showed that our method outperformed the baseline methods in terms of mean
intersection over union (IoU), insertion score, deletion score, and
insertion-deletion score on both the CUB-200-2011 and ImageNet-S datasets.
Notably, our best model achieved a 53.2-point improvement in mean IoU on the
CUB-200-2011 dataset compared with the baselines.

*Kazuma Nagata,Naoshi Kaneko*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DACoN is a framework that uses foundation models for automatic colorization of line drawings, enabling multiple reference images and handling occlusions/pose variations better than previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning approaches for anime line drawing colorization struggle with occlusions, pose variations, and viewpoint changes, and are limited to using only 1-2 reference images.

Method: Leverages foundation models to capture part-level semantics in line drawings, fuses low-resolution semantic features with high-resolution spatial features from CNNs, and removes the constraint on number of reference images.

Result: Quantitative and qualitative evaluations show superior colorization performance, demonstrating benefits of using multiple reference images.

Conclusion: DACoN achieves robust feature extraction and fine-grained colorization by combining foundation model semantics with CNN spatial features, outperforming previous methods that used limited reference images.

Abstract: Automatic colorization of line drawings has been widely studied to reduce the
labor cost of hand-drawn anime production. Deep learning approaches, including
image/video generation and feature-based correspondence, have improved accuracy
but struggle with occlusions, pose variations, and viewpoint changes. To
address these challenges, we propose DACoN, a framework that leverages
foundation models to capture part-level semantics, even in line drawings. Our
method fuses low-resolution semantic features from foundation models with
high-resolution spatial features from CNNs for fine-grained yet robust feature
extraction. In contrast to previous methods that rely on the Multiplex
Transformer and support only one or two reference images, DACoN removes this
constraint, allowing any number of references. Quantitative and qualitative
evaluations demonstrate the benefits of using multiple reference images,
achieving superior colorization performance. Our code and model are available
at https://github.com/kzmngt/DACoN.

*Jinlong Fan,Bingyu Hu,Xingguang Li,Yuxiang Yang,Jing Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FMGS-Avatar: A novel method combining mesh-guided 2D Gaussian splatting with foundation model knowledge distillation for high-fidelity monocular human avatar reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reconstructing animatable human avatars from monocular videos is challenging due to insufficient geometric information and surface detail preservation issues in existing 3D Gaussian splatting methods.

Method: Uses mesh-guided 2D Gaussian primitives attached to template mesh faces with constrained movement, plus foundation model knowledge distillation with selective gradient isolation to prevent conflicting optimization objectives.

Result: Superior reconstruction quality compared to existing methods, with significant improvements in geometric accuracy, appearance fidelity, and semantic information. Enables consistent rendering under novel views and poses.

Conclusion: The combination of enhanced representation through constrained 2D Gaussians and coordinated information distillation from foundation models significantly advances monocular human avatar reconstruction.

Abstract: Reconstructing high-fidelity animatable human avatars from monocular videos
remains challenging due to insufficient geometric information in single-view
observations. While recent 3D Gaussian Splatting methods have shown promise,
they struggle with surface detail preservation due to the free-form nature of
3D Gaussian primitives. To address both the representation limitations and
information scarcity, we propose a novel method, \textbf{FMGS-Avatar}, that
integrates two key innovations. First, we introduce Mesh-Guided 2D Gaussian
Splatting, where 2D Gaussian primitives are attached directly to template mesh
faces with constrained position, rotation, and movement, enabling superior
surface alignment and geometric detail preservation. Second, we leverage
foundation models trained on large-scale datasets, such as Sapiens, to
complement the limited visual cues from monocular videos. However, when
distilling multi-modal prior knowledge from foundation models, conflicting
optimization objectives can emerge as different modalities exhibit distinct
parameter sensitivities. We address this through a coordinated training
strategy with selective gradient isolation, enabling each loss component to
optimize its relevant parameters without interference. Through this combination
of enhanced representation and coordinated information distillation, our
approach significantly advances 3D monocular human avatar reconstruction.
Experimental evaluation demonstrates superior reconstruction quality compared
to existing methods, with notable gains in geometric accuracy and appearance
fidelity while providing rich semantic information. Additionally, the distilled
prior knowledge within a shared canonical space naturally enables spatially and
temporally consistent rendering under novel views and poses.

*Shangrong Wu,Yanghong Zhou,Yang Chen,Feng Zhang,P. Y. Mok*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoTRR uses MLLMs for listwise re-ranking in image retrieval by breaking queries into semantic components and performing global comparisons, achieving SOTA results across multiple retrieval tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods underutilize MLLMs' multimodal reasoning capabilities by only using them for evaluation rather than direct ranking, leading to suboptimal image retrieval performance.

Method: Chain-of-Thought Re-Ranking with three components: listwise ranking prompt for MLLM re-ranking, image evaluation prompt for candidate alignment assessment, and query deconstruction prompt for semantic breakdown.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across five datasets on three image retrieval tasks: text-to-image retrieval, composed image retrieval, and chat-based image retrieval.

Conclusion: Directly involving MLLMs in the ranking process through structured reasoning and query decomposition significantly improves image retrieval accuracy and provides interpretable decision-making.

Abstract: Image retrieval remains a fundamental yet challenging problem in computer
vision. While recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities, existing methods typically employ
them only for evaluation, without involving them directly in the ranking
process. As a result, their rich multimodal reasoning abilities remain
underutilized, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a
novel Chain-of-Thought Re-Ranking (CoTRR) method to address this issue.
Specifically, we design a listwise ranking prompt that enables MLLM to directly
participate in re-ranking candidate images. This ranking process is grounded in
an image evaluation prompt, which assesses how well each candidate aligns with
users query. By allowing MLLM to perform listwise reasoning, our method
supports global comparison, consistent reasoning, and interpretable
decision-making - all of which are essential for accurate image retrieval. To
enable structured and fine-grained analysis, we further introduce a query
deconstruction prompt, which breaks down the original query into multiple
semantic components. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our CoTRR method, which achieves state-of-the-art performance
across three image retrieval tasks, including text-to-image retrieval (TIR),
composed image retrieval (CIR) and chat-based image retrieval (Chat-IR). Our
code is available at https://github.com/freshfish15/CoTRR .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting smell references in historic artworks is challenging due to stylistic variations, detailed annotation requirements, annotation sparsity, and extreme class imbalance.

Method: Evaluated several diffusion-based augmentation strategies to generate synthetic data and incorporated this synthetic data into model training.

Result: Incorporating synthetic data improved detection performance, with the approach being effective even with small amounts of data and showing potential for further enhancements through scaling.

Conclusion: Leveraging large-scale pretraining of diffusion models offers a promising approach for improving detection accuracy in niche applications where annotations are scarce and costly to obtain.

Abstract: Finding smell references in historic artworks is a challenging problem.
Beyond artwork-specific challenges such as stylistic variations, their
recognition demands exceptionally detailed annotation classes, resulting in
annotation sparsity and extreme class imbalance. In this work, we explore the
potential of synthetic data generation to alleviate these issues and enable
accurate detection of smell-related objects. We evaluate several
diffusion-based augmentation strategies and demonstrate that incorporating
synthetic data into model training can improve detection performance. Our
findings suggest that leveraging the large-scale pretraining of diffusion
models offers a promising approach for improving detection accuracy,
particularly in niche applications where annotations are scarce and costly to
obtain. Furthermore, the proposed approach proves to be effective even with
relatively small amounts of data, and scaling it up provides high potential for
further enhancements.

TL;DR: First frame-accurate benchmark for small vision language models in video QA, revealing significant frame-sampling bias and providing standardized evaluation protocol.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video benchmarks suffer from frame-sampling bias as models are evaluated with different frame selection strategies, making fair comparisons difficult.

Method: Proposed a frame-accurate benchmark evaluating state-of-the-art small VLMs for video question-answering under controlled frame-sampling strategies with open-sourced code.

Result: Confirmed substantial frame-sampling bias and revealed both data-specific and task-specific behaviors of SVLMs under different frame-sampling techniques.

Conclusion: Need for standardized frame-sampling strategies tailored to each benchmarking dataset and provides reproducible, unbiased evaluation protocol for video VLMs.

Abstract: Comparing vision language models on videos is particularly complex, as the
performances is jointly determined by the model's visual representation
capacity and the frame-sampling strategy used to construct the input. Current
video benchmarks are suspected to suffer from substantial frame-sampling bias,
as models are evaluated with different frame selection strategies. In this
work, we propose the first frame-accurate benchmark of state-of-the-art small
VLMs for video question-answering, evaluated under controlled frame-sampling
strategies. Our results confirm the suspected bias and highlight both
data-specific and task-specific behaviors of SVLMs under different
frame-sampling techniques. By open-sourcing our benchmarking code, we provide
the community with a reproducible and unbiased protocol for evaluating video
VLMs and emphasize the need for standardized frame-sampling strategies tailored
to each benchmarking dataset in future research.

*Yuan Gao,Wei Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A real-time multi-model parametric representation method that combines Gaussian mixture models for segmentation with plane and B-spline surface fitting, achieving high efficiency and accuracy for point cloud processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing parametric representations for point clouds face a trade-off between computational efficiency and accuracy - highly adaptive models are computationally expensive while real-time methods have low degrees of freedom and struggle with high accuracy using few primitives.

Method: First uses Gaussian mixture model to segment point cloud into clusters, then selects and merges flat clusters into planes or curved surfaces. Planes are fitted with 2D voxel-based boundary description, while curved surfaces use B-spline surfaces with the same boundary method.

Result: The method shows 3.78x improvement in efficiency over state-of-the-art, achieves 2x higher accuracy than Gaussian mixture models, and operates at 36.4 fps on low-power onboard computers with greater robustness.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-model parametric representation successfully balances real-time performance with high accuracy, making it suitable for applications requiring efficient and robust point cloud processing like memory-efficient mapping and multi-robot collaboration.

Abstract: In recent years, parametric representations of point clouds have been widely
applied in tasks such as memory-efficient mapping and multi-robot
collaboration. Highly adaptive models, like spline surfaces or quadrics, are
computationally expensive in detection or fitting. In contrast, real-time
methods, such as Gaussian mixture models or planes, have low degrees of
freedom, making high accuracy with few primitives difficult. To tackle this
problem, a multi-model parametric representation with real-time surface
detection and fitting is proposed. Specifically, the Gaussian mixture model is
first employed to segment the point cloud into multiple clusters. Then, flat
clusters are selected and merged into planes or curved surfaces. Planes can be
easily fitted and delimited by a 2D voxel-based boundary description method.
Surfaces with curvature are fitted by B-spline surfaces and the same boundary
description method is employed. Through evaluations on multiple public
datasets, the proposed surface detection exhibits greater robustness than the
state-of-the-art approach, with 3.78 times improvement in efficiency.
Meanwhile, this representation achieves a 2-fold gain in accuracy over Gaussian
mixture models, operating at 36.4 fps on a low-power onboard computer.

### [22] [Dataset Distillation for Super-Resolution without Class Labels and Pre-trained Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14777)
*Sunwoo Cho,Yejin Jung,Nam Ik Cho,Jae Woong Soh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel data distillation method for image super-resolution that eliminates the need for class labels or pre-trained SR models, achieving state-of-the-art performance with only 0.68% of original training data and significantly reduced computational time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current data distillation methods for single image super-resolution heavily depend on pre-trained SR networks and class-specific information, limiting their generalizability and applicability. The computational demands of training deep neural networks with large datasets necessitate more efficient data utilization techniques.

Method: Extract high-gradient patches and categorize images using CLIP features, then fine-tune a diffusion model on selected patches to learn their distribution and synthesize distilled training images. This approach works without class labels or pre-trained SR models.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 0.68% of original dataset, showing just 0.3 dB performance drop. Diffusion model fine-tuning takes 4 hours and SR training completes in 1 hour, compared to 11 hours with full dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed data distillation framework provides an effective solution for data-efficient SR training, demonstrating superior performance with minimal data requirements and significantly reduced computational time while maintaining model generalizability.

Abstract: Training deep neural networks has become increasingly demanding, requiring
large datasets and significant computational resources, especially as model
complexity advances. Data distillation methods, which aim to improve data
efficiency, have emerged as promising solutions to this challenge. In the field
of single image super-resolution (SISR), the reliance on large training
datasets highlights the importance of these techniques. Recently, a generative
adversarial network (GAN) inversion-based data distillation framework for SR
was proposed, showing potential for better data utilization. However, the
current method depends heavily on pre-trained SR networks and class-specific
information, limiting its generalizability and applicability. To address these
issues, we introduce a new data distillation approach for image SR that does
not need class labels or pre-trained SR models. In particular, we first extract
high-gradient patches and categorize images based on CLIP features, then
fine-tune a diffusion model on the selected patches to learn their distribution
and synthesize distilled training images. Experimental results show that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance while using significantly less
training data and requiring less computational time. Specifically, when we
train a baseline Transformer model for SR with only 0.68\% of the original
dataset, the performance drop is just 0.3 dB. In this case, diffusion model
fine-tuning takes 4 hours, and SR model training completes within 1 hour, much
shorter than the 11-hour training time with the full dataset.

TL;DR: Report2CT is a novel framework that generates 3D chest CT volumes directly from free-text radiology reports using multiple medical text encoders and latent diffusion, achieving state-of-the-art performance in text-to-CT synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for 3D CT generation rely on simplified prompts that neglect rich semantic details in full radiology reports, reducing text-image alignment and clinical fidelity.

Method: Uses three pretrained medical text encoders (BiomedVLP CXR BERT, MedEmbed, ClinicalBERT) to capture clinical context, conditions a 3D latent diffusion model trained on 20,000 CT volumes from CT RATE dataset, and incorporates classifier-free guidance.

Result: Generated anatomically consistent CT volumes with excellent visual quality and text-image alignment. Multi-encoder conditioning improved CLIP scores, achieved state-of-the-art performance across all metrics, and ranked first in VLM3D Challenge at MICCAI 2025.

Conclusion: By leveraging complete radiology reports and multi-encoder text conditioning, Report2CT advances 3D CT synthesis, producing clinically faithful and high-quality synthetic data for medical applications.

Abstract: Text to image latent diffusion models have recently advanced medical image
synthesis, but applications to 3D CT generation remain limited. Existing
approaches rely on simplified prompts, neglecting the rich semantic detail in
full radiology reports, which reduces text image alignment and clinical
fidelity. We propose Report2CT, a radiology report conditional latent diffusion
framework for synthesizing 3D chest CT volumes directly from free text
radiology reports, incorporating both findings and impression sections using
multiple text encoder. Report2CT integrates three pretrained medical text
encoders (BiomedVLP CXR BERT, MedEmbed, and ClinicalBERT) to capture nuanced
clinical context. Radiology reports and voxel spacing information condition a
3D latent diffusion model trained on 20000 CT volumes from the CT RATE dataset.
Model performance was evaluated using Frechet Inception Distance (FID) for real
synthetic distributional similarity and CLIP based metrics for semantic
alignment, with additional qualitative and quantitative comparisons against
GenerateCT model. Report2CT generated anatomically consistent CT volumes with
excellent visual quality and text image alignment. Multi encoder conditioning
improved CLIP scores, indicating stronger preservation of fine grained clinical
details in the free text radiology reports. Classifier free guidance further
enhanced alignment with only a minor trade off in FID. We ranked first in the
VLM3D Challenge at MICCAI 2025 on Text Conditional CT Generation and achieved
state of the art performance across all evaluation metrics. By leveraging
complete radiology reports and multi encoder text conditioning, Report2CT
advances 3D CT synthesis, producing clinically faithful and high quality

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A fracture interactive geodesic active contour algorithm for bone segmentation that combines intensity and gradient norm in a novel edge-detector function, incorporates distance information with fracture prompts as adaptive step size, and addresses edge obstruction, leakage, and fracture issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical geodesic active contour models struggle with indiscriminate feature extraction, edge obstruction, edge leakage, and bone fracture phenomena in bone segmentation tasks.

Method: Proposed a novel edge-detector function combining intensity and gradient norm inspired by orthopedic knowledge. Introduced distance information with embedded fracture prompts as adaptive step size for contour evolution to stabilize the process and improve fracture region accuracy.

Result: Experiments on pelvic and ankle segmentation demonstrated effective handling of edge obstruction, leakage, and fracture problems with accurate, stable, and consistent performance.

Conclusion: The algorithm shows broader application potential for other bone anatomies and provides insights for combining domain knowledge with deep neural networks.

Abstract: For bone segmentation, the classical geodesic active contour model is usually
limited by its indiscriminate feature extraction, and then struggles to handle
the phenomena of edge obstruction, edge leakage and bone fracture. Thus, we
propose a fracture interactive geodesic active contour algorithm tailored for
bone segmentation, which can better capture bone features and perform robustly
to the presence of bone fractures and soft tissues. Inspired by orthopedic
knowledge, we construct a novel edge-detector function that combines the
intensity and gradient norm, which guides the contour towards bone edges
without being obstructed by other soft tissues and therefore reduces
mis-segmentation. Furthermore, distance information, where fracture prompts can
be embedded, is introduced into the contour evolution as an adaptive step size
to stabilize the evolution and help the contour stop at bone edges and
fractures. This embedding provides a way to interact with bone fractures and
improves the accuracy in the fracture regions. Experiments in pelvic and ankle
segmentation demonstrate the effectiveness on addressing the aforementioned
problems and show an accurate, stable and consistent performance, indicating a
broader application in other bone anatomies. Our algorithm also provides
insights into combining the domain knowledge and deep neural networks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes MED loss as regularization for cortical surface reconstruction to improve training consistency and reproducibility while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current learning-based cortical surface reconstruction methods lack optimal deformation energy minimization and training consistency across runs.

Method: Design Minimal Energy Deformation (MED) loss as regularizer for deformation trajectories, integrated into V2C-Flow model alongside Chamfer distance.

Result: Significant improvements in training consistency and reproducibility without compromising reconstruction accuracy or topological correctness.

Conclusion: MED loss effectively addresses deformation energy optimization and training consistency challenges in cortical surface reconstruction.

Abstract: Cortical surface reconstruction (CSR) from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
is fundamental to neuroimage analysis, enabling morphological studies of the
cerebral cortex and functional brain mapping. Recent advances in learning-based
CSR have dramatically accelerated processing, allowing for reconstructions
through the deformation of anatomical templates within seconds. However,
ensuring the learned deformations are optimal in terms of deformation energy
and consistent across training runs remains a particular challenge. In this
work, we design a Minimal Energy Deformation (MED) loss, acting as a
regularizer on the deformation trajectories and complementing the widely used
Chamfer distance in CSR. We incorporate it into the recent V2C-Flow model and
demonstrate considerable improvements in previously neglected training
consistency and reproducibility without harming reconstruction accuracy and
topological correctness.

TL;DR: ProtoMedX is a multi-modal AI model that combines DEXA scans and patient records for bone health classification, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy while providing built-in explainability through prototype-based architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI methods for bone health diagnosis focus on prediction accuracy using vision data alone but lack explainability, which is crucial for medical applications and regulatory compliance like the EU AI Act.

Method: ProtoMedX uses a prototype-based architecture that processes both DEXA scans of the lumbar spine and patient records in a multi-modal approach, designed to be explainable by design rather than relying on post hoc analysis.

Result: The model achieved 87.58% accuracy in vision-only tasks and 89.8% in multi-modal tasks using a dataset of 4,160 NHS patients, surpassing existing published methods in bone health classification.

Conclusion: ProtoMedX demonstrates that multi-modal AI with built-in explainability can achieve superior performance in medical diagnosis while providing clinically interpretable explanations, addressing both accuracy and regulatory requirements.

Abstract: Bone health studies are crucial in medical practice for the early detection
and treatment of Osteopenia and Osteoporosis. Clinicians usually make a
diagnosis based on densitometry (DEXA scans) and patient history. The
applications of AI in this field are ongoing research. Most successful methods
rely on deep learning models that use vision alone (DEXA/X-ray imagery) and
focus on prediction accuracy, while explainability is often disregarded and
left to post hoc assessments of input contributions. We propose ProtoMedX, a
multi-modal model that uses both DEXA scans of the lumbar spine and patient
records. ProtoMedX's prototype-based architecture is explainable by design,
which is crucial for medical applications, especially in the context of the
upcoming EU AI Act, as it allows explicit analysis of model decisions,
including incorrect ones. ProtoMedX demonstrates state-of-the-art performance
in bone health classification while also providing explanations that can be
visually understood by clinicians. Using a dataset of 4,160 real NHS patients,
the proposed ProtoMedX achieves 87.58% accuracy in vision-only tasks and 89.8%
in its multi-modal variant, both surpassing existing published methods.

Motivation: City administrations need up-to-date databases of urban objects and incidents, but manual geocoordinate mapping requires significant effort as digitization increases demand for current data.

Method: Uses advanced Metric Depth Estimation models to calculate geocoordinates based on object distance from camera, geometric principles, and camera specifications. Validated against LiDAR point clouds in urban environments.

Result: Evaluation shows accurate distance estimation across different distance intervals and semantic areas (roads, vegetation). Demonstrated effectiveness through practical use cases with traffic signs and road damage.

Conclusion: MapAnything provides an effective automated solution for urban object and incident mapping, with recommendations for automating urban database maintenance using individual images.

Abstract: To maintain an overview of urban conditions, city administrations manage
databases of objects like traffic signs and trees, complete with their
geocoordinates. Incidents such as graffiti or road damage are also relevant. As
digitization increases, so does the need for more data and up-to-date
databases, requiring significant manual effort. This paper introduces
MapAnything, a module that automatically determines the geocoordinates of
objects using individual images. Utilizing advanced Metric Depth Estimation
models, MapAnything calculates geocoordinates based on the object's distance
from the camera, geometric principles, and camera specifications. We detail and
validate the module, providing recommendations for automating urban object and

*Hongjun Wang,Jiyuan Chen,Zhengwei Yin,Xuan Song,Yinqiang Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a targeted feature denoising framework for generalizable image super-resolution, focusing specifically on noise overfitting rather than all degradation types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Models in image super-resolution tend to overfit to degradation patterns, particularly noise, which has distinct characteristics compared to other degradations like blur or JPEG artifacts.

Method: A targeted feature denoising framework with noise detection and denoising modules that can be integrated with existing super-resolution models without architectural changes.

Result: Superior performance compared to previous regularization-based methods across five traditional benchmarks and datasets in both synthetic and real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses the specific problem of noise overfitting in super-resolution models, providing a general solution that enhances generalization capabilities without requiring model architecture modifications.

Abstract: Generalizable Image Super-Resolution aims to enhance model generalization
capabilities under unknown degradations. To achieve this goal, the models are
expected to focus only on image content-related features instead of overfitting
degradations. Recently, numerous approaches such as Dropout and Feature
Alignment have been proposed to suppress models' natural tendency to overfit
degradations and yield promising results. Nevertheless, these works have
assumed that models overfit to all degradation types (e.g., blur, noise, JPEG),
while through careful investigations in this paper, we discover that models
predominantly overfit to noise, largely attributable to its distinct
degradation pattern compared to other degradation types. In this paper, we
propose a targeted feature denoising framework, comprising noise detection and
denoising modules. Our approach presents a general solution that can be
seamlessly integrated with existing super-resolution models without requiring
architectural modifications. Our framework demonstrates superior performance
compared to previous regularization-based methods across five traditional
benchmarks and datasets, encompassing both synthetic and real-world scenarios.

claims made by arXiv:2311.17983, namely that the usage of Diffusion Denoised
Smoothing (DDS) improves interpretability robustness to (1) attacks in a
segmentation task and (2) perturbation and attacks in a classification task. We
also extend the original study by investigating the authors' claims that adding
DDS to any interpretability method can improve its robustness under attack.
This is tested on baseline methods and the recently proposed Attribution
Rollout method. In addition, we measure the computational costs and
environmental impact of obtaining an FViT through DDS. Our results broadly
agree with the original study's findings, although minor discrepancies were
found and discussed.

*Wonduk Seo,Minhyeong Yu,Hyunjin An,Seunghyun Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MARIC is a multi-agent framework that reformulates image classification as collaborative reasoning, using specialized agents for global analysis, aspect extraction, and synthesis to outperform traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional image classification requires intensive parameter training and large annotated datasets, while current vision language models rely on single-pass representations that fail to capture complementary visual aspects.

Method: MARIC uses an Outliner Agent to analyze global themes and generate prompts, three Aspect Agents to extract fine-grained descriptions along distinct visual dimensions, and a Reasoning Agent to synthesize outputs through integrated reflection for classification.

Result: Experiments on 4 diverse image classification benchmark datasets show MARIC significantly outperforms baseline methods.

Conclusion: Multi-agent visual reasoning provides an effective approach for robust and interpretable image classification, mitigating limitations of both parameter-heavy training and monolithic VLM reasoning.

Abstract: Image classification has traditionally relied on parameter-intensive model
training, requiring large-scale annotated datasets and extensive fine tuning to
achieve competitive performance. While recent vision language models (VLMs)
alleviate some of these constraints, they remain limited by their reliance on
single pass representations, often failing to capture complementary aspects of
visual content. In this paper, we introduce Multi Agent based Reasoning for
Image Classification (MARIC), a multi agent framework that reformulates image
classification as a collaborative reasoning process. MARIC first utilizes an
Outliner Agent to analyze the global theme of the image and generate targeted
prompts. Based on these prompts, three Aspect Agents extract fine grained
descriptions along distinct visual dimensions. Finally, a Reasoning Agent
synthesizes these complementary outputs through integrated reflection step,
producing a unified representation for classification. By explicitly
decomposing the task into multiple perspectives and encouraging reflective
synthesis, MARIC mitigates the shortcomings of both parameter-heavy training
and monolithic VLM reasoning. Experiments on 4 diverse image classification
benchmark datasets demonstrate that MARIC significantly outperforms baselines,
highlighting the effectiveness of multi-agent visual reasoning for robust and
interpretable image classification.

*Ali Salar,Qing Liu,Guoying Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified framework using latent diffusion models for realistic portrait anonymization with complete control over the process through adaptive attribute guidance and support for localized anonymization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To protect personal identities in portrait images while maintaining utility for downstream computer vision tasks, addressing the limitations of prior anonymization approaches.

Method: Leverages latent diffusion models' inpainting ability with an adaptive attribute-guidance module that applies gradient correction during reverse denoising to align facial attributes with synthesized target images. Supports localized anonymization of specific facial regions.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on CelebA-HQ and FFHQ datasets without requiring additional model training.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides effective and controllable portrait anonymization that preserves facial attributes while protecting identity, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: The growing use of portrait images in computer vision highlights the need to
protect personal identities. At the same time, anonymized images must remain
useful for downstream computer vision tasks. In this work, we propose a unified
framework that leverages the inpainting ability of latent diffusion models to
generate realistic anonymized images. Unlike prior approaches, we have complete
control over the anonymization process by designing an adaptive
attribute-guidance module that applies gradient correction during the reverse
denoising process, aligning the facial attributes of the generated image with
those of the synthesized target image. Our framework also supports localized
anonymization, allowing users to specify which facial regions are left
unchanged. Extensive experiments conducted on the public CelebA-HQ and FFHQ
datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches while
requiring no additional model training. The source code is available on our

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A machine learning model that analyzes early MRI treatment response trajectories to predict pathological complete response in breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, achieving up to 86.1% accuracy with multiple imaging time points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable personalized therapy decisions by predicting individual treatment response, which varies substantially across patients and is challenging to forecast due to disease progression heterogeneity.

Method: Multi-task model that learns representations of early treatment response dynamics from longitudinal MRI data, forming trajectories in latent space that capture appearance, temporal continuity, and account for heterogeneity in non-responder cohorts.

Result: Achieved balanced accuracy of 0.761 using only pre-treatment data, 0.811 with early response data (T0 + T1), and 0.861 with four imaging time points (T0 -> T3) on the ISPY-2 dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed trajectory-based representation effectively captures treatment response dynamics, enabling accurate prediction of pathological complete response and demonstrating the value of longitudinal imaging data for personalized treatment planning.

Abstract: Effective therapy decisions require models that predict the individual
response to treatment. This is challenging since the progression of disease and
response to treatment vary substantially across patients. Here, we propose to
learn a representation of the early dynamics of treatment response from imaging
data to predict pathological complete response (pCR) in breast cancer patients
undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). The longitudinal change in magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) data of the breast forms trajectories in the latent
space, serving as basis for prediction of successful response. The multi-task
model represents appearance, fosters temporal continuity and accounts for the
comparably high heterogeneity in the non-responder cohort.In experiments on the
publicly available ISPY-2 dataset, a linear classifier in the latent trajectory
space achieves a balanced accuracy of 0.761 using only pre-treatment data (T0),
0.811 using early response (T0 + T1), and 0.861 using four imaging time points
(T0 -> T3). The code will be made available upon paper acceptance.

*Antoine Legrand,Renaud Detry,Christophe De Vleeschouwer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method to visualize 3D visual cues used by spacecraft pose estimation networks by training a NeRF-based image generator with backpropagated gradients, helping understand the decision process of pose estimators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: On-orbit operations require accurate 6D pose estimation between spacecraft, but data-driven methods lack interpretability, hindering their adoption in real missions due to unclear decision processes.

Method: Train a NeRF-based image generator using gradients back-propagated through the pose estimation network, which forces the generator to render the main 3D features that the pose estimator relies on.

Result: Experiments show the method successfully recovers relevant 3D cues and provides insights into the relationship between pose estimation network supervision and its implicit representation of the target spacecraft.

Conclusion: The proposed visualization method effectively reveals the 3D visual cues used by pose estimation networks, improving interpretability and potentially facilitating adoption in real spacecraft missions.

Abstract: On-orbit operations require the estimation of the relative 6D pose, i.e.,
position and orientation, between a chaser spacecraft and its target. While
data-driven spacecraft pose estimation methods have been developed, their
adoption in real missions is hampered by the lack of understanding of their
decision process. This paper presents a method to visualize the 3D visual cues
on which a given pose estimator relies. For this purpose, we train a NeRF-based
image generator using the gradients back-propagated through the pose estimation
network. This enforces the generator to render the main 3D features exploited
by the spacecraft pose estimation network. Experiments demonstrate that our
method recovers the relevant 3D cues. Furthermore, they offer additional
insights on the relationship between the pose estimation network supervision
and its implicit representation of the target spacecraft.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in complex video object segmentation including small/similar targets, occlusions, rapid motion, and complex interactions.

Method: Pseudo-labeling strategy using SAM2 checkpoint to generate labels for MOSE test set, combined with SAM2Long framework for primary segmentation and SeC model for complementary predictions with cascaded decision mechanism.

Result: Achieved J&F score of 0.8616 on MOSE test set (+1.4 points over baseline), securing 2nd place in LSVOS 2025 VOS Track.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates strong robustness and accuracy in long, complex video segmentation scenarios through pseudo-label training and multi-model inference.

Abstract: Complex Video Object Segmentation (VOS) presents significant challenges in
accurately segmenting objects across frames, especially in the presence of
small and similar targets, frequent occlusions, rapid motion, and complex
interactions. In this report, we present our solution for the LSVOS 2025 VOS
Track based on the SAM2 framework. We adopt a pseudo-labeling strategy during
training: a trained SAM2 checkpoint is deployed within the SAM2Long framework
to generate pseudo labels for the MOSE test set, which are then combined with
existing data for further training. For inference, the SAM2Long framework is
employed to obtain our primary segmentation results, while an open-source SeC
model runs in parallel to produce complementary predictions. A cascaded
decision mechanism dynamically integrates outputs from both models, exploiting
the temporal stability of SAM2Long and the concept-level robustness of SeC.
Benefiting from pseudo-label training and cascaded multi-model inference, our
approach achieves a J\&F score of 0.8616 on the MOSE test set -- +1.4 points
over our SAM2Long baseline -- securing the 2nd place in the LSVOS 2025 VOS
Track, and demonstrating strong robustness and accuracy in long, complex video
segmentation scenarios.

*Tahar Chettaoui,Naser Damer,Fadi Boutros*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIP foundation models lose cross-domain generalization when fine-tuned for specialized biometric tasks like face recognition, morphing attack detection, and presentation attack detection, with task complexity and classification head design affecting the degree of catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically quantify the trade-offs between specialization and generalization when fine-tuning foundation models like CLIP for highly specialized biometric tasks, as these models may suffer from over-specialization and lose their cross-domain generalization capabilities.

Method: Evaluated three instances of CLIP fine-tuned for face recognition (FR), morphing attack detection (MAD), and presentation attack detection (PAD) on 14 general vision datasets under zero-shot and linear-probe protocols, alongside common FR, MAD, and PAD benchmarks.

Result: Fine-tuned models suffer from over-specialization, especially for complex FR tasks. The FRoundation model with ViT-L backbone achieved 58.52% improvement on IJB-C FR benchmark but dropped to 51.63% on ImageNetV2 compared to baseline CLIP's 69.84%. Larger CLIP architectures preserved more original generalization ability.

Conclusion: Task complexity and classification head design correlate with catastrophic forgetting, and increased model capacity may help mitigate over-specialization when fine-tuning foundation models for specialized tasks.

Abstract: Foundation models such as CLIP have demonstrated exceptional zero- and
few-shot transfer capabilities across diverse vision tasks. However, when
fine-tuned for highly specialized biometric tasks, face recognition (FR),
morphing attack detection (MAD), and presentation attack detection (PAD), these
models may suffer from over-specialization. Thus, they may lose one of their
foundational strengths, cross-domain generalization. In this work, we
systematically quantify these trade-offs by evaluating three instances of CLIP
fine-tuned for FR, MAD, and PAD. We evaluate each adapted model as well as the
original CLIP baseline on 14 general vision datasets under zero-shot and
linear-probe protocols, alongside common FR, MAD, and PAD benchmarks. Our
results indicate that fine-tuned models suffer from over-specialization,
especially when fine-tuned for complex tasks of FR. Also, our results pointed
out that task complexity and classification head design, multi-class (FR) vs.
binary (MAD and PAD), correlate with the degree of catastrophic forgetting. The
FRoundation model with the ViT-L backbone outperforms other approaches on the
large-scale FR benchmark IJB-C, achieving an improvement of up to 58.52%.
However, it experiences a substantial performance drop on ImageNetV2, reaching
only 51.63% compared to 69.84% achieved by the baseline CLIP model. Moreover,
the larger CLIP architecture consistently preserves more of the model's
original generalization ability than the smaller variant, indicating that
increased model capacity may help mitigate over-specialization.

TL;DR: DF-LLaVA is a framework that enhances MLLMs' synthetic image detection capabilities by extracting and injecting latent knowledge through prompts, achieving both high accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing detection models only provide binary authenticity judgments without explanatory insights, while MLLM-based methods lag behind expert models in classification accuracy despite offering better interpretability.

Method: Extracts latent knowledge from MLLMs and injects it into training via prompts to unlock their intrinsic discrimination potential, enabling LLaVA to achieve superior detection performance.

Result: DF-LLaVA achieves outstanding detection accuracy exceeding expert models while maintaining the interpretability offered by MLLMs, as confirmed by extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully bridges the gap between accuracy and interpretability in synthetic image detection, providing both high detection performance and human-understandable explanations.

Abstract: With the increasing prevalence of synthetic images, evaluating image
authenticity and locating forgeries accurately while maintaining human
interpretability remains a challenging task. Existing detection models
primarily focus on simple authenticity classification, ultimately providing
only a forgery probability or binary judgment, which offers limited explanatory
insights into image authenticity. Moreover, while MLLM-based detection methods
can provide more interpretable results, they still lag behind expert models in
terms of pure authenticity classification accuracy. To address this, we propose
DF-LLaVA, a simple yet effective framework that unlocks the intrinsic
discrimination potential of MLLMs. Our approach first extracts latent knowledge
from MLLMs and then injects it into training via prompts. This framework allows
LLaVA to achieve outstanding detection accuracy exceeding expert models while
still maintaining the interpretability offered by MLLMs. Extensive experiments
confirm the superiority of our DF-LLaVA, achieving both high accuracy and
explainability in synthetic image detection. Code is available online at:

TL;DR: CMGR framework enhances 3D geometric fidelity using CLIP's spatial semantics to address geometric misalignment and texture bias in 3D class-incremental learning under extreme data scarcity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D class-incremental learning methods struggle with geometric misalignment and texture bias in data-scarce open-world scenarios, and current 2D foundation model integrations suffer from semantic blurring and unstable prototypes.

Method: Proposes Cross-Modal Geometric Rectification (CMGR) with Structure-Aware Geometric Rectification module for hierarchical alignment of 3D structures with CLIP's spatial priors, Texture Amplification Module for discriminative texture synthesis, and Base-Novel Discriminator for geometric variation isolation.

Result: Extensive experiments show significant improvement in 3D few-shot class-incremental learning, achieving superior geometric coherence and robustness to texture bias across cross-domain and within-domain settings.

Conclusion: CMGR effectively addresses geometric misalignment and texture bias issues in 3D incremental learning, providing stable decision prototypes and mitigating catastrophic forgetting through cross-modal geometric rectification.

Abstract: The rapid growth of 3D digital content necessitates expandable recognition
systems for open-world scenarios. However, existing 3D class-incremental
learning methods struggle under extreme data scarcity due to geometric
misalignment and texture bias. While recent approaches integrate 3D data with
2D foundation models (e.g., CLIP), they suffer from semantic blurring caused by
texture-biased projections and indiscriminate fusion of geometric-textural
cues, leading to unstable decision prototypes and catastrophic forgetting. To
address these issues, we propose Cross-Modal Geometric Rectification (CMGR), a
framework that enhances 3D geometric fidelity by leveraging CLIP's hierarchical
spatial semantics. Specifically, we introduce a Structure-Aware Geometric
Rectification module that hierarchically aligns 3D part structures with CLIP's
intermediate spatial priors through attention-driven geometric fusion.
Additionally, a Texture Amplification Module synthesizes minimal yet
discriminative textures to suppress noise and reinforce cross-modal
consistency. To further stabilize incremental prototypes, we employ a
Base-Novel Discriminator that isolates geometric variations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves 3D few-shot
class-incremental learning, achieving superior geometric coherence and
robustness to texture bias across cross-domain and within-domain settings.

TL;DR: Brain-HGCN: A hyperbolic graph neural network framework that better models brain network hierarchy for improved fMRI analysis and psychiatric disorder classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Euclidean GNNs struggle to represent the hierarchical topology of brain networks due to spatial constraints and high distortion, limiting clinical performance in fMRI analysis.

Method: Proposes Brain-HGCN based on hyperbolic geometry using Lorentz model, with hyperbolic graph attention layer featuring signed aggregation for excitatory/inhibitory connections, and geometrically sound Fréchet mean for graph readout.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art Euclidean baselines on two large-scale fMRI datasets for psychiatric disorder classification.

Conclusion: Pioneers a new geometric deep learning paradigm for fMRI analysis, demonstrating the immense potential of hyperbolic GNNs in computational psychiatry.

Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides a powerful non-invasive
window into the brain's functional organization by generating complex
functional networks, typically modeled as graphs. These brain networks exhibit
a hierarchical topology that is crucial for cognitive processing. However, due
to inherent spatial constraints, standard Euclidean GNNs struggle to represent
these hierarchical structures without high distortion, limiting their clinical
performance. To address this limitation, we propose Brain-HGCN, a geometric
deep learning framework based on hyperbolic geometry, which leverages the
intrinsic property of negatively curved space to model the brain's network
hierarchy with high fidelity. Grounded in the Lorentz model, our model employs
a novel hyperbolic graph attention layer with a signed aggregation mechanism to
distinctly process excitatory and inhibitory connections, ultimately learning
robust graph-level representations via a geometrically sound Fr\'echet mean for
graph readout. Experiments on two large-scale fMRI datasets for psychiatric
disorder classification demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms
a wide range of state-of-the-art Euclidean baselines. This work pioneers a new
geometric deep learning paradigm for fMRI analysis, highlighting the immense
potential of hyperbolic GNNs in the field of computational psychiatry.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RoboEye is a two-stage object identification framework that combines 2D semantic features with domain-adapted 3D reasoning to improve accuracy in large-scale e-commerce warehouses, achieving 7.1% higher Recall@1 than previous state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing number of product categories in e-commerce makes object identification challenging due to intra-class variability, rare items, visual similarities, diverse packaging, occlusion, and viewpoint changes that cause performance drops in 2D-only methods.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Large vision model extracts 2D features for candidate ranking, 2) Lightweight 3D-feature-awareness module predicts when 3D re-ranking is needed, using a robot 3D retrieval transformer with geometry-aware dense features and keypoint-based matching instead of cosine similarity.

Result: RoboEye improves Recall@1 by 7.1% over previous state-of-the-art (RoboLLM) and operates using only RGB images, avoiding explicit 3D inputs and reducing deployment costs.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively bridges training-deployment gaps by dynamically augmenting 2D features with 3D reasoning, providing significant performance improvements for automated warehouse packing while maintaining practical deployment feasibility.

Abstract: The rapidly growing number of product categories in large-scale e-commerce
makes accurate object identification for automated packing in warehouses
substantially more difficult. As the catalog grows, intra-class variability and
a long tail of rare or visually similar items increase, and when combined with
diverse packaging, cluttered containers, frequent occlusion, and large
viewpoint changes-these factors amplify discrepancies between query and
reference images, causing sharp performance drops for methods that rely solely
on 2D appearance features. Thus, we propose RoboEye, a two-stage identification
framework that dynamically augments 2D semantic features with domain-adapted 3D
reasoning and lightweight adapters to bridge training deployment gaps. In the
first stage, we train a large vision model to extract 2D features for
generating candidate rankings. A lightweight 3D-feature-awareness module then
estimates 3D feature quality and predicts whether 3D re-ranking is necessary,
preventing performance degradation and avoiding unnecessary computation. When
invoked, the second stage uses our robot 3D retrieval transformer, comprising a
3D feature extractor that produces geometry-aware dense features and a
keypoint-based matcher that computes keypoint-correspondence confidences
between query and reference images instead of conventional cosine-similarity
scoring. Experiments show that RoboEye improves Recall@1 by 7.1% over the prior
state of the art (RoboLLM). Moreover, RoboEye operates using only RGB images,
avoiding reliance on explicit 3D inputs and reducing deployment costs. The code

TL;DR: Proposes dual-stream masking (3D Spatial Grid + Progressive Semantic) for rotation-invariant point cloud MAE to address limitations of random masking, improving geometric and semantic coherence across orientations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Random masking strategies in rotation-invariant point cloud MAEs fail to capture geometric structure and semantic coherence, treating patches independently and overlooking spatial relationships and semantic object parts that maintain identity across rotations.

Method: Dual-stream approach combining 3D Spatial Grid Masking (structured patterns via coordinate sorting) and Progressive Semantic Masking (attention-driven clustering). Uses curriculum learning with dynamic weighting to progress from geometric to semantic understanding. Plug-and-play design integrates with existing frameworks.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN, and OmniObject3D show consistent improvements across various rotation scenarios with substantial performance gains over baseline rotation-invariant methods.

Conclusion: The proposed dual-stream masking strategy effectively addresses geometric and semantic limitations of random masking in rotation-invariant point cloud MAEs, demonstrating broad compatibility and significant performance improvements without requiring architectural changes.

Abstract: Existing rotation-invariant point cloud masked autoencoders (MAE) rely on
random masking strategies that overlook geometric structure and semantic
coherence. Random masking treats patches independently, failing to capture
spatial relationships consistent across orientations and overlooking semantic
object parts that maintain identity regardless of rotation. We propose a
dual-stream masking approach combining 3D Spatial Grid Masking and Progressive
Semantic Masking to address these fundamental limitations. Grid masking creates
structured patterns through coordinate sorting to capture geometric
relationships that persist across different orientations, while semantic
masking uses attention-driven clustering to discover semantically meaningful
parts and maintain their coherence during masking. These complementary streams
are orchestrated via curriculum learning with dynamic weighting, progressing
from geometric understanding to semantic discovery. Designed as plug-and-play
components, our strategies integrate into existing rotation-invariant
frameworks without architectural changes, ensuring broad compatibility across
different approaches. Comprehensive experiments on ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN,
and OmniObject3D demonstrate consistent improvements across various rotation
scenarios, showing substantial performance gains over the baseline
rotation-invariant methods.

Conclusion: EchoVLM shows substantial potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy in ultrasound imaging and provides a viable technical solution for future clinical applications.

Abstract: Ultrasound imaging has become the preferred imaging modality for early cancer
screening due to its advantages of non-ionizing radiation, low cost, and
real-time imaging capabilities. However, conventional ultrasound diagnosis
heavily relies on physician expertise, presenting challenges of high
subjectivity and low diagnostic efficiency. Vision-language models (VLMs) offer
promising solutions for this issue, but existing general-purpose models
demonstrate limited knowledge in ultrasound medical tasks, with poor
generalization in multi-organ lesion recognition and low efficiency across
multi-task diagnostics. To address these limitations, we propose EchoVLM, a
vision-language model specifically designed for ultrasound medical imaging. The
model employs a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture trained on data spanning
seven anatomical regions. This design enables the model to perform multiple
tasks, including ultrasound report generation, diagnosis and visual
question-answering (VQA). The experimental results demonstrated that EchoVLM
achieved significant improvements of 10.15 and 4.77 points in BLEU-1 scores and
ROUGE-1 scores respectively compared to Qwen2-VL on the ultrasound report

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual 3D modeling is time-consuming, and existing generative AI methods struggle with balancing visual quality, diversity, semantic consistency, and user control for indoor scene synthesis.

Method: Created a large synthetic dataset with 12,328 annotated scenes and 4.7M renderings, then developed SpatialGen - a multi-view multi-modal diffusion model that generates appearance (color images), geometry (scene coordinate maps), and semantic maps from 3D layouts and reference images.

Result: SpatialGen consistently generates superior results compared to previous methods, producing realistic and semantically consistent 3D indoor scenes while preserving spatial consistency across modalities.

Conclusion: The introduced dataset and SpatialGen model advance indoor scene understanding and generation, with both data and models being open-sourced to empower the research community.

Abstract: Creating high-fidelity 3D models of indoor environments is essential for
applications in design, virtual reality, and robotics. However, manual 3D
modeling remains time-consuming and labor-intensive. While recent advances in
generative AI have enabled automated scene synthesis, existing methods often
face challenges in balancing visual quality, diversity, semantic consistency,
and user control. A major bottleneck is the lack of a large-scale, high-quality
dataset tailored to this task. To address this gap, we introduce a
comprehensive synthetic dataset, featuring 12,328 structured annotated scenes
with 57,440 rooms, and 4.7M photorealistic 2D renderings. Leveraging this
dataset, we present SpatialGen, a novel multi-view multi-modal diffusion model
that generates realistic and semantically consistent 3D indoor scenes. Given a
3D layout and a reference image (derived from a text prompt), our model
synthesizes appearance (color image), geometry (scene coordinate map), and
semantic (semantic segmentation map) from arbitrary viewpoints, while
preserving spatial consistency across modalities. SpatialGen consistently
generates superior results to previous methods in our experiments. We are
open-sourcing our data and models to empower the community and advance the
field of indoor scene understanding and generation.

### [44] [PRISM: Product Retrieval In Shopping Carts using Hybrid Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14985)
*Arda Kabadayi,Senem Velipasalar,Jiajing Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRISM is a hybrid product retrieval method that combines vision-language models for initial filtering with pixel-level matching for fine-grained discrimination, achieving 4.21% higher top-1 accuracy than SOTA methods while maintaining real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Product retrieval in retail is challenging due to highly similar visual appearances between different brands and varying query angles. Foundational models struggle with subtle local differences, while pixel-wise methods are computationally expensive.

Method: Three-stage hybrid approach: 1) SigLIP vision-language model retrieves top 35 candidates, 2) YOLO-E segmentation removes background clutter, 3) LightGlue performs fine-grained pixel-level matching on filtered candidates.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art image retrieval methods by 4.21% in top-1 accuracy on ABV dataset while remaining within real-time processing bounds for practical deployment.

Conclusion: PRISM effectively combines the efficiency of vision-language models with the precision of pixel-level matching, enabling accurate discrimination of visually similar products in retail settings with practical computational requirements.

Abstract: Compared to traditional image retrieval tasks, product retrieval in retail
settings is even more challenging. Products of the same type from different
brands may have highly similar visual appearances, and the query image may be
taken from an angle that differs significantly from view angles of the stored
catalog images. Foundational models, such as CLIP and SigLIP, often struggle to
distinguish these subtle but important local differences. Pixel-wise matching
methods, on the other hand, are computationally expensive and incur
prohibitively high matching times. In this paper, we propose a new, hybrid
method, called PRISM, for product retrieval in retail settings by leveraging
the advantages of both vision-language model-based and pixel-wise matching
approaches. To provide both efficiency/speed and finegrained retrieval
accuracy, PRISM consists of three stages: 1) A vision-language model (SigLIP)
is employed first to retrieve the top 35 most semantically similar products
from a fixed gallery, thereby narrowing the search space significantly; 2) a
segmentation model (YOLO-E) is applied to eliminate background clutter; 3)
fine-grained pixel-level matching is performed using LightGlue across the
filtered candidates. This framework enables more accurate discrimination
between products with high inter-class similarity by focusing on subtle visual
cues often missed by global models. Experiments performed on the ABV dataset
show that our proposed PRISM outperforms the state-of-the-art image retrieval
methods by 4.21% in top-1 accuracy while still remaining within the bounds of
real-time processing for practical retail deployments.

TL;DR: Improved synthetic underwater data generation pipeline that includes forward scattering and nonuniform medium modeling, validated with real turbid dataset BUCKET showing 82.5% preference over reference model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing underwater image formation models focus on discoloration but overlook distance-dependent visibility loss in turbid environments, missing forward scattering effects and nonuniform medium considerations.

Method: Proposed improved synthetic data generation pipeline incorporating forward scattering term and nonuniform medium modeling. Collected BUCKET dataset with controlled turbidity conditions for real turbid footage with reference images.

Result: Demonstrated qualitative improvements over reference model, especially under increasing turbidity, with 82.5% selection rate by survey participants.

Conclusion: The inclusion of forward scattering and nonuniform medium modeling significantly improves synthetic underwater data generation for turbid environments, validated by both synthetic improvements and real dataset collection.

Abstract: In recent years, the underwater image formation model has found extensive use
in the generation of synthetic underwater data. Although many approaches focus
on scenes primarily affected by discoloration, they often overlook the model's
ability to capture the complex, distance-dependent visibility loss present in
highly turbid environments. In this work, we propose an improved synthetic data
generation pipeline that includes the commonly omitted forward scattering term,
while also considering a nonuniform medium. Additionally, we collected the
BUCKET dataset under controlled turbidity conditions to acquire real turbid
footage with the corresponding reference images. Our results demonstrate
qualitative improvements over the reference model, particularly under
increasing turbidity, with a selection rate of 82. 5\% by survey participants.

TL;DR: AdaMM is a multi-modal brain tumor segmentation framework that handles missing MRI modalities through knowledge distillation, adaptive refinement, and reliability modules, achieving superior performance in incomplete input scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Missing MRI modalities are common in clinical practice but limit existing deep learning methods that require complete inputs, especially for non-dominant modality combinations.

Method: Proposes AdaMM with three modules: Graph-guided Adaptive Refinement for semantic associations, Bi-Bottleneck Distillation for knowledge transfer via style matching and adversarial alignment, and Lesion-Presence-Guided Reliability for suppressing false positives.

Result: Extensive experiments on BraTS 2018 and 2024 datasets show AdaMM consistently outperforms existing methods with superior segmentation accuracy and robustness, particularly in single-modality and weak-modality configurations.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the superiority of knowledge distillation for missing-modality scenarios and provides practical guidance for method selection, with systematic evaluation of six strategy categories.

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor segmentation is essential for preoperative evaluation
and personalized treatment. Multi-modal MRI is widely used due to its ability
to capture complementary tumor features across different sequences. However, in
clinical practice, missing modalities are common, limiting the robustness and
generalizability of existing deep learning methods that rely on complete
inputs, especially under non-dominant modality combinations. To address this,
we propose AdaMM, a multi-modal brain tumor segmentation framework tailored for
missing-modality scenarios, centered on knowledge distillation and composed of
three synergistic modules. The Graph-guided Adaptive Refinement Module
explicitly models semantic associations between generalizable and
modality-specific features, enhancing adaptability to modality absence. The
Bi-Bottleneck Distillation Module transfers structural and textural knowledge
from teacher to student models via global style matching and adversarial
feature alignment. The Lesion-Presence-Guided Reliability Module predicts prior
probabilities of lesion types through an auxiliary classification task,
effectively suppressing false positives under incomplete inputs. Extensive
experiments on the BraTS 2018 and 2024 datasets demonstrate that AdaMM
consistently outperforms existing methods, exhibiting superior segmentation
accuracy and robustness, particularly in single-modality and weak-modality
configurations. In addition, we conduct a systematic evaluation of six
categories of missing-modality strategies, confirming the superiority of
knowledge distillation and offering practical guidance for method selection and
future research. Our source code is available at

*Chau Pham,Quan Dao,Mahesh Bhosale,Yunjie Tian,Dimitris Metaxas,David Doermann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning framework that dynamically optimizes hyperparameters for diffusion-based image editing, reducing computational costs compared to brute-force tuning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based image editing methods require extensive brute-force hyperparameter tuning (inversion timesteps, attention modification, etc.), which is computationally expensive and inefficient due to the large search space.

Method: Proposes a reinforcement learning framework that treats hyperparameter optimization as a sequential decision-making task using a Markov Decision Process. The method dynamically adjusts hyperparameters across denoising steps and integrates editing objectives into a reward function, using proximal policy optimization for efficiency.

Result: The approach significantly reduces search time and computational overhead compared to brute-force methods while maintaining optimal hyperparameter configurations for image editing.

Conclusion: This reinforcement learning-based hyperparameter optimization framework advances the practical deployment of diffusion-based image editing by making the process more efficient and computationally feasible.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have revolutionized text-guided image
editing, yet existing editing methods face critical challenges in
hyperparameter identification. To get the reasonable editing performance, these
methods often require the user to brute-force tune multiple interdependent
hyperparameters, such as inversion timesteps and attention modification,
\textit{etc.} This process incurs high computational costs due to the huge
hyperparameter search space. We consider searching optimal editing's
hyperparameters as a sequential decision-making task within the diffusion
denoising process. Specifically, we propose a reinforcement learning framework,
which establishes a Markov Decision Process that dynamically adjusts
hyperparameters across denoising steps, integrating editing objectives into a
reward function. The method achieves time efficiency through proximal policy
optimization while maintaining optimal hyperparameter configurations.
Experiments demonstrate significant reduction in search time and computational
overhead compared to existing brute-force approaches, advancing the practical
deployment of a diffusion-based image editing framework in the real world.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: YOLOv11 model trained on synthetic data with domain randomization achieves 0.910 mAP@50 on real-world object detection, showing synthetic-only training potential but highlighting domain gap challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the synthetic-to-real domain gap in object detection by training on synthetic data only, using domain randomization to bridge the performance gap between synthetic validation and real-world deployment.

Method: Extensive experimentation with YOLOv11 model using synthetic data, domain randomization strategies, data augmentation, dataset composition variations, and model scaling. Evaluation through both synthetic metrics and real-world testing on manually labeled dataset and Kaggle competition hidden test set.

Result: Best performing YOLOv11l model achieved 0.910 mAP@50 on hidden test set. Synthetic validation metrics were poor predictors of real performance. Increased dataset diversity with varied perspectives and complex backgrounds combined with tuned augmentation was crucial for success.

Conclusion: Synthetic-only training approach shows significant potential for object detection, but careful dataset design and augmentation are critical. Domain gap remains a challenge, requiring both quantitative and qualitative evaluation methods to guide development.

Abstract: This paper addresses the synthetic-to-real domain gap in object detection,
focusing on training a YOLOv11 model to detect a specific object (a soup can)
using only synthetic data and domain randomization strategies. The methodology
involves extensive experimentation with data augmentation, dataset composition,
and model scaling. While synthetic validation metrics were consistently high,
they proved to be poor predictors of real-world performance. Consequently,
models were also evaluated qualitatively, through visual inspection of
predictions, and quantitatively, on a manually labeled real-world test set, to
guide development. Final mAP@50 scores were provided by the official Kaggle
competition. Key findings indicate that increasing synthetic dataset diversity,
specifically by including varied perspectives and complex backgrounds, combined
with carefully tuned data augmentation, were crucial in bridging the domain
gap. The best performing configuration, a YOLOv11l model trained on an expanded
and diverse dataset, achieved a final mAP@50 of 0.910 on the competition's
hidden test set. This result demonstrates the potential of a synthetic-only
training approach while also highlighting the remaining challenges in fully
capturing real-world variability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Evaluation of three deep learning lung segmentation models (Unet-R231, TotalSegmentator, MedSAM) in transplant patients shows Unet-R231 performs best overall, but all models decline significantly in moderate-to-severe cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the performance of publicly available deep learning lung segmentation models across different disease severity levels and pathology categories for preoperative planning in lung transplantation.

Method: Retrospective study of 32 patients (3,645 CT slices) using three deep learning models with quantitative metrics (volumetric similarity, Dice coefficient, Hausdorff distance) and qualitative clinical acceptability scoring.

Result: Unet-R231 consistently outperformed other models across severity levels and pathology categories. All models showed significant performance declines from mild to moderate-to-severe cases, particularly in volumetric similarity.

Conclusion: Unet-R231 provides the most accurate automated segmentation, but specialized model fine-tuning is needed for severe pathology cases as performance declines significantly in moderate-to-severe conditions.

Abstract: This study evaluates publicly available deep-learning based lung segmentation
models in transplant-eligible patients to determine their performance across
disease severity levels, pathology categories, and lung sides, and to identify
limitations impacting their use in preoperative planning in lung
transplantation. This retrospective study included 32 patients who underwent
chest CT scans at Duke University Health System between 2017 and 2019 (total of
3,645 2D axial slices). Patients with standard axial CT scans were selected
based on the presence of two or more lung pathologies of varying severity. Lung
segmentation was performed using three previously developed deep learning
models: Unet-R231, TotalSegmentator, MedSAM. Performance was assessed using
quantitative metrics (volumetric similarity, Dice similarity coefficient,
Hausdorff distance) and a qualitative measure (four-point clinical
acceptability scale). Unet-R231 consistently outperformed TotalSegmentator and
MedSAM in general, for different severity levels, and pathology categories
(p<0.05). All models showed significant performance declines from mild to
moderate-to-severe cases, particularly in volumetric similarity (p<0.05),
without significant differences among lung sides or pathology types. Unet-R231
provided the most accurate automated lung segmentation among evaluated models
with TotalSegmentator being a close second, though their performance declined
significantly in moderate-to-severe cases, emphasizing the need for specialized
model fine-tuning in severe pathology contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current representation learning shows multi-modal clues improve semantic segmentation, but there's no flexible pretrain-and-finetune pipeline for multiple visual modalities.

Method: Proposes OmniSegmentor framework with: 1) ImageNeXt dataset containing five visual modalities based on ImageNet, 2) Efficient pretraining method to encode different modality information.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art records on NYU Depthv2, EventScape, MFNet, DeLiVER, SUNRGBD, and KITTI-360 datasets.

Conclusion: First universal multi-modal pretraining framework that consistently enhances model's perceptual capabilities across various scenarios with arbitrary modality combinations.

Abstract: Recent research on representation learning has proved the merits of
multi-modal clues for robust semantic segmentation. Nevertheless, a flexible
pretrain-and-finetune pipeline for multiple visual modalities remains
unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal learning framework,
termed OmniSegmentor. It has two key innovations: 1) Based on ImageNet, we
assemble a large-scale dataset for multi-modal pretraining, called ImageNeXt,
which contains five popular visual modalities. 2) We provide an efficient
pretraining manner to endow the model with the capacity to encode different
modality information in the ImageNeXt. For the first time, we introduce a
universal multi-modal pretraining framework that consistently amplifies the
model's perceptual capabilities across various scenarios, regardless of the
arbitrary combination of the involved modalities. Remarkably, our OmniSegmentor
achieves new state-of-the-art records on a wide range of multi-modal semantic
segmentation datasets, including NYU Depthv2, EventScape, MFNet, DeLiVER,
SUNRGBD, and KITTI-360.

*Fang Li,Hao Zhang,Narendra Ahuja*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method for camera parameter optimization in dynamic scenes using only single RGB video supervision, outperforming COLMAP in efficiency and accuracy without requiring ground truth motion masks or other priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: COLMAP is slow and requires ground truth motion masks for dynamic scenes, while many existing methods need additional priors like GT focal length, 3D point clouds, or camera poses that are unavailable in casually captured RGB videos.

Method: Three key components: (1) Patch-wise Tracking Filters for robust sparse hinge-like relations, (2) Outlier-aware Joint Optimization with adaptive down-weighting of moving outliers, (3) Two-stage Optimization Strategy balancing Softplus limits and convex minima for stability and speed.

Result: Method estimates camera parameters more efficiently and accurately than COLMAP, validated on 4 real-world datasets (NeRF-DS, DAVIS, iPhone, TUM-dynamics) and 1 synthetic dataset (MPI-Sintel) using only single RGB video supervision.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enables accurate camera parameter optimization for dynamic scenes using only RGB video input, eliminating the need for ground truth motion masks or other priors that are typically unavailable in casual video capture scenarios.

Abstract: Although COLMAP has long remained the predominant method for camera parameter
optimization in static scenes, it is constrained by its lengthy runtime and
reliance on ground truth (GT) motion masks for application to dynamic scenes.
Many efforts attempted to improve it by incorporating more priors as
supervision such as GT focal length, motion masks, 3D point clouds, camera
poses, and metric depth, which, however, are typically unavailable in casually
captured RGB videos. In this paper, we propose a novel method for more accurate
and efficient camera parameter optimization in dynamic scenes solely supervised
by a single RGB video. Our method consists of three key components: (1)
Patch-wise Tracking Filters, to establish robust and maximally sparse
hinge-like relations across the RGB video. (2) Outlier-aware Joint
Optimization, for efficient camera parameter optimization by adaptive
down-weighting of moving outliers, without reliance on motion priors. (3) A
Two-stage Optimization Strategy, to enhance stability and optimization speed by
a trade-off between the Softplus limits and convex minima in losses. We
visually and numerically evaluate our camera estimates. To further validate
accuracy, we feed the camera estimates into a 4D reconstruction method and
assess the resulting 3D scenes, and rendered 2D RGB and depth maps. We perform
experiments on 4 real-world datasets (NeRF-DS, DAVIS, iPhone, and TUM-dynamics)
and 1 synthetic dataset (MPI-Sintel), demonstrating that our method estimates
camera parameters more efficiently and accurately with a single RGB video as
the only supervision.

*Haobo Yang,Minghao Guo,Dequan Yang,Wenyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Integrating geometric visual illusions from perceptual psychology into image classification training improves model generalization and structural sensitivity, benefiting both CNN and transformer architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models rely on statistical regularities from large datasets but lack structured insights from perceptual psychology. The paper explores how perceptually motivated inductive biases from visual illusions can enhance vision models.

Method: Created a synthetic parametric geometric-illusion dataset and evaluated three multi-source learning strategies that combine illusion recognition tasks with ImageNet classification objectives.

Result: Incorporating geometric illusions as auxiliary supervision systematically improves generalization, especially for challenging visual cases with intricate contours and fine textures. Perceptually driven biases enhance structural sensitivity in both CNN and transformer architectures.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates successful integration of perceptual science and machine learning, showing that even synthetic stimuli traditionally considered unrelated to natural image recognition can provide valuable inductive biases for vision model design.

Abstract: Contemporary deep learning models have achieved impressive performance in
image classification by primarily leveraging statistical regularities within
large datasets, but they rarely incorporate structured insights drawn directly
from perceptual psychology. To explore the potential of perceptually motivated
inductive biases, we propose integrating classic geometric visual illusions
well-studied phenomena from human perception into standard image-classification
training pipelines. Specifically, we introduce a synthetic, parametric
geometric-illusion dataset and evaluate three multi-source learning strategies
that combine illusion recognition tasks with ImageNet classification
objectives. Our experiments reveal two key conceptual insights: (i)
incorporating geometric illusions as auxiliary supervision systematically
improves generalization, especially in visually challenging cases involving
intricate contours and fine textures; and (ii) perceptually driven inductive
biases, even when derived from synthetic stimuli traditionally considered
unrelated to natural image recognition, can enhance the structural sensitivity
of both CNN and transformer-based architectures. These results demonstrate a
novel integration of perceptual science and machine learning and suggest new
directions for embedding perceptual priors into vision model design.

*Saket S. Chaturvedi,Gaurav Bagwe,Lan Zhang,Xiaoyong Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel attack called Adversarial Instructional Prompt (AIP) exploits trusted instructional prompts in RAG systems to manipulate retrieval behavior and outputs, achieving up to 95.23% attack success rate while maintaining normal functionality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior RAG attacks focused on manipulating user queries, which is often impractical due to protected inputs. This paper identifies instructional prompts as a more realistic and stealthy attack vector since they are widely reused, publicly shared, and rarely audited.

Method: Proposes a genetic algorithm-based joint optimization to evolve adversarial prompts, using diverse query generation to simulate realistic linguistic variations. The attack balances naturalness, utility, and robustness to create prompts that evade detection while manipulating RAG behavior.

Result: AIP achieves up to 95.23% attack success rate (ASR) while preserving benign functionality, demonstrating that instructional prompts can be effectively weaponized to degrade RAG system integrity.

Conclusion: The study reveals a critical vulnerability in RAG systems through instructional prompt manipulation, emphasizing the need to reassess the security of shared instructional prompts that are currently trusted but vulnerable to adversarial exploitation.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
retrieving relevant documents from external sources to improve factual accuracy
and verifiability. However, this reliance introduces new attack surfaces within
the retrieval pipeline, beyond the LLM itself. While prior RAG attacks have
exposed such vulnerabilities, they largely rely on manipulating user queries,
which is often infeasible in practice due to fixed or protected user inputs.
This narrow focus overlooks a more realistic and stealthy vector: instructional
prompts, which are widely reused, publicly shared, and rarely audited. Their
implicit trust makes them a compelling target for adversaries to manipulate RAG
behavior covertly.
  We introduce a novel attack for Adversarial Instructional Prompt (AIP) that
exploits adversarial instructional prompts to manipulate RAG outputs by subtly
altering retrieval behavior. By shifting the attack surface to the
instructional prompts, AIP reveals how trusted yet seemingly benign interface
components can be weaponized to degrade system integrity. The attack is crafted
to achieve three goals: (1) naturalness, to evade user detection; (2) utility,
to encourage use of prompts; and (3) robustness, to remain effective across
diverse query variations. We propose a diverse query generation strategy that
simulates realistic linguistic variation in user queries, enabling the
discovery of prompts that generalize across paraphrases and rephrasings.
Building on this, a genetic algorithm-based joint optimization is developed to
evolve adversarial prompts by balancing attack success, clean-task utility, and
stealthiness. Experimental results show that AIP achieves up to 95.23% ASR
while preserving benign functionality. These findings uncover a critical and
previously overlooked vulnerability in RAG systems, emphasizing the need to
reassess the shared instructional prompts.

TL;DR: M&N framework transfers knowledge from 2D pretrained vision models to 3D medical image segmentation using iterative co-training and adaptive sampling, achieving SOTA performance in semi-supervised settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of limited labeled 3D medical images by leveraging knowledge from general 2D vision models pretrained on natural images, improving semi-supervised 3D medical segmentation.

Method: Proposes M&N framework with iterative co-training between 2D pretrained model and 3D segmentation model using pseudo-masks, plus learning rate guided sampling to adaptively balance labeled and unlabeled data based on prediction accuracy.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple public datasets, outperforming 13 existing semi-supervised segmentation approaches across all settings. Ablation studies confirm model-agnostic nature.

Conclusion: M&N effectively transfers 2D knowledge to 3D medical segmentation, is adaptable to different architectures, and minimizes adverse effects from inaccurate pseudo-masks through adaptive sampling.

Abstract: This paper explores the transfer of knowledge from general vision models
pretrained on 2D natural images to improve 3D medical image segmentation. We
focus on the semi-supervised setting, where only a few labeled 3D medical
images are available, along with a large set of unlabeled images. To tackle
this, we propose a model-agnostic framework that progressively distills
knowledge from a 2D pretrained model to a 3D segmentation model trained from
scratch. Our approach, M&N, involves iterative co-training of the two models
using pseudo-masks generated by each other, along with our proposed learning
rate guided sampling that adaptively adjusts the proportion of labeled and
unlabeled data in each training batch to align with the models' prediction
accuracy and stability, minimizing the adverse effect caused by inaccurate
pseudo-masks. Extensive experiments on multiple publicly available datasets
demonstrate that M&N achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming
thirteen existing semi-supervised segmentation approaches under all different
settings. Importantly, ablation studies show that M&N remains model-agnostic,
allowing seamless integration with different architectures. This ensures its
adaptability as more advanced models emerge. The code is available at

Result: RA-GAN outperforms SAM-GAN by 13.14% on average and CUSP-GAN by 9.1% in 60+ age group. Improves kinship verification accuracy by up to 5.22% on different relationships.

Conclusion: The racially unbiased age transformation significantly enhances kinship verification accuracy across all age groups and relationships, demonstrating the importance of addressing racial bias in face aging models.

Abstract: The age gap in kinship verification addresses the time difference between the
photos of the parent and the child. Moreover, their same-age photos are often
unavailable, and face aging models are racially biased, which impacts the
likeness of photos. Therefore, we propose a face aging GAN model, RA-GAN,
consisting of two new modules, RACEpSp and a feature mixer, to produce racially
unbiased images. The unbiased synthesized photos are used in kinship
verification to investigate the results of verifying same-age parent-child
images. The experiments demonstrate that our RA-GAN outperforms SAM-GAN on an
average of 13.14\% across all age groups, and CUSP-GAN in the 60+ age group by
9.1\% in terms of racial accuracy. Moreover, RA-GAN can preserve subjects'
identities better than SAM-GAN and CUSP-GAN across all age groups.
Additionally, we demonstrate that transforming parent and child images from the
KinFaceW-I and KinFaceW-II datasets to the same age can enhance the
verification accuracy across all age groups. The accuracy increases with our
RA-GAN for the kinship relationships of father-son and father-daughter,
mother-son, and mother-daughter, which are 5.22, 5.12, 1.63, and 0.41,
respectively, on KinFaceW-I. Additionally, the accuracy for the relationships
of father-daughter, father-son, and mother-son is 2.9, 0.39, and 1.6 on
KinFaceW-II, respectively. The code is available

*Zaiquan Yang,Yuhao Liu,Gerhard Hancke,Rynson W. H. Lau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Zero-shot spatio-temporal video grounding using MLLMs with novel decomposed spatio-temporal highlighting and temporal-augmented assembling strategies to improve grounding accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs tend to dynamically assign grounding tokens but suffer from suboptimal grounding due to inability to fully integrate text query cues like attributes and actions for inference.

Method: Proposes DSTH strategy that decouples queries into attribute/action sub-queries with logit-guided re-attention module, and TAS strategy using temporal-augmented frames to improve temporal consistency.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three common STVG benchmarks across various MLLMs.

Conclusion: The framework effectively unleashes MLLMs' reasoning ability for zero-shot spatio-temporal video grounding through decomposed query processing and temporal consistency enhancement.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal video grounding (STVG) aims at localizing the spatio-temporal
tube of a video, as specified by the input text query. In this paper, we
utilize multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to explore a zero-shot
solution in STVG. We reveal two key insights about MLLMs: (1) MLLMs tend to
dynamically assign special tokens, referred to as \textit{grounding tokens},
for grounding the text query; and (2) MLLMs often suffer from suboptimal
grounding due to the inability to fully integrate the cues in the text query
(\textit{e.g.}, attributes, actions) for inference. Based on these insights, we
propose a MLLM-based zero-shot framework for STVG, which includes novel
decomposed spatio-temporal highlighting (DSTH) and temporal-augmented
assembling (TAS) strategies to unleash the reasoning ability of MLLMs. The DSTH
strategy first decouples the original query into attribute and action
sub-queries for inquiring the existence of the target both spatially and
temporally. It then uses a novel logit-guided re-attention (LRA) module to
learn latent variables as spatial and temporal prompts, by regularizing token
predictions for each sub-query. These prompts highlight attribute and action
cues, respectively, directing the model's attention to reliable spatial and
temporal related visual regions. In addition, as the spatial grounding by the
attribute sub-query should be temporally consistent, we introduce the TAS
strategy to assemble the predictions using the original video frames and the
temporal-augmented frames as inputs to help improve temporal consistency. We
evaluate our method on various MLLMs, and show that it outperforms SOTA methods
on three common STVG benchmarks.

*Dewi Endah Kharismawati,Toni Kazic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSDD is a new aerial image dataset for maize seedling detection that enables accurate stand counting using computer vision models like YOLO variants, with best performance during V4-V6 growth stages and nadir camera views.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate maize seedling detection is crucial for precision agriculture but existing curated datasets are scarce. Traditional manual counting methods are labor-intensive and error-prone, creating a need for automated computer vision solutions.

Method: Created MSDD dataset with three classes (single, double, triple plants) capturing diverse conditions. Benchmark tested various YOLO models (YOLO11, YOLOv9) for detection performance across different growth stages and camera angles.

Result: YOLO11 achieved fastest inference (35ms per image), YOLOv9 had highest accuracy for single plants (precision up to 0.984, recall up to 0.873). Detection works best during V4-V6 stages and nadir views. Multi-plant detection remains challenging due to class imbalance and irregular appearances.

Conclusion: MSDD provides a strong foundation for developing models that enhance stand counting and support real-time decision-making in precision agriculture, representing progress toward automated agricultural monitoring.

Abstract: Accurate maize seedling detection is crucial for precision agriculture, yet
curated datasets remain scarce. We introduce MSDD, a high-quality aerial image
dataset for maize seedling stand counting, with applications in early-season
crop monitoring, yield prediction, and in-field management. Stand counting
determines how many plants germinated, guiding timely decisions such as
replanting or adjusting inputs. Traditional methods are labor-intensive and
error-prone, while computer vision enables efficient, accurate detection. MSDD
contains three classes-single, double, and triple plants-capturing diverse
growth stages, planting setups, soil types, lighting conditions, camera angles,
and densities, ensuring robustness for real-world use. Benchmarking shows
detection is most reliable during V4-V6 stages and under nadir views. Among
tested models, YOLO11 is fastest, while YOLOv9 yields the highest accuracy for
single plants. Single plant detection achieves precision up to 0.984 and recall
up to 0.873, but detecting doubles and triples remains difficult due to rarity
and irregular appearance, often from planting errors. Class imbalance further
reduces accuracy in multi-plant detection. Despite these challenges, YOLO11
maintains efficient inference at 35 ms per image, with an additional 120 ms for
saving outputs. MSDD establishes a strong foundation for developing models that
enhance stand counting, optimize resource allocation, and support real-time
decision-making. This dataset marks a step toward automating agricultural
monitoring and advancing precision agriculture.

*Xiaoyu Yue,Zidong Wang,Yuqing Wang,Wenlong Zhang,Xihui Liu,Wanli Ouyang,Lei Bai,Luping Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ST-AR is a novel training framework that addresses limitations of autoregressive models in visual tasks by introducing self-supervised objectives, significantly improving both image understanding and generation quality without pre-trained models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models designed for natural language face challenges when applied to visual domains, struggling with high-level visual semantics due to local dependence, semantic inconsistency, and spatial invariance issues.

Method: The proposed Self-guided Training for AutoRegressive models (ST-AR) introduces self-supervised objectives during training to address the identified three key properties that hinder visual learning: local/conditional dependence, inter-step semantic inconsistency, and spatial invariance deficiency.

Result: ST-AR significantly enhances image understanding and generation quality, achieving approximately 42% FID improvement for LlamaGen-L and 49% FID improvement for LlamaGen-XL while maintaining the same sampling strategy.

Conclusion: Self-supervised objectives effectively address the fundamental limitations of autoregressive models in visual domains, enabling improved visual representation learning and generation without relying on pre-trained models.

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of high-quality visual
representations in image generation and have highlighted the limitations of
generative models in image understanding. As a generative paradigm originally
designed for natural language, autoregressive models face similar challenges.
In this work, we present the first systematic investigation into the mechanisms
of applying the next-token prediction paradigm to the visual domain. We
identify three key properties that hinder the learning of high-level visual
semantics: local and conditional dependence, inter-step semantic inconsistency,
and spatial invariance deficiency. We show that these issues can be effectively
addressed by introducing self-supervised objectives during training, leading to
a novel training framework, Self-guided Training for AutoRegressive models
(ST-AR). Without relying on pre-trained representation models, ST-AR
significantly enhances the image understanding ability of autoregressive models
and leads to improved generation quality. Specifically, ST-AR brings
approximately 42% FID improvement for LlamaGen-L and 49% FID improvement for
LlamaGen-XL, while maintaining the same sampling strategy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SyncSeal is a specialized watermarking method that enhances image synchronization by estimating and inverting geometric transformations through end-to-end trained embedder and extractor networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing watermarking methods are vulnerable to geometric transformations (crop, rotation), so there's a need for robust synchronization techniques to protect images against such attacks.

Method: Uses an embedder network to imperceptibly alter images and an extractor network to predict geometric transformations. Both are end-to-end trained with a discriminator to maintain perceptual quality while minimizing transformation prediction error.

Result: Experimental validation shows SyncSeal effectively synchronizes images across various geometric and valuemetric transformations and can upgrade existing watermarking methods to withstand previously vulnerable geometric attacks.

Conclusion: SyncSeal provides an effective solution for robust image synchronization that can be applied on top of existing watermarking methods to enhance their geometric transformation robustness.

Abstract: Synchronization is the task of estimating and inverting geometric
transformations (e.g., crop, rotation) applied to an image. This work
introduces SyncSeal, a bespoke watermarking method for robust image
synchronization, which can be applied on top of existing watermarking methods
to enhance their robustness against geometric transformations. It relies on an
embedder network that imperceptibly alters images and an extractor network that
predicts the geometric transformation to which the image was subjected. Both
networks are end-to-end trained to minimize the error between the predicted and
ground-truth parameters of the transformation, combined with a discriminator to
maintain high perceptual quality. We experimentally validate our method on a
wide variety of geometric and valuemetric transformations, demonstrating its
effectiveness in accurately synchronizing images. We further show that our
synchronization can effectively upgrade existing watermarking methods to
withstand geometric transformations to which they were previously vulnerable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more effective VLA model by bridging visual frame prediction with action prediction through large-scale video generative pretraining from human demonstrations.

Method: Two-stage pretraining: 1) Ego-Centric Video Generative Pretraining on 12M videos to predict future frames, 2) Human-Centric Trajectory-Aware Modeling that jointly predicts future keypoint trajectories. Uses ActionVAE to compress action sequences into latent embeddings.

Result: RynnVLA-001 achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines when finetuned on downstream robotics datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed pretraining strategy provides a more effective initialization for VLA models, demonstrating the value of combining video generation with trajectory prediction for robotics applications.

Abstract: This paper presents RynnVLA-001, a vision-language-action(VLA) model built
upon large-scale video generative pretraining from human demonstrations. We
propose a novel two-stage pretraining methodology. The first stage, Ego-Centric
Video Generative Pretraining, trains an Image-to-Video model on 12M ego-centric
manipulation videos to predict future frames conditioned on an initial frame
and a language instruction. The second stage, Human-Centric Trajectory-Aware
Modeling, extends this by jointly predicting future keypoint trajectories,
thereby effectively bridging visual frame prediction with action prediction.
Furthermore, to enhance action representation, we propose ActionVAE, a
variational autoencoder that compresses sequences of actions into compact
latent embeddings, reducing the complexity of the VLA output space. When
finetuned on the same downstream robotics datasets, RynnVLA-001 achieves
superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating that the
proposed pretraining strategy provides a more effective initialization for VLA
models.

Motivation: Existing trajectory prediction methods assume complete and noise-free data, overlooking real-world challenges like out-of-sight objects and sensor noise from limited camera coverage and obstructions, which pose safety risks.

Method: Enhanced Vision-Positioning Denoising Module that uses camera calibration to create vision-positioning mapping, addressing lack of visual references and denoising noisy sensor data in an unsupervised manner.

Conclusion: First work to integrate vision-positioning projection for denoising noisy sensor trajectories of out-of-sight agents, providing comprehensive benchmark and paving way for future advances in the field.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is a critical task in computer vision and autonomous
systems, playing a key role in autonomous driving, robotics, surveillance, and
virtual reality. Existing methods often rely on complete and noise-free
observational data, overlooking the challenges associated with out-of-sight
objects and the inherent noise in sensor data caused by limited camera
coverage, obstructions, and the absence of ground truth for denoised
trajectories. These limitations pose safety risks and hinder reliable
prediction in real-world scenarios. In this extended work, we present
advancements in Out-of-Sight Trajectory (OST), a novel task that predicts the
noise-free visual trajectories of out-of-sight objects using noisy sensor data.
Building on our previous research, we broaden the scope of Out-of-Sight
Trajectory Prediction (OOSTraj) to include pedestrians and vehicles, extending
its applicability to autonomous driving, robotics, surveillance, and virtual
reality. Our enhanced Vision-Positioning Denoising Module leverages camera
calibration to establish a vision-positioning mapping, addressing the lack of
visual references, while effectively denoising noisy sensor data in an
unsupervised manner. Through extensive evaluations on the Vi-Fi and JRDB
datasets, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both trajectory
denoising and prediction, significantly surpassing previous baselines.
Additionally, we introduce comparisons with traditional denoising methods, such
as Kalman filtering, and adapt recent trajectory prediction models to our task,
providing a comprehensive benchmark. This work represents the first initiative
to integrate vision-positioning projection for denoising noisy sensor
trajectories of out-of-sight agents, paving the way for future advances. The

TL;DR: A novel multi-view stereo framework that introduces diffusion models for depth refinement, achieving state-of-the-art performance with improved efficiency through conditional diffusion processes and adaptive sampling strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve computational efficiency and performance in 3D geometry reconstruction from calibrated images by leveraging the success of diffusion models in generation tasks, moving beyond traditional coarse-to-fine depth estimation approaches.

Method: Formulates depth refinement as a conditional diffusion process using a condition encoder, combines lightweight 2D U-Net with convolutional GRU for efficiency, and implements confidence-based adaptive sampling of depth hypotheses. Proposes two methods: DiffMVS and CasDiffMVS.

Result: DiffMVS achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art efficiency in run-time and GPU memory. CasDiffMVS achieves state-of-the-art performance on DTU, Tanks & Temples and ETH3D benchmarks.

Conclusion: The integration of diffusion models into multi-view stereo frameworks significantly improves both efficiency and reconstruction quality, demonstrating the potential of diffusion-based approaches for 3D geometry reconstruction tasks.

Abstract: To reconstruct the 3D geometry from calibrated images, learning-based
multi-view stereo (MVS) methods typically perform multi-view depth estimation
and then fuse depth maps into a mesh or point cloud. To improve the
computational efficiency, many methods initialize a coarse depth map and then
gradually refine it in higher resolutions. Recently, diffusion models achieve
great success in generation tasks. Starting from a random noise, diffusion
models gradually recover the sample with an iterative denoising process. In
this paper, we propose a novel MVS framework, which introduces diffusion models
in MVS. Specifically, we formulate depth refinement as a conditional diffusion
process. Considering the discriminative characteristic of depth estimation, we
design a condition encoder to guide the diffusion process. To improve
efficiency, we propose a novel diffusion network combining lightweight 2D U-Net
and convolutional GRU. Moreover, we propose a novel confidence-based sampling
strategy to adaptively sample depth hypotheses based on the confidence
estimated by diffusion model. Based on our novel MVS framework, we propose two
novel MVS methods, DiffMVS and CasDiffMVS. DiffMVS achieves competitive
performance with state-of-the-art efficiency in run-time and GPU memory.
CasDiffMVS achieves state-of-the-art performance on DTU, Tanks & Temples and

Motivation: Event cameras excel in challenging environments but lack large datasets with dense depth annotations, hindering learning-based monocular depth estimation from event data.

Method: Propose cross-modal distillation paradigm leveraging Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to generate dense proxy labels. Use spatially aligned event streams and RGB frames, and adapt VFMs including Depth Anything v2 and a novel recurrent architecture for event-based depth inference.

Result: Evaluation on synthetic and real-world datasets shows competitive performance compared to fully supervised methods without requiring expensive depth annotations, and achieves state-of-the-art performance with VFM-based models.

Conclusion: The cross-modal distillation approach effectively addresses the annotation limitation for event camera depth estimation and demonstrates that VFM-based models can achieve superior performance in monocular depth estimation from event data.

Abstract: Event cameras capture sparse, high-temporal-resolution visual information,
making them particularly suitable for challenging environments with high-speed
motion and strongly varying lighting conditions. However, the lack of large
datasets with dense ground-truth depth annotations hinders learning-based
monocular depth estimation from event data. To address this limitation, we
propose a cross-modal distillation paradigm to generate dense proxy labels
leveraging a Vision Foundation Model (VFM). Our strategy requires an event
stream spatially aligned with RGB frames, a simple setup even available
off-the-shelf, and exploits the robustness of large-scale VFMs. Additionally,
we propose to adapt VFMs, either a vanilla one like Depth Anything v2 (DAv2),
or deriving from it a novel recurrent architecture to infer depth from
monocular event cameras. We evaluate our approach with synthetic and real-world
datasets, demonstrating that i) our cross-modal paradigm achieves competitive
performance compared to fully supervised methods without requiring expensive
depth annotations, and ii) our VFM-based models achieve state-of-the-art
performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CalibPrompt is a novel framework that calibrates Medical Vision-Language Models during prompt tuning to improve confidence estimation and prevent overconfident errors in medical imaging tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical Vision-Language Models show strong performance but their confidence calibration remains unexplored, leading to potentially dangerous overconfident errors that could undermine clinical trust and decision-making reliability.

Method: CalibPrompt optimizes learnable prompts with calibration objectives: 1) a regularizer aligning smoothed accuracy with predicted confidences, and 2) an angular separation loss to maximize textual feature proximity for better confidence estimates in multimodal Med-VLMs.

Result: Extensive experiments on four Med-VLMs and five medical imaging datasets show CalibPrompt consistently improves calibration without significantly affecting clean accuracy.

Conclusion: CalibPrompt effectively addresses the confidence calibration challenge in Med-VLMs through prompt tuning with specialized calibration objectives, enhancing reliability for clinical applications while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
performance across diverse medical imaging tasks by leveraging large-scale
image-text pretraining. However, their confidence calibration is largely
unexplored, and so remains a significant challenge. As such, miscalibrated
predictions can lead to overconfident errors, undermining clinical trust and
decision-making reliability. To address this, we introduce CalibPrompt, the
first framework to calibrate Med-VLMs during prompt tuning. CalibPrompt
optimizes a small set of learnable prompts with carefully designed calibration
objectives under scarce labeled data regime. First, we study a regularizer that
attempts to align the smoothed accuracy with the predicted model confidences.
Second, we introduce an angular separation loss to maximize textual feature
proximity toward improving the reliability in confidence estimates of
multimodal Med-VLMs. Extensive experiments on four publicly available Med-VLMs
and five diverse medical imaging datasets reveal that CalibPrompt consistently
improves calibration without drastically affecting clean accuracy. Our code is
