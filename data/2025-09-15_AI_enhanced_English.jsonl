While there has been extensive research in\napplying deep learning models to Alzheimer's prediction tasks, these models\nremain limited by lack of available labeled data, poor generalization across\ndatasets, and inflexibility to varying numbers of input scans and time\nintervals between scans. In this study, we adapt three state-of-the-art\ntemporal self-supervised learning (SSL) approaches for 3D brain MRI analysis,\nand add novel extensions designed to handle variable-length inputs and learn\nrobust spatial features. We aggregate four publicly available datasets\ncomprising 3,161 patients for pre-training, and show the performance of our\nmodel across multiple Alzheimer's prediction tasks including diagnosis\nclassification, conversion detection, and future conversion prediction.\nImportantly, our SSL model implemented with temporal order prediction and\ncontrastive learning outperforms supervised learning on six out of seven\ndownstream tasks. It demonstrates adaptability and generalizability across\ntasks and number of input images with varying time intervals, highlighting its\ncapacity for robust performance across clinical applications.
