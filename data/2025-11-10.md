### [1] [IndicVisionBench: Benchmarking Cultural and Multilingual Understanding in VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04727)
*Ali Faraz,Akash,Shaharukh Khan,Raja Kolla,Akshat Patidar,Suranjan Goswami,Abhinav Ravi,Chandra Khatri,Shubham Agarwal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IndicVisionBench is the first large-scale multimodal benchmark focused on the Indian subcontinent, covering 10 Indian languages and 3 tasks (OCR, MMT, VQA) to evaluate cultural and linguistic biases in vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language model benchmarks are Western-centric, leaving gaps in understanding performance across culturally diverse and multilingual settings, particularly for the Indian subcontinent.

Method: Created a benchmark with ~5K images and 37K+ QA pairs across 13 culturally grounded topics, covering English and 10 Indian languages. Evaluated 8 models including proprietary and open-weights systems.

Result: Experiments revealed substantial performance gaps, highlighting limitations of current VLMs in culturally diverse contexts.

Conclusion: IndicVisionBench establishes a reproducible evaluation framework for more inclusive multimodal research by centering cultural diversity and multilinguality.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive generalization
across multimodal tasks, yet most evaluation benchmarks remain Western-centric,
leaving open questions about their performance in culturally diverse and
multilingual settings. To address this gap, we introduce IndicVisionBench, the
first large-scale benchmark centered on the Indian subcontinent. Covering
English and 10 Indian languages, our benchmark spans 3 multimodal tasks,
including Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Multimodal Machine Translation
(MMT), and Visual Question Answering (VQA), covering 6 kinds of question types.
Our final benchmark consists of a total of ~5K images and 37K+ QA pairs across
13 culturally grounded topics. In addition, we release a paired parallel corpus
of annotations across 10 Indic languages, creating a unique resource for
analyzing cultural and linguistic biases in VLMs. We evaluate a broad spectrum
of 8 models, from proprietary closed-source systems to open-weights medium and
large-scale models. Our experiments reveal substantial performance gaps,
underscoring the limitations of current VLMs in culturally diverse contexts. By
centering cultural diversity and multilinguality, IndicVisionBench establishes
a reproducible evaluation framework that paves the way for more inclusive
multimodal research.

### [2] [Knowledge-based anomaly detection for identifying network-induced shape artifacts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04729)
*Rucha Deshpande,Tahsin Rahman,Miguel Lago,Adarsh Subbaswamy,Jana G. Delfino,Ghada Zamzmi,Elim Thompson,Aldo Badano,Seyed Kahaki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel knowledge-based anomaly detection method for identifying network-induced shape artifacts in synthetic medical images, using angle gradient analysis and isolation forests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Synthetic data helps address data scarcity but may introduce artifacts that compromise model performance and clinical utility, requiring quality assessment methods.

Method: Two-stage framework: (1) feature extractor analyzing per-image distribution of angle gradients along anatomical boundaries, (2) isolation forest-based anomaly detector.

Result: Achieved AUC values of 0.97 and 0.91 on two mammography datasets, with human reader agreement rates of 66% and 68% for most anomalous images, and Kendall-Tau correlations of 0.45 and 0.43.

Conclusion: The method enables responsible use of synthetic data by allowing developers to evaluate synthetic images against anatomical constraints and improve dataset quality.

Abstract: Synthetic data provides a promising approach to address data scarcity for
training machine learning models; however, adoption without proper quality
assessments may introduce artifacts, distortions, and unrealistic features that
compromise model performance and clinical utility. This work introduces a novel
knowledge-based anomaly detection method for detecting network-induced shape
artifacts in synthetic images. The introduced method utilizes a two-stage
framework comprising (i) a novel feature extractor that constructs a
specialized feature space by analyzing the per-image distribution of angle
gradients along anatomical boundaries, and (ii) an isolation forest-based
anomaly detector. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for
identifying network-induced shape artifacts in two synthetic mammography
datasets from models trained on CSAW-M and VinDr-Mammo patient datasets
respectively. Quantitative evaluation shows that the method successfully
concentrates artifacts in the most anomalous partition (1st percentile), with
AUC values of 0.97 (CSAW-syn) and 0.91 (VMLO-syn). In addition, a reader study
involving three imaging scientists confirmed that images identified by the
method as containing network-induced shape artifacts were also flagged by human
readers with mean agreement rates of 66% (CSAW-syn) and 68% (VMLO-syn) for the
most anomalous partition, approximately 1.5-2 times higher than the least
anomalous partition. Kendall-Tau correlations between algorithmic and human
rankings were 0.45 and 0.43 for the two datasets, indicating reasonable
agreement despite the challenging nature of subtle artifact detection. This
method is a step forward in the responsible use of synthetic data, as it allows
developers to evaluate synthetic images for known anatomic constraints and
pinpoint and address specific issues to improve the overall quality of a
synthetic dataset.

### [3] [CPO: Condition Preference Optimization for Controllable Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04753)
*Zonglin Lyu,Ming Li,Xinxin Liu,Chen Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Condition Preference Optimization (CPO) improves text-to-image controllability by performing preference learning over control conditions rather than generated images, eliminating confounding factors and achieving superior results over ControlNet++.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like ControlNet++ optimize only low-noise timesteps and introduce approximation errors, while Direct Preference Optimization struggles with ensuring win-lose image pairs differ only in controllability due to generative model uncertainty.

Method: CPO constructs winning and losing control signals (c^w and c^l) and trains the model to prefer c^w, eliminating confounding factors like image quality and providing a low-variance training objective.

Result: CPO achieves significant improvements: over 10% error rate reduction in segmentation, 70-80% in human pose, and consistent 2-5% reductions in edge and depth maps compared to ControlNet++.

Conclusion: CPO provides a more effective approach for improving controllability in text-to-image generation by optimizing over control conditions rather than generated images, with theoretical and empirical advantages over existing methods.

Abstract: To enhance controllability in text-to-image generation, ControlNet introduces
image-based control signals, while ControlNet++ improves pixel-level cycle
consistency between generated images and the input control signal. To avoid the
prohibitive cost of back-propagating through the sampling process, ControlNet++
optimizes only low-noise timesteps (e.g., $t < 200$) using a single-step
approximation, which not only ignores the contribution of high-noise timesteps
but also introduces additional approximation errors. A straightforward
alternative for optimizing controllability across all timesteps is Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), a fine-tuning method that increases model
preference for more controllable images ($I^{w}$) over less controllable ones
($I^{l}$). However, due to uncertainty in generative models, it is difficult to
ensure that win--lose image pairs differ only in controllability while keeping
other factors, such as image quality, fixed. To address this, we propose
performing preference learning over control conditions rather than generated
images. Specifically, we construct winning and losing control signals,
$\mathbf{c}^{w}$ and $\mathbf{c}^{l}$, and train the model to prefer
$\mathbf{c}^{w}$. This method, which we term \textit{Condition Preference
Optimization} (CPO), eliminates confounding factors and yields a low-variance
training objective. Our approach theoretically exhibits lower contrastive loss
variance than DPO and empirically achieves superior results. Moreover, CPO
requires less computation and storage for dataset curation. Extensive
experiments show that CPO significantly improves controllability over the
state-of-the-art ControlNet++ across multiple control types: over $10\%$ error
rate reduction in segmentation, $70$--$80\%$ in human pose, and consistent
$2$--$5\%$ reductions in edge and depth maps.

### [4] [DARN: Dynamic Adaptive Regularization Networks for Efficient and Robust Foundation Model Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04766)
*Dhenenjay Yadav,Rohan Sawai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DARN introduces dynamic adaptive regularization networks with task complexity prediction and adaptive dropout to handle heterogeneity in satellite imagery, achieving state-of-the-art performance in geospatial foundation model adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard adaptation methods for foundation models in geospatial analysis use fixed regularization strategies that fail to account for the significant heterogeneity in satellite imagery, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: DARN integrates three innovations: Task Complexity Predictor (TCP) for per-sample difficulty estimation, Adaptive Dropout Modulation (ADM) that dynamically adjusts dropout rates (0.1-0.5), and Dynamic Capacity Gating (DCG) for channel activation modulation.

Result: DARN achieves new SOTA on GeoBench (86.66% mIoU, +5.56 pp) in full fine-tuning and SOTA-competitive accuracy (90.5% mIoU) in efficient adaptation, with superior OOD generalization (+9.5 pp), enhanced robustness (17% corruption error reduction), and improved minority class performance.

Conclusion: DARN provides a more intelligent, robust, and efficient approach to leveraging foundation models in critical geospatial applications by dynamically adapting to task complexity and heterogeneity.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) offer powerful representations for geospatial
analysis, but adapting them effectively remains challenging. Standard
adaptation methods, whether full fine-tuning or efficient frozen-backbone
approaches, typically employ decoders with fixed regularization strategies,
failing to account for the significant heterogeneity in satellite imagery. We
introduce Dynamic Adaptive Regularization Networks (DARN), a novel decoder
architecture designed to address this limitation. DARN integrates three key
innovations: (1) a lightweight Task Complexity Predictor (TCP) that estimates
per-sample difficulty, (2) Adaptive Dropout Modulation (ADM), dynamically
adjusting dropout rates (from 0.1 to 0.5) based on predicted complexity, and
(3) Dynamic Capacity Gating (DCG) that modulates channel activation. We provide
theoretical justifications linking DARN's optimization to stationary point
convergence and its mechanism to adaptive information bottlenecks. Empirically,
DARN demonstrates exceptional performance across both major adaptation
paradigms. In full fine-tuning (unfrozen backbone), DARN achieves a new
state-of-the-art on the multi-task GeoBench benchmark (86.66% mIoU, +5.56 pp
over prior SOTA). In efficient adaptation (frozen backbone), DARN achieves
SOTA-competitive accuracy (90.5% mIoU on Sen1Floods11) while delivering
substantial advantages crucial for real-world deployment: superior
out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization (+9.5 pp mIoU on AI4SmallFarms),
enhanced robustness (17% relative reduction in corruption error), and improved
performance on minority classes. DARN offers a more intelligent, robust, and
efficient approach to leveraging FMs in critical geospatial applications.

### [5] [Global 3D Reconstruction of Clouds & Tropical Cyclones](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04773)
*Shirin Ermis,Cesar Aybar,Lilli Freischem,Stella Girtsou,Kyriaki-Margarita Bintsi,Emiliano Diaz Salas-Porras,Michael Eisinger,William Jones,Anna Jungbluth,Benoit Tremblay*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new framework using pre-training and fine-tuning to create 3D cloud maps from 2D satellite imagery, specifically for tropical cyclones, enabling accurate reconstruction of intense storm structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tropical cyclone forecasting is challenging due to limited satellite observations of TC structure and difficulties in resolving cloud properties involved in intensification.

Method: Pre-training--fine-tuning pipeline that learns from multiple satellites with global coverage to translate 2D satellite imagery into 3D cloud maps of relevant cloud properties, applied to a custom-built TC dataset.

Result: First-ever creation of global instantaneous 3D cloud maps and accurate reconstruction of 3D structure of intense storms, extending available satellite observations and providing estimates when observations are missing.

Conclusion: This approach is crucial for advancing understanding of TC intensification and improving forecasts by providing comprehensive 3D cloud structure data.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of tropical cyclones (TCs) remains challenging due to
limited satellite observations probing TC structure and difficulties in
resolving cloud properties involved in TC intensification. Recent research has
demonstrated the capabilities of machine learning methods for 3D cloud
reconstruction from satellite observations. However, existing approaches have
been restricted to regions where TCs are uncommon, and are poorly validated for
intense storms. We introduce a new framework, based on a
pre-training--fine-tuning pipeline, that learns from multiple satellites with
global coverage to translate 2D satellite imagery into 3D cloud maps of
relevant cloud properties. We apply our model to a custom-built TC dataset to
evaluate performance in the most challenging and relevant conditions. We show
that we can - for the first time - create global instantaneous 3D cloud maps
and accurately reconstruct the 3D structure of intense storms. Our model not
only extends available satellite observations but also provides estimates when
observations are missing entirely. This is crucial for advancing our
understanding of TC intensification and improving forecasts.

### [6] [EETnet: a CNN for Gaze Detection and Tracking for Smart-Eyewear](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04779)
*Andrea Aspesi,Andrea Simpsi,Aaron Tognoli,Simone Mentasti,Luca Merigo,Matteo Matteucci*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EETnet is a CNN for event-based eye tracking that can run on microcontrollers, with classification and regression versions for pupil detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing event-based eye tracking solutions require powerful GPUs and lack deployment on embedded devices with limited resources.

Method: Developed EETnet CNN using purely event-based data, with training/evaluation/quantization methodology and two architectures: grid-based classification and pixel-level regression.

Result: Created a network capable of running on microcontrollers with limited resources for efficient, low-power eye tracking.

Conclusion: EETnet enables practical deployment of event-based eye tracking on embedded devices, addressing the gap between research validation and real-world applications.

Abstract: Event-based cameras are becoming a popular solution for efficient, low-power
eye tracking. Due to the sparse and asynchronous nature of event data, they
require less processing power and offer latencies in the microsecond range.
However, many existing solutions are limited to validation on powerful GPUs,
with no deployment on real embedded devices. In this paper, we present EETnet,
a convolutional neural network designed for eye tracking using purely
event-based data, capable of running on microcontrollers with limited
resources. Additionally, we outline a methodology to train, evaluate, and
quantize the network using a public dataset. Finally, we propose two versions
of the architecture: a classification model that detects the pupil on a grid
superimposed on the original image, and a regression model that operates at the
pixel level.

### [7] [3D Gaussian Point Encoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04797)
*Jim James,Ben Wilson,Simon Lucey,James Hays*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3D Gaussian Point Encoder is an explicit per-point embedding using learned 3D Gaussians, offering faster and more efficient 3D recognition compared to traditional PointNets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move from implicit representations like PointNet to explicit geometric representations for 3D recognition tasks, similar to the shift from NeRF to Gaussian Splatting in 3D reconstruction.

Method: Develop optimization techniques using natural gradients and distillation from PointNets to learn Gaussian Basis that reconstructs PointNet activations, and extend filtering techniques from 3D Gaussian Splatting.

Result: The encoder runs 2.7x faster than comparable PointNet with 46% less memory and 88% fewer FLOPs, and in Mamba3D achieves 1.27x speedup with 42% memory and 54% FLOP reduction.

Conclusion: 3D Gaussian Point Encoders provide efficient explicit geometric representation for 3D recognition, enabling high framerates even on CPU-only devices.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the 3D Gaussian Point Encoder, an explicit
per-point embedding built on mixtures of learned 3D Gaussians. This explicit
geometric representation for 3D recognition tasks is a departure from widely
used implicit representations such as PointNet. However, it is difficult to
learn 3D Gaussian encoders in end-to-end fashion with standard optimizers. We
develop optimization techniques based on natural gradients and distillation
from PointNets to find a Gaussian Basis that can reconstruct PointNet
activations. The resulting 3D Gaussian Point Encoders are faster and more
parameter efficient than traditional PointNets. As in the 3D reconstruction
literature where there has been considerable interest in the move from implicit
(e.g., NeRF) to explicit (e.g., Gaussian Splatting) representations, we can
take advantage of computational geometry heuristics to accelerate 3D Gaussian
Point Encoders further. We extend filtering techniques from 3D Gaussian
Splatting to construct encoders that run 2.7 times faster as a comparable
accuracy PointNet while using 46% less memory and 88% fewer FLOPs. Furthermore,
we demonstrate the effectiveness of 3D Gaussian Point Encoders as a component
in Mamba3D, running 1.27 times faster and achieving a reduction in memory and
FLOPs by 42% and 54% respectively. 3D Gaussian Point Encoders are lightweight
enough to achieve high framerates on CPU-only devices.

### [8] [Data Efficiency and Transfer Robustness in Biomedical Image Segmentation: A Study of Redundancy and Forgetting with Cellpose](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04803)
*Shuo Zhao,Jianxu Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper analyzes data redundancy and catastrophic forgetting in biomedical image segmentation using Cellpose, showing that only 10% of training data is needed for performance saturation and proposing dataset quantization strategies to mitigate forgetting during cross-domain transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address two underexplored challenges in generalist biomedical image segmentation models: training data redundancy and the impact of cross-domain transfer on model retention (catastrophic forgetting).

Method: Used Cellpose as a case study with systematic empirical analysis including: (1) dataset quantization (DQ) strategy for constructing compact diverse training subsets, (2) cross-domain finetuning experiments to examine catastrophic forgetting, (3) selective DQ-based replay with 5-10% source data, and (4) training domain sequencing analysis.

Result: Image segmentation performance saturates with only 10% of data, revealing substantial redundancy. Cross-domain finetuning causes significant source domain degradation, especially from generalist to specialist domains. Selective DQ replay with 5-10% source data effectively restores source performance while full replay hinders target adaptation. Training domain sequencing improves generalization and reduces forgetting.

Conclusion: Efficient biomedical image segmentation requires data-centric design with compact subsets, retention-aware learning strategies, and informed domain ordering to address both data redundancy and catastrophic forgetting challenges.

Abstract: Generalist biomedical image segmentation models such as Cellpose are
increasingly applied across diverse imaging modalities and cell types. However,
two critical challenges remain underexplored: (1) the extent of training data
redundancy and (2) the impact of cross domain transfer on model retention. In
this study, we conduct a systematic empirical analysis of these challenges
using Cellpose as a case study. First, to assess data redundancy, we propose a
simple dataset quantization (DQ) strategy for constructing compact yet diverse
training subsets. Experiments on the Cyto dataset show that image segmentation
performance saturates with only 10% of the data, revealing substantial
redundancy and potential for training with minimal annotations. Latent space
analysis using MAE embeddings and t-SNE confirms that DQ selected patches
capture greater feature diversity than random sampling. Second, to examine
catastrophic forgetting, we perform cross domain finetuning experiments and
observe significant degradation in source domain performance, particularly when
adapting from generalist to specialist domains. We demonstrate that selective
DQ based replay reintroducing just 5-10% of the source data effectively
restores source performance, while full replay can hinder target adaptation.
Additionally, we find that training domain sequencing improves generalization
and reduces forgetting in multi stage transfer. Our findings highlight the
importance of data centric design in biomedical image segmentation and suggest
that efficient training requires not only compact subsets but also retention
aware learning strategies and informed domain ordering. The code is available
at https://github.com/MMV-Lab/biomedseg-efficiency.

### [9] [An Active Learning Pipeline for Biomedical Image Instance Segmentation with Minimal Human Intervention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04811)
*Shuo Zhao,Yu Zhou,Jianxu Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A data-centric AI workflow combining foundation models and nnU-Net with active learning and pseudo-labeling to reduce manual annotation requirements in biomedical image segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of traditional methods (noise sensitivity), nnU-Net (requires extensive annotated data), and foundation models (underperformance on domain-specific datasets) in biomedical image segmentation.

Method: Pipeline that generates pseudo-labels from foundation models for nnU-Net self-configuration, then selects representative core-set for minimal manual annotation to fine-tune nnU-Net.

Result: Significantly reduces need for manual annotations while maintaining competitive segmentation performance.

Conclusion: Provides accessible solution for biomedical researchers to apply state-of-the-art AI techniques with minimal human intervention.

Abstract: Biomedical image segmentation is critical for precise structure delineation
and downstream analysis. Traditional methods often struggle with noisy data,
while deep learning models such as U-Net have set new benchmarks in
segmentation performance. nnU-Net further automates model configuration, making
it adaptable across datasets without extensive tuning. However, it requires a
substantial amount of annotated data for cross-validation, posing a challenge
when only raw images but no labels are available. Large foundation models offer
zero-shot generalizability, but may underperform on specific datasets with
unique characteristics, limiting their direct use for analysis. This work
addresses these bottlenecks by proposing a data-centric AI workflow that
leverages active learning and pseudo-labeling to combine the strengths of
traditional neural networks and large foundation models while minimizing human
intervention. The pipeline starts by generating pseudo-labels from a foundation
model, which are then used for nnU-Net's self-configuration. Subsequently, a
representative core-set is selected for minimal manual annotation, enabling
effective fine-tuning of the nnU-Net model. This approach significantly reduces
the need for manual annotations while maintaining competitive performance,
providing an accessible solution for biomedical researchers to apply
state-of-the-art AI techniques in their segmentation tasks. The code is
available at https://github.com/MMV-Lab/AL_BioMed_img_seg.

### [10] [Geometry Denoising with Preferred Normal Vectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04848)
*Manuel Weiß,Lukas Baumgärtner,Roland Herzog,Stephan Schmidt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new geometry denoising method using surface normal priors and embedded segmentation via label vectors, solved with split Bregman optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage prior knowledge about surface normal vectors for more effective geometry denoising while naturally incorporating segmentation.

Method: Uses preferred normal vectors (label vectors) for segmentation based on normal similarity, with total variation regularization, solved via split Bregman (ADMM) approach and vertex updates using second-order shape calculus.

Result: Proposes a novel denoising paradigm that simultaneously performs denoising and segmentation based on normal vector similarity.

Conclusion: The method effectively integrates prior normal knowledge into geometry denoising while embedding segmentation, providing a unified approach to surface processing.

Abstract: We introduce a new paradigm for geometry denoising using prior knowledge
about the surface normal vector. This prior knowledge comes in the form of a
set of preferred normal vectors, which we refer to as label vectors. A
segmentation problem is naturally embedded in the denoising process. The
segmentation is based on the similarity of the normal vector to the elements of
the set of label vectors. Regularization is achieved by a total variation term.
We formulate a split Bregman (ADMM) approach to solve the resulting
optimization problem. The vertex update step is based on second-order shape
calculus.

### [11] [Self-Supervised Implicit Attention Priors for Point Cloud Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04864)
*Kyle Fogarty,Chenyue Cai,Jing Yang,Zhilin Guo,Cengiz Öztireli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An implicit self-prior approach that learns shape-specific priors directly from input point clouds using cross-attention with learnable embeddings, combined with RIMLS for high-fidelity surface reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recovering high-quality surfaces from irregular point clouds is ill-posed without strong geometric priors, and existing methods often require external training data.

Method: Joint training of a dictionary of learnable embeddings with an implicit distance field using cross-attention, followed by dense point sampling and integration with robust implicit moving least squares (RIMLS).

Result: Outperforms both classical and learning-based approaches in generating high-fidelity surfaces with superior detail preservation and robustness to data degradations.

Conclusion: The self-prior approach effectively captures shape-specific patterns without external data, enabling high-quality surface reconstruction from irregular point clouds.

Abstract: Recovering high-quality surfaces from irregular point cloud is ill-posed
unless strong geometric priors are available. We introduce an implicit
self-prior approach that distills a shape-specific prior directly from the
input point cloud itself and embeds it within an implicit neural
representation. This is achieved by jointly training a small dictionary of
learnable embeddings with an implicit distance field; at every query location,
the field attends to the dictionary via cross-attention, enabling the network
to capture and reuse repeating structures and long-range correlations inherent
to the shape. Optimized solely with self-supervised point cloud reconstruction
losses, our approach requires no external training data. To effectively
integrate this learned prior while preserving input fidelity, the trained field
is then sampled to extract densely distributed points and analytic normals via
automatic differentiation. We integrate the resulting dense point cloud and
corresponding normals into a robust implicit moving least squares (RIMLS)
formulation. We show this hybrid strategy preserves fine geometric details in
the input data, while leveraging the learned prior to regularize sparse
regions. Experiments show that our method outperforms both classical and
learning-based approaches in generating high-fidelity surfaces with superior
detail preservation and robustness to common data degradations.

### [12] [Clinical-ComBAT: a diffusion-weighted MRI harmonization method for clinical applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04871)
*Gabriel Girard,Manon Edde,Félix Dumais,Yoan David,Matthieu Dumont,Guillaume Theaud,Jean-Christophe Houde,Arnaud Boré,Maxime Descoteaux,Pierre-Marc Jodoin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Clinical-ComBAT is a flexible harmonization method for diffusion-weighted MRI data that addresses limitations of traditional ComBAT by enabling independent site harmonization, non-linear modeling, and adaptability to small clinical cohorts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard ComBAT method has limitations for clinical use due to its reliance on linear relationships, homogeneous populations, fixed site numbers, and well-populated sites, which don't align with real-world clinical scenarios.

Method: Clinical-ComBAT harmonizes each site independently using non-linear polynomial data model, site-specific harmonization referenced to a normative site, variance priors for small cohorts, hyperparameter tuning, and goodness-of-fit metrics.

Result: The method shows improved alignment of diffusion metrics and enhanced applicability for normative modeling on both simulated and real data.

Conclusion: Clinical-ComBAT provides an effective solution for harmonizing DW-MRI data in clinical settings, overcoming the limitations of traditional ComBAT while maintaining flexibility for new data and clinics.

Abstract: Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) derived scalar maps
are effective for assessing neurodegenerative diseases and microstructural
properties of white matter in large number of brain conditions. However, DW-MRI
inherently limits the combination of data from multiple acquisition sites
without harmonization to mitigate scanner-specific biases. While the widely
used ComBAT method reduces site effects in research, its reliance on linear
covariate relationships, homogeneous populations, fixed site numbers, and well
populated sites constrains its clinical use. To overcome these limitations, we
propose Clinical-ComBAT, a method designed for real-world clinical scenarios.
Clinical-ComBAT harmonizes each site independently, enabling flexibility as new
data and clinics are introduced. It incorporates a non-linear polynomial data
model, site-specific harmonization referenced to a normative site, and variance
priors adaptable to small cohorts. It further includes hyperparameter tuning
and a goodness-of-fit metric for harmonization assessment. We demonstrate its
effectiveness on simulated and real data, showing improved alignment of
diffusion metrics and enhanced applicability for normative modeling.

### [13] [Validating Vision Transformers for Otoscopy: Performance and Data-Leakage Effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04872)
*James Ndubuisi,Fernando Auat,Marta Vallejo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision transformers (Swin) showed initial high accuracy for ear disease diagnosis but performance dropped significantly after fixing data leakage issues, highlighting the importance of rigorous data preprocessing in medical ML.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve diagnostic accuracy for ear diseases given the 27% misdiagnosis rate among otolaryngologists, by comparing vision transformers with traditional CNNs.

Method: Used Swin v1 and Swin v2 transformer models on otoscopic video frames from a Chilean hospital dataset, with frames selected using Laplacian and Shannon entropy thresholds and blank frames removed.

Result: Initial accuracies were 100% (Swin v1) and 99.1% (Swin v2), outperforming ResNet (99.5%). After fixing data leakage, accuracies dropped to 83% for both Swin models and 82% for ResNet.

Conclusion: Vision transformers show promise but rigorous data handling is crucial. Optimal balance between advanced architectures and effective preprocessing is key for reliable medical diagnosis models.

Abstract: This study evaluates the efficacy of vision transformer models, specifically
Swin transformers, in enhancing the diagnostic accuracy of ear diseases
compared to traditional convolutional neural networks. With a reported 27%
misdiagnosis rate among specialist otolaryngologists, improving diagnostic
accuracy is crucial. The research utilised a real-world dataset from the
Department of Otolaryngology at the Clinical Hospital of the Universidad de
Chile, comprising otoscopic videos of ear examinations depicting various middle
and external ear conditions. Frames were selected based on the Laplacian and
Shannon entropy thresholds, with blank frames removed. Initially, Swin v1 and
Swin v2 transformer models achieved accuracies of 100% and 99.1%, respectively,
marginally outperforming the ResNet model (99.5%). These results surpassed
metrics reported in related studies. However, the evaluation uncovered a
critical data leakage issue in the preprocessing step, affecting both this
study and related research using the same raw dataset. After mitigating the
data leakage, model performance decreased significantly. Corrected accuracies
were 83% for both Swin v1 and Swin v2, and 82% for the ResNet model. This
finding highlights the importance of rigorous data handling in machine learning
studies, especially in medical applications. The findings indicate that while
vision transformers show promise, it is essential to find an optimal balance
between the benefits of advanced model architectures and those derived from
effective data preprocessing. This balance is key to developing a reliable
machine learning model for diagnosing ear diseases.

### [14] [Beta Distribution Learning for Reliable Roadway Crash Risk Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04886)
*Ahmad Elallaf,Nathan Jacobs,Xinyue Ye,Mei Chen,Gongbo Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A geospatial deep learning framework using satellite imagery to predict fatal crash risks with uncertainty-aware Beta probability distributions, achieving 17-23% recall improvement over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional traffic safety studies examine risk factors in isolation and conventional neural networks provide point estimates without uncertainty, limiting their utility in critical decision-making for roadway safety.

Method: Leverages satellite imagery as comprehensive spatial input to capture nuanced spatial patterns and environmental risk factors, estimating full Beta probability distributions over fatal crash risk rather than deterministic outputs.

Result: Outperforms baselines with 17-23% improvement in recall (key for flagging potential dangers) and delivers superior calibration, providing reliable and interpretable risk assessments from satellite imagery alone.

Conclusion: Enables safer autonomous navigation and offers a highly scalable tool for urban planners and policymakers to enhance roadway safety equitably and cost-effectively through uncertainty-aware predictions.

Abstract: Roadway traffic accidents represent a global health crisis, responsible for
over a million deaths annually and costing many countries up to 3% of their
GDP. Traditional traffic safety studies often examine risk factors in
isolation, overlooking the spatial complexity and contextual interactions
inherent in the built environment. Furthermore, conventional Neural
Network-based risk estimators typically generate point estimates without
conveying model uncertainty, limiting their utility in critical
decision-making. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a novel geospatial
deep learning framework that leverages satellite imagery as a comprehensive
spatial input. This approach enables the model to capture the nuanced spatial
patterns and embedded environmental risk factors that contribute to fatal crash
risks. Rather than producing a single deterministic output, our model estimates
a full Beta probability distribution over fatal crash risk, yielding accurate
and uncertainty-aware predictions--a critical feature for trustworthy AI in
safety-critical applications. Our model outperforms baselines by achieving a
17-23% improvement in recall, a key metric for flagging potential dangers,
while delivering superior calibration. By providing reliable and interpretable
risk assessments from satellite imagery alone, our method enables safer
autonomous navigation and offers a highly scalable tool for urban planners and
policymakers to enhance roadway safety equitably and cost-effectively.

### [15] [Learning to Restore Multi-Degraded Images via Ingredient Decoupling and Task-Aware Path Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04920)
*Hu Gao,Xiaoning Lei,Ying Zhang,Xichen Xu,Guannan Jiang,Lizhuang Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes IMDNet, an adaptive multi-degradation image restoration network that uses decoupled degradation representations to dynamically select optimal restoration paths for handling multiple coexisting degradations like rain, noise, and haze.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing image restoration methods focus on single degradation types, but real-world images often suffer from multiple coexisting degradations, limiting practical effectiveness.

Method: Uses degradation ingredient decoupling blocks (DIDBlock) to separate degradation ingredients statistically by integrating spatial and frequency domain information, fusion blocks (FBlock) to integrate degradation information, and task adaptation blocks (TABlock) to dynamically activate/fuse functional branches based on multi-degradation representations.

Result: Extensive experiments show superior performance on multi-degradation restoration while maintaining strong competitiveness on single-degradation tasks.

Conclusion: IMDNet provides an effective tightly integrated architecture for handling multiple coexisting degradations in real-world image restoration scenarios.

Abstract: Image restoration (IR) aims to recover clean images from degraded
observations. Despite remarkable progress, most existing methods focus on a
single degradation type, whereas real-world images often suffer from multiple
coexisting degradations, such as rain, noise, and haze coexisting in a single
image, which limits their practical effectiveness. In this paper, we propose an
adaptive multi-degradation image restoration network that reconstructs images
by leveraging decoupled representations of degradation ingredients to guide
path selection. Specifically, we design a degradation ingredient decoupling
block (DIDBlock) in the encoder to separate degradation ingredients
statistically by integrating spatial and frequency domain information,
enhancing the recognition of multiple degradation types and making their
feature representations independent. In addition, we present fusion block
(FBlock) to integrate degradation information across all levels using learnable
matrices. In the decoder, we further introduce a task adaptation block
(TABlock) that dynamically activates or fuses functional branches based on the
multi-degradation representation, flexibly selecting optimal restoration paths
under diverse degradation conditions. The resulting tightly integrated
architecture, termed IMDNet, is extensively validated through experiments,
showing superior performance on multi-degradation restoration while maintaining
strong competitiveness on single-degradation tasks.

Abstract: The advancement of artificial intelligence in oral healthcare relies on the
availability of large-scale multimodal datasets that capture the complexity of
clinical practice. In this paper, we present a comprehensive multimodal

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel deep learning framework using high-dimensional latent space representations and Multi-Agent Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (MAARL) for robust and adaptive deepfake watermarking that balances robustness against benign distortions with sensitivity to malicious tampering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of existing passive deepfake detectors that struggle to generalize to new deepfake types, and improve proactive detection using watermarks by better balancing robustness and fragility.

Method: Developed a learnable watermark embedder operating in latent space, combined with MAARL paradigm where a watermarking agent interacts with adversarial attacker agent simulating benign and malicious manipulations.

Result: Outperformed state-of-the-art approaches with improvements of over 4.5% on CelebA and more than 5.3% on CelebA-HQ under challenging manipulation scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides an effective solution for robust deepfake detection through adaptive watermarking that maintains the delicate balance between resilience to benign distortions and sensitivity to malicious tampering.

Abstract: Rapid advances in generative AI have led to increasingly realistic deepfakes,
posing growing challenges for law enforcement and public trust. Existing
passive deepfake detectors struggle to keep pace, largely due to their
dependence on specific forgery artifacts, which limits their ability to
generalize to new deepfake types. Proactive deepfake detection using watermarks
has emerged to address the challenge of identifying high-quality synthetic
media. However, these methods often struggle to balance robustness against
benign distortions with sensitivity to malicious tampering. This paper
introduces a novel deep learning framework that harnesses high-dimensional
latent space representations and the Multi-Agent Adversarial Reinforcement
Learning (MAARL) paradigm to develop a robust and adaptive watermarking
approach. Specifically, we develop a learnable watermark embedder that operates
in the latent space, capturing high-level image semantics, while offering
precise control over message encoding and extraction. The MAARL paradigm
empowers the learnable watermarking agent to pursue an optimal balance between
robustness and fragility by interacting with a dynamic curriculum of benign and
malicious image manipulations simulated by an adversarial attacker agent.
Comprehensive evaluations on the CelebA and CelebA-HQ benchmarks reveal that
our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving
improvements of over 4.5% on CelebA and more than 5.3% on CelebA-HQ under
challenging manipulation scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLM enables 3D Gaussian Splatting to render large scenes on consumer GPUs by offloading Gaussians to CPU memory and using pipelining to overlap communication and computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting has high memory requirements that exceed GPU capacity for large scenes, limiting its practical use on consumer hardware.

Method: Uses CPU memory offloading with pipelining strategy to overlap GPU-CPU communication, GPU computation, and CPU computation while reducing communication volume through access pattern analysis.

Result: Can render scenes with 100 million Gaussians on a single RTX4090 while achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction quality.

Conclusion: CLM successfully enables large-scale 3DGS rendering on consumer GPUs through efficient memory management and pipelining techniques.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is an increasingly popular novel view synthesis
approach due to its fast rendering time, and high-quality output. However,
scaling 3DGS to large (or intricate) scenes is challenging due to its large
memory requirement, which exceed most GPU's memory capacity. In this paper, we
describe CLM, a system that allows 3DGS to render large scenes using a single
consumer-grade GPU, e.g., RTX4090. It does so by offloading Gaussians to CPU
memory, and loading them into GPU memory only when necessary. To reduce
performance and communication overheads, CLM uses a novel offloading strategy
that exploits observations about 3DGS's memory access pattern for pipelining,
and thus overlap GPU-to-CPU communication, GPU computation and CPU computation.
Furthermore, we also exploit observation about the access pattern to reduce
communication volume. Our evaluation shows that the resulting implementation
can render a large scene that requires 100 million Gaussians on a single
RTX4090 and achieve state-of-the-art reconstruction quality.

TL;DR: PDS is a novel method for synthesizing missing fMRI and dMRI modalities using a pattern-aware dual-modal 3D diffusion framework with tissue refinement, achieving state-of-the-art performance in neurodegenerative disease diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Missing MRI modalities (fMRI and dMRI) pose a major barrier for clinical use in neurodegenerative disease studies. Existing GAN and diffusion models struggle with fMRI-dMRI synthesis due to significant signal differences and inadequate integration of disease-related neuroanatomical patterns.

Method: Proposes PDS with two innovations: (1) pattern-aware dual-modal 3D diffusion framework for cross-modality learning, and (2) tissue refinement network with efficient microstructure refinement to maintain structural fidelity and fine details.

Result: Achieves PSNR/SSIM scores of 29.83 dB/90.84% for fMRI synthesis (+1.54 dB/+4.12% over baselines) and 30.00 dB/77.55% for dMRI synthesis (+1.02 dB/+2.2%). Clinical validation shows 67.92%/66.02%/64.15% accuracy for NC vs. MCI vs. AD classification in hybrid real-synthetic experiments.

Conclusion: PDS provides state-of-the-art modality completion for fMRI and dMRI, enabling improved neurodegenerative disease diagnosis through high-quality synthesized data that maintains structural fidelity and integrates disease patterns.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), especially functional MRI (fMRI) and
diffusion MRI (dMRI), is essential for studying neurodegenerative diseases.
However, missing modalities pose a major barrier to their clinical use.
Although GAN- and diffusion model-based approaches have shown some promise in
modality completion, they remain limited in fMRI-dMRI synthesis due to (1)
significant BOLD vs. diffusion-weighted signal differences between fMRI and
dMRI in time/gradient axis, and (2) inadequate integration of disease-related
neuroanatomical patterns during generation. To address these challenges, we
propose PDS, introducing two key innovations: (1) a pattern-aware dual-modal 3D
diffusion framework for cross-modality learning, and (2) a tissue refinement
network integrated with a efficient microstructure refinement to maintain
structural fidelity and fine details. Evaluated on OASIS-3, ADNI, and in-house
datasets, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, with PSNR/SSIM scores
of 29.83 dB/90.84\% for fMRI synthesis (+1.54 dB/+4.12\% over baselines) and
30.00 dB/77.55\% for dMRI synthesis (+1.02 dB/+2.2\%). In clinical validation,
the synthesized data show strong diagnostic performance, achieving
67.92\%/66.02\%/64.15\% accuracy (NC vs. MCI vs. AD) in hybrid real-synthetic

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework to probe DNNs' geometric understanding using optimized shapes as semantic carriers, interpretability tools, and adversarial examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks have primarily focused on texture understanding, leaving their geometric understanding poorly explored. The paper aims to investigate how DNNs process and understand geometric information.

Method: An end-to-end differentiable framework that combines Fourier series parameterization of arbitrary shapes, winding number-based pixel grid mapping, and signal energy constraints for efficient optimization of physically plausible shapes.

Result: Optimized shapes can: 1) generate high-confidence classifications from purely geometric inputs, 2) serve as precise interpretability tools to isolate model's salient regions, and 3) create generalizable adversarial examples that deceive downstream visual tasks.

Conclusion: The work provides a versatile framework for exploring the geometric world of DNNs and opens new frontiers for challenging and understanding machine perception through geometric analysis.

Abstract: While both shape and texture are fundamental to visual recognition, research
on deep neural networks (DNNs) has predominantly focused on the latter, leaving
their geometric understanding poorly probed. Here, we show: first, that
optimized shapes can act as potent semantic carriers, generating
high-confidence classifications from inputs defined purely by their geometry;
second, that they are high-fidelity interpretability tools that precisely
isolate a model's salient regions; and third, that they constitute a new,
generalizable adversarial paradigm capable of deceiving downstream visual
tasks. This is achieved through an end-to-end differentiable framework that
unifies a powerful Fourier series to parameterize arbitrary shapes, a winding
number-based mapping to translate them into the pixel grid required by DNNs,
and signal energy constraints that enhance optimization efficiency while
ensuring physically plausible shapes. Our work provides a versatile framework
for probing the geometric world of DNNs and opens new frontiers for challenging
and understanding machine perception.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel method for generating labeled 3D datasets with controlled topological invariants to address the lack of suitable data for training neural network-based topological data analysis estimators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional TDA methods like persistent homology are computationally demanding, and there's a lack of labeled 3D data with proper class distributions and diversity for supervised learning in TDA tasks.

Method: Systematically generate labeled 3D datasets using the Repulsive Surface algorithm to control topological invariants (e.g., hole count), then train a genus estimator network using a 3D convolutional transformer architecture.

Result: The synthetic dataset enables training of neural network estimators, with observed decrease in accuracy as deformations increase, highlighting the importance of both topological and geometric complexity for generalized estimators.

Conclusion: The introduced dataset fills a critical gap in labeled 3D datasets for training and evaluating TDA models and techniques, addressing computational challenges in traditional methods.

Abstract: Topological Data Analysis (TDA) involves techniques of analyzing the
underlying structure and connectivity of data. However, traditional methods
like persistent homology can be computationally demanding, motivating the
development of neural network-based estimators capable of reducing
computational overhead and inference time. A key barrier to advancing these
methods is the lack of labeled 3D data with class distributions and diversity
tailored specifically for supervised learning in TDA tasks. To address this, we
introduce a novel approach for systematically generating labeled 3D datasets
using the Repulsive Surface algorithm, allowing control over topological
invariants, such as hole count. The resulting dataset offers varied geometry
with topological labeling, making it suitable for training and benchmarking
neural network estimators. This paper uses a synthetic 3D dataset to train a
genus estimator network, created using a 3D convolutional transformer
architecture. An observed decrease in accuracy as deformations increase
highlights the role of not just topological complexity, but also geometric
complexity, when training generalized estimators. This dataset fills a gap in
labeled 3D datasets and generation for training and evaluating models and
techniques for TDA.

Motivation: Stickers are popular for visual communication but their semantic relationships are challenging to understand due to diverse and symbolic content, requiring specialized tools for analysis.

Method: Created Triple-S benchmark with 905 human-annotated sticker pairs, then developed General Sticker Encoder (GSE) - a lightweight model that learns robust embeddings using Triple-S and additional datasets.

Result: GSE achieves superior performance on unseen stickers and strong results on downstream tasks like emotion classification and sticker-to-sticker retrieval, outperforming existing pretrained vision/multimodal models.

Conclusion: The released Triple-S benchmark and GSE model provide standardized evaluation tools and robust embeddings to enable future research in sticker understanding, retrieval, and multimodal content generation.

Abstract: Stickers have become a popular form of visual communication, yet
understanding their semantic relationships remains challenging due to their
highly diverse and symbolic content. In this work, we formally {define the
Sticker Semantic Similarity task} and introduce {Triple-S}, the first benchmark
for this task, consisting of 905 human-annotated positive and negative sticker
pairs. Through extensive evaluation, we show that existing pretrained vision
and multimodal models struggle to capture nuanced sticker semantics. To address
this, we propose the {General Sticker Encoder (GSE)}, a lightweight and
versatile model that learns robust sticker embeddings using both Triple-S and
additional datasets. GSE achieves superior performance on unseen stickers, and
demonstrates strong results on downstream tasks such as emotion classification
and sticker-to-sticker retrieval. By releasing both Triple-S and GSE, we
provide standardized evaluation tools and robust embeddings, enabling future
research in sticker understanding, retrieval, and multimodal content
generation. The Triple-S benchmark and GSE have been publicly released and are

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inherent bias in LVLM architectures toward language modality caused by simply appending visual embeddings to text sequences.

Method: Refine textual embeddings by integrating average-pooled visual features as a simple yet effective fusion approach.

Result: Demonstrably improves visual grounding and significantly reduces hallucinations on established benchmarks.

Conclusion: Visual information integration mitigates modality imbalance issues; more sophisticated fusion methods could further enhance performance but are left for future work.

Abstract: In this work, we identify an inherent bias in prevailing LVLM architectures
toward the language modality, largely resulting from the common practice of
simply appending visual embeddings to the input text sequence. To address this,
we propose a simple yet effective method that refines textual embeddings by
integrating average-pooled visual features. Our approach demonstrably improves
visual grounding and significantly reduces hallucinations on established
benchmarks. While average pooling offers a straightforward, robust, and
efficient means of incorporating visual information, we believe that more
sophisticated fusion methods could further enhance visual grounding and
cross-modal alignment. Given that the primary focus of this work is to
highlight the modality imbalance and its impact on hallucinations -- and to
show that refining textual embeddings with visual information mitigates this
issue -- we leave exploration of advanced fusion strategies for future work.

TL;DR: Proposes DRE-SLCL method for end-to-end Whole Slide Image representation using dynamic residual encoding with slide-level contrastive learning to handle gigapixel slides with thousands of tiles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training end-to-end WSI models is challenging due to GPU limitations in processing tens of thousands of image tiles from gigapixel slides in a single mini-batch.

Method: Uses memory bank to store tile features across dataset, samples subset of tiles per WSI, retrieves additional features from memory bank, applies residual encoding to generate WSI representation, and computes slide-level contrastive loss using histopathology reports.

Result: Experiments show effectiveness on cancer subtyping, cancer recognition, and mutation prediction tasks.

Conclusion: DRE-SLCL method successfully addresses computational challenges in end-to-end WSI representation learning and proves effective across multiple cancer analysis tasks.

Abstract: Whole Slide Image (WSI) representation is critical for cancer subtyping,
cancer recognition and mutation prediction.Training an end-to-end WSI
representation model poses significant challenges, as a standard gigapixel
slide can contain tens of thousands of image tiles, making it difficult to
compute gradients of all tiles in a single mini-batch due to current GPU
limitations. To address this challenge, we propose a method of dynamic residual
encoding with slide-level contrastive learning (DRE-SLCL) for end-to-end WSI
representation. Our approach utilizes a memory bank to store the features of
tiles across all WSIs in the dataset. During training, a mini-batch usually
contains multiple WSIs. For each WSI in the batch, a subset of tiles is
randomly sampled and their features are computed using a tile encoder. Then,
additional tile features from the same WSI are selected from the memory bank.
The representation of each individual WSI is generated using a residual
encoding technique that incorporates both the sampled features and those
retrieved from the memory bank. Finally, the slide-level contrastive loss is
computed based on the representations and histopathology reports ofthe WSIs
within the mini-batch. Experiments conducted over cancer subtyping, cancer
recognition, and mutation prediction tasks proved the effectiveness of the
proposed DRE-SLCL method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable privacy-preserving, low-light, and low-cost motion capture without specialized lighting, cameras, or wearable devices by leveraging pressure signals and text guidance.

Method: Uses dual-level feature extractor for pressure data interpretation and hierarchical diffusion model for movement trajectories and posture adjustments, combining physical cues from pressure and semantic guidance from text prompts.

Result: Generates high-fidelity, physically plausible motions and establishes new state-of-the-art performance, with the MPL benchmark being the first for this task.

Conclusion: Pressure2Motion is a pioneering approach that successfully combines pressure data and linguistic priors for motion generation, offering practical advantages for privacy-sensitive and cost-effective motion capture scenarios.

Abstract: We present Pressure2Motion, a novel motion capture algorithm that synthesizes
human motion from a ground pressure sequence and text prompt. It eliminates the
need for specialized lighting setups, cameras, or wearable devices, making it
suitable for privacy-preserving, low-light, and low-cost motion capture
scenarios. Such a task is severely ill-posed due to the indeterminate nature of
the pressure signals to full-body motion. To address this issue, we introduce
Pressure2Motion, a generative model that leverages pressure features as input
and utilizes a text prompt as a high-level guiding constraint. Specifically,
our model utilizes a dual-level feature extractor that accurately interprets
pressure data, followed by a hierarchical diffusion model that discerns
broad-scale movement trajectories and subtle posture adjustments. Both the
physical cues gained from the pressure sequence and the semantic guidance
derived from descriptive texts are leveraged to guide the motion generation
with precision. To the best of our knowledge, Pressure2Motion is a pioneering
work in leveraging both pressure data and linguistic priors for motion
generation, and the established MPL benchmark is the first benchmark for this
task. Experiments show our method generates high-fidelity, physically plausible
motions, establishing a new state-of-the-art for this task. The codes and
benchmarks will be publicly released upon publication.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify complex multimodal fusion designs and multi-stage decoders in existing MRIS approaches by creating a unified end-to-end framework.

Method: Proposes autoregressive next-token prediction over unified multimodal sequences, with three novel strategies: Next-k Token Prediction, Token-level Contrastive Learning, and memory-based Hard Error Token optimization.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art performance on QaTa-COV19 and MosMedData+ datasets, demonstrating superior segmentation accuracy.

Conclusion: NTP-MRISeg provides a streamlined and effective alternative to traditional MRIS pipelines with improved generalization and adaptability.

Abstract: Medical Referring Image Segmentation (MRIS) involves segmenting target
regions in medical images based on natural language descriptions. While
achieving promising results, recent approaches usually involve complex design
of multimodal fusion or multi-stage decoders. In this work, we propose
NTP-MRISeg, a novel framework that reformulates MRIS as an autoregressive
next-token prediction task over a unified multimodal sequence of tokenized
image, text, and mask representations. This formulation streamlines model
design by eliminating the need for modality-specific fusion and external
segmentation models, supports a unified architecture for end-to-end training.
It also enables the use of pretrained tokenizers from emerging large-scale
multimodal models, enhancing generalization and adaptability. More importantly,
to address challenges under this formulation-such as exposure bias, long-tail
token distributions, and fine-grained lesion edges-we propose three novel
strategies: (1) a Next-k Token Prediction (NkTP) scheme to reduce cumulative
prediction errors, (2) Token-level Contrastive Learning (TCL) to enhance
boundary sensitivity and mitigate long-tail distribution effects, and (3) a
memory-based Hard Error Token (HET) optimization strategy that emphasizes
difficult tokens during training. Extensive experiments on the QaTa-COV19 and
MosMedData+ datasets demonstrate that NTP-MRISeg achieves new state-of-the-art
performance, offering a streamlined and effective alternative to traditional
MRIS pipelines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PITTA is a novel test-time adaptation framework for monocular depth estimation that works without camera pose information and uses instance-aware masking to handle dynamic environments effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time adaptation methods for monocular depth estimation are ineffective in diverse and dynamic real-world environments, requiring a more robust solution that doesn't rely on camera pose information.

Method: PITTA uses a pose-agnostic TTA paradigm and instance-aware image masking that extracts dynamic object masks from panoptic segmentation, plus an edge extraction method for images and depth maps.

Result: Extensive experiments on DrivingStereo and Waymo datasets show PITTA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in monocular depth estimation during test-time adaptation.

Conclusion: PITTA provides a highly effective test-time adaptation framework for monocular depth estimation that works without camera pose information and handles dynamic environments through innovative masking strategies.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation (MDE), inferring pixel-level depths in single RGB
images from a monocular camera, plays a crucial and pivotal role in a variety
of AI applications demanding a three-dimensional (3D) topographical scene. In
the real-world scenarios, MDE models often need to be deployed in environments
with different conditions from those for training. Test-time (domain)
adaptation (TTA) is one of the compelling and practical approaches to address
the issue. Although there have been notable advancements in TTA for MDE,
particularly in a self-supervised manner, existing methods are still
ineffective and problematic when applied to diverse and dynamic environments.
To break through this challenge, we propose a novel and high-performing TTA
framework for MDE, named PITTA. Our approach incorporates two key innovative
strategies: (i) pose-agnostic TTA paradigm for MDE and (ii) instance-aware
image masking. Specifically, PITTA enables highly effective TTA on a pretrained
MDE network in a pose-agnostic manner without resorting to any camera pose
information. Besides, our instance-aware masking strategy extracts
instance-wise masks for dynamic objects (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians, etc.)
from a segmentation mask produced by a pretrained panoptic segmentation
network, by removing static objects including background components. To further
boost performance, we also present a simple yet effective edge extraction
methodology for the input image (i.e., a single monocular image) and depth map.
Extensive experimental evaluations on DrivingStereo and Waymo datasets with
varying environmental conditions demonstrate that our proposed framework,
PITTA, surpasses the existing state-of-the-art techniques with remarkable
performance improvements in MDE during TTA.

Result: CLIP-B/16 model trained on only 1 million Role-SynthCLIP pairs achieves 64.1% Recall@1 on MS COCO validation set, surpassing the best existing synthetic data baseline (trained on 5M pairs) by 2.8 percentage points.

Conclusion: Role-SynthCLIP effectively enhances semantic diversity and fine-grained image-text alignment of synthetic pairs, improving caption expressiveness and accuracy while maintaining the same number of image-text pairs.

Abstract: The effectiveness of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models
critically depends on the semantic diversity and quality of their training
data. However, while existing synthetic data generation methods primarily focus
on increasing data volume, such emphasis often leads to limited semantic
diversity and redundant or shallow captions. To address this limitation, we
propose Role-SynthCLIP, a novel data synthesis framework that leverages
multi-perspective role-playing prompts (e.g., a compositional analyst, an
interpreter of image context) to guide Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
in generating semantically diverse captions from distinct viewpoints. This
mechanism enhances the semantic diversity and fine-grained image-text alignment
of synthetic pairs, thereby improving caption expressiveness and accuracy while
keeping the total number of image-text pairs unchanged. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. A CLIP-B/16 model
trained on only 1 million Role-SynthCLIP pairs achieves a Recall@1 of 64.1% on
the MS COCO validation set, surpassing the best existing synthetic data
baseline (trained on 5M pairs) by 2.8 percentage points. The code and trained
models are released at https://github.com/huangfu170/Role-SynthCLIP.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SurgiATM is a lightweight plug-and-play module that combines physics-based atmospheric modeling with deep learning to remove surgical smoke from laparoscopic videos, improving existing desmoking methods without adding trainable parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Surgical smoke from tissue cauterization degrades visual quality in laparoscopic surgery, increasing surgical error risks and hindering clinical decision-making and computer-assisted analysis. Smoke removal is critical for patient safety and operative efficiency.

Method: SurgiATM statistically bridges physics-based atmospheric models with data-driven deep learning, combining generalizability with accuracy. It's designed as a lightweight plug-and-play module with only two hyperparameters and no additional trainable weights, preserving original network architectures.

Result: Extensive experiments on three public surgical datasets with ten desmoking methods showed that SurgiATM commonly reduces restoration errors and enhances generalizability across multiple procedures (cholecystectomy, nephrectomy, diaphragm dissection) without adding trainable layers.

Conclusion: SurgiATM provides convenient, low-cost, effective, and generalizable surgical smoke removal that can be seamlessly integrated into diverse surgical desmoking architectures to enhance accuracy and stability for clinical applications.

Abstract: During laparoscopic surgery, smoke generated by tissue cauterization can
significantly degrade the visual quality of endoscopic frames, increasing the
risk of surgical errors and hindering both clinical decision-making and
computer-assisted visual analysis. Consequently, removing surgical smoke is
critical to ensuring patient safety and maintaining operative efficiency. In
this study, we propose the Surgical Atmospheric Model (SurgiATM) for surgical
smoke removal. SurgiATM statistically bridges a physics-based atmospheric model
and data-driven deep learning models, combining the superior generalizability
of the former with the high accuracy of the latter. Furthermore, SurgiATM is
designed as a lightweight, plug-and-play module that can be seamlessly
integrated into diverse surgical desmoking architectures to enhance their
accuracy and stability, better meeting clinical requirements. It introduces
only two hyperparameters and no additional trainable weights, preserving the
original network architecture with minimal computational and modification
overhead. We conduct extensive experiments on three public surgical datasets
with ten desmoking methods, involving multiple network architectures and
covering diverse procedures, including cholecystectomy, partial nephrectomy,
and diaphragm dissection. The results demonstrate that incorporating SurgiATM
commonly reduces the restoration errors of existing models and relatively
enhances their generalizability, without adding any trainable layers or
weights. This highlights the convenience, low cost, effectiveness, and
generalizability of the proposed method. The code for SurgiATM is released at
https://github.com/MingyuShengSMY/SurgiATM.

TL;DR: Adversarial examples are highly sensitive to occlusion. The paper introduces SMCE to measure confidence volatility and proposes SWM-AED detection method that achieves up to 96.5% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding intrinsic differences between adversarial examples and clean samples is key to enhancing DNN robustness and detection against adversarial attacks.

Method: Used nine canonical attacks on CIFAR-10, introduced Sliding Mask Confidence Entropy (SMCE) to quantify model confidence fluctuation under occlusion, and proposed Sliding Window Mask-based Adversarial Example Detection (SWM-AED).

Result: Adversarial examples have significantly higher confidence volatility under occlusion than originals. SWM-AED achieves accuracy over 62% in most cases and up to 96.5% across classifiers and attacks.

Conclusion: The proposed SWM-AED method effectively detects adversarial examples by leveraging their occlusion sensitivity, avoiding catastrophic overfitting of conventional adversarial training.

Abstract: Understanding intrinsic differences between adversarial examples and clean
samples is key to enhancing DNN robustness and detection against adversarial
attacks. This study first empirically finds that image-based adversarial
examples are notably sensitive to occlusion. Controlled experiments on CIFAR-10
used nine canonical attacks (e.g., FGSM, PGD) to generate adversarial examples,
paired with original samples for evaluation. We introduce Sliding Mask
Confidence Entropy (SMCE) to quantify model confidence fluctuation under
occlusion. Using 1800+ test images, SMCE calculations supported by Mask Entropy
Field Maps and statistical distributions show adversarial examples have
significantly higher confidence volatility under occlusion than originals.
Based on this, we propose Sliding Window Mask-based Adversarial Example
Detection (SWM-AED), which avoids catastrophic overfitting of conventional
adversarial training. Evaluations across classifiers and attacks on CIFAR-10
demonstrate robust performance, with accuracy over 62% in most cases and up to
96.5%.

*Ruolin Li,Min Liu,Yuan Bian,Zhaoyang Li,Yuzhen Li,Xueping Wang,Yaonan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DPPP is a dual-stage framework that uses prompt-driven diffusion models to generate privacy-preserving virtual data for person re-identification, achieving state-of-the-art generalization performance without real sensitive data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy concerns in person Re-ID by creating virtual datasets that overcome limitations of existing game engine-based approaches (complex construction, poor domain generalization) and avoid using sensitive real-world images.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Generate diverse virtual dataset (GenePerson) using multi-dimensional prompts with appearance, illumination, and viewpoint attributes; 2) Prompt-driven Disentanglement Mechanism (PDM) using contrastive learning and textual inversion networks to separate style and content features for domain-invariant learning.

Result: Created GenePerson dataset with 130,519 images of 6,641 identities. Models trained on GenePerson with PDM achieve state-of-the-art generalization performance, outperforming models trained on both real and existing virtual Re-ID datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed DPPP framework successfully addresses privacy concerns while achieving superior domain generalization, demonstrating that virtual data generated through prompt-driven diffusion models can effectively replace sensitive real data for person Re-ID tasks.

Abstract: With growing concerns over data privacy, researchers have started using
virtual data as an alternative to sensitive real-world images for training
person re-identification (Re-ID) models. However, existing virtual datasets
produced by game engines still face challenges such as complex construction and
poor domain generalization, making them difficult to apply in real scenarios.
To address these challenges, we propose a Dual-stage Prompt-driven
Privacy-preserving Paradigm (DPPP). In the first stage, we generate rich
prompts incorporating multi-dimensional attributes such as pedestrian
appearance, illumination, and viewpoint that drive the diffusion model to
synthesize diverse data end-to-end, building a large-scale virtual dataset
named GenePerson with 130,519 images of 6,641 identities. In the second stage,
we propose a Prompt-driven Disentanglement Mechanism (PDM) to learn
domain-invariant generalization features. With the aid of contrastive learning,
we employ two textual inversion networks to map images into pseudo-words
representing style and content, respectively, thereby constructing
style-disentangled content prompts to guide the model in learning
domain-invariant content features at the image level. Experiments demonstrate
that models trained on GenePerson with PDM achieve state-of-the-art
generalization performance, surpassing those on popular real and virtual Re-ID
datasets.

TL;DR: A dual-level reinforcement learning framework for adverse weather image restoration, using a physics-driven dataset and dynamic model orchestration to achieve state-of-the-art performance without paired supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision models trained on synthetic data struggle to generalize to complex real-world weather degradations, requiring more adaptive solutions.

Method: Constructed HFLS-Weather dataset, then designed dual-level RL framework: local level refines weather-specific models via perturbation-driven quality optimization; global level uses meta-controller for dynamic model selection and execution order.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse adverse weather scenarios, enabling continuous adaptation to real-world conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed reinforcement learning framework effectively addresses adverse weather perception challenges through physics-driven data and adaptive model orchestration.

Abstract: Adverse weather severely impairs real-world visual perception, while existing
vision models trained on synthetic data with fixed parameters struggle to
generalize to complex degradations. To address this, we first construct
HFLS-Weather, a physics-driven, high-fidelity dataset that simulates diverse
weather phenomena, and then design a dual-level reinforcement learning
framework initialized with HFLS-Weather for cold-start training. Within this
framework, at the local level, weather-specific restoration models are refined
through perturbation-driven image quality optimization, enabling reward-based
learning without paired supervision; at the global level, a meta-controller
dynamically orchestrates model selection and execution order according to scene
degradation. This framework enables continuous adaptation to real-world
conditions and achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of
adverse weather scenarios. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First deep learning study using raw OCT B-scans for Alzheimer's disease prediction, achieving AUC 0.62 with ResNet-34 but below clinical threshold, highlighting challenges of early detection years before diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore direct classification of OCT B-scan images for early Alzheimer's detection, moving beyond traditional segmented layer thickness measurements, as imaging precedes clinical diagnosis by several years.

Method: Fine-tuned multiple pretrained models (ImageNet networks and OCT-specific RETFound transformer) using subject-level cross-validation from UK Biobank, with OCT-specific augmentation and year-weighted loss function prioritizing recent cases.

Result: ResNet-34 achieved AUC of 0.62 in 4-year cohort, below clinical threshold but explainability analyses confirmed localized structural differences in central macular subfield between AD and control groups.

Conclusion: Provides baseline for OCT-based AD prediction, highlights challenges of detecting subtle retinal biomarkers years before diagnosis, and points to need for larger datasets and multimodal approaches.

Abstract: Alterations in retinal layer thickness, measurable using Optical Coherence
Tomography (OCT), have been associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as
Alzheimer's disease (AD). While previous studies have mainly focused on
segmented layer thickness measurements, this study explored the direct
classification of OCT B-scan images for the early detection of AD. To our
knowledge, this is the first application of deep learning to raw OCT B-scans
for AD prediction in the literature. Unlike conventional medical image
classification tasks, early detection is more challenging than diagnosis
because imaging precedes clinical diagnosis by several years. We fine-tuned and
evaluated multiple pretrained models, including ImageNet-based networks and the
OCT-specific RETFound transformer, using subject-level cross-validation
datasets matched for age, sex, and imaging instances from the UK Biobank
cohort. To reduce overfitting in this small, high-dimensional dataset, both
standard and OCT-specific augmentation techniques were applied, along with a
year-weighted loss function that prioritized cases diagnosed within four years
of imaging. ResNet-34 produced the most stable results, achieving an AUC of
0.62 in the 4-year cohort. Although below the threshold for clinical
application, our explainability analyses confirmed localized structural
differences in the central macular subfield between the AD and control groups.
These findings provide a baseline for OCT-based AD prediction, highlight the
challenges of detecting subtle retinal biomarkers years before AD diagnosis,
and point to the need for larger datasets and multimodal approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lane detection in snow-covered environments is challenging due to frequent absence or occlusion of lane markings, requiring alternative approaches for autonomous driving in winter conditions.

Method: Detects vertical roadside posts (delineators) as indirect lane indicators, then fits a smooth lane trajectory using parameterized Bezier curve model while leveraging spatial consistency and road geometry.

Result: Significantly improved robustness in adverse weather compared to state-of-the-art lane detection systems, particularly in cases with heavy snow occlusion.

Conclusion: Establishes a strong foundation for reliable lane detection in winter scenarios and contributes a valuable resource (SnowyLane dataset) for future all-weather autonomous driving research.

Abstract: Lane detection for autonomous driving in snow-covered environments remains a
major challenge due to the frequent absence or occlusion of lane markings. In
this paper, we present a novel, robust and realtime capable approach that
bypasses the reliance on traditional lane markings by detecting roadside
features,specifically vertical roadside posts called delineators, as indirect
lane indicators. Our method first perceives these posts, then fits a smooth
lane trajectory using a parameterized Bezier curve model, leveraging spatial
consistency and road geometry. To support training and evaluation in these
challenging scenarios, we introduce SnowyLane, a new synthetic dataset
containing 80,000 annotated frames capture winter driving conditions, with
varying snow coverage, and lighting conditions. Compared to state-of-the-art
lane detection systems, our approach demonstrates significantly improved
robustness in adverse weather, particularly in cases with heavy snow occlusion.
This work establishes a strong foundation for reliable lane detection in winter
scenarios and contributes a valuable resource for future research in

*Adrian Azzarelli,Nantheera Anantrasirichai,David R Bull*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method that splits Gaussian Splatting into foreground and background components using sparse masks to improve dynamic 3D reconstruction from sparse multi-view video, achieving state-of-the-art results with smaller model size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitation of current deformable Gaussian Splatting methods in handling sparse camera configurations common in filmmaking with tight budgets, where complex dynamic features are hard to capture.

Method: Split canonical Gaussians and deformation field into foreground/background using sparse masks at t=0. Train each representation separately with different loss functions during canonical pre-training, then model different parameters for each deformation field during dynamic training based on their characteristics.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art qualitative and quantitative results (up to 3 PSNR higher) with half the model size on 3D scenes. Produces segmented dynamic reconstructions including transparent and dynamic textures without dense mask supervision.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively handles sparse camera setups in filmmaking by separating foreground and background dynamics, outperforming existing approaches while requiring less supervision and computational resources.

Abstract: Deformable Gaussian Splatting (GS) accomplishes photorealistic dynamic 3-D
reconstruction from dense multi-view video (MVV) by learning to deform a
canonical GS representation. However, in filmmaking, tight budgets can result
in sparse camera configurations, which limits state-of-the-art (SotA) methods
when capturing complex dynamic features. To address this issue, we introduce an
approach that splits the canonical Gaussians and deformation field into
foreground and background components using a sparse set of masks for frames at
t=0. Each representation is separately trained on different loss functions
during canonical pre-training. Then, during dynamic training, different
parameters are modeled for each deformation field following common filmmaking
practices. The foreground stage contains diverse dynamic features so changes in
color, position and rotation are learned. While, the background containing
film-crew and equipment, is typically dimmer and less dynamic so only changes
in point position are learned. Experiments on 3-D and 2.5-D entertainment
datasets show that our method produces SotA qualitative and quantitative
results; up to 3 PSNR higher with half the model size on 3-D scenes. Unlike the
SotA and without the need for dense mask supervision, our method also produces
segmented dynamic reconstructions including transparent and dynamic textures.

TL;DR: BRIXEL is a knowledge distillation method that enables DINOv3 models to produce high-resolution feature maps more efficiently by having students learn to reproduce their own features at higher resolutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision foundation models like DINOv3 require high-resolution inputs and substantial computational resources due to transformer's quadratic complexity, limiting their practical deployment.

Method: Proposes BRIXEL - a knowledge distillation approach where the student model learns to reproduce its own feature maps at higher resolution through a simple distillation process.

Result: BRIXEL outperforms baseline DINOv3 models by large margins on downstream tasks at fixed resolution and produces similar feature maps to the teacher at a fraction of the computational cost.

Conclusion: BRIXEL provides an effective and simple solution to reduce computational requirements while maintaining high-quality feature maps for vision foundation models.

Abstract: Vision foundation models achieve strong performance on both global and
locally dense downstream tasks. Pretrained on large images, the recent DINOv3
model family is able to produce very fine-grained dense feature maps, enabling
state-of-the-art performance. However, computing these feature maps requires
the input image to be available at very high resolution, as well as large
amounts of compute due to the squared complexity of the transformer
architecture. To address these issues, we propose BRIXEL, a simple knowledge
distillation approach that has the student learn to reproduce its own feature
maps at higher resolution. Despite its simplicity, BRIXEL outperforms the
baseline DINOv3 models by large margins on downstream tasks when the resolution
is kept fixed. Moreover, it is able to produce feature maps that are very
similar to those of the teacher at a fraction of the computational cost. Code

TL;DR: MUSE is a self-supervised learning method for nucleus detection and classification in histopathology that uses multi-scale dense self-distillation and eliminates the need for labor-intensive nucleus-level annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for nucleus detection and classification rely heavily on labor-intensive nucleus-level annotations and fail to effectively leverage large-scale unlabeled data for learning discriminative nucleus representations.

Method: Proposes MUSE with NuLo (Nucleus-based Local self-distillation) - a coordinate-guided mechanism for flexible local self-distillation based on predicted nucleus positions, enabling cross-scale alignment without strict spatial alignment requirements. Also includes an encoder-decoder architecture and large field-of-view semi-supervised fine-tuning.

Result: Extensive experiments on three benchmarks show MUSE effectively addresses core challenges of histopathological NDC, surpassing state-of-the-art supervised baselines and outperforming generic pathology foundation models.

Conclusion: MUSE provides an effective self-supervised learning approach for nucleus detection and classification that reduces annotation dependency and better utilizes unlabeled data while achieving superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Nucleus detection and classification (NDC) in histopathology analysis is a
fundamental task that underpins a wide range of high-level pathology
applications. However, existing methods heavily rely on labor-intensive
nucleus-level annotations and struggle to fully exploit large-scale unlabeled
data for learning discriminative nucleus representations. In this work, we
propose MUSE (MUlti-scale denSE self-distillation), a novel self-supervised
learning method tailored for NDC. At its core is NuLo (Nucleus-based Local
self-distillation), a coordinate-guided mechanism that enables flexible local
self-distillation based on predicted nucleus positions. By removing the need
for strict spatial alignment between augmented views, NuLo allows critical
cross-scale alignment, thus unlocking the capacity of models for fine-grained
nucleus-level representation. To support MUSE, we design a simple yet effective
encoder-decoder architecture and a large field-of-view semi-supervised
fine-tuning strategy that together maximize the value of unlabeled pathology
images. Extensive experiments on three widely used benchmarks demonstrate that
MUSE effectively addresses the core challenges of histopathological NDC. The
resulting models not only surpass state-of-the-art supervised baselines but
also outperform generic pathology foundation models.

Motivation: To extend the original WtL algorithm beyond color ship segmentation to handle infrared ships and diverse RGB objects, enabling detailed segmentation for specialized applications requiring high-quality samples.

Method: Adapts the object contour detector for IR ships and enhances the algorithm to process various RGB objects using contour tracking to refine object contours into 1-pixel-wide closed shapes that can be binarized for segmentation.

Result: WtL2 outperforms latest contour-based methods in achieving closed object contours, delivers high peak IoU with impressive detail, and broadens application range to IR and diverse RGB objects.

Conclusion: WtL2 is a compelling method for specialized applications requiring detailed segmentation or high-quality samples, potentially accelerating progress in niche image segmentation areas.

Abstract: This paper presents Walk the Lines 2 (WtL2), a unique contour tracking
algorithm specifically adapted for detailed segmentation of infrared (IR) ships
and various objects in RGB.1 This extends the original Walk the Lines (WtL)
[12], which focused solely on detailed ship segmentation in color. These
innovative WtLs can replace the standard non-maximum suppression (NMS) by using
contour tracking to refine the object contour until a 1-pixel-wide closed shape
can be binarized, forming a segmentable area in foreground-background
scenarios. WtL2 broadens the application range of WtL beyond its original
scope, adapting to IR and expanding to diverse objects within the RGB context.
To achieve IR segmentation, we adapt its input, the object contour detector, to
IR ships. In addition, the algorithm is enhanced to process a wide range of RGB
objects, outperforming the latest generation of contour-based methods when
achieving a closed object contour, offering high peak Intersection over Union
(IoU) with impressive details. This positions WtL2 as a compelling method for
specialized applications that require detailed segmentation or high-quality
samples, potentially accelerating progress in several niche areas of image
segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like ControlNet rely on handcrafted condition maps and retraining, limiting flexibility and generalization, while inversion-based approaches incur high inference costs due to dual-path denoising.

Method: FreeControl performs one-step attention extraction from a single optimally chosen key timestep and reuses it throughout denoising, with Latent-Condition Decoupling (LCD) to separate key timestep and noised latent for finer control.

Result: The method enables structurally and semantically aligned, visually coherent generation directly from raw images with approximately 5% additional cost, supporting compositional control via reference images from multiple sources.

Conclusion: FreeControl introduces a new paradigm for test-time control that provides flexibility for intuitive compositional design and compatibility with modern diffusion models while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Controlling the spatial and semantic structure of diffusion-generated images
remains a challenge. Existing methods like ControlNet rely on handcrafted
condition maps and retraining, limiting flexibility and generalization.
Inversion-based approaches offer stronger alignment but incur high inference
cost due to dual-path denoising. We present FreeControl, a training-free
framework for semantic structural control in diffusion models. Unlike prior
methods that extract attention across multiple timesteps, FreeControl performs
one-step attention extraction from a single, optimally chosen key timestep and
reuses it throughout denoising. This enables efficient structural guidance
without inversion or retraining. To further improve quality and stability, we
introduce Latent-Condition Decoupling (LCD): a principled separation of the key
timestep and the noised latent used in attention extraction. LCD provides finer
control over attention quality and eliminates structural artifacts. FreeControl
also supports compositional control via reference images assembled from
multiple sources - enabling intuitive scene layout design and stronger prompt
alignment. FreeControl introduces a new paradigm for test-time control,
enabling structurally and semantically aligned, visually coherent generation
directly from raw images, with the flexibility for intuitive compositional
design and compatibility with modern diffusion models at approximately 5
percent additional cost.

Motivation: Novel view synthesis from monocular videos of dynamic scenes with unknown camera poses remains challenging. Existing methods like NeRF and 3DGS struggle with dynamic content and rely on pre-computed camera poses.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Uses 3D foundational models for initial pose/geometry estimation, 2) Motion-aware refinement with MA-BA module (transformer priors + SAM2 for dynamic segmentation) and MA-GS representation (control points with deformation MLP + linear blend skinning).

Conclusion: 4D3R provides an effective pose-free solution for dynamic scene reconstruction that outperforms existing methods in quality and efficiency.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis from monocular videos of dynamic scenes with unknown
camera poses remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics.
While recent advances in 3D representations such as Neural Radiance Fields
(NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have shown promising results for static

camera poses. We present 4D3R, a pose-free dynamic neural rendering framework
that decouples static and dynamic components through a two-stage approach. Our
method first leverages 3D foundational models for initial pose and geometry
estimation, followed by motion-aware refinement. 4D3R introduces two key
technical innovations: (1) a motion-aware bundle adjustment (MA-BA) module that
combines transformer-based learned priors with SAM2 for robust dynamic object
segmentation, enabling more accurate camera pose refinement; and (2) an
efficient Motion-Aware Gaussian Splatting (MA-GS) representation that uses
control points with a deformation field MLP and linear blend skinning to model
dynamic motion, significantly reducing computational cost while maintaining
high-quality reconstruction. Extensive experiments on real-world dynamic

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel anomaly detection representation learning framework that creates specialized pretrained features for industrial anomaly detection, addressing limitations of ImageNet-pretrained features through angle- and norm-oriented contrastive losses trained on a large-scale AD dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current anomaly detection methods rely on ImageNet-pretrained features, which are suboptimal because ImageNet pretraining doesn't focus on distinguishing normal vs abnormal patterns and suffers from distribution shift between natural images and industrial AD data.

Method: Proposes angle- and norm-oriented contrastive losses to maximize angle size and norm differences between normal and abnormal features, pretrained on RealIAD dataset using class-generalizable residual features to handle distribution shifts.

Result: Extensive experiments on five AD datasets and five backbones show superior performance when replacing original features with the proposed pretrained representations across multiple embedding-based AD methods.

Conclusion: The proposed AD-specific pretraining framework effectively addresses limitations of ImageNet-pretrained features and significantly improves anomaly detection performance in industrial settings.

Abstract: The current mainstream and state-of-the-art anomaly detection (AD) methods
are substantially established on pretrained feature networks yielded by
ImageNet pretraining. However, regardless of supervised or self-supervised
pretraining, the pretraining process on ImageNet does not match the goal of
anomaly detection (i.e., pretraining in natural images doesn't aim to
distinguish between normal and abnormal). Moreover, natural images and
industrial image data in AD scenarios typically have the distribution shift.
The two issues can cause ImageNet-pretrained features to be suboptimal for AD
tasks. To further promote the development of the AD field, pretrained
representations specially for AD tasks are eager and very valuable. To this
end, we propose a novel AD representation learning framework specially designed
for learning robust and discriminative pretrained representations for
industrial anomaly detection. Specifically, closely surrounding the goal of
anomaly detection (i.e., focus on discrepancies between normals and anomalies),
we propose angle- and norm-oriented contrastive losses to maximize the angle
size and norm difference between normal and abnormal features simultaneously.
To avoid the distribution shift from natural images to AD images, our
pretraining is performed on a large-scale AD dataset, RealIAD. To further
alleviate the potential shift between pretraining data and downstream AD
datasets, we learn the pretrained AD representations based on the
class-generalizable representation, residual features. For evaluation, based on
five embedding-based AD methods, we simply replace their original features with
our pretrained representations. Extensive experiments on five AD datasets and
five backbones consistently show the superiority of our pretrained features.

*Mohamed Sanim Akremi,Rim Slama,Hedi Tabia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an online skeleton-based motion recognition system using SPD matrix representation and Siamese network for continuous detection and classification of motions in streaming sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing skeleton-based approaches focus on segment-based recognition which is not suitable for online scenarios where continuous motion recognition from streaming data is needed for real-life applications.

Method: Uses a two-component system: detector and classifier employing Semi-Positive Definite (SPD) matrix representation for skeletal data and Siamese network for learning semantic similarity to predict motion intervals in unsegmented sequences.

Result: Extensive experiments on hand gesture and body action benchmarks show the system outperforms state-of-the-art methods in most cases, with the detector being flexible and capable of continuously identifying kinetic states.

Conclusion: The proposed online recognition system effectively addresses the limitations of segment-based approaches and demonstrates superior performance for continuous motion recognition in streaming skeleton sequences.

Abstract: Online continuous motion recognition is a hot topic of research since it is
more practical in real life application cases. Recently, Skeleton-based
approaches have become increasingly popular, demonstrating the power of using
such 3D temporal data. However, most of these works have focused on
segment-based recognition and are not suitable for the online scenarios. In
this paper, we propose an online recognition system for skeleton sequence
streaming composed from two main components: a detector and a classifier, which
use a Semi-Positive Definite (SPD) matrix representation and a Siamese network.
The powerful statistical representations for the skeletal data given by the SPD
matrices and the learning of their semantic similarity by the Siamese network
enable the detector to predict time intervals of the motions throughout an
unsegmented sequence. In addition, they ensure the classifier capability to
recognize the motion in each predicted interval. The proposed detector is
flexible and able to identify the kinetic state continuously. We conduct
extensive experiments on both hand gesture and body action recognition
benchmarks to prove the accuracy of our online recognition system which in most
cases outperforms state-of-the-art performances.

Abstract: Introduction: Accurate intraoperative delineation of colorectal liver
metastases (CRLM) is crucial for achieving negative resection margins but
remains challenging using intraoperative ultrasound (iUS) due to low contrast,
noise, and operator dependency. Automated segmentation could enhance precision
and efficiency in ultrasound-based navigation workflows.
  Methods: Eighty-five tracked 3D iUS volumes from 85 CRLM patients were used
to train and evaluate a 3D U-Net implemented via the nnU-Net framework. Two
variants were compared: one trained on full iUS volumes and another on cropped
regions around tumors. Segmentation accuracy was assessed using Dice Similarity
Coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff Distance (HDist.), and Relative Volume Difference
(RVD) on retrospective and prospective datasets. The workflow was integrated
into 3D Slicer for real-time intraoperative use.
  Results: The cropped-volume model significantly outperformed the full-volume
model across all metrics (AUC-ROC = 0.898 vs 0.718). It achieved median DSC =
0.74, recall = 0.79, and HDist. = 17.1 mm comparable to semi-automatic
segmentation but with ~4x faster execution (~ 1 min). Prospective
intraoperative testing confirmed robust and consistent performance, with
clinically acceptable accuracy for real-time surgical guidance.
  Conclusion: Automatic 3D segmentation of CRLM in iUS using a cropped 3D U-Net
provides reliable, near real-time results with minimal operator input. The
method enables efficient, registration-free ultrasound-based navigation for
hepatic surgery, approaching expert-level accuracy while substantially reducing
manual workload and procedure time.

TL;DR: DeepEyesV2 is an agentic multimodal model that integrates tool use (code execution, web search) into reasoning through a two-stage training pipeline and demonstrates effective real-world multimodal reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To build agentic multimodal models that can actively invoke external tools and integrate these operations into reasoning, addressing the limitation that direct reinforcement learning alone fails to induce robust tool-use behavior.

Method: Two-stage training pipeline: cold-start stage to establish tool-use patterns, followed by reinforcement learning stage to refine tool invocation. Uses a diverse, moderately challenging training dataset with examples where tool use is beneficial.

Result: DeepEyesV2 shows effectiveness across real-world understanding, mathematical reasoning, and search-intensive tasks. It exhibits task-adaptive tool invocation (image operations for perception, numerical computations for reasoning) and complex tool combinations through reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: The study provides guidance for developing agentic multimodal models, demonstrating that the proposed two-stage training approach enables robust tool-use behavior and selective tool invocation based on context.

Abstract: Agentic multimodal models should not only comprehend text and images, but
also actively invoke external tools, such as code execution environments and
web search, and integrate these operations into reasoning. In this work, we
introduce DeepEyesV2 and explore how to build an agentic multimodal model from
the perspectives of data construction, training methods, and model evaluation.
We observe that direct reinforcement learning alone fails to induce robust
tool-use behavior. This phenomenon motivates a two-stage training pipeline: a
cold-start stage to establish tool-use patterns, and reinforcement learning
stage to further refine tool invocation. We curate a diverse, moderately
challenging training dataset, specifically including examples where tool use is
beneficial. We further introduce RealX-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark
designed to evaluate real-world multimodal reasoning, which inherently requires
the integration of multiple capabilities, including perception, search, and
reasoning. We evaluate DeepEyesV2 on RealX-Bench and other representative
benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness across real-world understanding,
mathematical reasoning, and search-intensive tasks. Moreover, DeepEyesV2
exhibits task-adaptive tool invocation, tending to use image operations for
perception tasks and numerical computations for reasoning tasks. Reinforcement
learning further enables complex tool combinations and allows model to
selectively invoke tools based on context. We hope our study can provide
guidance for community in developing agentic multimodal models.

TL;DR: CuisineSense is a wearable system that uses smartwatch hand motion and smart glasses head dynamics to detect eating states and classify Chinese food types, addressing limitations of traditional dietary monitoring methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional self-report methods have recall bias, camera-based approaches raise privacy concerns, and existing wearable methods focus on limited Western food types, failing to address the diversity of Chinese cuisine.

Method: Two-stage detection pipeline: first stage identifies eating states by distinguishing temporal patterns from non-eating behaviors, second stage conducts fine-grained food type recognition using hand motion from smartwatch and head dynamics from smart glasses.

Result: Achieves high accuracy in both eating state detection and food classification on a dataset of 27.5 hours of IMU recordings across 11 food categories and 10 participants.

Conclusion: CuisineSense offers a practical solution for unobtrusive, wearable-based dietary monitoring that addresses the diversity of Chinese cuisine while maintaining privacy.

Abstract: Accurate food intake detection is vital for dietary monitoring and chronic
disease prevention. Traditional self-report methods are prone to recall bias,
while camera-based approaches raise concerns about privacy. Furthermore,
existing wearable-based methods primarily focus on a limited number of food
types, such as hamburgers and pizza, failing to address the vast diversity of
Chinese cuisine. To bridge this gap, we propose CuisineSense, a system that
classifies Chinese food types by integrating hand motion cues from a smartwatch
with head dynamics from smart glasses. To filter out irrelevant daily
activities, we design a two-stage detection pipeline. The first stage
identifies eating states by distinguishing characteristic temporal patterns
from non-eating behaviors. The second stage then conducts fine-grained food
type recognition based on the motions captured during food intake. To evaluate
CuisineSense, we construct a dataset comprising 27.5 hours of IMU recordings
across 11 food categories and 10 participants. Experiments demonstrate that
CuisineSense achieves high accuracy in both eating state detection and food
classification, offering a practical solution for unobtrusive, wearable-based
dietary monitoring.The system code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing online Video-LLMs struggle to simultaneously process continuous frame-by-frame inputs and determine optimal response timing, compromising real-time responsiveness and narrative coherence.

Method: LiveStar incorporates: (1) incremental video-language alignment training for variable-length video streams; (2) response-silence decoding framework for optimal proactive response timing; (3) memory-aware acceleration via peak-end memory compression and streaming key-value cache.

Result: LiveStar achieves state-of-the-art performance with 19.5% improvement in semantic correctness, 18.1% reduced timing difference, and 12.0% FPS improvement across five OmniStar tasks compared to existing online Video-LLMs.

Conclusion: LiveStar demonstrates superior performance in online video understanding with improved real-time responsiveness and narrative coherence, supported by the comprehensive OmniStar dataset for training and benchmarking.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) for
offline video understanding, existing online Video-LLMs typically struggle to
simultaneously process continuous frame-by-frame inputs and determine optimal
response timing, often compromising real-time responsiveness and narrative
coherence. To address these limitations, we introduce LiveStar, a pioneering
live streaming assistant that achieves always-on proactive responses through
adaptive streaming decoding. Specifically, LiveStar incorporates: (1) a
training strategy enabling incremental video-language alignment for
variable-length video streams, preserving temporal consistency across
dynamically evolving frame sequences; (2) a response-silence decoding framework
that determines optimal proactive response timing via a single forward pass
verification; (3) memory-aware acceleration via peak-end memory compression for
online inference on 10+ minute videos, combined with streaming key-value cache
to achieve 1.53x faster inference. We also construct an OmniStar dataset, a
comprehensive dataset for training and benchmarking that encompasses 15 diverse
real-world scenarios and 5 evaluation tasks for online video understanding.
Extensive experiments across three benchmarks demonstrate LiveStar's
state-of-the-art performance, achieving an average 19.5% improvement in
semantic correctness with 18.1% reduced timing difference compared to existing
online Video-LLMs, while improving FPS by 12.0% across all five OmniStar tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper exposes flaws in current point cloud evaluation metrics, proposes improved metrics including Surface Normal Concordance (SNC), and introduces Diffusion Point Transformer for state-of-the-art point cloud generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current metrics for evaluating generated point clouds lack robustness and fail to capture geometric fidelity, while existing generative models need improvement for higher quality 3D structure generation.

Method: Proposed improved metrics with sample alignment and Density-Aware Chamfer Distance (DCD), introduced Surface Normal Concordance (SNC) metric, and developed Diffusion Point Transformer architecture using transformer-based serialized patch attention.

Result: The model outperforms previous solutions on ShapeNet dataset, achieving new state-of-the-art in point cloud generation quality with comprehensive evaluation using the proposed metrics.

Conclusion: The combination of robust evaluation metrics and the novel Diffusion Point Transformer architecture enables more reliable assessment and higher quality generation of 3D point clouds.

Abstract: As 3D point clouds become a cornerstone of modern technology, the need for
sophisticated generative models and reliable evaluation metrics has grown
exponentially. In this work, we first expose that some commonly used metrics
for evaluating generated point clouds, particularly those based on Chamfer
Distance (CD), lack robustness against defects and fail to capture geometric
fidelity and local shape consistency when used as quality indicators. We
further show that introducing samples alignment prior to distance calculation
and replacing CD with Density-Aware Chamfer Distance (DCD) are simple yet
essential steps to ensure the consistency and robustness of point cloud
generative model evaluation metrics. While existing metrics primarily focus on
directly comparing 3D Euclidean coordinates, we present a novel metric, named
Surface Normal Concordance (SNC), which approximates surface similarity by
comparing estimated point normals. This new metric, when combined with
traditional ones, provides a more comprehensive evaluation of the quality of
generated samples. Finally, leveraging recent advancements in transformer-based
models for point cloud analysis, such as serialized patch attention , we
propose a new architecture for generating high-fidelity 3D structures, the
Diffusion Point Transformer. We perform extensive experiments and comparisons
on the ShapeNet dataset, showing that our model outperforms previous solutions,
particularly in terms of quality of generated point clouds, achieving new
state-of-the-art. Code available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current steganography struggles to embed semantically rich, sentence-level information into carriers, but in the AIGC era, steganography capacity is more critical than ever for hiding meaningful textual content.

Method: The authors present S²LM (Semantic Steganographic Language Model), which utilizes LLMs to embed high-level textual information into images through a newly designed pipeline where the LLM is involved throughout the entire process.

Result: Both quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that the method effectively unlocks new semantic steganographic capabilities for LLMs, successfully embedding sentences and paragraphs into images.

Conclusion: The proposed S²LM framework enables semantic steganography at the sentence level, representing a significant advancement beyond traditional bit-level steganography methods.

Abstract: Although steganography has made significant advancements in recent years, it
still struggles to embed semantically rich, sentence-level information into
carriers. However, in the era of AIGC, the capacity of steganography is more
critical than ever. In this work, we present Sentence-to-Image Steganography,
an instance of Semantic Steganography, a novel task that enables the hiding of
arbitrary sentence-level messages within a cover image. Furthermore, we
establish a benchmark named Invisible Text (IVT), comprising a diverse set of
sentence-level texts as secret messages for evaluation. Finally, we present
$\mathbf{S^2LM}$: Semantic Steganographic Language Model, which utilizes large
language models (LLMs) to embed high-level textual information, such as
sentences or even paragraphs, into images. Unlike traditional bit-level
counterparts, $\mathrm{S^2LM}$ enables the integration of semantically rich
content through a newly designed pipeline in which the LLM is involved
throughout the entire process. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments
demonstrate that our method effectively unlocks new semantic steganographic

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Articulated object perception is challenging because existing methods ignore temporal dynamics despite objects' inherently dynamic nature. There's a lack of 4D temporal data exploration and no benchmark dataset for panoptic segmentation of articulated objects.

Method: Proposed CanonSeg4D framework that estimates per-frame offsets to map observed object parts to a learned canonical space, enabling consistent alignment of parts across sequential frames. Built on the new Artic4D dataset derived from PartNet Mobility with synthetic sensor data.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on Artic4D show CanonSeg4D outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in panoptic segmentation accuracy, particularly in complex scenarios.

Conclusion: Temporal modeling and canonical alignment are effective for dynamic object understanding, paving the way for future advances in 4D articulated object perception.

Abstract: Articulated object perception presents significant challenges in computer
vision, particularly because most existing methods ignore temporal dynamics
despite the inherently dynamic nature of such objects. The use of 4D temporal
data has not been thoroughly explored in articulated object perception and
remains unexamined for panoptic segmentation. The lack of a benchmark dataset
further hurt this field. To this end, we introduce Artic4D as a new dataset
derived from PartNet Mobility and augmented with synthetic sensor data,
featuring 4D panoptic annotations and articulation parameters. Building on this
dataset, we propose CanonSeg4D, a novel 4D panoptic segmentation framework.
This approach explicitly estimates per-frame offsets mapping observed object
parts to a learned canonical space, thereby enhancing part-level segmentation.
The framework employs this canonical representation to achieve consistent
alignment of object parts across sequential frames. Comprehensive experiments
on Artic4D demonstrate that the proposed CanonSeg4D outperforms state of the
art approaches in panoptic segmentation accuracy in more complex scenarios.
These findings highlight the effectiveness of temporal modeling and canonical
alignment in dynamic object understanding, and pave the way for future advances

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current research focuses mainly on text-to-motion generation while motion understanding remains underexplored, and existing datasets lack detailed temporal annotations for complex motion sequences.

Method: Created CompMo dataset with 60,000 motion sequences containing multiple actions (2-10 per sequence) with precise temporal boundaries, and developed DEMO model combining large language model with motion adapter.

Result: DEMO substantially outperforms existing methods on CompMo dataset and adapted benchmarks, establishing strong baseline for 3D motion understanding.

Conclusion: The work addresses the gap in motion understanding research and provides comprehensive dataset and model for dense motion captioning, enabling future research in 3D motion analysis.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D human motion and language integration have primarily
focused on text-to-motion generation, leaving the task of motion understanding
relatively unexplored. We introduce Dense Motion Captioning, a novel task that
aims to temporally localize and caption actions within 3D human motion
sequences. Current datasets fall short in providing detailed temporal
annotations and predominantly consist of short sequences featuring few actions.
To overcome these limitations, we present the Complex Motion Dataset (CompMo),
the first large-scale dataset featuring richly annotated, complex motion
sequences with precise temporal boundaries. Built through a carefully designed
data generation pipeline, CompMo includes 60,000 motion sequences, each
composed of multiple actions ranging from at least two to ten, accurately
annotated with their temporal extents. We further present DEMO, a model that
integrates a large language model with a simple motion adapter, trained to
generate dense, temporally grounded captions. Our experiments show that DEMO
substantially outperforms existing methods on CompMo as well as on adapted
benchmarks, establishing a robust baseline for future research in 3D motion
understanding and captioning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal LLM approaches for visual quality assessment suffer from shallow reasoning, poor score calibration, and limited cross-domain generalization due to reliance on supervised fine-tuning or rank-only objectives.

Method: Proposes PreResQ-R1 with dual-branch reward formulation that separates intra-sample response coherence and inter-sample preference alignment, optimized via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Extends to video QA with global-temporal and local-spatial data flow strategy.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results across 10 IQA and 5 VQA benchmarks, surpassing by 5.30% and 2.15% in IQA task under SRCC and PLCC metrics respectively, using only 6K images and 28K videos for fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The framework enables fine-grained, stable, and interpretable chain-of-thought reasoning about perceptual quality, producing human-aligned reasoning traces that reveal perceptual cues underlying quality judgments.

Abstract: Visual Quality Assessment (QA) seeks to predict human perceptual judgments of
visual fidelity. While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show
promise in reasoning about image and video quality, existing approaches mainly
rely on supervised fine-tuning or rank-only objectives, resulting in shallow
reasoning, poor score calibration, and limited cross-domain generalization. We
propose PreResQ-R1, a Preference-Response Disentangled Reinforcement Learning
framework that unifies absolute score regression and relative ranking
consistency within a single reasoning-driven optimization scheme. Unlike prior
QA methods, PreResQ-R1 introduces a dual-branch reward formulation that
separately models intra-sample response coherence and inter-sample preference
alignment, optimized via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). This design
encourages fine-grained, stable, and interpretable chain-of-thought reasoning
about perceptual quality. To extend beyond static imagery, we further design a
global-temporal and local-spatial data flow strategy for Video Quality
Assessment. Remarkably, with reinforcement fine-tuning on only 6K images and
28K videos, PreResQ-R1 achieves state-of-the-art results across 10 IQA and 5
VQA benchmarks under both SRCC and PLCC metrics, surpassing by margins of 5.30%
and textbf2.15% in IQA task, respectively. Beyond quantitative gains, it
produces human-aligned reasoning traces that reveal the perceptual cues
underlying quality judgments. Code and model are available.

a bounding box around the corresponding components in the physical space, and
where the component should be placed. By connecting assembly instructions with

TL;DR: PALM is a large-scale dataset of 13k hand scans and 90k multi-view images from 263 subjects, enabling realistic single-image hand avatar personalization through PALM-Net.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Creating high-quality personalized hand avatars from images is challenging due to complex geometry, appearance, articulation, unconstrained lighting, and limited views, with limited datasets available.

Method: PALM dataset with 13k hand scans from 263 subjects and 90k multi-view images; PALM-Net uses multi-subject prior over hand geometry and material properties via physically based inverse rendering.

Result: PALM provides rich variation in skin tone, age, and geometry; PALM-Net enables realistic, relightable single-image hand avatar personalization.

Conclusion: PALM's scale and diversity make it a valuable real-world resource for hand modeling and related research.

Abstract: The ability to grasp objects, signal with gestures, and share emotion through
touch all stem from the unique capabilities of human hands. Yet creating
high-quality personalized hand avatars from images remains challenging due to
complex geometry, appearance, and articulation, particularly under
unconstrained lighting and limited views. Progress has also been limited by the
lack of datasets that jointly provide accurate 3D geometry, high-resolution
multiview imagery, and a diverse population of subjects. To address this, we
present PALM, a large-scale dataset comprising 13k high-quality hand scans from
263 subjects and 90k multi-view images, capturing rich variation in skin tone,
age, and geometry. To show its utility, we present a baseline PALM-Net, a
multi-subject prior over hand geometry and material properties learned via
physically based inverse rendering, enabling realistic, relightable
single-image hand avatar personalization. PALM's scale and diversity make it a
valuable real-world resource for hand modeling and related research.

TL;DR: MPRF is a multimodal pipeline using transformer-based foundation models for robust loop closure detection in GNSS-denied environments, combining visual retrieval with explicit 6-DoF pose estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual place recognition fails due to aliasing and weak textures, while LiDAR-based methods suffer from sparsity and ambiguity in unstructured environments like planetary exploration.

Method: Two-stage visual retrieval using DINOv2 features with SALAD aggregation for candidate screening, combined with SONATA-based LiDAR descriptors for geometric verification and explicit 6-DoF pose estimation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval methods in precision on S3LI datasets, enhances pose estimation robustness in low-texture regions, and achieves favorable accuracy-efficiency-reliability trade-off.

Conclusion: MPRF demonstrates the potential of foundation models to unify place recognition and pose estimation, providing interpretable correspondences suitable for SLAM back-ends.

Abstract: Robust loop closure detection is a critical component of Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms in GNSS-denied environments, such as
in the context of planetary exploration. In these settings, visual place
recognition often fails due to aliasing and weak textures, while LiDAR-based
methods suffer from sparsity and ambiguity. This paper presents MPRF, a
multimodal pipeline that leverages transformer-based foundation models for both
vision and LiDAR modalities to achieve robust loop closure in severely
unstructured environments. Unlike prior work limited to retrieval, MPRF
integrates a two-stage visual retrieval strategy with explicit 6-DoF pose
estimation, combining DINOv2 features with SALAD aggregation for efficient
candidate screening and SONATA-based LiDAR descriptors for geometric
verification. Experiments on the S3LI dataset and S3LI Vulcano dataset show
that MPRF outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval methods in precision while
enhancing pose estimation robustness in low-texture regions. By providing
interpretable correspondences suitable for SLAM back-ends, MPRF achieves a
favorable trade-off between accuracy, efficiency, and reliability,
demonstrating the potential of foundation models to unify place recognition and
pose estimation. Code and models will be released at github.com/DLR-RM/MPRF.

*Aupendu Kar,Krishnendu Ghosh,Prabir Kumar Biswas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel continual learning approach for image restoration that modifies convolution layers to adapt knowledge from previous tasks without architectural changes, enabling seamless integration with existing deep architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing continual learning methods for image restoration require heavy architectural modifications and computational overhead, while regularization-based approaches are unsuitable due to different restoration tasks needing different feature processing.

Method: Proposes a simple modification of convolution layers to adapt knowledge from previous restoration tasks without changing the main backbone architecture, allowing application to any deep architecture without structural changes.

Result: Experimental validation shows the model can introduce new restoration tasks without compromising existing task performance, and new task performance improves by adapting knowledge from previous tasks. The approach increases trainable parameters without significant computational overhead or inference time.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides an efficient continual learning solution for image restoration that avoids architectural modifications while maintaining performance across tasks and improving new task learning through knowledge adaptation.

Abstract: Continual learning is an emerging topic in the field of deep learning, where
a model is expected to learn continuously for new upcoming tasks without
forgetting previous experiences. This field has witnessed numerous
advancements, but few works have been attempted in the direction of image
restoration. Handling large image sizes and the divergent nature of various
degradation poses a unique challenge in the restoration domain. However,
existing works require heavily engineered architectural modifications for new
task adaptation, resulting in significant computational overhead.
Regularization-based methods are unsuitable for restoration, as different
restoration challenges require different kinds of feature processing. In this
direction, we propose a simple modification of the convolution layer to adapt
the knowledge from previous restoration tasks without touching the main
backbone architecture. Therefore, it can be seamlessly applied to any deep
architecture without any structural modifications. Unlike other approaches, we
demonstrate that our model can increase the number of trainable parameters
without significantly increasing computational overhead or inference time.
Experimental validation demonstrates that new restoration tasks can be
introduced without compromising the performance of existing tasks. We also show
that performance on new restoration tasks improves by adapting the knowledge
from the knowledge base created by previous restoration tasks. The code is

Motivation: To create synchronized talking faces from text without ground-truth audio at inference, addressing distribution shifts between clean and TTS-predicted features while preserving speaker identity and natural expressiveness.

Method: Two-stage training: pretraining on Wav2Vec2 embeddings and finetuning on TTS outputs, using Text-to-Vec module to generate embeddings that jointly condition speech and face generation.

Result: Conditioning on TTS-predicted latent features outperforms cascaded pipelines, improving both lip-sync accuracy and visual realism in generated talking faces.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables tight audio-visual alignment and produces natural, expressive speech with synchronized facial motion without requiring ground-truth audio during inference.

Abstract: We propose a text-to-talking-face synthesis framework leveraging latent
speech representations from HierSpeech++. A Text-to-Vec module generates
Wav2Vec2 embeddings from text, which jointly condition speech and face
generation. To handle distribution shifts between clean and TTS-predicted
features, we adopt a two-stage training: pretraining on Wav2Vec2 embeddings and
finetuning on TTS outputs. This enables tight audio-visual alignment, preserves
speaker identity, and produces natural, expressive speech and synchronized
facial motion without ground-truth audio at inference. Experiments show that
conditioning on TTS-predicted latent features outperforms cascaded pipelines,
improving both lip-sync and visual realism.

TL;DR: gitmerge3D is a globally informed graph token merging method that reduces token count by 90-95% in 3D point cloud transformers while maintaining competitive performance, challenging the assumption that more tokens yield better results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D point cloud transformers rely on dense token representations that incur high computational and memory costs, with tokens being remarkably redundant and leading to substantial inefficiency.

Method: Introduces gitmerge3D, a globally informed graph token merging method that reduces token count by up to 90-95% while maintaining performance.

Result: The method maintains competitive performance across multiple 3D vision tasks while achieving substantial improvements in computational efficiency.

Conclusion: This work challenges prevailing assumptions about token density, reveals that current models are over-tokenized, and provides insights for developing more efficient 3D foundation architectures.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D point cloud transformers have led to state-of-the-art
results in tasks such as semantic segmentation and reconstruction. However,
these models typically rely on dense token representations, incurring high
computational and memory costs during training and inference. In this work, we
present the finding that tokens are remarkably redundant, leading to
substantial inefficiency. We introduce gitmerge3D, a globally informed graph
token merging method that can reduce the token count by up to 90-95% while
maintaining competitive performance. This finding challenges the prevailing
assumption that more tokens inherently yield better performance and highlights
that many current models are over-tokenized and under-optimized for
scalability. We validate our method across multiple 3D vision tasks and show
consistent improvements in computational efficiency. This work is the first to
assess redundancy in large-scale 3D transformer models, providing insights into
the development of more efficient 3D foundation architectures. Our code and

*Olivier Dietrich,Merlin Alfredsson,Emilia Arens,Nando Metzger,Torben Peters,Linus Scheibenreif,Jan Dirk Wegner,Konrad Schindler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Medium-resolution Copernicus satellite imagery can effectively detect building damage for disaster response, with simpler models outperforming complex architectures in generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable rapid damage assessment using widely available medium-resolution Earth observation data as a complement to limited very-high resolution imagery.

Method: Created xBD-S12 dataset with 10,315 pre/post-disaster Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 image pairs aligned with xBD benchmark, and conducted experiments comparing different model architectures.

Result: Building damage can be detected well despite 10m resolution; simpler models generalize better to unseen disasters than complex architectures; geospatial foundation models provide little practical benefit.

Conclusion: Copernicus imagery is viable for wide-area damage assessment and can complement VHR imagery, with simpler models being more effective for this task.

Abstract: Natural disasters demand rapid damage assessment to guide humanitarian
response. Here, we investigate whether medium-resolution Earth observation
images from the Copernicus program can support building damage assessment,
complementing very-high resolution imagery with often limited availability. We
introduce xBD-S12, a dataset of 10,315 pre- and post-disaster image pairs from
both Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2, spatially and temporally aligned with the
established xBD benchmark. In a series of experiments, we demonstrate that
building damage can be detected and mapped rather well in many disaster
scenarios, despite the moderate 10$\,$m ground sampling distance. We also find
that, for damage mapping at that resolution, architectural sophistication does
not seem to bring much advantage: more complex model architectures tend to
struggle with generalization to unseen disasters, and geospatial foundation
models bring little practical benefit. Our results suggest that Copernicus
images are a viable data source for rapid, wide-area damage assessment and
could play an important role alongside VHR imagery. We release the xBD-S12
dataset, code, and trained models to support further research.

TL;DR: A novel photo dating method that estimates when a photo was taken using face information, with a new dataset CSFD-1.6M containing 1.6M annotated faces from movie stills.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a photo dating system that leverages facial information rather than just scene context, addressing the limitation of existing methods that don't utilize multiple faces in images.

Method: A probabilistic framework combining modern face recognition and age estimation models with career-based temporal priors, using multi-face information aggregation from the CSFD-1.6M dataset.

Result: Aggregating evidence from multiple faces consistently improves performance, significantly outperforming scene-based baselines, especially for images with several identifiable individuals.

Conclusion: Multi-face information aggregation is highly effective for photo dating, with the proposed probabilistic framework showing superior performance over traditional scene-based approaches.

Abstract: We introduce a novel method for Photo Dating which estimates the year a
photograph was taken by leveraging information from the faces of people present
in the image. To facilitate this research, we publicly release CSFD-1.6M, a new
dataset containing over 1.6 million annotated faces, primarily from movie
stills, with identity and birth year annotations. Uniquely, our dataset
provides annotations for multiple individuals within a single image, enabling
the study of multi-face information aggregation. We propose a probabilistic
framework that formally combines visual evidence from modern face recognition
and age estimation models, and career-based temporal priors to infer the photo
capture year. Our experiments demonstrate that aggregating evidence from
multiple faces consistently improves the performance and the approach
significantly outperforms strong, scene-based baselines, particularly for
images containing several identifiable individuals.

TL;DR: Real-time flow regime classification using neuromorphic sensors achieves 97.6% accuracy with 0.28ms processing time, outperforming conventional optical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow boiling is efficient but sudden flow regime shifts disrupt thermal performance, requiring accurate low-latency monitoring that conventional optical imaging cannot provide due to computational demands and insufficient temporal resolution.

Method: Developed five classification models using traditional image data and event-based data from neuromorphic sensors, which detect brightness changes at individual pixels without full-frame reconstruction, enabling fast motion detection.

Result: Event-based models outperform frame-based approaches, with the event-based LSTM model achieving 97.6% classification accuracy with 0.28ms processing time, supported by an asynchronous processing pipeline with majority voting for stable output.

Conclusion: The proposed neuromorphic sensor-based framework enables reliable real-time flow regime monitoring for experimental control and intelligent thermal management, overcoming limitations of conventional optical methods.

Abstract: Flow boiling is an efficient heat transfer mechanism capable of dissipating
high heat loads with minimal temperature variation, making it an ideal thermal
management method. However, sudden shifts between flow regimes can disrupt
thermal performance and system reliability, highlighting the need for accurate
and low-latency real-time monitoring. Conventional optical imaging methods are
limited by high computational demands and insufficient temporal resolution,
making them inadequate for capturing transient flow behavior. To address this,
we propose a real-time framework based on signals from neuromorphic sensors for
flow regime classification. Neuromorphic sensors detect changes in brightness
at individual pixels, which typically correspond to motion at edges, enabling
fast and efficient detection without full-frame reconstruction, providing
event-based information. We develop five classification models using both
traditional image data and event-based data, demonstrating that models
leveraging event data outperform frame-based approaches due to their
sensitivity to dynamic flow features. Among these models, the event-based long
short-term memory model provides the best balance between accuracy and speed,
achieving 97.6% classification accuracy with a processing time of 0.28 ms. Our
asynchronous processing pipeline supports continuous, low-latency predictions
and delivers stable output through a majority voting mechanisms, enabling
reliable real-time feedback for experimental control and intelligent thermal
management.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the potential of integrating natural language understanding with advanced backbone architectures for superior object detection accuracy, efficiency, and real-world adaptability.

Abstract: This paper introduces a cutting-edge approach to cross-modal interaction for
tiny object detection by combining semantic-guided natural language processing
with advanced visual recognition backbones. The proposed method integrates the
BERT language model with the CNN-based Parallel Residual Bi-Fusion Feature
Pyramid Network (PRB-FPN-Net), incorporating innovative backbone architectures
such as ELAN, MSP, and CSP to optimize feature extraction and fusion. By
employing lemmatization and fine-tuning techniques, the system aligns semantic
cues from textual inputs with visual features, enhancing detection precision
for small and complex objects. Experimental validation using the COCO and
Objects365 datasets demonstrates that the model achieves superior performance.
On the COCO2017 validation set, it attains a 52.6% average precision (AP),
outperforming YOLO-World significantly while maintaining half the parameter
consumption of Transformer-based models like GLIP. Several test on different of

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GroupKAN introduces grouped functional modules to reduce computational complexity in medical image segmentation while maintaining high accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like U-KAN face scalability issues due to O(C^2) complexity from full-channel transformations, limiting their practical application as channel numbers increase.

Method: Proposes two novel modules: (1) Grouped KAN Transform that partitions channels into groups for multivariate spline mappings, reducing complexity to O(C^2/G), and (2) Grouped KAN Activation that applies shared spline-based mappings within channel groups for efficient token-wise nonlinearity.

Result: Achieves 79.80% average IoU on three medical benchmarks (BUSI, GlaS, CVC), surpassing U-KAN by +1.11% while using only 47.6% of parameters (3.02M vs 6.35M), with improved interpretability.

Conclusion: GroupKAN successfully addresses the scalability limitations of previous KAN-based methods while maintaining high segmentation accuracy and interpretability through efficient grouped functional transformations.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation requires models that are accurate, lightweight,
and interpretable. Convolutional architectures lack adaptive nonlinearity and
transparent decision-making, whereas Transformer architectures are hindered by
quadratic complexity and opaque attention mechanisms. U-KAN addresses these
challenges using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, achieving higher accuracy than
both convolutional and attention-based methods, fewer parameters than
Transformer variants, and improved interpretability compared to conventional
approaches. However, its O(C^2) complexity due to full-channel transformations
limits its scalability as the number of channels increases. To overcome this,
we introduce GroupKAN, a lightweight segmentation network that incorporates two
novel, structured functional modules: (1) Grouped KAN Transform, which
partitions channels into G groups for multivariate spline mappings, reducing
complexity to O(C^2/G), and (2) Grouped KAN Activation, which applies shared
spline-based mappings within each channel group for efficient, token-wise
nonlinearity. Evaluated on three medical benchmarks (BUSI, GlaS, and CVC),
GroupKAN achieves an average IoU of 79.80 percent, surpassing U-KAN by +1.11
percent while requiring only 47.6 percent of the parameters (3.02M vs 6.35M),
and shows improved interpretability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TimeSearch-R reformulates temporal search as interleaved text-video thinking using reinforcement learning, introducing GRPO-CSV with self-verification to improve video reasoning completeness and achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing temporal search methods rely on hand-crafted search processes without end-to-end optimization for learning optimal search strategies, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: Proposes TimeSearch-R with GRPO-CSV (Group Relative Policy Optimization with Completeness Self-Verification) that integrates searching video clips into reasoning through RL and verifies frame adequacy using the same policy model.

Result: Achieves significant improvements on temporal search benchmarks (Haystack-LVBench, Haystack-Ego4D) and long-form video understanding benchmarks (VideoMME, MLVU), with 4.1% improvement over Qwen2.5-VL and 2.0% over Video-R1 on LongVideoBench.

Conclusion: TimeSearch-R establishes new state-of-the-art performance by effectively integrating temporal search with video reasoning through reinforcement learning and self-verification mechanisms.

Abstract: Temporal search aims to identify a minimal set of relevant frames from tens
of thousands based on a given query, serving as a foundation for accurate
long-form video understanding. Existing works attempt to progressively narrow
the search space. However, these approaches typically rely on a hand-crafted
search process, lacking end-to-end optimization for learning optimal search
strategies. In this paper, we propose TimeSearch-R, which reformulates temporal
search as interleaved text-video thinking, seamlessly integrating searching
video clips into the reasoning process through reinforcement learning (RL).
However, applying RL training methods, such as Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), to video reasoning can result in unsupervised intermediate
search decisions. This leads to insufficient exploration of the video content
and inconsistent logical reasoning. To address these issues, we introduce GRPO
with Completeness Self-Verification (GRPO-CSV), which gathers searched video
frames from the interleaved reasoning process and utilizes the same policy
model to verify the adequacy of searched frames, thereby improving the
completeness of video reasoning. Additionally, we construct datasets
specifically designed for the SFT cold-start and RL training of GRPO-CSV,
filtering out samples with weak temporal dependencies to enhance task
difficulty and improve temporal search capabilities. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that TimeSearch-R achieves significant improvements on temporal
search benchmarks such as Haystack-LVBench and Haystack-Ego4D, as well as
long-form video understanding benchmarks like VideoMME and MLVU. Notably,
TimeSearch-R establishes a new state-of-the-art on LongVideoBench with 4.1%
improvement over the base model Qwen2.5-VL and 2.0% over the advanced video
reasoning model Video-R1. Our code is available at

TL;DR: VST is a framework that enhances VLMs' spatial abilities through large-scale datasets and progressive training, achieving SOTA results without harming general capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve spatial awareness in VLMs without adding extra encoders that cause overhead and harm general capabilities.

Method: Uses VST-P (4.1M samples) for spatial perception and VST-R (135K samples) for spatial reasoning, with progressive training: supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art results: 34.8% on MMSI-Bench and 61.2% on VSIBench.

Conclusion: Vision-Language-Action models can be significantly enhanced with spatial tuning, paving the way for more physically grounded AI.

Abstract: Capturing spatial relationships from visual inputs is a cornerstone of
human-like general intelligence. Several previous studies have tried to enhance
the spatial awareness of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by adding extra expert
encoders, which brings extra overhead and usually harms general capabilities.
To enhance the spatial ability in general architectures, we introduce Visual
Spatial Tuning (VST), a comprehensive framework to cultivate VLMs with
human-like visuospatial abilities, from spatial perception to reasoning. We
first attempt to enhance spatial perception in VLMs by constructing a
large-scale dataset termed VST-P, which comprises 4.1 million samples spanning
19 skills across single views, multiple images, and videos. Then, we present
VST-R, a curated dataset with 135K samples that instruct models to reason in
space. In particular, we adopt a progressive training pipeline: supervised
fine-tuning to build foundational spatial knowledge, followed by reinforcement
learning to further improve spatial reasoning abilities. Without the
side-effect to general capabilities, the proposed VST consistently achieves
state-of-the-art results on several spatial benchmarks, including $34.8\%$ on
MMSI-Bench and $61.2\%$ on VSIBench. It turns out that the
Vision-Language-Action models can be significantly enhanced with the proposed
spatial tuning paradigm, paving the way for more physically grounded AI.
