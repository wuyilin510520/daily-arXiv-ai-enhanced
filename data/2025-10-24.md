*Sai Teja Erukude,Viswa Chaitanya Marella,Suhasnadh Reddy Veluru*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Using frequency-domain analysis with 2D DFT and ResNet50 to detect StyleGAN-generated images, achieving 92.8% accuracy and 0.95 AUC by identifying unique frequency signatures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid rise of photorealistic GAN-generated images poses serious challenges for image forensics and industrial systems requiring reliable content authenticity.

Method: Applied 2D Discrete Fourier Transform to convert images to frequency domain, then trained ResNet50 neural network on these transformed images to detect periodic artifacts and distinguish real from synthetic images.

Result: Frequency-domain model achieved 92.8% accuracy and 0.95 AUC, significantly outperforming equivalent model trained on raw spatial-domain images, revealing unique frequency-domain signatures in GAN-generated images.

Conclusion: GAN-generated images have detectable frequency-domain fingerprints, and combining signal processing with deep learning has strong industrial potential for enhancing digital forensics and AI system trustworthiness.

Abstract: The rapid rise of photorealistic images produced from Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) poses a serious challenge for image forensics and industrial
systems requiring reliable content authenticity. This paper uses
frequency-domain analysis combined with deep learning to solve the problem of
distinguishing StyleGAN-generated images from real ones. Specifically, a
two-dimensional Discrete Fourier Transform (2D DFT) was applied to transform
images into the Fourier domain, where subtle periodic artifacts become
detectable. A ResNet50 neural network is trained on these transformed images to
differentiate between real and synthetic ones. The experiments demonstrate that
the frequency-domain model achieves a 92.8 percent and an AUC of 0.95,
significantly outperforming the equivalent model trained on raw spatial-domain
images. These results indicate that the GAN-generated images have unique
frequency-domain signatures or "fingerprints". The method proposed highlights
the industrial potential of combining signal processing techniques and deep
learning to enhance digital forensics and strengthen the trustworthiness of
industrial AI systems.

### [2] [Transformed Multi-view 3D Shape Features with Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19955)
*Márcus Vinícius Lobo Costa,Sherlon Almeida da Silva,Bárbara Caroline Benato,Leo Sampaio Ferraz Ribeiro,Moacir Antonelli Ponti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision Transformers with contrastive learning achieve strong 3D shape understanding from 2D images, reaching 90.6% accuracy on ModelNet10 without extensive labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Computer vision struggles with 3D object recognition from 2D images due to CNNs' limitations in capturing shape relationships and the need for extensive labeled data.

Method: Combines Vision Transformers (ViTs) with contrastive learning objectives (both supervised and self-supervised) for multi-view 3D analysis, leveraging ViTs' global shape understanding and contrastive learning's feature refinement.

Result: Achieved 90.6% accuracy on ModelNet10, demonstrating that ViTs with contrastive learning effectively capture global shape semantics and local discriminative features for 3D representation learning.

Conclusion: The empirical approach validates that combining ViTs with contrastive objectives successfully overcomes CNN limitations and reduces dependency on labeled data for 3D shape understanding.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges in representation learning of 3D shape
features by investigating state-of-the-art backbones paired with both
contrastive supervised and self-supervised learning objectives. Computer vision
methods struggle with recognizing 3D objects from 2D images, often requiring
extensive labeled data and relying on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that
may overlook crucial shape relationships. Our work demonstrates that Vision
Transformers (ViTs) based architectures, when paired with modern contrastive
objectives, achieve promising results in multi-view 3D analysis on our
downstream tasks, unifying contrastive and 3D shape understanding pipelines.
For example, supervised contrastive losses reached about 90.6% accuracy on
ModelNet10. The use of ViTs and contrastive learning, leveraging ViTs' ability
to understand overall shapes and contrastive learning's effectiveness,
overcomes the need for extensive labeled data and the limitations of CNNs in
capturing crucial shape relationships. The success stems from capturing global
shape semantics via ViTs and refining local discriminative features through
contrastive optimization. Importantly, our approach is empirical, as it is
grounded on extensive experimental evaluation to validate the effectiveness of
combining ViTs with contrastive objectives for 3D representation learning.

### [3] [FutrTrack: A Camera-LiDAR Fusion Transformer for 3D Multiple Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19981)
*Martha Teiko Teye,Ori Maoz,Matthias Rottmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FutrTrack is a modular camera-LiDAR multi-object tracking framework that uses transformer-based refinement and fusion tracking to improve 3D object tracking performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance 3D multi-object tracking by leveraging multimodal sensor fusion (camera and LiDAR) without explicit motion models, addressing challenges like occlusion and viewpoint changes.

Method: Uses a two-stage transformer pipeline with temporal smoothing over moving windows, integrates bounding boxes with BEV fusion features from cameras and LiDAR, and employs identity propagation using geometric and semantic cues.

Result: Achieves 74.7 aMOTA on nuScenes test set, reduces identity switches while maintaining competitive accuracy, and outperforms single-sensor approaches on nuScenes and KITTI benchmarks.

Conclusion: Query-based transformer tracking methods significantly benefit from multimodal sensor features, providing an efficient framework that competes with neural-network-based methods without pretraining.

Abstract: We propose FutrTrack, a modular camera-LiDAR multi-object tracking framework
that builds on existing 3D detectors by introducing a transformer-based
smoother and a fusion-driven tracker. Inspired by query-based tracking
frameworks, FutrTrack employs a multimodal two-stage transformer refinement and
tracking pipeline. Our fusion tracker integrates bounding boxes with multimodal
bird's-eye-view (BEV) fusion features from multiple cameras and LiDAR without
the need for an explicit motion model. The tracker assigns and propagates
identities across frames, leveraging both geometric and semantic cues for
robust re-identification under occlusion and viewpoint changes. Prior to
tracking, we refine sequences of bounding boxes with a temporal smoother over a
moving window to refine trajectories, reduce jitter, and improve spatial
consistency. Evaluated on nuScenes and KITTI, FutrTrack demonstrates that
query-based transformer tracking methods benefit significantly from multimodal
sensor features compared with previous single-sensor approaches. With an aMOTA
of 74.7 on the nuScenes test set, FutrTrack achieves strong performance on 3D
MOT benchmarks, reducing identity switches while maintaining competitive
accuracy. Our approach provides an efficient framework for improving
transformer-based trackers to compete with other neural-network-based methods
even with limited data and without pretraining.

### [4] [Improving Predictive Confidence in Medical Imaging via Online Label Smoothing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20011)
*Kushan Choudhury,Shubhrodeep Roy,Ankur Chanda,Shubhajit Biswas,Somenath Kuiry*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Online Label Smoothing (OLS) improves medical image classification by dynamically adjusting soft labels during training, achieving better accuracy and calibration than traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models in medical imaging often produce overconfident predictions, undermining reliability. Traditional label smoothing treats all non-target classes equally, ignoring class relationships.

Method: Used Online Label Smoothing (OLS) that dynamically adjusts soft labels based on model's prediction patterns. Evaluated on RadImageNet dataset with ResNet-50, MobileNetV2, and VGG-19 architectures.

Result: OLS consistently improved Top-1 and Top-5 classification accuracy compared to hard labels, conventional label smoothing, and teacher-free knowledge distillation. Also produced more compact and well-separated feature embeddings.

Conclusion: OLS strengthens predictive performance and enhances calibration, making it a practical solution for developing trustworthy AI systems in medical imaging.

Abstract: Deep learning models, especially convolutional neural networks, have achieved
impressive results in medical image classification. However, these models often
produce overconfident predictions, which can undermine their reliability in
critical healthcare settings. While traditional label smoothing offers a simple
way to reduce such overconfidence, it fails to consider relationships between
classes by treating all non-target classes equally. In this study, we explore
the use of Online Label Smoothing (OLS), a dynamic approach that adjusts soft
labels throughout training based on the model's own prediction patterns. We
evaluate OLS on the large-scale RadImageNet dataset using three widely used
architectures: ResNet-50, MobileNetV2, and VGG-19. Our results show that OLS
consistently improves both Top-1 and Top-5 classification accuracy compared to
standard training methods, including hard labels, conventional label smoothing,
and teacher-free knowledge distillation. In addition to accuracy gains, OLS
leads to more compact and well-separated feature embeddings, indicating
improved representation learning. These findings suggest that OLS not only
strengthens predictive performance but also enhances calibration, making it a
practical and effective solution for developing trustworthy AI systems in the
medical imaging domain.

### [5] [A Unified Detection Pipeline for Robust Object Detection in Fisheye-Based Traffic Surveillance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20016)
*Neema Jakisa Owor,Joshua Kofi Asamoah,Tanner Wambui Muturi,Anneliese Jakisa Owor,Blessing Agyei Kyem,Andrews Danyo,Yaw Adu-Gyamfi,Armstrong Aboah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A detection framework for fisheye cameras that addresses radial distortion challenges through pre/post-processing and ensemble methods, achieving 8th place in AI City Challenge 2025.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fisheye cameras capture wide fields of view for traffic surveillance but suffer from radial distortion and nonuniform resolution, especially near image boundaries, which degrades standard object detector performance.

Method: Uses pre and post-processing pipeline to enhance detection consistency across distorted regions, trains multiple state-of-the-art detection models on fisheye traffic imagery, and combines outputs through ensemble strategy.

Result: Achieved F1 score of 0.6366 on 2025 AI City Challenge Track 4, ranking 8th out of 62 teams.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses fisheye imagery challenges and demonstrates robustness in handling distortion-related detection issues.

Abstract: Fisheye cameras offer an efficient solution for wide-area traffic
surveillance by capturing large fields of view from a single vantage point.
However, the strong radial distortion and nonuniform resolution inherent in
fisheye imagery introduce substantial challenges for standard object detectors,
particularly near image boundaries where object appearance is severely
degraded. In this work, we present a detection framework designed to operate
robustly under these conditions. Our approach employs a simple yet effective
pre and post processing pipeline that enhances detection consistency across the
image, especially in regions affected by severe distortion. We train several
state-of-the-art detection models on the fisheye traffic imagery and combine
their outputs through an ensemble strategy to improve overall detection
accuracy. Our method achieves an F1 score of0.6366 on the 2025 AI City
Challenge Track 4, placing 8thoverall out of 62 teams. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in addressing issues inherent to
fisheye imagery.

### [6] [Extreme Views: 3DGS Filter for Novel View Synthesis from Out-of-Distribution Camera Poses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20027)
*Damian Bowness,Charalambos Poullis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A real-time filtering method for 3D Gaussian Splatting that reduces visual noise when viewing models from extrapolated camera positions outside training distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS models exhibit substantial visual noise when viewed from camera positions outside training distribution due to lack of data in extrapolated regions, causing uncertain density, color, and geometry predictions.

Method: Proposes a real-time render-aware filtering method using sensitivity scores from intermediate gradients, targeting instabilities from anisotropic orientations rather than isotropic variance to address generative uncertainty.

Result: Substantially improves visual quality, realism, and consistency compared to existing NeRF-based approaches like BayesRays, while maintaining real-time performance.

Conclusion: The filter seamlessly integrates into existing 3DGS rendering pipelines in real-time without requiring extensive retraining or fine-tuning, enabling high visual fidelity during free navigation outside original training viewpoints.

Abstract: When viewing a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model from camera positions
significantly outside the training data distribution, substantial visual noise
commonly occurs. These artifacts result from the lack of training data in these
extrapolated regions, leading to uncertain density, color, and geometry
predictions from the model.
  To address this issue, we propose a novel real-time render-aware filtering
method. Our approach leverages sensitivity scores derived from intermediate
gradients, explicitly targeting instabilities caused by anisotropic
orientations rather than isotropic variance. This filtering method directly
addresses the core issue of generative uncertainty, allowing 3D reconstruction
systems to maintain high visual fidelity even when users freely navigate
outside the original training viewpoints.
  Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our method substantially improves
visual quality, realism, and consistency compared to existing Neural Radiance
Field (NeRF)-based approaches such as BayesRays. Critically, our filter
seamlessly integrates into existing 3DGS rendering pipelines in real-time,
unlike methods that require extensive post-hoc retraining or fine-tuning.

### [7] [BrainPuzzle: Hybrid Physics and Data-Driven Reconstruction for Transcranial Ultrasound Tomography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20029)
*Shengyu Chen,Shihang Feng,Yi Luo,Xiaowei Jia,Youzuo Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BrainPuzzle is a hybrid two-stage framework combining physics-based modeling with machine learning to achieve quantitative transcranial ultrasound brain imaging by reconstructing accurate speed-of-sound maps under challenging conditions of skull attenuation and sparse-aperture acquisitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ultrasound brain imaging faces challenges due to skull-induced signal attenuation, mode conversion, phase aberration, and the impracticality of full-aperture arrays. Physics-based methods struggle with weak signals, while purely data-driven methods produce quantitatively biased results under low SNR and sparse-aperture conditions.

Method: A two-stage hybrid framework: (1) Reverse time migration (time-reversal acoustics) applied to multi-angle acquisitions produces migration fragments preserving structural details under low SNR; (2) A transformer-based super-resolution encoder-decoder with graph-based attention unit fuses fragments into coherent SoS images. Uses partial-array acquisition with movable low-count transducers.

Result: Experiments on two synthetic datasets show BrainPuzzle achieves superior SoS reconstruction accuracy and image completeness compared to existing methods, demonstrating robust performance under challenging transcranial imaging conditions.

Conclusion: BrainPuzzle effectively addresses the limitations of both physics-based and purely data-driven approaches for transcranial ultrasound, showing potential to advance quantitative ultrasound brain imaging through its hybrid framework that compensates for missing aperture and maintains accuracy under low SNR conditions.

Abstract: Ultrasound brain imaging remains challenging due to the large difference in
sound speed between the skull and brain tissues and the difficulty of coupling
large probes to the skull. This work aims to achieve quantitative transcranial
ultrasound by reconstructing an accurate speed-of-sound (SoS) map of the brain.
Traditional physics-based full-waveform inversion (FWI) is limited by weak
signals caused by skull-induced attenuation, mode conversion, and phase
aberration, as well as incomplete spatial coverage since full-aperture arrays
are clinically impractical. In contrast, purely data-driven methods that learn
directly from raw ultrasound data often fail to model the complex nonlinear and
nonlocal wave propagation through bone, leading to anatomically plausible but
quantitatively biased SoS maps under low signal-to-noise and sparse-aperture
conditions. To address these issues, we propose BrainPuzzle, a hybrid two-stage
framework that combines physical modeling with machine learning. In the first
stage, reverse time migration (time-reversal acoustics) is applied to
multi-angle acquisitions to produce migration fragments that preserve
structural details even under low SNR. In the second stage, a transformer-based
super-resolution encoder-decoder with a graph-based attention unit (GAU) fuses
these fragments into a coherent and quantitatively accurate SoS image. A
partial-array acquisition strategy using a movable low-count transducer set
improves feasibility and coupling, while the hybrid algorithm compensates for
the missing aperture. Experiments on two synthetic datasets show that
BrainPuzzle achieves superior SoS reconstruction accuracy and image
completeness, demonstrating its potential for advancing quantitative ultrasound
brain imaging.

### [8] [Exposing Blindspots: Cultural Bias Evaluation in Generative Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20042)
*Huichan Seo,Sieun Choi,Minki Hong,Yi Zhou,Junseo Kim,Lukman Ismaila,Naome Etori,Mehul Agarwal,Zhixuan Liu,Jihie Kim,Jean Oh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a unified evaluation framework for cultural bias in both text-to-image (T2I) generation and image-to-image (I2I) editing systems, revealing that models default to Global-North depictions, I2I editing erodes cultural fidelity, and current systems apply superficial cultural cues rather than context-aware changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in cultural bias research by examining both T2I generation and I2I editing systems, which have been underexplored compared to T2I systems alone.

Method: Developed a unified evaluation framework across six countries using an 8-category/36-subcategory schema with era-aware prompts. Used open models with fixed settings and combined automatic metrics, culture-aware retrieval-augmented VQA, and expert human judgments from native reviewers.

Result: Three key findings: (1) models default to Global-North, modern-leaning depictions under country-agnostic prompts; (2) iterative I2I editing erodes cultural fidelity despite conventional metrics; (3) I2I models apply superficial cues rather than era-consistent, context-aware changes.

Conclusion: Culture-sensitive edits remain unreliable in current systems, and the study provides a reproducible, culture-centered benchmark for diagnosing and tracking cultural bias in generative image models.

Abstract: Generative image models produce striking visuals yet often misrepresent
culture. Prior work has examined cultural bias mainly in text-to-image (T2I)
systems, leaving image-to-image (I2I) editors underexplored. We bridge this gap
with a unified evaluation across six countries, an 8-category/36-subcategory
schema, and era-aware prompts, auditing both T2I generation and I2I editing
under a standardized protocol that yields comparable diagnostics. Using open
models with fixed settings, we derive cross-country, cross-era, and
cross-category evaluations. Our framework combines standard automatic metrics,
a culture-aware retrieval-augmented VQA, and expert human judgments collected
from native reviewers. To enable reproducibility, we release the complete image
corpus, prompts, and configurations. Our study reveals three findings: (1)
under country-agnostic prompts, models default to Global-North, modern-leaning
depictions that flatten cross-country distinctions; (2) iterative I2I editing
erodes cultural fidelity even when conventional metrics remain flat or improve;
and (3) I2I models apply superficial cues (palette shifts, generic props)
rather than era-consistent, context-aware changes, often retaining source
identity for Global-South targets. These results highlight that
culture-sensitive edits remain unreliable in current systems. By releasing
standardized data, prompts, and human evaluation protocols, we provide a
reproducible, culture-centered benchmark for diagnosing and tracking cultural
bias in generative image models.

### [9] [Filter-Based Reconstruction of Images from Events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20071)
*Bernd Pfrommer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FIBAR is a simple filter-based method for reconstructing intensity images from event camera data, running efficiently on CPU without neural networks, though producing noisier results than deep learning approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current event camera image reconstruction methods rely heavily on neural networks running on GPUs, which are complex and computationally expensive. There's a need for simpler, more efficient methods that can run on standard CPUs.

Method: Uses temporal digital IIR filter to integrate intensity changes from events, detects stale pixels with a novel algorithm that tracks recently updated pixels, and applies Gaussian filtering to stale pixels based on the assumption that absence of events indicates low image gradient.

Result: FIBAR runs on laptop CPU at 42-140 million events/s, is asynchronous allowing arbitrary time read-out, but produces noisier reconstructions with ghost images compared to neural network methods. However, it's sufficient for tasks like fiducial marker detection.

Conclusion: FIBAR provides a simpler, CPU-efficient alternative to neural network methods for event camera image reconstruction, suitable for certain applications despite producing noisier results with ghost artifacts.

Abstract: Reconstructing an intensity image from the events of a moving event camera is
a challenging task that is typically approached with neural networks deployed
on graphics processing units. This paper presents a much simpler, FIlter Based
Asynchronous Reconstruction method (FIBAR). First, intensity changes signaled
by events are integrated with a temporal digital IIR filter. To reduce
reconstruction noise, stale pixels are detected by a novel algorithm that
regulates a window of recently updated pixels. Arguing that for a moving
camera, the absence of events at a pixel location likely implies a low image
gradient, stale pixels are then blurred with a Gaussian filter. In contrast to
most existing methods, FIBAR is asynchronous and permits image read-out at an
arbitrary time. It runs on a modern laptop CPU at about 42(140) million
events/s with (without) spatial filtering enabled. A few simple qualitative
experiments are presented that show the difference in image reconstruction
between FIBAR and a neural network-based approach (FireNet). FIBAR's
reconstruction is noisier than neural network-based methods and suffers from
ghost images. However, it is sufficient for certain tasks such as the detection
of fiducial markers. Code is available at

### [10] [Data-Adaptive Transformed Bilateral Tensor Low-Rank Representation for Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20077)
*Hui Chen,Xinjie Wang,Xianchao Xiu,Wanquan Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TBTLRR is a novel tensor low-rank representation model that learns adaptive unitary transforms and exploits bilateral tensor structure for improved image clustering with better noise robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tensor low-rank representation methods use fixed transformations and have poor robustness to noise, limiting their effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

Method: Proposes TBTLRR with data-adaptive tensor nuclear norm via learned unitary transforms, bilateral structure for local correlations, and integrates ℓ₁/₂-norm and Frobenius norm regularization for noise handling. Uses ADMM-based optimization with theoretical convergence.

Result: Extensive experiments show TBTLRR achieves superior clustering performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: TBTLRR effectively captures global and local correlations while handling complex noise, making it a robust solution for image clustering tasks.

Abstract: Tensor low-rank representation (TLRR) has demonstrated significant success in
image clustering. However, most existing methods rely on fixed transformations
and suffer from poor robustness to noise. In this paper, we propose a novel
transformed bilateral tensor low-rank representation model called TBTLRR, which
introduces a data-adaptive tensor nuclear norm by learning arbitrary unitary
transforms, allowing for more effective capture of global correlations. In
addition, by leveraging the bilateral structure of latent tensor data, TBTLRR
is able to exploit local correlations between image samples and features.
Furthermore, TBTLRR integrates the $\ell_{1/2}$-norm and Frobenius norm
regularization terms for better dealing with complex noise in real-world
scenarios. To solve the proposed nonconvex model, we develop an efficient
optimization algorithm inspired by the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM) and provide theoretical convergence. Extensive experiments
validate its superiority over the state-of-the-art methods in clustering. The
code will be available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/TBTLRR.

*Lorenzo Arboit,Dennis N. Schneider,Britty Baby,Vinkle Srivastav,Pietro Mascagni,Nicolas Padoy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Endoshare is a source-available, cross-platform application for merging, standardizing, and de-identifying endoscopic videos in minimally invasive surgery, addressing privacy concerns and heterogeneous recording formats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video-based assessment and surgical data science are limited by heterogeneous recording formats and privacy concerns associated with video sharing, hindering widespread adoption in surgical training, research, and quality improvement.

Method: Developed following software development life cycle with iterative, user-centered feedback. Used privacy-by-design architecture based on usability heuristics survey. Tested with clinicians and computer scientists using Technology Acceptance Model constructs and benchmarking across hardware configurations.

After refinement, surgeons reported high perceived usefulness (5.07/7), ease of use (5.15/7), heuristic usability (4.38/5), and strong recommendation (9.20/10). Processing time varied with mode, video duration, and computational power.

Conclusion: Endoshare provides a transparent, user-friendly pipeline for standardized, privacy-preserving surgical video management. Needs compliance certification and broader interoperability validation to become a deployable alternative to proprietary systems.

Abstract: Video-based assessment and surgical data science can advance surgical
training, research, and quality improvement. However, widespread use remains
limited by heterogeneous recording formats and privacy concerns associated with
video sharing. We present Endoshare, a source-available, cross-platform
application for merging, standardizing, and de-identifying endoscopic videos in
minimally invasive surgery. Development followed the software development life
cycle with iterative, user-centered feedback. During the analysis phase, an
internal survey of clinicians and computer scientists based on ten usability
heuristics identified key requirements that guided a privacy-by-design
architecture. In the testing phase, an external clinician survey combined the
same heuristics with Technology Acceptance Model constructs to assess usability
and adoption, complemented by benchmarking across different hardware
configurations. Four clinicians and four computer scientists initially tested
the prototype, reporting high usability (4.68 +/- 0.40/5 and 4.03 +/- 0.51/5),
with the lowest score (4.00 +/- 0.93/5) relating to label clarity. After
refinement, the testing phase surveyed ten surgeons who reported high perceived
usefulness (5.07 +/- 1.75/7), ease of use (5.15 +/- 1.71/7), heuristic
usability (4.38 +/- 0.48/5), and strong recommendation (9.20 +/- 0.79/10).
Processing time varied with processing mode, video duration (both p <= 0.001),
and machine computational power (p = 0.041). Endoshare provides a transparent,
user-friendly pipeline for standardized, privacy-preserving surgical video
management. Compliance certification and broader interoperability validation
are needed to establish it as a deployable alternative to proprietary systems.

### [12] [Attentive Convolution: Unifying the Expressivity of Self-Attention with Convolutional Efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20092)
*Hao Yu,Haoyu Chen,Yan Jiang,Wei Peng,Zhaodong Sun,Samuel Kaski,Guoying Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ATConv is a novel convolutional operator that incorporates adaptive routing and lateral inhibition principles from self-attention, achieving better performance than SA mechanisms with only 3×3 kernels while maintaining linear complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the performance gap between self-attention and convolutions by identifying and incorporating the key principles that give SA its expressive power over traditional convolutions.

Method: Proposed Attentive Convolution (ATConv), which reformulates the convolutional operator to include adaptive routing (dynamic position information flow based on semantic content) and lateral inhibition (score competition that suppresses redundancy).

Result: ATConv with 3×3 kernels consistently outperforms various SA mechanisms in vision tasks. AttNet achieves 84.4% ImageNet-1K accuracy with 27M parameters. In diffusion models, replacing SA with ATConv reduces FID by 0.15 with faster sampling.

Conclusion: ATConv successfully captures the intrinsic expressivity of self-attention while maintaining the efficiency benefits of convolutions, demonstrating that principled reformulation of CNNs can bridge the performance gap with attention-based models.

Abstract: Self-attention (SA) has become the cornerstone of modern vision backbones for
its powerful expressivity over traditional Convolutions (Conv). However, its
quadratic complexity remains a critical bottleneck for practical applications.
Given that Conv offers linear complexity and strong visual priors, continuing
efforts have been made to promote the renaissance of Conv. However, a
persistent performance chasm remains, highlighting that these modernizations
have not yet captured the intrinsic expressivity that defines SA. In this
paper, we re-examine the design of the CNNs, directed by a key question: what
principles give SA its edge over Conv? As a result, we reveal two fundamental
insights that challenge the long-standing design intuitions in prior research
(e.g., Receptive field). The two findings are: (1) \textit{Adaptive routing}:
SA dynamically regulates positional information flow according to semantic
content, whereas Conv employs static kernels uniformly across all positions.
(2) \textit{Lateral inhibition}: SA induces score competition among token
weighting, effectively suppressing redundancy and sharpening representations,
whereas Conv filters lack such inhibitory dynamics and exhibit considerable
redundancy. Based on this, we propose \textit{Attentive Convolution} (ATConv),
a principled reformulation of the convolutional operator that intrinsically
injects these principles. Interestingly, with only $3\times3$ kernels, ATConv
consistently outperforms various SA mechanisms in fundamental vision tasks.
Building on ATConv, we introduce AttNet, a CNN family that can attain
\textbf{84.4\%} ImageNet-1K Top-1 accuracy with only 27M parameters. In
diffusion-based image generation, replacing all SA with the proposed $3\times
3$ ATConv in SiT-XL/2 reduces ImageNet FID by 0.15 in 400k steps with faster
sampling. Code is available at: github.com/price112/Attentive-Convolution.

### [13] [StableSketcher: Enhancing Diffusion Model for Pixel-based Sketch Generation via Visual Question Answering Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20093)
*Jiho Park,Sieun Choi,Jaeyoon Seo,Jihie Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StableSketcher is a novel framework that enhances diffusion models to generate high-quality hand-drawn sketches with improved text-image alignment using optimized VAE decoding and VQA-based reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models struggle with synthesizing pixel-based human-drawn sketches, which represent abstract expression, due to challenges in capturing sketch characteristics and maintaining prompt fidelity.

Method: Fine-tuned variational autoencoder for better latent decoding of sketch characteristics, and integrated a new visual question answering-based reward function for reinforcement learning to improve text-image alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments show StableSketcher generates sketches with improved stylistic fidelity and better prompt alignment compared to Stable Diffusion baseline. Also introduced SketchDUO, the first instance-level sketch dataset with captions and QA pairs.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses sketch generation challenges and the new dataset overcomes limitations of existing image-label pair datasets, with both code and dataset to be made publicly available.

Abstract: Although recent advancements in diffusion models have significantly enriched
the quality of generated images, challenges remain in synthesizing pixel-based
human-drawn sketches, a representative example of abstract expression. To
combat these challenges, we propose StableSketcher, a novel framework that
empowers diffusion models to generate hand-drawn sketches with high prompt
fidelity. Within this framework, we fine-tune the variational autoencoder to
optimize latent decoding, enabling it to better capture the characteristics of
sketches. In parallel, we integrate a new reward function for reinforcement
learning based on visual question answering, which improves text-image
alignment and semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
StableSketcher generates sketches with improved stylistic fidelity, achieving
better alignment with prompts compared to the Stable Diffusion baseline.
Additionally, we introduce SketchDUO, to the best of our knowledge, the first
dataset comprising instance-level sketches paired with captions and
question-answer pairs, thereby addressing the limitations of existing datasets
that rely on image-label pairs. Our code and dataset will be made publicly

### [14] [BIOCAP: Exploiting Synthetic Captions Beyond Labels in Biological Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20095)
*Ziheng Zhang,Xinyue Ma,Arpita Chowdhury,Elizabeth G. Campolongo,Matthew J. Thompson,Net Zhang,Samuel Stevens,Hilmar Lapp,Tanya Berger-Wolf,Yu Su,Wei-Lun Chao,Jianyang Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces BIOCAP, a biological foundation model that uses synthetic descriptive captions generated by MLLMs to enhance multimodal learning, achieving improved species classification and text-image retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of instance-specific captions in biological multimodal models by using descriptive captions as additional supervision to capture latent biological traits and reduce spurious correlations.

Method: Generate synthetic captions using multimodal large language models guided by Wikipedia-derived visual information and taxon-tailored format examples, then train BIOCAP (BIOCLIP with Captions) using these captions.

Result: BIOCAP captures rich semantics and achieves strong performance in species classification and text-image retrieval, demonstrating the value of descriptive captions beyond simple labels.

Conclusion: Descriptive captions provide valuable supervision for biological multimodal foundation models, bridging biological images with rich semantic understanding when instance-specific captions are available.

Abstract: This work investigates descriptive captions as an additional source of
supervision for biological multimodal foundation models. Images and captions
can be viewed as complementary samples from the latent morphospace of a
species, each capturing certain biological traits. Incorporating captions
during training encourages alignment with this shared latent structure,
emphasizing potentially diagnostic characters while suppressing spurious
correlations. The main challenge, however, lies in obtaining faithful,
instance-specific captions at scale. This requirement has limited the
utilization of natural language supervision in organismal biology compared with
many other scientific domains. We complement this gap by generating synthetic
captions with multimodal large language models (MLLMs), guided by
Wikipedia-derived visual information and taxon-tailored format examples. These
domain-specific contexts help reduce hallucination and yield accurate,
instance-based descriptive captions. Using these captions, we train BIOCAP
(i.e., BIOCLIP with Captions), a biological foundation model that captures rich
semantics and achieves strong performance in species classification and
text-image retrieval. These results demonstrate the value of descriptive
captions beyond labels in bridging biological images with multimodal foundation
models.

### [16] [Inverse Image-Based Rendering for Light Field Generation from Single Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20132)
*Hyunjun Jung,Hae-Gon Jeon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel view synthesis method called inverse image-based rendering that generates light fields from single images using neural rendering, enabling realistic novel view synthesis without 3D reconstruction or specialized hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of traditional light field acquisition which requires computational costs or specialized devices like bulky camera setups, making light field generation more accessible from single images.

Method: Uses a neural rendering pipeline that stores light flow from source rays, computes relationships via cross-attention, predicts target ray colors, and iteratively generates novel views while updating occluded contents.

Result: The method works well on various challenging datasets without retraining after initial synthetic training, outperforming state-of-the-art novel view synthesis approaches.

Conclusion: Inverse image-based rendering successfully enables light field generation from single images, broadening the applicability of light field technology without requiring specialized hardware or explicit 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: A concept of light-fields computed from multiple view images on regular grids
has proven its benefit for scene representations, and supported realistic
renderings of novel views and photographic effects such as refocusing and
shallow depth of field. In spite of its effectiveness of light flow
computations, obtaining light fields requires either computational costs or
specialized devices like a bulky camera setup and a specialized microlens
array. In an effort to broaden its benefit and applicability, in this paper, we
propose a novel view synthesis method for light field generation from only
single images, named inverse image-based rendering. Unlike previous attempts to
implicitly rebuild 3D geometry or to explicitly represent objective scenes, our
method reconstructs light flows in a space from image pixels, which behaves in
the opposite way to image-based rendering. To accomplish this, we design a
neural rendering pipeline to render a target ray in an arbitrary viewpoint. Our
neural renderer first stores the light flow of source rays from the input
image, then computes the relationships among them through cross-attention, and
finally predicts the color of the target ray based on these relationships.
After the rendering pipeline generates the first novel view from a single input
image, the generated out-of-view contents are updated to the set of source
rays. This procedure is iteratively performed while ensuring the consistent
generation of occluded contents. We demonstrate that our inverse image-based
rendering works well with various challenging datasets without any retraining
or finetuning after once trained on synthetic dataset, and outperforms relevant
state-of-the-art novel view synthesis methods.

*Jiachen Liang,Ruibing Hou,Minyang Hu,Hong Chang,Shiguang Shan,Xilin Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LogitGap is a novel post-hoc OOD detection method that exploits the relationship between maximum logit and remaining logits to enhance ID/OOD separability, using a training-free strategy to identify informative logits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing post-hoc OOD detection methods underexploit rich information in model's logits space, limiting their effectiveness in distinguishing in-distribution from out-of-distribution samples.

Method: Proposes LogitGap method that explicitly uses the relationship between maximum logit and remaining logits, with a training-free strategy to automatically identify the most informative logits for scoring.

Result: Extensive experiments on vision-language and vision-only models show LogitGap consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse OOD detection scenarios and benchmarks.

Conclusion: LogitGap effectively enhances OOD detection by better exploiting logit space information, providing both theoretical and empirical validation of its approach.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for ensuring the reliability
of deep learning models in open-world applications. While post-hoc methods are
favored for their efficiency and ease of deployment, existing approaches often
underexploit the rich information embedded in the model's logits space. In this
paper, we propose LogitGap, a novel post-hoc OOD detection method that
explicitly exploits the relationship between the maximum logit and the
remaining logits to enhance the separability between in-distribution (ID) and
OOD samples. To further improve its effectiveness, we refine LogitGap by
focusing on a more compact and informative subset of the logit space.
Specifically, we introduce a training-free strategy that automatically
identifies the most informative logits for scoring. We provide both theoretical
analysis and empirical evidence to validate the effectiveness of our approach.
Extensive experiments on both vision-language and vision-only models
demonstrate that LogitGap consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance
across diverse OOD detection scenarios and benchmarks. Code is available at

TL;DR: PartNeXt is a new 3D dataset with 23,000 textured models across 50 categories, featuring fine-grained hierarchical part annotations that enable better part segmentation and introduce 3D part-centric question answering benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D part datasets like PartNet have limitations including untextured geometries and expert-dependent annotation, which restrict scalability and usability for advancing part-level understanding in computer vision.

Method: Created PartNeXt dataset with scalable annotation pipeline, texture-aware labels, and hierarchical part structure. Benchmarked on class-agnostic part segmentation and introduced new 3D part-centric question answering task for evaluating 3D-LLMs.

Result: State-of-the-art methods struggle with fine-grained and leaf-level parts on PartNeXt. Training Point-SAM on PartNeXt yields substantial gains over PartNet. 3D-LLMs show significant gaps in open-vocabulary part grounding.

Conclusion: PartNeXt enables new research avenues in structured 3D understanding through its scalable annotation, texture-aware labels, and multi-task evaluation capabilities, addressing limitations of previous datasets.

Abstract: Understanding objects at the level of their constituent parts is fundamental
to advancing computer vision, graphics, and robotics. While datasets like
PartNet have driven progress in 3D part understanding, their reliance on
untextured geometries and expert-dependent annotation limits scalability and
usability. We introduce PartNeXt, a next-generation dataset addressing these
gaps with over 23,000 high-quality, textured 3D models annotated with
fine-grained, hierarchical part labels across 50 categories. We benchmark
PartNeXt on two tasks: (1) class-agnostic part segmentation, where
state-of-the-art methods (e.g., PartField, SAMPart3D) struggle with
fine-grained and leaf-level parts, and (2) 3D part-centric question answering,
a new benchmark for 3D-LLMs that reveals significant gaps in open-vocabulary
part grounding. Additionally, training Point-SAM on PartNeXt yields substantial
gains over PartNet, underscoring the dataset's superior quality and diversity.
By combining scalable annotation, texture-aware labels, and multi-task
evaluation, PartNeXt opens new avenues for research in structured 3D
understanding.

### [19] [Monocular Visual 8D Pose Estimation for Articulated Bicycles and Cyclists](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20158)
*Eduardo R. Corral-Soto,Yang Liu,Yuan Ren,Bai Dongfeng,Liu Bingbing*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces an 8D pose estimation method for articulated bicycles and cyclists from single RGB images, extending beyond traditional 6D pose by also estimating steering and pedal rotations to better capture bicycle articulation and travel direction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cyclists are safety-critical vulnerable road users in autonomous driving, and accurate pose estimation is crucial for intention classification, behavior prediction, and collision avoidance. Traditional 6D pose methods are insufficient for articulated bicycles because varying steering/pedal angles change the 3D bounding box and orientation may not align with actual travel direction.

Method: The proposed method jointly estimates 8D pose (3D translation, 3D rotation, plus steering handle and pedal rotations) and 3D keypoints of articulated bicycles from single RGB images. It uses a mix of synthetic and real image data for training to generalize on real images.

Result: The method achieves competitive scores compared to state-of-the-art category-level 6D pose estimators that use rigid canonical object templates, showing promising results in accurately estimating the 8D pose parameters.

Conclusion: The 8D pose estimation approach enables more fine-grained bicycle pose state and travel direction estimation, addressing limitations of rigid 6D pose methods for articulated objects like bicycles in autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: In Autonomous Driving, cyclists belong to the safety-critical class of
Vulnerable Road Users (VRU), and accurate estimation of their pose is critical
for cyclist crossing intention classification, behavior prediction, and
collision avoidance. Unlike rigid objects, articulated bicycles are composed of
movable rigid parts linked by joints and constrained by a kinematic structure.
6D pose methods can estimate the 3D rotation and translation of rigid bicycles,
but 6D becomes insufficient when the steering/pedals angles of the bicycle
vary. That is because: 1) varying the articulated pose of the bicycle causes
its 3D bounding box to vary as well, and 2) the 3D box orientation is not
necessarily aligned to the orientation of the steering which determines the
actual intended travel direction. In this work, we introduce a method for
category-level 8D pose estimation for articulated bicycles and cyclists from a
single RGB image. Besides being able to estimate the 3D translation and
rotation of a bicycle from a single image, our method also estimates the
rotations of its steering handles and pedals with respect to the bicycle body
frame. These two new parameters enable the estimation of a more fine-grained
bicycle pose state and travel direction. Our proposed model jointly estimates
the 8D pose and the 3D Keypoints of articulated bicycles, and trains with a mix
of synthetic and real image data to generalize on real images. We include an
evaluation section where we evaluate the accuracy of our estimated 8D pose
parameters, and our method shows promising results by achieving competitive
scores when compared against state-of-the-art category-level 6D pose estimators
that use rigid canonical object templates for matching.

*Xudong Yan,Songhe Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel approach for Compositional Zero-Shot Learning that uses unsupervised data to update multimodal prototypes at test time, with adaptive update weights and dynamic priority queue for handling distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome performance degradation caused by distribution shift of label space at test time due to unseen attribute-object compositions.

Method: Accumulates comprehensive knowledge from unsupervised data to update multimodal prototypes, uses adaptive update weights, dynamic priority queue for high-confidence images, and aligns textual and visual prototypes through multimodal collaborative representation learning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark datasets under both closed-world and open-world settings.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively handles distribution shifts in CZSL by leveraging multimodal knowledge from unsupervised data and adaptive prototype updates.

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize novel
attribute-object compositions based on the knowledge learned from seen ones.
Existing methods suffer from performance degradation caused by the distribution
shift of label space at test time, which stems from the inclusion of unseen
compositions recombined from attributes and objects. To overcome the challenge,
we propose a novel approach that accumulates comprehensive knowledge in both
textual and visual modalities from unsupervised data to update multimodal
prototypes at test time. Building on this, we further design an adaptive update
weight to control the degree of prototype adjustment, enabling the model to
flexibly adapt to distribution shift during testing. Moreover, a dynamic
priority queue is introduced that stores high-confidence images to acquire
visual knowledge from historical images for inference. Considering the semantic
consistency of multimodal knowledge, we align textual and visual prototypes by
multimodal collaborative representation learning. Extensive experiments
indicate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on four
benchmark datasets under both closed-world and open-world settings. Code will
be available at https://github.com/xud-yan/TOMCAT .

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IB-GAN is a new unsupervised GAN model for disentangled representation learning that uses Information Bottleneck framework to constrain mutual information between input and generated output, achieving competitive disentanglement scores and better sample quality than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve disentangled representation learning in GANs by applying Information Bottleneck framework to optimize GAN training, addressing limitations of existing approaches like InfoGAN.

Method: Uses intermediate stochastic layer in generator to constrain mutual information between input and output, trained jointly with generator in end-to-end fashion. Similar architecture to InfoGAN but with critical difference in information constraint.

Result: Achieves competitive disentanglement scores on dSprites and Color-dSprites datasets compared to state-of-the-art β-VAEs, outperforms InfoGAN. Better visual quality and diversity on CelebA and 3D Chairs datasets in terms of FID score.

Conclusion: IB-GAN successfully integrates Information Bottleneck framework into GAN optimization, enabling more disentangled and interpretable latent space while maintaining or improving sample quality over existing methods.

Abstract: We propose a new GAN-based unsupervised model for disentangled representation
learning. The new model is discovered in an attempt to utilize the Information
Bottleneck (IB) framework to the optimization of GAN, thereby named IB-GAN. The
architecture of IB-GAN is partially similar to that of InfoGAN but has a
critical difference; an intermediate layer of the generator is leveraged to
constrain the mutual information between the input and the generated output.
The intermediate stochastic layer can serve as a learnable latent distribution
that is trained with the generator jointly in an end-to-end fashion. As a
result, the generator of IB-GAN can harness the latent space in a disentangled
and interpretable manner. With the experiments on dSprites and Color-dSprites
dataset, we demonstrate that IB-GAN achieves competitive disentanglement scores
to those of state-of-the-art \b{eta}-VAEs and outperforms InfoGAN. Moreover,
the visual quality and the diversity of samples generated by IB-GAN are often
better than those by \b{eta}-VAEs and Info-GAN in terms of FID score on CelebA
and 3D Chairs dataset.

*Yun Wang,Junjie Hu,Qiaole Dong,Yongjian Zhang,Yanwei Fu,Tin Lun Lam,Dapeng Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PPMStereo introduces a Pick-and-Play Memory module for temporally consistent depth estimation from stereo video, achieving state-of-the-art performance with efficient computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Temporally consistent depth estimation from stereo video is critical for real-world applications like augmented reality, but remains challenging due to the difficulty in modeling long-term temporal consistency efficiently. Previous methods face a trade-off between limited temporal modeling and high computational costs for long-range dependencies.

Method: Proposes PPMStereo with a Pick-and-Play Memory (PPM) module inspired by human two-stage decision-making. PPM has a 'pick' process that identifies the most relevant frames and a 'play' process that weights selected frames adaptively for spatio-temporal aggregation, maintaining a compact yet informative memory buffer.

Result: Extensive experiments show PPMStereo achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and temporal consistency. Notably achieves 0.62/1.11 TEPE on Sintel clean/final with 17.3% & 9.02% improvements over BiDAStereo while using fewer computational costs.

Conclusion: PPMStereo effectively addresses the temporal consistency challenge in stereo depth estimation through its efficient memory buffer design, demonstrating superior performance with reduced computational requirements compared to previous methods.

Abstract: Temporally consistent depth estimation from stereo video is critical for
real-world applications such as augmented reality, where inconsistent depth
estimation disrupts the immersion of users. Despite its importance, this task
remains challenging due to the difficulty in modeling long-term temporal
consistency in a computationally efficient manner. Previous methods attempt to
address this by aggregating spatio-temporal information but face a fundamental
trade-off: limited temporal modeling provides only modest gains, whereas
capturing long-range dependencies significantly increases computational cost.
To address this limitation, we introduce a memory buffer for modeling
long-range spatio-temporal consistency while achieving efficient dynamic stereo
matching. Inspired by the two-stage decision-making process in humans, we
propose a \textbf{P}ick-and-\textbf{P}lay \textbf{M}emory (PPM) construction
module for dynamic \textbf{Stereo} matching, dubbed as \textbf{PPMStereo}. PPM
consists of a `pick' process that identifies the most relevant frames and a
`play' process that weights the selected frames adaptively for spatio-temporal
aggregation. This two-stage collaborative process maintains a compact yet
highly informative memory buffer while achieving temporally consistent
information aggregation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of
PPMStereo, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and
temporal consistency. % Notably, PPMStereo achieves 0.62/1.11 TEPE on the
Sintel clean/final (17.3\% \& 9.02\% improvements over BiDAStereo) with fewer
computational costs. Codes are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation benchmarks focus on individual subjects rather than scenes with multiple interacting people, leaving the plausibility of multi-agent dynamics in generated videos unverified.

Method: Developed evaluation protocol for T2V and I2V models using start frames from datasets for I2V and a prompt suite for T2V, with a key component being a method to reconstruct 2D bird's-eye view trajectories from pixel-space without known camera parameters.

Result: Leading models have learned surprisingly effective priors for plausible multi-agent behavior, but exhibit failure modes like merging and disappearing people.

Conclusion: Current video generation models show promise as world simulators for pedestrian dynamics but require improvement to address specific failure modes in multi-agent interactions.

Abstract: Large-scale video generation models have demonstrated high visual realism in
diverse contexts, spurring interest in their potential as general-purpose world
simulators. Existing benchmarks focus on individual subjects rather than scenes
with multiple interacting people. However, the plausibility of multi-agent
dynamics in generated videos remains unverified. We propose a rigorous
evaluation protocol to benchmark text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V)
models as implicit simulators of pedestrian dynamics. For I2V, we leverage
start frames from established datasets to enable comparison with a ground truth
video dataset. For T2V, we develop a prompt suite to explore diverse pedestrian
densities and interactions. A key component is a method to reconstruct 2D
bird's-eye view trajectories from pixel-space without known camera parameters.
Our analysis reveals that leading models have learned surprisingly effective
priors for plausible multi-agent behavior. However, failure modes like merging
and disappearing people highlight areas for future improvement.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPAN proposes continuous regression for temporal intention localization instead of discrete classification, modeling suspicion progression using temporal point process theory and multimodal information to enable earlier detection and better explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing discrete classification methods fail to capture the continuous nature of suspicious intentions, limiting early intervention and explainability in video surveillance applications.

Method: SPAN uses continuous regression with suspicion score formula based on Temporal Point Process theory, Suspicion Coefficient Modulation with multimodal information, and Concept-Anchored Mapping to link actions to intention concepts.

Result: SPAN significantly outperforms existing methods on HAI dataset, reducing MSE by 19.8% and improving average mAP by 1.78%, with 2.74% mAP gain in low-frequency cases.

Conclusion: Continuous suspicion modeling enables earlier detection and proactive intervention, greatly enhancing system explainability and practical utility in security applications compared to discrete classification.

Abstract: Temporal Intention Localization (TIL) is crucial for video surveillance,
focusing on identifying varying levels of suspicious intentions to improve
security monitoring. However, existing discrete classification methods fail to
capture the continuous nature of suspicious intentions, limiting early
intervention and explainability. In this paper, we propose the Suspicion
Progression Analysis Network (SPAN), which shifts from discrete classification
to continuous regression, enabling the capture of fluctuating and evolving
suspicious intentions. We reveal that suspicion exhibits long-term dependencies
and cumulative effects, similar to Temporal Point Process (TPP) theory. Based
on these insights, we define a suspicion score formula that models continuous
changes while accounting for temporal characteristics. We also introduce
Suspicion Coefficient Modulation, which adjusts suspicion coefficients using
multimodal information to reflect the varying impacts of suspicious actions.
Additionally, the Concept-Anchored Mapping method is proposed to link
suspicious actions to predefined intention concepts, offering insights into
both the actions and their potential underlying intentions. Extensive
experiments on the HAI dataset show that SPAN significantly outperforms
existing methods, reducing MSE by 19.8% and improving average mAP by 1.78%.
Notably, SPAN achieves a 2.74% mAP gain in low-frequency cases, demonstrating
its superior ability to capture subtle behavioral changes. Compared to discrete
classification systems, our continuous suspicion modeling approach enables
earlier detection and proactive intervention, greatly enhancing system
explainability and practical utility in security applications.

TL;DR: Analysis of 54 public brain MRI datasets reveals systematic biases and heterogeneity that challenge foundation model development, with preprocessing alone insufficient to eliminate inter-dataset variability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models for brain MRI require large-scale, diverse data, but systematic assessments of data characteristics and preprocessing effects are lacking.

Method: Multi-level analysis of 54 datasets (538,031 scans): dataset-level characterization of modality/disease coverage, image-level quantification of voxel properties, evaluation of preprocessing variability, and feature-space analysis using 3D DenseNet121.

Result: Revealed strong dataset imbalances, substantial heterogeneity in voxel properties, preprocessing improves within-dataset consistency but residual differences persist, and measurable covariate shift remains after harmonization.

Conclusion: Public brain MRI resources exhibit significant variability requiring preprocessing-aware and domain-adaptive strategies for generalizable foundation models.

Abstract: The development of foundation models for brain MRI depends critically on the
scale, diversity, and consistency of available data, yet systematic assessments
of these factors remain scarce. In this study, we analyze 54 publicly
accessible brain MRI datasets encompassing over 538,031 to provide a
structured, multi-level overview tailored to foundation model development. At
the dataset level, we characterize modality composition, disease coverage, and
dataset scale, revealing strong imbalances between large healthy cohorts and
smaller clinical populations. At the image level, we quantify voxel spacing,
orientation, and intensity distributions across 15 representative datasets,
demonstrating substantial heterogeneity that can influence representation
learning. We then perform a quantitative evaluation of preprocessing
variability, examining how intensity normalization, bias field correction,
skull stripping, spatial registration, and interpolation alter voxel statistics
and geometry. While these steps improve within-dataset consistency, residual
differences persist between datasets. Finally, feature-space case study using a
3D DenseNet121 shows measurable residual covariate shift after standardized
preprocessing, confirming that harmonization alone cannot eliminate
inter-dataset bias. Together, these analyses provide a unified characterization
of variability in public brain MRI resources and emphasize the need for
preprocessing-aware and domain-adaptive strategies in the design of
generalizable brain MRI foundation models.

*Bingjie Gao,Qianli Ma,Xiaoxue Wu,Shuai Yang,Guanzhou Lan,Haonan Zhao,Jiaxuan Chen,Qingyang Liu,Yu Qiao,Xinyuan Chen,Yaohui Wang,Li Niu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAPO++ is a cross-stage prompt optimization framework for text-to-video generation that improves video quality without modifying the underlying generative models through three stages: retrieval-augmented prompt optimization, sample-specific iterative refinement, and LLM fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: User-provided prompts for text-to-video generation are often short, unstructured, and misaligned with training data, limiting the generative potential of diffusion-based T2V models.

Method: Three-stage framework: (1) RAPO enriches prompts with retrieved modifiers and refactors them to match training distributions; (2) SSPO iteratively refines prompts using multi-source feedback (semantic alignment, spatial fidelity, temporal coherence, optical flow); (3) Fine-tunes LLM using optimized prompt pairs to internalize optimization patterns.

Result: Extensive experiments across five state-of-the-art T2V models and five benchmarks show significant gains in semantic alignment, compositional reasoning, temporal stability, and physical plausibility, outperforming existing methods by large margins.

Conclusion: RAPO++ is a model-agnostic, cost-efficient, and scalable solution that sets a new standard for prompt optimization in text-to-video generation.

Abstract: Prompt design plays a crucial role in text-to-video (T2V) generation, yet
user-provided prompts are often short, unstructured, and misaligned with
training data, limiting the generative potential of diffusion-based T2V models.
We present \textbf{RAPO++}, a cross-stage prompt optimization framework that
unifies training-data--aligned refinement, test-time iterative scaling, and
large language model (LLM) fine-tuning to substantially improve T2V generation
without modifying the underlying generative backbone. In \textbf{Stage 1},
Retrieval-Augmented Prompt Optimization (RAPO) enriches user prompts with
semantically relevant modifiers retrieved from a relation graph and refactors
them to match training distributions, enhancing compositionality and
multi-object fidelity. \textbf{Stage 2} introduces Sample-Specific Prompt
Optimization (SSPO), a closed-loop mechanism that iteratively refines prompts
using multi-source feedback -- including semantic alignment, spatial fidelity,
temporal coherence, and task-specific signals such as optical flow -- yielding
progressively improved video generation quality. \textbf{Stage 3} leverages
optimized prompt pairs from SSPO to fine-tune the rewriter LLM, internalizing
task-specific optimization patterns and enabling efficient, high-quality prompt
generation even before inference. Extensive experiments across five
state-of-the-art T2V models and five benchmarks demonstrate that RAPO++
achieves significant gains in semantic alignment, compositional reasoning,
temporal stability, and physical plausibility, outperforming existing methods
by large margins. Our results highlight RAPO++ as a model-agnostic,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-based image editing methods use target-agnostic corruption that focuses on source reconstruction but neglects semantic gaps to the editing target, resulting in limited editability and inconsistency when modifications deviate substantially from the source.

Method: Proposes FlowCycle - an inversion-free, flow-based editing framework that parameterizes corruption with learnable noises and optimizes them through a cycle-consistent process with dual consistency constraints, iteratively editing source to target and recovering back to source.

Result: Extensive ablations demonstrate that FlowCycle achieves superior editing quality and consistency over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The target-aware intermediate state approach enables faithful modifications while preserving source consistency, overcoming limitations of target-agnostic corruption methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained text-to-image flow models have enabled
remarkable progress in text-based image editing. Mainstream approaches always
adopt a corruption-then-restoration paradigm, where the source image is first
corrupted into an ``intermediate state'' and then restored to the target image
under the prompt guidance. However, current methods construct this intermediate
state in a target-agnostic manner, i.e., they primarily focus on realizing
source image reconstruction while neglecting the semantic gaps towards the
specific editing target. This design inherently results in limited editability
or inconsistency when the desired modifications substantially deviate from the
source. In this paper, we argue that the intermediate state should be
target-aware, i.e., selectively corrupting editing-relevant contents while
preserving editing-irrelevant ones. To this end, we propose FlowCycle, a novel
inversion-free and flow-based editing framework that parameterizes corruption
with learnable noises and optimizes them through a cycle-consistent process. By
iteratively editing the source to the target and recovering back to the source
with dual consistency constraints, FlowCycle learns to produce a target-aware
intermediate state, enabling faithful modifications while preserving source
consistency. Extensive ablations have demonstrated that FlowCycle achieves
superior editing quality and consistency over state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: CURL is a self-supervised contrastive learning framework for fetal movement detection from ultrasound videos, achieving 78.01% sensitivity and 81.60% AUROC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional fetal movement detection methods like maternal perception and CTG are subjective and inaccurate, creating need for objective automated analysis.

Method: Uses dual-contrastive loss with spatial and temporal contrastive learning, task-specific sampling strategy, and probabilistic fine-tuning for long recordings.

Result: Achieved 78.01% sensitivity and 81.60% AUROC on 92 subjects with 30-minute ultrasound sessions.

Conclusion: Self-supervised contrastive learning shows strong potential for reliable fetal movement analysis and improved prenatal monitoring.

Abstract: Accurate fetal movement (FM) detection is essential for assessing prenatal
health, as abnormal movement patterns can indicate underlying complications
such as placental dysfunction or fetal distress. Traditional methods, including
maternal perception and cardiotocography (CTG), suffer from subjectivity and
limited accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose Contrastive
Ultrasound Video Representation Learning (CURL), a novel self-supervised
learning framework for FM detection from extended fetal ultrasound video
recordings. Our approach leverages a dual-contrastive loss, incorporating both
spatial and temporal contrastive learning, to learn robust motion
representations. Additionally, we introduce a task-specific sampling strategy,
ensuring the effective separation of movement and non-movement segments during
self-supervised training, while enabling flexible inference on arbitrarily long
ultrasound recordings through a probabilistic fine-tuning approach. Evaluated
on an in-house dataset of 92 subjects, each with 30-minute ultrasound sessions,
CURL achieves a sensitivity of 78.01% and an AUROC of 81.60%, demonstrating its
potential for reliable and objective FM analysis. These results highlight the
potential of self-supervised contrastive learning for fetal movement analysis,
paving the way for improved prenatal monitoring and clinical decision-making.

*Jiahuan Wang,Yuxin Chen,Jun Yu,Guangming Lu,Wenjie Pei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EditInfinity adapts VQ-based generative models for text-driven image editing by leveraging exact intermediate quantized representations for precise image inversion, outperforming diffusion-based methods on PIE-Bench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models suffer from approximation errors during image inversion due to lack of exact supervision in intermediate steps, limiting editing performance.

Method: Proposes EditInfinity using Infinity (binary-quantized generative model) with efficient image inversion mechanism integrating text prompting rectification and style preservation, plus holistic smoothing strategy.

Result: Superior performance on PIE-Bench benchmark across add, change, and delete operations compared to state-of-the-art diffusion baselines.

Conclusion: VQ-based models with exact intermediate representations enable more effective supervision for precise image inversion, leading to better text-driven image editing with high fidelity and semantic alignment.

Abstract: Adapting pretrained diffusion-based generative models for text-driven image
editing with negligible tuning overhead has demonstrated remarkable potential.
A classical adaptation paradigm, as followed by these methods, first infers the
generative trajectory inversely for a given source image by image inversion,
then performs image editing along the inferred trajectory guided by the target
text prompts. However, the performance of image editing is heavily limited by
the approximation errors introduced during image inversion by diffusion models,
which arise from the absence of exact supervision in the intermediate
generative steps. To circumvent this issue, we investigate the
parameter-efficient adaptation of VQ-based generative models for image editing,
and leverage their inherent characteristic that the exact intermediate
quantized representations of a source image are attainable, enabling more
effective supervision for precise image inversion. Specifically, we propose
\emph{EditInfinity}, which adapts \emph{Infinity}, a binary-quantized
generative model, for image editing. We propose an efficient yet effective
image inversion mechanism that integrates text prompting rectification and
image style preservation, enabling precise image inversion. Furthermore, we
devise a holistic smoothing strategy which allows our \emph{EditInfinity} to
perform image editing with high fidelity to source images and precise semantic
alignment to the text prompts. Extensive experiments on the PIE-Bench benchmark
across "add", "change", and "delete" editing operations, demonstrate the
superior performance of our model compared to state-of-the-art diffusion-based
baselines. Code available at: https://github.com/yx-chen-ust/EditInfinity.

### [30] [Why LVLMs Are More Prone to Hallucinations in Longer Responses: The Role of Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20229)
*Ge Zheng,Jiaye Qian,Jiajin Tang,Sibei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel 'induce-detect-suppress' framework to address hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models, showing that hallucinations in longer responses stem from increased context reliance rather than length itself.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Vision-Language Models suffer from hallucination issues, particularly in longer free-form responses, and the authors aim to understand whether this is caused by length-induced errors or deeper mechanisms related to context reliance.

Method: The authors propose an 'induce-detect-suppress' framework that actively induces hallucinations through designed contexts, uses these instances for early detection of high-risk cases, and suppresses object-level hallucinations during decoding.

Result: The approach achieves consistent, significant improvements across all benchmarks, demonstrating strong detection capabilities and improved hallucination mitigation.

Conclusion: The study validates that hallucinations in longer responses are caused by increased context reliance rather than length itself, and provides new insights for deeper exploration of hallucinations in LVLMs.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made significant progress in recent
years but are also prone to hallucination issues. They exhibit more
hallucinations in longer, free-form responses, often attributed to accumulated
uncertainties. In this paper, we ask: Does increased hallucination result
solely from length-induced errors, or is there a deeper underlying mechanism?
After a series of preliminary experiments and findings, we suggest that the
risk of hallucinations is not caused by length itself but by the increased
reliance on context for coherence and completeness in longer responses.
Building on these insights, we propose a novel "induce-detect-suppress"
framework that actively induces hallucinations through deliberately designed
contexts, leverages induced instances for early detection of high-risk cases,
and ultimately suppresses potential object-level hallucinations during actual
decoding. Our approach achieves consistent, significant improvements across all
benchmarks, demonstrating its efficacy. The strong detection and improved
hallucination mitigation not only validate our framework but, more importantly,
re-validate our hypothesis on context. Rather than solely pursuing performance
gains, this study aims to provide new insights and serves as a first step
toward a deeper exploration of hallucinations in LVLMs' longer responses.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COS3D is a collaborative prompt-segmentation framework for open-vocabulary 3D segmentation that integrates language and segmentation cues through a collaborative field with instance and language components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Gaussian-splatting-based methods either use a single 3D language field (leading to poor segmentation) or rely on pre-computed class-agnostic segmentations (suffering from error accumulation).

Method: Proposes collaborative field with instance and language fields, uses instance-to-language feature mapping and two-stage training strategy, and adaptive language-to-instance prompt refinement during inference.

Result: COS3D achieves leading performance on two widely-used benchmarks and shows high potential for various applications including novel image-based 3D segmentation, hierarchical segmentation, and robotics.

Conclusion: The collaborative framework effectively integrates language and segmentation cues, overcoming limitations of existing methods and demonstrating superior performance and broad applicability.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D segmentation is a fundamental yet challenging task,
requiring a mutual understanding of both segmentation and language. However,
existing Gaussian-splatting-based methods rely either on a single 3D language
field, leading to inferior segmentation, or on pre-computed class-agnostic
segmentations, suffering from error accumulation. To address these limitations,
we present COS3D, a new collaborative prompt-segmentation framework that
contributes to effectively integrating complementary language and segmentation
cues throughout its entire pipeline. We first introduce the new concept of
collaborative field, comprising an instance field and a language field, as the
cornerstone for collaboration. During training, to effectively construct the
collaborative field, our key idea is to capture the intrinsic relationship
between the instance field and language field, through a novel
instance-to-language feature mapping and designing an efficient two-stage
training strategy. During inference, to bridge distinct characteristics of the
two fields, we further design an adaptive language-to-instance prompt
refinement, promoting high-quality prompt-segmentation inference. Extensive
experiments not only demonstrate COS3D's leading performance over existing
methods on two widely-used benchmarks but also show its high potential to
various applications,~\ie, novel image-based 3D segmentation, hierarchical
segmentation, and robotics. The code is publicly available at

*Minseok Kang,Minhyeok Lee,Minjung Kim,Donghyeong Kim,Sangyoun Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DualGround is a dual-branch architecture for Video Temporal Grounding that separates global and local semantics by routing [EOS] tokens through sentence-level paths and clustering word tokens into phrase-level units, achieving state-of-the-art performance on VTG tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VTG approaches treat all text tokens uniformly during crossmodal attention, disregarding their distinct semantic roles. Controlled experiments show VTG models overly rely on [EOS]-driven global semantics while failing to effectively utilize word-level signals, limiting fine-grained temporal alignment.

Method: Proposes DualGround with: (1) token-role-aware cross-modal interaction strategies that align video features with sentence-level and phrase-level semantics in structurally disentangled manner, (2) joint modeling framework that improves global alignment and enhances fine-grained temporal grounding using structured phrase-aware context.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on both Moment Retrieval and Highlight Detection tasks across QVHighlights and Charades-STA benchmarks.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the effectiveness of disentangled semantic modeling in video-language alignment, enabling the model to capture both coarse and localized semantics for more expressive and context-aware video grounding.

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to localize temporal segments in long,
untrimmed videos that align with a given natural language query. This task
typically comprises two subtasks: Moment Retrieval (MR) and Highlight Detection
(HD). While recent advances have been progressed by powerful pretrained
vision-language models such as CLIP and InternVideo2, existing approaches
commonly treat all text tokens uniformly during crossmodal attention,
disregarding their distinct semantic roles. To validate the limitations of this
approach, we conduct controlled experiments demonstrating that VTG models
overly rely on [EOS]-driven global semantics while failing to effectively
utilize word-level signals, which limits their ability to achieve fine-grained
temporal alignment. Motivated by this limitation, we propose DualGround, a
dual-branch architecture that explicitly separates global and local semantics
by routing the [EOS] token through a sentence-level path and clustering word
tokens into phrase-level units for localized grounding. Our method introduces
(1) tokenrole- aware cross modal interaction strategies that align video
features with sentence-level and phrase-level semantics in a structurally
disentangled manner, and (2) a joint modeling framework that not only improves
global sentence-level alignment but also enhances finegrained temporal
grounding by leveraging structured phrase-aware context. This design allows the
model to capture both coarse and localized semantics, enabling more expressive
and context-aware video grounding. DualGround achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both Moment Retrieval and Highlight Detection tasks across
QVHighlights and Charades- STA benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of
disentangled semantic modeling in video-language alignment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EDGeo introduces mask-based positional encoding and context enhancement for cross-view object geo-localization, achieving SOTA performance with 3.39% accuracy improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use keypoint-based positional encoding that only captures 2D coordinates, neglecting object shape information and causing sensitivity to annotation shifts and limited cross-view matching capability.

Method: Proposes mask-based positional encoding (MPE) using segmentation masks to capture both spatial coordinates and object silhouettes, plus a context enhancement module (CEM) with horizontal/vertical strip convolutions for large-span objects.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CVOGL and VIGOR-Building datasets with 3.39% improvement in localization accuracy under challenging ground-to-satellite scenarios.

Conclusion: Provides a robust positional encoding paradigm and contextual modeling framework for advancing cross-view geo-localization research.

Abstract: Cross-view object geo-localization enables high-precision object localization
through cross-view matching, with critical applications in autonomous driving,
urban management, and disaster response. However, existing methods rely on
keypoint-based positional encoding, which captures only 2D coordinates while
neglecting object shape information, resulting in sensitivity to annotation
shifts and limited cross-view matching capability. To address these
limitations, we propose a mask-based positional encoding scheme that leverages
segmentation masks to capture both spatial coordinates and object silhouettes,
thereby upgrading the model from "location-aware" to "object-aware."
Furthermore, to tackle the challenge of large-span objects (e.g., elongated
buildings) in satellite imagery, we design a context enhancement module. This
module employs horizontal and vertical strip convolutional kernels to extract
long-range contextual features, enhancing feature discrimination among
strip-like objects. Integrating MPE and CEM, we present EDGeo, an end-to-end
framework for robust cross-view object geo-localization. Extensive experiments
on two public datasets (CVOGL and VIGOR-Building) demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 3.39% improvement in localization
accuracy under challenging ground-to-satellite scenarios. This work provides a
robust positional encoding paradigm and a contextual modeling framework for
advancing cross-view geo-localization research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CMC is a multimodal emotion recognition model that addresses semantic inconsistencies across modalities and text dominance through pseudo unimodal labels and parameter-free fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome semantic inconsistencies between modalities and the dominance of text modality in existing MER approaches, which compromises recognition accuracy.

Method: Uses Pseudo Label Generation Module for self-supervised unimodal pretraining, Parameter-free Fusion Module, and Multimodal Consensus Router for multimodal finetuning to mitigate text dominance and guide fusion toward reliable consensus.

Result: Achieves performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art methods across CH-SIMS, CH-SIMS v2, CMU-MOSI, and CMU-MOSEI datasets, with notable advantages in scenarios with semantic inconsistencies.

Conclusion: CMC effectively addresses multimodal semantic inconsistencies and text dominance, demonstrating superior performance across multiple benchmark datasets.

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) has made substantial
progress. Nevertheless, most existing approaches neglect the semantic
inconsistencies that may arise across modalities, such as conflicting emotional
cues between text and visual inputs. Besides, current methods are often
dominated by the text modality due to its strong representational capacity,
which can compromise recognition accuracy. To address these challenges, we
propose a model termed Calibrated Multimodal Consensus (CMC). CMC introduces a
Pseudo Label Generation Module (PLGM) to produce pseudo unimodal labels,
enabling unimodal pretraining in a self-supervised fashion. It then employs a
Parameter-free Fusion Module (PFM) and a Multimodal Consensus Router (MCR) for
multimodal finetuning, thereby mitigating text dominance and guiding the fusion
process toward a more reliable consensus. Experimental results demonstrate that
CMC achieves performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art methods
across four datasets, CH-SIMS, CH-SIMS v2, CMU-MOSI, and CMU-MOSEI, and
exhibits notable advantages in scenarios with semantic inconsistencies on
CH-SIMS and CH-SIMS v2. The implementation of this work is publicly accessible

this paper presents a real-time currency detection system designed to assist
visually impaired individuals. The proposed model is trained on a dataset

TL;DR: GMFVAD is a video anomaly detection method that uses fine-grained multi-modal features to reduce redundancy in visual features by incorporating text captions to highlight important video content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous VAD methods use multi-modal information coarsely and overlook redundant information in video snippets. The paper aims to leverage multi-modal diversity to refine features and reduce redundancy.

Method: Generate fine-grained multi-modal features by summarizing video snippet content and incorporating text features from video captions to enhance visual features of highlighted portions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on four main datasets. Ablation experiments confirm improvements come from reduced redundant information.

Conclusion: GMFVAD effectively reduces feature redundancy through fine-grained multi-modal integration, leading to superior video anomaly detection performance.

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a challenging task that detects anomalous
frames in continuous surveillance videos. Most previous work utilizes the
spatio-temporal correlation of visual features to distinguish whether there are
abnormalities in video snippets. Recently, some works attempt to introduce
multi-modal information, like text feature, to enhance the results of video
anomaly detection. However, these works merely incorporate text features into
video snippets in a coarse manner, overlooking the significant amount of
redundant information that may exist within the video snippets. Therefore, we
propose to leverage the diversity among multi-modal information to further
refine the extracted features, reducing the redundancy in visual features, and
we propose Grained Multi-modal Feature for Video Anomaly Detection (GMFVAD).
Specifically, we generate more grained multi-modal feature based on the video
snippet, which summarizes the main content, and text features based on the
captions of original video will be introduced to further enhance the visual
features of highlighted portions. Experiments show that the proposed GMFVAD
achieves state-of-the-art performance on four mainly datasets. Ablation
experiments also validate that the improvement of GMFVAD is due to the
reduction of redundant information.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VCR methods achieve high accuracy but overlook dataset biases and lack debiasing strategies, limiting model generalization capabilities.

Method: Introduced VCR-OOD datasets for evaluation, analyzed causal graphs and prediction shortcuts, and applied backdoor adjustment method using a dictionary based on correct answers to eliminate bias.

Result: Experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed debiasing method across different datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses bias issues in VCR and improves model generalization through systematic debiasing techniques.

Abstract: Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR) refers to answering questions and
providing explanations based on images. While existing methods achieve high

biases in both textual and visual data. We introduce the VCR-OOD datasets,
comprising VCR-OOD-QA and VCR-OOD-VA subsets, which are designed to evaluate
the generalization capabilities of models across two modalities. Furthermore,
we analyze the causal graphs and prediction shortcuts in VCR and adopt a
backdoor adjustment method to remove bias. Specifically, we create a dictionary
based on the set of correct answers to eliminate prediction shortcuts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the fundamental constraint of representation trilemma in CV-SAR image recognition under data-limited and domain-shift scenarios, where conventional models fail to sufficiently harness rich electromagnetic scattering features.

Method: Introduces Knowledge-Informed Neural Network (KINN) with a "compression-aggregation-compression" architecture: physics-guided compression using dictionary processor, aggregation module, and semantic compression with self-distillation. Implemented in both CNN (0.7M) and Vision Transformer (0.95M) variants.

Result: Extensive evaluations on five SAR benchmarks establish state-of-the-art in parameter-efficient recognition, with exceptional generalization in data-scarce and out-of-distribution scenarios, and tangible interpretability.

Conclusion: KINN provides an effective solution to the representation trilemma and offers a new path for trustworthy AI in SAR image analysis by combining physical priors with neural networks.

Abstract: Deep learning models for complex-valued Synthetic Aperture Radar (CV-SAR)
image recognition are fundamentally constrained by a representation trilemma
under data-limited and domain-shift scenarios: the concurrent, yet conflicting,
optimization of generalization, interpretability, and efficiency. Our work is
motivated by the premise that the rich electromagnetic scattering features
inherent in CV-SAR data hold the key to resolving this trilemma, yet they are
insufficiently harnessed by conventional data-driven models. To this end, we
introduce the Knowledge-Informed Neural Network (KINN), a lightweight framework
built upon a novel "compression-aggregation-compression" architecture. The
first stage performs a physics-guided compression, wherein a novel dictionary
processor adaptively embeds physical priors, enabling a compact unfolding
network to efficiently extract sparse, physically-grounded signatures. A
subsequent aggregation module enriches these representations, followed by a
final semantic compression stage that utilizes a compact classification head
with self-distillation to learn maximally task-relevant and discriminative
embeddings. We instantiate KINN in both CNN (0.7M) and Vision Transformer
(0.95M) variants. Extensive evaluations on five SAR benchmarks confirm that
KINN establishes a state-of-the-art in parameter-efficient recognition,
offering exceptional generalization in data-scarce and out-of-distribution
scenarios and tangible interpretability, thereby providing an effective
solution to the representation trilemma and offering a new path for trustworthy
AI in SAR image analysis.

TL;DR: The paper proposes DMC³, a dual-modal counterfactual contrastive framework for Egocentric VideoQA that addresses first-person perspective challenges through counterfactual sample construction and contrastive optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Egocentric VideoQA methods ignore unique challenges of first-person perspective like understanding multiple events and hand-object interactions, which need specialized approaches.

Method: DMC³ framework with three components: 1) egocentric videoqa baseline, 2) counterfactual sample construction module generating positive/negative samples via event paraphrasing and core interaction mining, 3) contrastive optimization using contrastive loss to minimize distance to positive samples and maximize distance to negative samples.

Result: Achieves 52.51% on normal split and 46.04% on indirect split of EgoTaskQA, and 13.2% on QAEGO4D, reaching state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The proposed DMC³ framework effectively addresses egocentric video challenges and achieves superior performance on benchmark datasets through counterfactual contrastive learning.

Abstract: Egocentric Video Question Answering (Egocentric VideoQA) plays an important
role in egocentric video understanding, which refers to answering questions
based on first-person videos. Although existing methods have made progress
through the paradigm of pre-training and fine-tuning, they ignore the unique
challenges posed by the first-person perspective, such as understanding
multiple events and recognizing hand-object interactions. To deal with these
challenges, we propose a Dual-Modal Counterfactual Contrastive Construction
(DMC$^3$) framework, which contains an egocentric videoqa baseline, a
counterfactual sample construction module and a counterfactual sample-involved
contrastive optimization. Specifically, We first develop a counterfactual
sample construction module to generate positive and negative samples for
textual and visual modalities through event description paraphrasing and core
interaction mining, respectively. Then, We feed these samples together with the
original samples into the baseline. Finally, in the counterfactual
sample-involved contrastive optimization module, we apply contrastive loss to
minimize the distance between the original sample features and the positive
sample features, while maximizing the distance from the negative samples.
Experiments show that our method achieve 52.51\% and 46.04\% on the
\textit{normal} and \textit{indirect} splits of EgoTaskQA, and 13.2\% on
QAEGO4D, both reaching the state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Instruction-as-Reasoning paradigm for GUI grounding, treating instructions as dynamic analytical pathways. It proposes a two-stage training framework (SFT + RL) that achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior works treat instructions as static proxies for user intent, overlooking instruction diversity and quality. Existing datasets have 23.3% flaw rate in instructions, and exploiting instruction diversity can yield up to 76% performance improvement.

Method: Two-stage training: supervised fine-tuning on synthesized diverse instructions for multi-perspective reasoning, followed by reinforcement learning to optimize pathway selection and composition.

Result: UI-Ins-7B and UI-Ins-32B achieve SOTA on five grounding benchmarks: 87.3% on UI-I2E-Bench, 57.0% on ScreenSpot-Pro, 84.9% on MMBench-GUI L2. UI-Ins-7B achieves 74.1% success rate on AndroidWorld as executor.

Conclusion: The Instruction-as-Reasoning paradigm enables models to selectively compose and synthesize novel instruction pathways at inference, demonstrating emergent reasoning and strong agentic potential while mitigating policy collapse in SFT+RL framework.

Abstract: GUI grounding, which maps natural-language instructions to actionable UI
elements, is a core capability of GUI agents. Prior works largely treats
instructions as a static proxy for user intent, overlooking the impact of
instruction diversity and quality on grounding performance. Through a careful
investigation of existing grounding datasets, we find a 23.3% flaw rate in
their instructions and show that inference-time exploitation of instruction
diversity yields up to a substantial 76% relative performance improvement. In
this paper, we introduce the Instruction-as-Reasoning paradigm, treating
instructions as dynamic analytical pathways that offer distinct perspectives
and enabling the model to select the most effective pathway during reasoning.
To achieve this, we propose a two-stage training framework: supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) on synthesized, diverse instructions to instill
multi-perspective reasoning, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) to
optimize pathway selection and composition. Our resulting models, UI-Ins-7B and
UI-Ins-32B, achieve state-of-the-art results on five challenging grounding
benchmarks and exhibit emergent reasoning, selectively composing and
synthesizing novel instruction pathways at inference. In particular, UI-Ins-32B
attains the best grounding accuracy, scoring 87.3% on UI-I2E-Bench, 57.0% on
ScreenSpot-Pro, and 84.9% on MMBench-GUI L2. Furthermore, our model
demonstrates strong agentic potential, achieving a 74.1% success rate on
AndroidWorld using UI-Ins-7B as the executor. Our in-depth analysis reveals
additional insights such as how reasoning can be formulated to enhance rather
than hinder grounding performance, and how our method mitigates policy collapse
in the SFT+RL framework. All code and model checkpoints will be publicly
released in https://github.com/alibaba/UI-Ins.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome severe inter-platform heterogeneity and domain gaps between generic training descriptions and platform-specific test queries in cross-modal geo-localization tasks.

Method: Uses domain-aligned preprocessing (platform-wise partitioning, satellite augmentation, orientation word removal) and LLM-based caption refinement, then trains three platform experts using BGE-M3 and EVA-CLIP with progressive two-stage hard-negative mining, fusing scores at inference.

Result: The system achieved first place on the official leaderboard, demonstrating robust cross-modal geo-localization under heterogeneous viewpoints.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses platform heterogeneity and domain gaps in cross-modal geo-localization, achieving state-of-the-art performance through domain-aligned preprocessing and expert fusion.

Abstract: We present a winning solution to RoboSense 2025 Track 4: Cross-Modal Drone
Navigation. The task retrieves the most relevant geo-referenced image from a
large multi-platform corpus (satellite/drone/ground) given a natural-language
query. Two obstacles are severe inter-platform heterogeneity and a domain gap
between generic training descriptions and platform-specific test queries. We
mitigate these with a domain-aligned preprocessing pipeline and a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework: (i) platform-wise partitioning, satellite
augmentation, and removal of orientation words; (ii) an LLM-based caption
refinement pipeline to align textual semantics with the distinct visual
characteristics of each platform. Using BGE-M3 (text) and EVA-CLIP (image), we
train three platform experts using a progressive two-stage, hard-negative
mining strategy to enhance discriminative power, and fuse their scores at
inference. The system tops the official leaderboard, demonstrating robust
cross-modal geo-localization under heterogeneous viewpoints.

*Zelin Peng,Zhengqin Xu,Qingyang Liu,Xiaokang Yang,Wei Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyperET is an efficient training paradigm for multi-modal LLMs that uses hyperbolic space to align visual and textual representations at arbitrary granularity levels, achieving significant improvements with minimal parameter overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs require massive computational resources due to vision encoders (like CLIP and SAM) lacking proper multi-granularity alignment with language. Hyperbolic space naturally models hierarchies and can bridge this granularity gap.

Method: HyperET optimizes visual representations through dynamic hyperbolic radius adjustment in hyperbolic space, using learnable matrices with Möbius multiplication operations implemented via diagonal scaling, block-diagonal, and banded matrices.

Result: Comprehensive experiments show HyperET consistently improves existing MLLMs in both pre-training and fine-tuning phases with less than 1% additional parameters across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: HyperET provides an efficient solution to the multi-granularity alignment problem in MLLMs by leveraging hyperbolic geometry, enabling better performance with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as a transformative
approach for aligning visual and textual understanding. They typically require
extremely high computational resources (e.g., thousands of GPUs) for training
to achieve cross-modal alignment at multi-granularity levels. We argue that a
key source of this inefficiency lies in the vision encoders they widely equip
with, e.g., CLIP and SAM, which lack the alignment with language at
multi-granularity levels. To address this issue, in this paper, we leverage
hyperbolic space, which inherently models hierarchical levels and thus provides
a principled framework for bridging the granularity gap between visual and
textual modalities at an arbitrary granularity level. Concretely, we propose an
efficient training paradigm for MLLMs, dubbed as HyperET, which can optimize
visual representations to align with their textual counterparts at an arbitrary
granularity level through dynamic hyperbolic radius adjustment in hyperbolic
space. HyperET employs learnable matrices with M\"{o}bius multiplication
operations, implemented via three effective configurations: diagonal scaling
matrices, block-diagonal matrices, and banded matrices, providing a flexible
yet efficient parametrization strategy. Comprehensive experiments across
multiple MLLM benchmarks demonstrate that HyperET consistently improves both
existing pre-training and fine-tuning MLLMs clearly with less than 1\%
additional parameters.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AnyPcc introduces a universal point cloud compression framework with a Universal Context Model and Instance-Adaptive Fine-Tuning to address generalization challenges and OOD data handling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome generalization limitations in deep learning-based point cloud compression, specifically addressing the lack of robust context models and inefficient handling of out-of-distribution data.

Method: Uses a Universal Context Model with spatial and channel-wise grouping priors, combined with Instance-Adaptive Fine-Tuning that fine-tunes a small subset of network weights per instance and includes them in the bitstream.

Result: Sets new state-of-the-art performance in point cloud compression across 15 diverse datasets, with the marginal bit cost of weights being outweighed by geometry compression savings.

Conclusion: AnyPcc provides an effective solution for universal point cloud compression by combining robust context modeling with adaptive fine-tuning strategies.

Abstract: Generalization remains a critical challenge for deep learning-based point
cloud geometry compression. We argue this stems from two key limitations: the
lack of robust context models and the inefficient handling of
out-of-distribution (OOD) data. To address both, we introduce AnyPcc, a
universal point cloud compression framework. AnyPcc first employs a Universal
Context Model that leverages priors from both spatial and channel-wise grouping
to capture robust contextual dependencies. Second, our novel Instance-Adaptive
Fine-Tuning (IAFT) strategy tackles OOD data by synergizing explicit and
implicit compression paradigms. It fine-tunes a small subset of network weights
for each instance and incorporates them into the bitstream, where the marginal
bit cost of the weights is dwarfed by the resulting savings in geometry
compression. Extensive experiments on a benchmark of 15 diverse datasets
confirm that AnyPcc sets a new state-of-the-art in point cloud compression. Our
code and datasets will be released to encourage reproducible research.

### [45] [AccuQuant: Simulating Multiple Denoising Steps for Quantizing Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20348)
*Seunghoon Lee,Jeongwoo Choi,Byunggwan Son,Jaehyeon Moon,Jeimin Jeon,Bumsub Ham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AccuQuant is a novel post-training quantization method for diffusion models that addresses error accumulation over denoising steps by minimizing discrepancies between full-precision and quantized models across multiple steps, with efficient O(1) memory implementation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantization errors in diffusion models accumulate over multiple denoising steps during sampling, degrading performance. Previous approaches treated each step independently, failing to account for this error accumulation problem.

Method: AccuQuant minimizes discrepancies between full-precision and quantized diffusion models across multiple denoising steps, explicitly simulating the sampling process for quantization. It uses an efficient implementation that reduces memory complexity from O(n) to O(1).

Result: The method demonstrates efficacy and efficiency across various tasks and diffusion models on standard benchmarks, effectively addressing the error accumulation problem.

Conclusion: AccuQuant provides an effective post-training quantization solution for diffusion models by accounting for error accumulation across denoising steps, with significant memory efficiency improvements.

Abstract: We present in this paper a novel post-training quantization (PTQ) method,
dubbed AccuQuant, for diffusion models. We show analytically and empirically
that quantization errors for diffusion models are accumulated over denoising
steps in a sampling process. To alleviate the error accumulation problem,
AccuQuant minimizes the discrepancies between outputs of a full-precision
diffusion model and its quantized version within a couple of denoising steps.
That is, it simulates multiple denoising steps of a diffusion sampling process
explicitly for quantization, accounting the accumulated errors over multiple
denoising steps, which is in contrast to previous approaches to imitating a
training process of diffusion models, namely, minimizing the discrepancies
independently for each step. We also present an efficient implementation
technique for AccuQuant, together with a novel objective, which reduces a
memory complexity significantly from $\mathcal{O}(n)$ to $\mathcal{O}(1)$,
where $n$ is the number of denoising steps. We demonstrate the efficacy and
efficiency of AccuQuant across various tasks and diffusion models on standard
benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Positional Encoding Field (PE-Field), which extends positional encodings from 2D to 3D, enabling Diffusion Transformers to model geometry directly in 3D space for improved novel view synthesis and spatial image editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors discovered that patch tokens in Diffusion Transformers exhibit surprising independence, with spatial coherence primarily governed by positional encodings rather than token interactions. This insight motivated extending positional encodings to 3D fields.

Method: Proposed PE-Field that extends positional encodings from 2D plane to structured 3D field, incorporating depth-aware encodings for volumetric reasoning and hierarchical encodings for fine-grained sub-patch control.

Result: PE-Field-augmented DiT achieves state-of-the-art performance on single-image novel view synthesis and generalizes to controllable spatial image editing.

Conclusion: Extending positional encodings to 3D fields enables DiTs to better model geometry and spatial relationships, improving performance on 3D-aware tasks while maintaining the scalability benefits of Transformer architectures.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have emerged as the dominant architecture for
visual generation, powering state-of-the-art image and video models. By
representing images as patch tokens with positional encodings (PEs), DiTs
combine Transformer scalability with spatial and temporal inductive biases. In
this work, we revisit how DiTs organize visual content and discover that patch
tokens exhibit a surprising degree of independence: even when PEs are
perturbed, DiTs still produce globally coherent outputs, indicating that
spatial coherence is primarily governed by PEs. Motivated by this finding, we
introduce the Positional Encoding Field (PE-Field), which extends positional
encodings from the 2D plane to a structured 3D field. PE-Field incorporates
depth-aware encodings for volumetric reasoning and hierarchical encodings for
fine-grained sub-patch control, enabling DiTs to model geometry directly in 3D
space. Our PE-Field-augmented DiT achieves state-of-the-art performance on
single-image novel view synthesis and generalizes to controllable spatial image
editing.

### [47] [Mitigating Cross-modal Representation Bias for Multicultural Image-to-Recipe Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20393)
*Qing Wang,Chong-Wah Ngo,Yu Cao,Ee-Peng Lim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes causal representation learning to predict overlooked culinary elements in images and inject them into cross-modal learning, improving recipe retrieval by capturing subtle ingredients and cooking methods not visually apparent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image-to-recipe retrieval assumes images fully capture recipe details, but images only show final cooked dishes, missing crucial recipe-specific details like subtle ingredients and cooking processes, leading to biased representations.

Method: Novel causal approach that predicts culinary elements potentially overlooked in images and explicitly injects these elements into cross-modal representation learning to mitigate biases.

Result: Achieves impressive retrieval performance on both monolingual Recipe1M and newly curated multilingual multicultural cuisine datasets, capable of uncovering subtle ingredients and cooking actions.

Conclusion: Causal representation learning effectively addresses the modality gap in image-to-recipe retrieval by capturing non-visual recipe details, improving performance especially for similar recipes with subtle differences.

Abstract: Existing approaches for image-to-recipe retrieval have the implicit
assumption that a food image can fully capture the details textually documented
in its recipe. However, a food image only reflects the visual outcome of a
cooked dish and not the underlying cooking process. Consequently, learning
cross-modal representations to bridge the modality gap between images and
recipes tends to ignore subtle, recipe-specific details that are not visually
apparent but are crucial for recipe retrieval. Specifically, the
representations are biased to capture the dominant visual elements, resulting
in difficulty in ranking similar recipes with subtle differences in use of
ingredients and cooking methods. The bias in representation learning is
expected to be more severe when the training data is mixed of images and
recipes sourced from different cuisines. This paper proposes a novel causal
approach that predicts the culinary elements potentially overlooked in images,
while explicitly injecting these elements into cross-modal representation
learning to mitigate biases. Experiments are conducted on the standard
monolingual Recipe1M dataset and a newly curated multilingual multicultural
cuisine dataset. The results indicate that the proposed causal representation
learning is capable of uncovering subtle ingredients and cooking actions and
achieves impressive retrieval performance on both monolingual and multilingual
multicultural datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FuzzyDistillViT-MobileNet uses dynamic fuzzy logic-driven knowledge distillation for lung cancer classification, achieving over 99% accuracy on both histopathological and CT-scan datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address uncertainty and complexity in lung cancer diagnosis by dynamically adjusting knowledge distillation weights using fuzzy logic, enabling better handling of ambiguous regions in medical images.

Method: Uses ViT-B32 as teacher and MobileNet as student with dynamic fuzzy logic KD, wavelet-based image fusion with Gamma correction/Histogram Equalization, and Genetic Algorithm for model selection from 12 candidates.

Result: Achieved 99.16% accuracy on LC25000 histopathological images and 99.54% accuracy on IQOTH/NCCD CT-scan images, demonstrating robustness across imaging domains.

Conclusion: The proposed dynamic fuzzy logic KD approach effectively handles uncertainty in medical images and achieves state-of-the-art performance in lung cancer classification across different imaging modalities.

Abstract: This paper presents the FuzzyDistillViT-MobileNet model, a novel approach for
lung cancer (LC) classification, leveraging dynamic fuzzy logic-driven
knowledge distillation (KD) to address uncertainty and complexity in disease
diagnosis. Unlike traditional models that rely on static KD with fixed weights,
our method dynamically adjusts the distillation weight using fuzzy logic,
enabling the student model to focus on high-confidence regions while reducing
attention to ambiguous areas. This dynamic adjustment improves the model
ability to handle varying uncertainty levels across different regions of LC
images. We employ the Vision Transformer (ViT-B32) as the instructor model,
which effectively transfers knowledge to the student model, MobileNet,
enhancing the student generalization capabilities. The training process is
further optimized using a dynamic wait adjustment mechanism that adapts the
training procedure for improved convergence and performance. To enhance image
quality, we introduce pixel-level image fusion improvement techniques such as
Gamma correction and Histogram Equalization. The processed images (Pix1 and
Pix2) are fused using a wavelet-based fusion method to improve image resolution
and feature preservation. This fusion method uses the wavedec2 function to
standardize images to a 224x224 resolution, decompose them into multi-scale
frequency components, and recursively average coefficients at each level for
better feature representation. To address computational efficiency, Genetic
Algorithm (GA) is used to select the most suitable pre-trained student model
from a pool of 12 candidates, balancing model performance with computational
cost. The model is evaluated on two datasets, including LC25000
histopathological images (99.16% accuracy) and IQOTH/NCCD CT-scan images
(99.54% accuracy), demonstrating robustness across different imaging domains.

TL;DR: Conan is a framework for evidence-grounded multi-step video reasoning that identifies contextual/evidence frames, reasons over cross-frame clues, and adaptively decides when to conclude or explore further, achieving state-of-the-art performance on video reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL-based video reasoning methods produce ungrounded or hallucinated conclusions, while frame-retrieval approaches struggle with inaccurate evidence localization. There's a need for better evidence-grounded multi-step reasoning in video understanding.

Method: Developed Conan framework with: (1) Conan-91K dataset of automatically generated reasoning traces including frame identification, evidence reasoning, and action decision; (2) Multi-stage progressive cold-start strategy with Identification-Reasoning-Action (AIR) RLVR training framework to enhance multi-step visual reasoning.

Result: Conan surpasses baseline Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct by over 10% average accuracy on six multi-step reasoning benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance. It also generalizes effectively to long-video understanding tasks.

Conclusion: Conan demonstrates strong evidence-grounded multi-step video reasoning capabilities with excellent scalability and robustness, providing an effective solution to video reasoning challenges.

Abstract: Video reasoning, which requires multi-step deduction across frames, remains a
major challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While
reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods enhance reasoning capabilities, they
often rely on text-only chains that yield ungrounded or hallucinated
conclusions. Conversely, frame-retrieval approaches introduce visual grounding
but still struggle with inaccurate evidence localization. To address these
challenges, we present Conan, a framework for evidence-grounded multi-step
video reasoning. Conan identifies contextual and evidence frames, reasons over
cross-frame clues, and adaptively decides when to conclude or explore further.
To achieve this, we (1) construct Conan-91K, a large-scale dataset of
automatically generated reasoning traces that includes frame identification,
evidence reasoning, and action decision, and (2) design a multi-stage
progressive cold-start strategy combined with an
Identification-Reasoning-Action (AIR) RLVR training framework to jointly
enhance multi-step visual reasoning. Extensive experiments on six multi-step
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that Conan surpasses the baseline
Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct by an average of over 10% in accuracy, achieving
state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, Conan generalizes effectively to
long-video understanding tasks, validating its strong scalability and
robustness.

*Alexandre Fournier-Montgieux,Hervé Le Borgne,Adrian Popescu,Bertrand Luvison*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a more reliable demographic attribute inference pipeline for fairness auditing in face analysis systems, using modular transfer learning instead of end-to-end training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fairness evaluation in face analysis systems depends on demographic attribute inference, but the validity of fairness auditing hinges on the reliability of this inference process. Improved reliability leads to less biased and lower-variance fairness estimates.

Method: A fully reproducible DAI pipeline using modular transfer learning with pretrained face recognition encoders and non-linear classification heads. Audited across accuracy, fairness, and a new robustness metric based on intra-identity consistency.

Result: The proposed method outperforms strong baselines, particularly on the more challenging ethnicity attribute. Results show improved performance across multiple datasets and training setups.

Conclusion: This work provides a reliable foundation for demographic inference in fairness auditing and contributes publicly available resources including metadata, codebase, pretrained models, and evaluation toolkit for transparency and reproducibility.

Abstract: Fairness evaluation in face analysis systems (FAS) typically depends on
automatic demographic attribute inference (DAI), which itself relies on
predefined demographic segmentation. However, the validity of fairness auditing
hinges on the reliability of the DAI process. We begin by providing a
theoretical motivation for this dependency, showing that improved DAI
reliability leads to less biased and lower-variance estimates of FAS fairness.
To address this, we propose a fully reproducible DAI pipeline that replaces
conventional end-to-end training with a modular transfer learning approach. Our
design integrates pretrained face recognition encoders with non-linear
classification heads. We audit this pipeline across three dimensions: accuracy,
fairness, and a newly introduced notion of robustness, defined via
intra-identity consistency. The proposed robustness metric is applicable to any
demographic segmentation scheme. We benchmark the pipeline on gender and
ethnicity inference across multiple datasets and training setups. Our results
show that the proposed method outperforms strong baselines, particularly on
ethnicity, which is the more challenging attribute. To promote transparency and
reproducibility, we will publicly release the training dataset metadata, full
codebase, pretrained models, and evaluation toolkit. This work contributes a
reliable foundation for demographic inference in fairness auditing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EchoDistill enables one-step diffusion personalization through bidirectional concept distillation between teacher (multi-step) and student (one-step) models, improving both personalization quality and generation speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current one-step diffusion models struggle with personalization due to limited capacity to capture new concept distributions effectively, while multi-step models are slow for practical use.

Method: End-to-end training with bidirectional concept distillation: concept flows from teacher to student, then echoed back from student to teacher. Uses shared text encoder, adversarial losses, alignment losses, and bidirectional echoing refinement.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing personalization methods in one-step diffusion personalization setup, enhancing both student's personalization ability and teacher's generative quality.

Conclusion: EchoDistill establishes a novel paradigm for rapid and effective personalization in text-to-image diffusion models through collaborative bidirectional distillation.

Abstract: Recent advances in accelerating text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have
enabled the synthesis of high-fidelity images even in a single step. However,
personalizing these models to incorporate novel concepts remains a challenge
due to the limited capacity of one-step models to capture new concept
distributions effectively. We propose a bidirectional concept distillation
framework, EchoDistill, to enable one-step diffusion personalization (1-SDP).
Our approach involves an end-to-end training process where a multi-step
diffusion model (teacher) and a one-step diffusion model (student) are trained
simultaneously. The concept is first distilled from the teacher model to the
student, and then echoed back from the student to the teacher. During the
EchoDistill, we share the text encoder between the two models to ensure
consistent semantic understanding. Following this, the student model is
optimized with adversarial losses to align with the real image distribution and
with alignment losses to maintain consistency with the teacher's output.
Furthermore, we introduce the bidirectional echoing refinement strategy,
wherein the student model leverages its faster generation capability to
feedback to the teacher model. This bidirectional concept distillation
mechanism not only enhances the student ability to personalize novel concepts
but also improves the generative quality of the teacher model. Our experiments
demonstrate that this collaborative framework significantly outperforms
existing personalization methods over the 1-SDP setup, establishing a novel
paradigm for rapid and effective personalization in T2I diffusion models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Metis-HOME is a Hybrid Optimized Mixture-of-Experts framework that addresses the trade-off between specialized reasoning and general understanding in multimodal models by creating two expert branches: one for complex reasoning and another for rapid inference, with a dynamic router allocating queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal reasoning models are inefficient for simple queries due to expensive reasoning processes and suffer from impaired general understanding capabilities when specialized for reasoning tasks.

Method: The approach structures a dense model into two expert branches: a thinking branch for complex multi-step reasoning and a non-thinking branch for rapid inference on tasks like VQA and OCR, using a lightweight trainable router for query allocation. Implemented by adapting Qwen2.5-VL-7B into an MoE architecture.

Result: The framework substantially enhances complex reasoning abilities while improving the model's general capabilities, reversing the degradation trend observed in other reasoning-specialized models.

Conclusion: Metis-HOME establishes a new paradigm for building powerful and versatile MLLMs that effectively resolves the reasoning-vs-generalization dilemma.

Abstract: Inspired by recent advancements in LLM reasoning, the field of multimodal
reasoning has seen remarkable progress, achieving significant performance gains
on intricate tasks such as mathematical problem-solving. Despite this progress,
current multimodal large reasoning models exhibit two key limitations. They
tend to employ computationally expensive reasoning even for simple queries,
leading to inefficiency. Furthermore, this focus on specialized reasoning often
impairs their broader, more general understanding capabilities. In this paper,
we propose Metis-HOME: a Hybrid Optimized Mixture-of-Experts framework designed
to address this trade-off. Metis-HOME enables a ''Hybrid Thinking'' paradigm by
structuring the original dense model into two distinct expert branches: a
thinking branch tailored for complex, multi-step reasoning, and a non-thinking
branch optimized for rapid, direct inference on tasks like general VQA and OCR.
A lightweight, trainable router dynamically allocates queries to the most
suitable expert. We instantiate Metis-HOME by adapting the Qwen2.5-VL-7B into
an MoE architecture. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that our approach not
only substantially enhances complex reasoning abilities but also improves the
model's general capabilities, reversing the degradation trend observed in other
reasoning-specialized models. Our work establishes a new paradigm for building
powerful and versatile MLLMs, effectively resolving the prevalent
reasoning-vs-generalization dilemma.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes FiFa framework for fine-grained explainable deepfake analysis, addressing limitations in current MLLMs by introducing better data annotation and a unified model architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal large language models for deepfake analysis lack fine-grained awareness - they have unreliable coarse-grained annotations, cannot connect textual explanations to visual artifacts, and don't support queries for arbitrary facial regions, making responses insufficiently grounded in visual context.

Method: Proposed Fake-in-Facext (FiFa) framework with two main contributions: 1) FiFa-Annotator using Facial Image Concept Tree for reliable fine-grained data annotation, and 2) FiFa-MLLM - a unified multi-task learning architecture supporting multimodal inputs/outputs with auxiliary supervision for Artifact-Grounding Explanation task.

Result: FiFa-MLLM outperforms strong baselines on the AGE task and achieves state-of-the-art performance on existing explainable deepfake analysis datasets.

Conclusion: The FiFa framework successfully addresses fine-grained explainable deepfake analysis limitations through improved data annotation and model architecture, enabling better grounding of explanations in visual evidence.

Abstract: The advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has bridged the
gap between vision and language tasks, enabling the implementation of
Explainable DeepFake Analysis (XDFA). However, current methods suffer from a
lack of fine-grained awareness: the description of artifacts in data annotation
is unreliable and coarse-grained, and the models fail to support the output of
connections between textual forgery explanations and the visual evidence of
artifacts, as well as the input of queries for arbitrary facial regions. As a
result, their responses are not sufficiently grounded in Face Visual Context
(Facext). To address this limitation, we propose the Fake-in-Facext (FiFa)
framework, with contributions focusing on data annotation and model
construction. We first define a Facial Image Concept Tree (FICT) to divide
facial images into fine-grained regional concepts, thereby obtaining a more
reliable data annotation pipeline, FiFa-Annotator, for forgery explanation.
Based on this dedicated data annotation, we introduce a novel
Artifact-Grounding Explanation (AGE) task, which generates textual forgery
explanations interleaved with segmentation masks of manipulated artifacts. We
propose a unified multi-task learning architecture, FiFa-MLLM, to
simultaneously support abundant multimodal inputs and outputs for fine-grained
Explainable DeepFake Analysis. With multiple auxiliary supervision tasks,
FiFa-MLLM can outperform strong baselines on the AGE task and achieve SOTA
performance on existing XDFA datasets. The code and data will be made

Motivation: Motion blur from camera shake, especially under large or rotational movements, remains a major challenge in image restoration that existing methods struggle with.

Method: Uses Projective Motion Blur Model with differentiable blur creation module. Neural network predicts 3D rotation trajectory to guide model-based restoration network trained end-to-end, with post-inference trajectory optimization via reblur loss.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real datasets, particularly effective for severe or spatially variant blur where end-to-end deblurring networks struggle.

Conclusion: The method provides interpretable camera motion estimation while enabling reconstruction of sharp image sequences, outperforming existing approaches especially for challenging blur scenarios.

Abstract: Motion blur caused by camera shake, particularly under large or rotational
movements, remains a major challenge in image restoration. We propose a deep
learning framework that jointly estimates the latent sharp image and the
underlying camera motion trajectory from a single blurry image. Our method
leverages the Projective Motion Blur Model (PMBM), implemented efficiently
using a differentiable blur creation module compatible with modern networks. A
neural network predicts a full 3D rotation trajectory, which guides a
model-based restoration network trained end-to-end. This modular architecture
provides interpretability by revealing the camera motion that produced the
blur. Moreover, this trajectory enables the reconstruction of the sequence of
sharp images that generated the observed blurry image. To further refine
results, we optimize the trajectory post-inference via a reblur loss, improving
consistency between the blurry input and the restored output. Extensive
experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
synthetic and real datasets, particularly in cases with severe or spatially
variant blur, where end-to-end deblurring networks struggle.

*Fuchen Li,Yansong Du,Wenbo Cheng,Xiaoxia Zhou,Sen Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ACamera-Net is a lightweight network that predicts optimal camera exposure and white balance parameters from RAW inputs to improve image quality under challenging lighting conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Consumer cameras struggle with complex illumination (low light, HDR, backlighting) causing underexposure, color casts, and tonal inconsistency that degrade downstream vision tasks.

Method: Two-module framework: ACamera-Exposure estimates ISO to fix underexposure, and ACamera-Color predicts color temperature and gain factors for color consistency. Optimized for real-time edge device inference.

Result: Extensive experiments show ACamera-Net consistently enhances image quality and stabilizes perception outputs, outperforming conventional auto modes and lightweight baselines.

Conclusion: ACamera-Net provides effective camera parameter adjustment for improved image quality across diverse lighting conditions without needing additional enhancement modules.

Abstract: Consumer-grade camera systems often struggle to maintain stable image quality
under complex illumination conditions such as low light, high dynamic range,
and backlighting, as well as spatial color temperature variation. These issues
lead to underexposure, color casts, and tonal inconsistency, which degrade the
performance of downstream vision tasks. To address this, we propose
ACamera-Net, a lightweight and scene-adaptive camera parameter adjustment
network that directly predicts optimal exposure and white balance from RAW
inputs. The framework consists of two modules: ACamera-Exposure, which
estimates ISO to alleviate underexposure and contrast loss, and ACamera-Color,
which predicts correlated color temperature and gain factors for improved color
consistency. Optimized for real-time inference on edge devices, ACamera-Net can
be seamlessly integrated into imaging pipelines. Trained on diverse real-world
data with annotated references, the model generalizes well across lighting
conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ACamera-Net consistently
enhances image quality and stabilizes perception outputs, outperforming
conventional auto modes and lightweight baselines without relying on additional
image enhancement modules.

Result: EmbodiedBrain achieves superior performance across all metrics, establishing new state-of-the-art for embodied foundation models, with experimental validation through comprehensive three-part evaluation system.

Conclusion: The work paves the way for next-generation generalist embodied agents by open-sourcing all data, model weights, and evaluation methods, addressing key limitations in current embodied AI approaches.

Abstract: The realization of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) necessitates
Embodied AI agents capable of robust spatial perception, effective task
planning, and adaptive execution in physical environments. However, current
large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for embodied tasks
suffer from key limitations, including a significant gap between model design

these challenges, we propose EmbodiedBrain, a novel vision-language foundation
model available in both 7B and 32B parameter sizes. Our framework features an
agent-aligned data structure and employs a powerful training methodology that
integrates large-scale Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Step-Augumented Group
Relative Policy Optimization (Step-GRPO), which boosts long-horizon task
success by integrating preceding steps as Guided Precursors. Furthermore, we
incorporate a comprehensive reward system, including a Generative Reward Model
(GRM) accelerated at the infrastructure level, to improve training efficiency.
For enable thorough validation, we establish a three-part evaluation system
encompassing General, Planning, and End-to-End Simulation Benchmarks,
highlighted by the proposal and open-sourcing of a novel, challenging
simulation environment. Experimental results demonstrate that EmbodiedBrain
achieves superior performance across all metrics, establishing a new

TL;DR: Open-o3 Video is a non-agent framework that integrates explicit spatio-temporal evidence into video reasoning by highlighting key timestamps, objects, and bounding boxes alongside answers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most video reasoning models only generate textual reasoning traces without indicating when and where key evidence appears, and extending evidence-centered reasoning from images to videos is challenging due to the need for joint temporal tracking and spatial localization across dynamic scenes.

Method: Curated two high-quality datasets (STGR-CoT-30k for SFT and STGR-RL-36k for RL) with unified spatio-temporal annotations, and adopted a cold-start reinforcement learning strategy with multiple specially designed rewards that jointly encourage answer accuracy, temporal alignment, and spatial precision.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on V-STAR benchmark, raising mAM by 14.4% and mLGM by 24.2% on Qwen2.5-VL baseline. Consistent improvements observed on VideoMME, WorldSense, VideoMMMU, and TVGBench. Reasoning traces also provide valuable signals for test-time scaling and confidence-aware verification.

Conclusion: Open-o3 Video successfully integrates explicit spatio-temporal evidence into video reasoning, enabling reasoning to be grounded in concrete visual observations and providing valuable signals for test-time scaling and confidence-aware verification.

Abstract: Most video reasoning models only generate textual reasoning traces without
indicating when and where key evidence appears. Recent models such as OpenAI-o3
have sparked wide interest in evidence-centered reasoning for images, yet
extending this ability to videos is more challenging, as it requires joint
temporal tracking and spatial localization across dynamic scenes. We introduce
Open-o3 Video, a non-agent framework that integrates explicit spatio-temporal
evidence into video reasoning, and carefully collect training data and design
training strategies to address the aforementioned challenges. The model
highlights key timestamps, objects, and bounding boxes alongside its answers,
allowing reasoning to be grounded in concrete visual observations. To enable
this functionality, we first curate and build two high-quality datasets,
STGR-CoT-30k for SFT and STGR-RL-36k for RL, with carefully constructed
temporal and spatial annotations, since most existing datasets offer either
temporal spans for videos or spatial boxes on images, lacking unified
spatio-temporal supervision and reasoning traces. Then, we adopt a cold-start
reinforcement learning strategy with multiple specially designed rewards that
jointly encourage answer accuracy, temporal alignment, and spatial precision.
On V-STAR benchmark, Open-o3 Video achieves state-of-the-art performance,
raising mAM by 14.4% and mLGM by 24.2% on the Qwen2.5-VL baseline. Consistent
improvements are also observed on a broad range of video understanding
benchmarks, including VideoMME, WorldSense, VideoMMMU, and TVGBench. Beyond
accuracy, the reasoning traces produced by Open-o3 Video also provide valuable
signals for test-time scaling, enabling confidence-aware verification and
improving answer reliability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GenColorBench is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating text-to-image models' color generation capabilities, addressing the gap in existing benchmarks that lack systematic assessment of color precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models struggle with fine-grained color controllability and existing benchmarks neglect systematic color evaluation, despite color being fundamental to visual perception and critical for applications requiring brand consistency.

Method: Proposed GenColorBench benchmark grounded in color systems (ISCC-NBS, CSS3/X11) with 44K color-focused prompts covering 400+ colors, including numerical colors absent in other benchmarks, using both perceptual and automated assessments.

Result: Evaluations of popular text-to-image models using GenColorBench reveal performance variations, showing which color conventions models understand best and identifying specific failure modes in color generation.

Conclusion: GenColorBench provides the first comprehensive assessment of color generation capabilities and will guide improvements in precise color generation for text-to-image models.

Abstract: Recent years have seen impressive advances in text-to-image generation, with
image generative or unified models producing high-quality images from text. Yet
these models still struggle with fine-grained color controllability, often
failing to accurately match colors specified in text prompts. While existing
benchmarks evaluate compositional reasoning and prompt adherence, none
systematically assess color precision. Color is fundamental to human visual
perception and communication, critical for applications from art to design
workflows requiring brand consistency. However, current benchmarks either
neglect color or rely on coarse assessments, missing key capabilities such as
interpreting RGB values or aligning with human expectations. To this end, we
propose GenColorBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for text-to-image
color generation, grounded in color systems like ISCC-NBS and CSS3/X11,
including numerical colors which are absent elsewhere. With 44K color-focused
prompts covering 400+ colors, it reveals models' true capabilities via
perceptual and automated assessments. Evaluations of popular text-to-image
models using GenColorBench show performance variations, highlighting which
color conventions models understand best and identifying failure modes. Our
GenColorBench assessments will guide improvements in precise color generation.
The benchmark will be made public upon acceptance.

*Ziyu Ye,Chen Ju,Chaofan Ma,Xiaoyun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework for cross-modality segmentation using similarity-based prototypes to address domain shift in unsupervised domain adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models suffer performance degradation on unseen data due to domain shift, and unsupervised domain adaptation aims to reduce domain gap without costly annotation.

Method: Learn class-wise prototypes in embedding space with similarity constraints, use dictionaries to store prototypes from different images to prevent class-missing and enable contrastive learning.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method achieves better results than other state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed similarity-based prototype framework effectively addresses cross-modality segmentation challenges in unsupervised domain adaptation.

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved great success on various vision
challenges, but a well-trained model would face drastic performance degradation
when applied to unseen data. Since the model is sensitive to domain shift,
unsupervised domain adaptation attempts to reduce the domain gap and avoid
costly annotation of unseen domains. This paper proposes a novel framework for
cross-modality segmentation via similarity-based prototypes. In specific, we
learn class-wise prototypes within an embedding space, then introduce a
similarity constraint to make these prototypes representative for each semantic
class while separable from different classes. Moreover, we use dictionaries to
store prototypes extracted from different images, which prevents the
class-missing problem and enables the contrastive learning of prototypes, and
further improves performance. Extensive experiments show that our method
achieves better results than other state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: Free-moving object reconstruction from monocular video is challenging without reliable pose or depth cues and under arbitrary object motion.

Method: Uses a dual-key memory module combining latent appearance-geometry keys with explicit directional keys, progressively refining object representation through dense Gaussian primitive field anchored to first frame.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art pose-free reconstruction baselines on real-world datasets, consistently improving with more observations while maintaining constant memory and runtime.

Conclusion: The approach enables high-quality, object-centric 3D Gaussian reconstruction directly from RGB frames with constant computational cost regardless of video sequence length.

Abstract: Free-moving object reconstruction from monocular video remains challenging,
particularly without reliable pose or depth cues and under arbitrary object
motion. We introduce OnlineSplatter, a novel online feed-forward framework
generating high-quality, object-centric 3D Gaussians directly from RGB frames
without requiring camera pose, depth priors, or bundle optimization. Our
approach anchors reconstruction using the first frame and progressively refines
the object representation through a dense Gaussian primitive field, maintaining
constant computational cost regardless of video sequence length. Our core
contribution is a dual-key memory module combining latent appearance-geometry
keys with explicit directional keys, robustly fusing current frame features
with temporally aggregated object states. This design enables effective
handling of free-moving objects via spatial-guided memory readout and an
efficient sparsification mechanism, ensuring comprehensive yet compact object
coverage. Evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that OnlineSplatter
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art pose-free reconstruction baselines,
consistently improving with more observations while maintaining constant memory

*Yuan Sheng,Yanbin Hao,Chenxu Li,Shuo Wang,Xiangnan He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeViCES is a training-free framework for long video understanding that selects informative frames through semantic-visual consensus and refines answers by resolving inconsistencies between different evidence sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long video understanding is challenging due to complex, diverse content and computational limitations of current Video-LLMs. Existing frame selection methods ignore temporal dependencies or rely on unimodal evidence, limiting their ability to provide complete query-relevant context.

Method: SeViCES has two key components: 1) Semantic-Visual Consensus Frame Selection (SVCFS) with temporal-aware semantic branch using LLM reasoning over captions and cluster-guided visual branch aligning embeddings with semantic scores via mutual information; 2) Answer Consensus Refinement (ACR) that fuses evidence and constrains answer space to resolve inconsistencies.

Result: Extensive experiments on long video understanding benchmarks show that SeViCES consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the importance of consensus-driven evidence selection for Video-LLMs, providing effective and reliable long video understanding without requiring training.

Abstract: Long video understanding remains challenging due to its complex, diverse, and
temporally scattered content. Although video large language models (Video-LLMs)
can process videos lasting tens of minutes, applying them to truly long
sequences is computationally prohibitive and often leads to unfocused or
inconsistent reasoning. A promising solution is to select only the most
informative frames, yet existing approaches typically ignore temporal
dependencies or rely on unimodal evidence, limiting their ability to provide
complete and query-relevant context. We propose a Semantic-Visual Consensus
Evidence Selection (SeViCES) framework for effective and reliable long video
understanding. SeViCES is training-free and model-agnostic, and introduces two
key components. The Semantic-Visual Consensus Frame Selection (SVCFS) module
selects frames through (1) a temporal-aware semantic branch that leverages LLM
reasoning over captions, and (2) a cluster-guided visual branch that aligns
embeddings with semantic scores via mutual information. The Answer Consensus
Refinement (ACR) module further resolves inconsistencies between semantic- and
visual-based predictions by fusing evidence and constraining the answer space.
Extensive experiments on long video understanding benchmarks show that SeViCES
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and
robustness, demonstrating the importance of consensus-driven evidence selection
for Video-LLMs.

Method: The authors systematically review 260 studies (49 on dental datasets and 211 on DL algorithms), introducing dental imaging basics, summarizing dataset characteristics, presenting DL foundational techniques, and categorizing models by different DIA tasks while analyzing network architectures, optimization strategies, and training methods.

Result: The review comprehensively summarizes recent progress in DL-based dental image analysis, including characteristics of existing datasets, foundational DL techniques, and performance analysis of various models across different DIA tasks.

Abstract: Efficient analysis and processing of dental images are crucial for dentists
to achieve accurate diagnosis and optimal treatment planning. However, dental
imaging inherently poses several challenges, such as low contrast, metallic
artifacts, and variations in projection angles. Combined with the subjectivity
arising from differences in clinicians' expertise, manual interpretation often
proves time-consuming and prone to inconsistency. Artificial intelligence
(AI)-based automated dental image analysis (DIA) offers a promising solution to
these issues and has become an integral part of computer-aided dental diagnosis
and treatment. Among various AI technologies, deep learning (DL) stands out as
the most widely applied and influential approach due to its superior feature
extraction and representation capabilities. To comprehensively summarize recent
progress in this field, we focus on the two fundamental aspects of DL
research-datasets and models. In this paper, we systematically review 260
studies on DL applications in DIA, including 49 papers on publicly available
dental datasets and 211 papers on DL-based algorithms. We first introduce the
basic concepts of dental imaging and summarize the characteristics and
acquisition methods of existing datasets. Then, we present the foundational
techniques of DL and categorize relevant models and algorithms according to
different DIA tasks, analyzing their network architectures, optimization
strategies, training methods, and performance. Furthermore, we summarize
commonly used training and evaluation metrics in the DIA domain. Finally, we
discuss the current challenges of existing research and outline potential
future directions. We hope that this work provides a valuable and systematic

TL;DR: BTB3D introduces a causal convolutional encoder-decoder for 3D medical imaging that produces compact, frequency-aware volumetric tokens, achieving state-of-the-art performance in report generation and text-to-CT synthesis through a three-stage training curriculum.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models for 3D medical imaging struggle with high-resolution, long-sequence volumes due to misaligned vision encoders and slice-wise tokenization that blurs fine anatomy, reducing diagnostic performance.

Method: BTB3D uses a causal convolutional encoder-decoder with a three-stage training curriculum: (i) local reconstruction, (ii) overlapping-window tiling, and (iii) long-context decoder refinement, enabling learning from short slice excerpts while generalizing to scans exceeding 300 slices.

Result: BTB3D improves BLEU scores and increases clinical F1 by 40% over existing methods for report generation, and reduces FID by 75% and halves FVD for text-to-CT synthesis, producing anatomically consistent 512*512*241 volumes.

Conclusion: Precise three-dimensional tokenization, rather than larger language backbones alone, is essential for scalable vision-language modeling in 3D medical imaging.

Abstract: Recent progress in vision-language modeling for 3D medical imaging has been
fueled by large-scale computed tomography (CT) corpora with paired free-text
reports, stronger architectures, and powerful pretrained models. This has
enabled applications such as automated report generation and text-conditioned
3D image synthesis. Yet, current approaches struggle with high-resolution,
long-sequence volumes: contrastive pretraining often yields vision encoders
that are misaligned with clinical language, and slice-wise tokenization blurs
fine anatomy, reducing diagnostic performance on downstream tasks. We introduce
BTB3D (Better Tokens for Better 3D), a causal convolutional encoder-decoder
that unifies 2D and 3D training and inference while producing compact,
frequency-aware volumetric tokens. A three-stage training curriculum enables
(i) local reconstruction, (ii) overlapping-window tiling, and (iii)
long-context decoder refinement, during which the model learns from short slice
excerpts yet generalizes to scans exceeding 300 slices without additional
memory overhead. BTB3D sets a new state-of-the-art on two key tasks: it
improves BLEU scores and increases clinical F1 by 40% over CT2Rep, CT-CHAT, and
Merlin for report generation; and it reduces FID by 75% and halves FVD compared
to GenerateCT and MedSyn for text-to-CT synthesis, producing anatomically
consistent 512*512*241 volumes. These results confirm that precise
three-dimensional tokenization, rather than larger language backbones alone, is
essential for scalable vision-language modeling in 3D medical imaging. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address two key challenges in ultra-high-resolution T2I generation: lack of large-scale high-quality UHR datasets and absence of tailored training strategies for fine-grained detail synthesis in UHR scenarios.

Method: Proposes UltraHR-100K dataset (100K images >3K resolution) and frequency-aware post-training with Detail-Oriented Timestep Sampling (DOTS) and Soft-Weighting Frequency Regularization (SWFR) using Discrete Fourier Transform.

Result: Extensive experiments on UltraHR-eval4K benchmarks show significant improvement in fine-grained detail quality and overall fidelity of UHR image generation.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses UHR T2I generation challenges through dataset creation and specialized training methods, achieving superior detail preservation and image quality.

Abstract: Ultra-high-resolution (UHR) text-to-image (T2I) generation has seen notable
progress. However, two key challenges remain : 1) the absence of a large-scale
high-quality UHR T2I dataset, and (2) the neglect of tailored training
strategies for fine-grained detail synthesis in UHR scenarios. To tackle the
first challenge, we introduce \textbf{UltraHR-100K}, a high-quality dataset of
100K UHR images with rich captions, offering diverse content and strong visual
fidelity. Each image exceeds 3K resolution and is rigorously curated based on
detail richness, content complexity, and aesthetic quality. To tackle the
second challenge, we propose a frequency-aware post-training method that
enhances fine-detail generation in T2I diffusion models. Specifically, we
design (i) \textit{Detail-Oriented Timestep Sampling (DOTS)} to focus learning
on detail-critical denoising steps, and (ii) \textit{Soft-Weighting Frequency
Regularization (SWFR)}, which leverages Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to
softly constrain frequency components, encouraging high-frequency detail
preservation. Extensive experiments on our proposed UltraHR-eval4K benchmarks
demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the fine-grained detail
quality and overall fidelity of UHR image generation. The code is available at

inefficient recycling, and increased greenhouse gas emissions. To address these
issues, this study introduces HybridSOMSpikeNet, a hybrid deep learning
framework that integrates convolutional feature extraction, differentiable
self-organization, and spiking-inspired temporal processing to enable
intelligent and energy-efficient waste classification. The proposed model
employs a pre-trained ResNet-152 backbone to extract deep spatial
representations, followed by a Differentiable Soft Self-Organizing Map
(Soft-SOM) that enhances topological clustering and interpretability. A spiking
neural head accumulates temporal activations over discrete time steps,
improving robustness and generalization. Trained on a ten-class waste dataset,
HybridSOMSpikeNet achieved a test accuracy of 97.39%, outperforming several
state-of-the-art architectures while maintaining a lightweight computational
profile suitable for real-world deployment. Beyond its technical innovations,
the framework provides tangible environmental benefits. By enabling precise and
automated waste segregation, it supports higher recycling efficiency, reduces
contamination in recyclable streams, and minimizes the ecological and
operational costs of waste processing. The approach aligns with global
sustainability priorities, particularly the United Nations Sustainable
Development Goals (SDG 11 and SDG 12), by contributing to cleaner cities,
circular economy initiatives, and intelligent environmental management systems.

### [68] [Efficient Multi-bit Quantization Network Training via Weight Bias Correction and Bit-wise Coreset Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20673)
*Jinhee Kim,Jae Jun An,Kang Eun Jeon,Jong Hwan Ko*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes two techniques to reduce training overhead in multi-bit quantization networks: weight bias correction for shared batch normalization and bit-wise coreset sampling for efficient subset training, achieving up to 7.88x faster training while maintaining competitive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-bit quantization approaches suffer from significant training overhead as they require full-dataset updates for each supported bit-width and extra fine-tuning stages for additional precision options, leading to linear scaling of training costs with the number of precisions.

Method: Two main techniques: (1) Weight bias correction enables shared batch normalization by neutralizing quantization-induced bias across bit-widths and aligning activation distributions; (2) Bit-wise coreset sampling strategy allows each child model to train on compact, informative subsets selected via gradient-based importance scores.

Result: Experiments on CIFAR-10/100, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet-1K with ResNet and ViT architectures show competitive or superior accuracy while reducing training time up to 7.88x compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses the training overhead problem in multi-bit quantization networks through weight bias correction and coreset sampling, enabling efficient deployment of flexible precision models without compromising utility.

Abstract: Multi-bit quantization networks enable flexible deployment of deep neural
networks by supporting multiple precision levels within a single model.
However, existing approaches suffer from significant training overhead as
full-dataset updates are repeated for each supported bit-width, resulting in a
cost that scales linearly with the number of precisions. Additionally, extra
fine-tuning stages are often required to support additional or intermediate
precision options, further compounding the overall training burden. To address
this issue, we propose two techniques that greatly reduce the training overhead
without compromising model utility: (i) Weight bias correction enables shared
batch normalization and eliminates the need for fine-tuning by neutralizing
quantization-induced bias across bit-widths and aligning activation
distributions; and (ii) Bit-wise coreset sampling strategy allows each child
model to train on a compact, informative subset selected via gradient-based
importance scores by exploiting the implicit knowledge transfer phenomenon.
Experiments on CIFAR-10/100, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet-1K with both ResNet and
ViT architectures demonstrate that our method achieves competitive or superior
accuracy while reducing training time up to 7.88x. Our code is released at

### [70] [Mixing Importance with Diversity: Joint Optimization for KV Cache Compression in Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20707)
*Xuyang Liu,Xiyan Gui,Yuchao Zhang,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MixKV is a novel KV cache compression method for large vision-language models that balances importance and diversity to address modality-specific semantic redundancy, achieving significant performance improvements under extreme compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KV cache compression methods focus only on importance but overlook modality-specific semantic redundancy patterns in multi-modal KV caches, leading to potential loss of semantic coverage.

Method: MixKV adapts to head-wise semantic redundancy by selectively balancing diversity and importance when compressing KV pairs, mixing importance with diversity for optimized compression.

Result: Under extreme compression (budget=64), MixKV improves baseline methods by 5.1% across five multi-modal benchmarks and achieves 8.0-9.0% gains on GUI grounding tasks while maintaining comparable inference efficiency.

Conclusion: MixKV effectively addresses the memory bottleneck in LVLMs by considering both importance and diversity in KV cache compression, with demonstrated effectiveness across multiple models and tasks.

Abstract: Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities in processing extended multi-modal sequences, yet the resulting
key-value (KV) cache expansion creates a critical memory bottleneck that
fundamentally limits deployment scalability. While existing KV cache
compression methods focus on retaining high-importance KV pairs to minimize
storage, they often overlook the modality-specific semantic redundancy patterns
that emerge distinctively in multi-modal KV caches. In this work, we first
analyze how, beyond simple importance, the KV cache in LVLMs exhibits varying
levels of redundancy across attention heads. We show that relying solely on
importance can only cover a subset of the full KV cache information
distribution, leading to potential loss of semantic coverage. To address this,
we propose \texttt{MixKV}, a novel method that mixes importance with diversity
for optimized KV cache compression in LVLMs. \texttt{MixKV} adapts to head-wise
semantic redundancy, selectively balancing diversity and importance when
compressing KV pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{MixKV}
consistently enhances existing methods across multiple LVLMs. Under extreme
compression (budget=64), \texttt{MixKV} improves baseline methods by an average
of \textbf{5.1\%} across five multi-modal understanding benchmarks and achieves
remarkable gains of \textbf{8.0\%} and \textbf{9.0\%} for SnapKV and AdaKV on
GUI grounding tasks, all while maintaining comparable inference efficiency.
Furthermore, \texttt{MixKV} extends seamlessly to LLMs with comparable
performance gains. Our code is available at

TL;DR: ALICE-LRI is a sensor-agnostic method that achieves lossless range image generation from spinning LiDAR point clouds by automatically reverse-engineering intrinsic sensor geometry without requiring manufacturer metadata.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional LiDAR projection methods suffer from geometric inconsistencies that cause irreversible information loss, compromising high-fidelity applications in autonomous navigation and remote sensing.

Method: The algorithm automatically infers critical LiDAR parameters including laser beam configuration, angular distributions, and per-beam calibration corrections to enable lossless projection and complete point cloud reconstruction.

Result: Comprehensive evaluation shows perfect point preservation with zero points lost across all point clouds, maintaining geometric accuracy within sensor precision limits with real-time performance.

Conclusion: This paradigm shift from approximate to lossless LiDAR projections opens new possibilities for high-precision remote sensing applications requiring complete geometric preservation.

Abstract: 3D LiDAR sensors are essential for autonomous navigation, environmental
monitoring, and precision mapping in remote sensing applications. To
efficiently process the massive point clouds generated by these sensors, LiDAR
data is often projected into 2D range images that organize points by their
angular positions and distances. While these range image representations enable
efficient processing, conventional projection methods suffer from fundamental
geometric inconsistencies that cause irreversible information loss,
compromising high-fidelity applications. We present ALICE-LRI (Automatic LiDAR
Intrinsic Calibration Estimation for Lossless Range Images), the first general,
sensor-agnostic method that achieves lossless range image generation from
spinning LiDAR point clouds without requiring manufacturer metadata or
calibration files. Our algorithm automatically reverse-engineers the intrinsic
geometry of any spinning LiDAR sensor by inferring critical parameters
including laser beam configuration, angular distributions, and per-beam
calibration corrections, enabling lossless projection and complete point cloud
reconstruction with zero point loss. Comprehensive evaluation across the
complete KITTI and DurLAR datasets demonstrates that ALICE-LRI achieves perfect
point preservation, with zero points lost across all point clouds. Geometric
accuracy is maintained well within sensor precision limits, establishing
geometric losslessness with real-time performance. We also present a
compression case study that validates substantial downstream benefits,
demonstrating significant quality improvements in practical applications. This
paradigm shift from approximate to lossless LiDAR projections opens new
possibilities for high-precision remote sensing applications requiring complete
geometric preservation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AutoScape is a framework for generating long-horizon driving scenes using RGB-D diffusion models to create geometrically consistent keyframes, then interpolating between them with video diffusion to produce coherent videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of generating realistic and geometrically consistent long-horizon driving videos, which requires maintaining spatial coherence over extended time periods.

Method: Uses an RGB-D diffusion model to generate sparse keyframes with geometric consistency, then employs a video diffusion model to interpolate between keyframes. Key techniques include joint image-depth handling in shared latent space, conditioning on existing scene geometry, and warp-consistent sampling guidance.

Result: Generates realistic driving videos over 20 seconds long, achieving 48.6% improvement in long-horizon FID and 43.0% improvement in FVD scores compared to prior state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: AutoScape successfully addresses long-horizon driving scene generation by combining RGB-D keyframe generation with video interpolation, significantly outperforming existing approaches in both quality and geometric consistency metrics.

Abstract: This paper proposes AutoScape, a long-horizon driving scene generation
framework. At its core is a novel RGB-D diffusion model that iteratively
generates sparse, geometrically consistent keyframes, serving as reliable
anchors for the scene's appearance and geometry. To maintain long-range
geometric consistency, the model 1) jointly handles image and depth in a shared
latent space, 2) explicitly conditions on the existing scene geometry (i.e.,
rendered point clouds) from previously generated keyframes, and 3) steers the
sampling process with a warp-consistent guidance. Given high-quality RGB-D
keyframes, a video diffusion model then interpolates between them to produce
dense and coherent video frames. AutoScape generates realistic and
geometrically consistent driving videos of over 20 seconds, improving the
long-horizon FID and FVD scores over the prior state-of-the-art by 48.6\% and
43.0\%, respectively.

*Noam Issachar,Guy Yariv,Sagie Benaim,Yossi Adi,Dani Lischinski,Raanan Fattal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dynamic Position Extrapolation (DyPE) is a training-free method that enables pre-trained diffusion transformers to generate ultra-high-resolution images beyond their training resolution by dynamically adjusting positional encoding based on the diffusion process's spectral progression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training diffusion transformers at ultra-high resolutions is extremely costly due to quadratic scaling of self-attention with image tokens. Existing methods struggle with generating images far beyond training resolution without additional training or sampling costs.

Method: DyPE dynamically adjusts the model's positional encoding at each diffusion step to match the frequency spectrum with the current generative stage, leveraging the fact that low-frequency structures converge early while high-frequencies take more steps to resolve.

Result: DyPE enables generation of images at resolutions far beyond training data (e.g., 16 million pixels using FLUX) with no additional sampling cost. It consistently improves performance on multiple benchmarks and achieves state-of-the-art fidelity in ultra-high-resolution image generation.

Conclusion: DyPE provides an effective training-free solution for ultra-high-resolution image generation with diffusion transformers, with performance gains becoming more pronounced at higher resolutions.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer models can generate images with remarkable fidelity and
detail, yet training them at ultra-high resolutions remains extremely costly
due to the self-attention mechanism's quadratic scaling with the number of
image tokens. In this paper, we introduce Dynamic Position Extrapolation
(DyPE), a novel, training-free method that enables pre-trained diffusion
transformers to synthesize images at resolutions far beyond their training
data, with no additional sampling cost. DyPE takes advantage of the spectral
progression inherent to the diffusion process, where low-frequency structures
converge early, while high-frequencies take more steps to resolve.
Specifically, DyPE dynamically adjusts the model's positional encoding at each
diffusion step, matching their frequency spectrum with the current stage of the
generative process. This approach allows us to generate images at resolutions
that exceed the training resolution dramatically, e.g., 16 million pixels using
FLUX. On multiple benchmarks, DyPE consistently improves performance and
achieves state-of-the-art fidelity in ultra-high-resolution image generation,
with gains becoming even more pronounced at higher resolutions. Project page is

TL;DR: α-Flow is a new objective that unifies trajectory flow matching and MeanFlow, addressing optimization conflicts through curriculum learning and achieving state-of-the-art few-step generative modeling results on ImageNet-256.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MeanFlow shows promise for few-step generative modeling but suffers from optimization conflicts between trajectory flow matching and trajectory consistency terms, causing slow convergence.

Method: Introduces α-Flow, a family of objectives that unifies trajectory flow matching, Shortcut Model, and MeanFlow. Uses curriculum strategy to smoothly anneal from trajectory flow matching to MeanFlow, disentangling conflicting objectives.

Result: Outperforms MeanFlow across scales and settings on class-conditional ImageNet-1K 256x256. Largest α-Flow-XL/2+ model achieves SOTA with FID 2.58 (1-NFE) and 2.15 (2-NFE) using vanilla DiT backbones.

Conclusion: α-Flow successfully resolves optimization conflicts in MeanFlow through curriculum learning, enabling better convergence and state-of-the-art performance in few-step generative modeling.

Abstract: MeanFlow has recently emerged as a powerful framework for few-step generative
modeling trained from scratch, but its success is not yet fully understood. In
this work, we show that the MeanFlow objective naturally decomposes into two
parts: trajectory flow matching and trajectory consistency. Through gradient
analysis, we find that these terms are strongly negatively correlated, causing
optimization conflict and slow convergence. Motivated by these insights, we
introduce $\alpha$-Flow, a broad family of objectives that unifies trajectory
flow matching, Shortcut Model, and MeanFlow under one formulation. By adopting
a curriculum strategy that smoothly anneals from trajectory flow matching to
MeanFlow, $\alpha$-Flow disentangles the conflicting objectives, and achieves
better convergence. When trained from scratch on class-conditional ImageNet-1K
256x256 with vanilla DiT backbones, $\alpha$-Flow consistently outperforms
MeanFlow across scales and settings. Our largest $\alpha$-Flow-XL/2+ model
achieves new state-of-the-art results using vanilla DiT backbones, with FID
scores of 2.58 (1-NFE) and 2.15 (2-NFE).

Motivation: To address the challenge of accurate 3D reconstruction from single 2D images by unifying pose estimation and shape generation within a single generative framework.

Method: Uses a two-stage flow matching pipeline: coarse stage for initial geometry and pose recovery, and refinement stage that integrates pose-aligned image features to enhance structural and appearance details.

Result: Outperforms leading methods with over 3 dB PSNR gain, over 10% Chamfer Distance reduction, matches monocular pose estimators in accuracy, and delivers superior visual fidelity.

Conclusion: Cupid demonstrates effective joint learning of camera pose and 3D shape through a unified generative framework, achieving state-of-the-art performance in single-image 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: This work proposes a new generation-based 3D reconstruction method, named
Cupid, that accurately infers the camera pose, 3D shape, and texture of an
object from a single 2D image. Cupid casts 3D reconstruction as a conditional
sampling process from a learned distribution of 3D objects, and it jointly
generates voxels and pixel-voxel correspondences, enabling robust pose and
shape estimation under a unified generative framework. By representing both
input camera poses and 3D shape as a distribution in a shared 3D latent space,
Cupid adopts a two-stage flow matching pipeline: (1) a coarse stage that
produces initial 3D geometry with associated 2D projections for pose recovery;
and (2) a refinement stage that integrates pose-aligned image features to
enhance structural fidelity and appearance details. Extensive experiments
demonstrate Cupid outperforms leading 3D reconstruction methods with an over 3
dB PSNR gain and an over 10% Chamfer Distance reduction, while matching
monocular estimators on pose accuracy and delivering superior visual fidelity
over baseline 3D generative models. For an immersive view of the 3D results

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many studies underutilize radar's capability to provide accurate range/depth information, assigning it only a supplementary role despite its potential for crucial contributions to multi-object tracking.

Method: Developed a radar-camera fusion MOT framework using online calibration, common features for real-world position derivation, and feature matching with category-consistency checking to improve sensor association accuracy.

Result: The framework streamlines radar-camera mapping process and improves tracking precision, as demonstrated in real-world experiments in controlled environments and actual traffic scenarios.

Conclusion: This work is the first to investigate integration of radar-camera common features and their use in online calibration for MOT, achieving enhanced tracking efficiency with reduced manual interventions.

Abstract: This paper presents a Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) framework that fuses radar
and camera data to enhance tracking efficiency while minimizing manual
interventions. Contrary to many studies that underutilize radar and assign it a
supplementary role--despite its capability to provide accurate range/depth
information of targets in a world 3D coordinate system--our approach positions
radar in a crucial role. Meanwhile, this paper utilizes common features to
enable online calibration to autonomously associate detections from radar and
camera. The main contributions of this work include: (1) the development of a
radar-camera fusion MOT framework that exploits online radar-camera calibration
to simplify the integration of detection results from these two sensors, (2)
the utilization of common features between radar and camera data to accurately
derive real-world positions of detected objects, and (3) the adoption of
feature matching and category-consistency checking to surpass the limitations
of mere position matching in enhancing sensor association accuracy. To the best
of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the integration of
radar-camera common features and their use in online calibration for achieving
MOT. The efficacy of our framework is demonstrated by its ability to streamline
the radar-camera mapping process and improve tracking precision, as evidenced
by real-world experiments conducted in both controlled environments and actual

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ARGenSeg is a novel autoregressive generation-based approach for image segmentation that unifies multimodal understanding and pixel-level perception within MLLMs, using visual token generation and VQ-VAE detokenization to produce dense masks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLM segmentation methods use discrete representations or specialized heads that limit fine-grained visual detail capture. The goal is to enable MLLMs to perform segmentation through pixel-level understanding rather than relying on external decoders.

Method: Proposes a generation-based segmentation framework where MLLMs output visual tokens that are detokenized into images using a universal VQ-VAE. Uses next-scale-prediction strategy for parallel token generation to reduce inference latency.

Result: Outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods on multiple segmentation datasets with significant inference speed improvements while maintaining strong multimodal understanding capabilities.

Conclusion: ARGenSeg successfully demonstrates that MLLMs can perform high-quality segmentation through pixel-level generation, achieving superior performance and efficiency compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: We propose a novel AutoRegressive Generation-based paradigm for image
Segmentation (ARGenSeg), achieving multimodal understanding and pixel-level
perception within a unified framework. Prior works integrating image
segmentation into multimodal large language models (MLLMs) typically employ
either boundary points representation or dedicated segmentation heads. These
methods rely on discrete representations or semantic prompts fed into
task-specific decoders, which limits the ability of the MLLM to capture
fine-grained visual details. To address these challenges, we introduce a
segmentation framework for MLLM based on image generation, which naturally
produces dense masks for target objects. We leverage MLLM to output visual
tokens and detokenize them into images using an universal VQ-VAE, making the
segmentation fully dependent on the pixel-level understanding of the MLLM. To
reduce inference latency, we employ a next-scale-prediction strategy to
generate required visual tokens in parallel. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method surpasses prior state-of-the-art approaches on multiple
segmentation datasets with a remarkable boost in inference speed, while
maintaining strong understanding capabilities.

Motivation: To address the common shortcoming of existing video-generative approaches in causal modeling of physical simulations over time, and leverage the success of transformer models from language to visual domains.

Method: Simple end-to-end transformer adaptation for video prediction with various spatiotemporal self-attention layouts, using continuous pixel-space representations and unsupervised training on physical simulation datasets.

Conclusion: Provides a platform for attention-based spatiotemporal video modeling through a simple, parameter-efficient, and interpretable approach that generalizes well to out-of-distribution parameters.

Abstract: Inspired by the performance and scalability of autoregressive large language
models (LLMs), transformer-based models have seen recent success in the visual
domain. This study investigates a transformer adaptation for video prediction
with a simple end-to-end approach, comparing various spatiotemporal
self-attention layouts. Focusing on causal modeling of physical simulations
over time; a common shortcoming of existing video-generative approaches, we
attempt to isolate spatiotemporal reasoning via physical object tracking
metrics and unsupervised training on physical simulation datasets. We introduce
a simple yet effective pure transformer model for autoregressive video
prediction, utilizing continuous pixel-space representations for video
prediction. Without the need for complex training strategies or latent
feature-learning components, our approach significantly extends the time
horizon for physically accurate predictions by up to 50% when compared with
existing latent-space approaches, while maintaining comparable performance on
common video quality metrics. In addition, we conduct interpretability
experiments to identify network regions that encode information useful to
perform accurate estimations of PDE simulation parameters via probing models,
and find that this generalizes to the estimation of out-of-distribution
simulation parameters. This work serves as a platform for further
attention-based spatiotemporal modeling of videos via a simple, parameter
efficient, and interpretable approach.

Motivation: Large VLMs struggle with information-intensive images that densely interleave text and graphics, facing challenges in precise localization and multi-hop reasoning over dispersed evidence.

Method: Uses speculative decoding approach: draft stage with small VLMs generating diverse localization candidates, verdict stage with strong VLM synthesizing paths, plus consensus expert selection for efficiency.

Result: Achieves consistent gains on challenging benchmarks including InfographicVQA, ChartMuseum, ChartQAPro, and HR-Bench 4K, with both error correction and cost-efficiency.

Conclusion: SV effectively synthesizes correct insights from partially accurate reasoning paths, outperforming large proprietary models or training pipelines while being computationally efficient.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
multimodal understanding, yet they struggle when reasoning over
information-intensive images that densely interleave textual annotations with
fine-grained graphical elements. The main challenges lie in precisely
localizing critical cues in dense layouts and multi-hop reasoning to integrate
dispersed evidence. We propose Speculative Verdict (SV), a training-free
framework inspired by speculative decoding that combines multiple lightweight
draft experts with a large verdict model. In the draft stage, small VLMs act as
draft experts to generate reasoning paths that provide diverse localization
candidates; in the verdict stage, a strong VLM synthesizes these paths to
produce the final answer, minimizing computational cost while recovering
correct answers. To further improve efficiency and accuracy, SV introduces a
consensus expert selection mechanism that forwards only high-agreement
reasoning paths to the verdict. Empirically, SV achieves consistent gains on
challenging information-intensive and high-resolution visual question answering
benchmarks, including InfographicVQA, ChartMuseum, ChartQAPro, and HR-Bench 4K.
By synthesizing correct insights from multiple partially accurate reasoning
paths, SV achieves both error correction and cost-efficiency compared to large

Method: Uses unmixing bottleneck: extracts endmember signatures from low-resolution HSI, predicts abundance-like maps from MSI using MLP, reconstructs spectra via linear mixing, and trains self-supervised via MSI spectral response function.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised/self-supervised baselines, remains competitive with supervised methods, trains in under a minute, and works robustly even with single-band MSI.

Conclusion: SpectraMorph provides interpretable hyperspectral super-resolution with physics-guided approach, achieving strong performance while maintaining transparency and robustness across various MSI configurations.

Abstract: Hyperspectral sensors capture dense spectra per pixel but suffer from low
spatial resolution, causing blurred boundaries and mixed-pixel effects.
Co-registered companion sensors such as multispectral, RGB, or panchromatic
cameras provide high-resolution spatial detail, motivating hyperspectral
super-resolution through the fusion of hyperspectral and multispectral images
(HSI-MSI). Existing deep learning based methods achieve strong performance but
rely on opaque regressors that lack interpretability and often fail when the
MSI has very few bands. We propose SpectraMorph, a physics-guided
self-supervised fusion framework with a structured latent space. Instead of
direct regression, SpectraMorph enforces an unmixing bottleneck: endmember
signatures are extracted from the low-resolution HSI, and a compact multilayer
perceptron predicts abundance-like maps from the MSI. Spectra are reconstructed
by linear mixing, with training performed in a self-supervised manner via the
MSI sensor's spectral response function. SpectraMorph produces interpretable
intermediates, trains in under a minute, and remains robust even with a
single-band (pan-chromatic) MSI. Experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets show SpectraMorph consistently outperforming state-of-the-art
unsupervised/self-supervised baselines while remaining very competitive against
supervised baselines.

TL;DR: LDDBM is a general-purpose framework for modality translation using latent-variable diffusion models that bridges arbitrary modalities without requiring aligned dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models excel in single-modality domains but struggle with modality translation due to restrictive assumptions like shared dimensionality and Gaussian priors, limiting their generality.

Method: Uses latent-variable extension of Denoising Diffusion Bridge Models with shared latent space, contrastive alignment loss for semantic consistency, domain-agnostic encoder-decoder architecture, and predictive loss for cross-domain translation.

Result: Performs strongly on diverse MT tasks including multi-view to 3D shape generation, image super-resolution, and multi-view scene synthesis, establishing a new strong baseline.

Conclusion: LDDBM provides an effective general framework for modality translation that supports arbitrary modality pairs without dimensional constraints.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling have positioned diffusion models as
state-of-the-art tools for sampling from complex data distributions. While
these models have shown remarkable success across single-modality domains such
as images and audio, extending their capabilities to Modality Translation (MT),
translating information across different sensory modalities, remains an open
challenge. Existing approaches often rely on restrictive assumptions, including
shared dimensionality, Gaussian source priors, and modality-specific
architectures, which limit their generality and theoretical grounding. In this
work, we propose the Latent Denoising Diffusion Bridge Model (LDDBM), a
general-purpose framework for modality translation based on a latent-variable
extension of Denoising Diffusion Bridge Models. By operating in a shared latent
space, our method learns a bridge between arbitrary modalities without
requiring aligned dimensions. We introduce a contrastive alignment loss to
enforce semantic consistency between paired samples and design a
domain-agnostic encoder-decoder architecture tailored for noise prediction in
latent space. Additionally, we propose a predictive loss to guide training
toward accurate cross-domain translation and explore several training
strategies to improve stability. Our approach supports arbitrary modality pairs
and performs strongly on diverse MT tasks, including multi-view to 3D shape
generation, image super-resolution, and multi-view scene synthesis.
Comprehensive experiments and ablations validate the effectiveness of our
framework, establishing a new strong baseline in general modality translation.

### [83] [LayerComposer: Interactive Personalized T2I via Spatially-Aware Layered Canvas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20820)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LayerComposer is an interactive framework for personalized multi-subject text-to-image generation that uses a layered canvas representation and locking mechanism to enable precise spatial control and identity preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing personalized generative models lack interactive control over spatial composition and scale poorly to multiple subjects, limiting their practical usability.

Method: Uses a layered canvas where each subject is on a distinct layer for occlusion-free composition, and a locking mechanism that preserves selected layers while allowing others to adapt contextually. Combines positional embeddings with complementary data sampling.

Result: Achieves superior spatial control and identity preservation compared to state-of-the-art methods in multi-subject personalized image generation.

Conclusion: LayerComposer provides an effective interactive framework for multi-subject personalized generation with professional editing-like control over spatial composition.

Abstract: Despite their impressive visual fidelity, existing personalized generative
models lack interactive control over spatial composition and scale poorly to
multiple subjects. To address these limitations, we present LayerComposer, an
interactive framework for personalized, multi-subject text-to-image generation.
Our approach introduces two main contributions: (1) a layered canvas, a novel
representation in which each subject is placed on a distinct layer, enabling
occlusion-free composition; and (2) a locking mechanism that preserves selected
layers with high fidelity while allowing the remaining layers to adapt flexibly
to the surrounding context. Similar to professional image-editing software, the
proposed layered canvas allows users to place, resize, or lock input subjects
through intuitive layer manipulation. Our versatile locking mechanism requires
no architectural changes, relying instead on inherent positional embeddings
combined with a new complementary data sampling strategy. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that LayerComposer achieves superior spatial control and identity
preservation compared to the state-of-the-art methods in multi-subject
personalized image generation.

TL;DR: HoloCine bridges the narrative gap in text-to-video generation by creating coherent, multi-shot scenes with global consistency, moving beyond isolated clip synthesis to automated filmmaking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-video models generate isolated clips but fail at creating coherent multi-shot narratives essential for storytelling, creating a 'narrative gap' that needs to be addressed.

Method: Uses Window Cross-Attention for precise directorial control by localizing text prompts to specific shots, and Sparse Inter-Shot Self-Attention (dense within shots, sparse between them) for efficient minute-scale generation.

Result: Sets new state-of-the-art in narrative coherence and develops emergent abilities including persistent memory for characters/scenes and intuitive grasp of cinematic techniques.

Conclusion: Marks a pivotal shift from clip synthesis towards automated filmmaking, making end-to-end cinematic creation a tangible future.

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-video models excel at generating isolated clips but
fall short of creating the coherent, multi-shot narratives, which are the
essence of storytelling. We bridge this "narrative gap" with HoloCine, a model
that generates entire scenes holistically to ensure global consistency from the
first shot to the last. Our architecture achieves precise directorial control
through a Window Cross-Attention mechanism that localizes text prompts to
specific shots, while a Sparse Inter-Shot Self-Attention pattern (dense within
shots but sparse between them) ensures the efficiency required for minute-scale
generation. Beyond setting a new state-of-the-art in narrative coherence,
HoloCine develops remarkable emergent abilities: a persistent memory for
characters and scenes, and an intuitive grasp of cinematic techniques. Our work
marks a pivotal shift from clip synthesis towards automated filmmaking, making
end-to-end cinematic creation a tangible future. Our code is available at:
