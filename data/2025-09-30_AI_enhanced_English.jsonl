They are deployed within an operational design domain (ODD) on\nspecific routes and environmental conditions, and are subject to continuous\nmonitoring to regain control in safety-critical situations. Since ODDs\ntypically cover urban areas, robotaxis must reliably detect vulnerable road\nusers (VRUs) such as pedestrians, bicyclists, or e-scooter riders. To better\nhandle such varied traffic situations, end-to-end AI, which directly compute\nvehicle control actions from multi-modal sensor data instead of only for\nperception, is on the rise. High quality data is needed for systematically\ntraining and evaluating such systems within their OOD. In this work, we propose\nPCICF, a framework to systematically identify and classify VRU situations to\nsupport ODD's incident analysis. We base our work on the existing synthetic\ndataset SMIRK, and enhance it by extending its single-pedestrian-only design\ninto the MoreSMIRK dataset, a structured dictionary of multi-pedestrian\ncrossing situations constructed systematically. We then use space-filling\ncurves (SFCs) to transform multi-dimensional features of scenarios into\ncharacteristic patterns, which we match with corresponding entries in\nMoreSMIRK. We evaluate PCICF with the large real-world dataset PIE, which\ncontains more than 150 manually annotated pedestrian crossing videos. We show\nthat PCICF can successfully identify and classify complex pedestrian crossings,\neven when groups of pedestrians merge or split. By leveraging computationally\nefficient components like SFCs, PCICF has even potential to be used onboard of\nrobotaxis for OOD detection for example.

To bridge this gap, this paper introduces DC-Gen, a\ngeneral framework that accelerates text-to-image diffusion models by leveraging\na deeply compressed latent space.

To overcome this, DC-Gen first bridges the representation gap with\na lightweight embedding alignment training. Once the latent embeddings are\naligned, only a small amount of LoRA fine-tuning is needed to unlock the base\nmodel's inherent generation quality.
