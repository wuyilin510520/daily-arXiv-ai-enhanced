### [1] [Facial Emotion Recognition does not detect feeling unsafe in automated driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04490)
*Abel van Elburg,Konstantinos Gkentsidis,Mathieu Sarrazin,Sarah Barendswaard,Varun Kotian,Riender Happee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Study examines perceived risk in automated vehicles using driving simulator experiment with different driving styles and pedestrian interactions, finding facial expression unreliable but neural network model effective for objective risk assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand factors affecting public acceptance of automated vehicles, particularly how trust and perceived safety influence risk perception during automated driving scenarios.

Method: Conducted driving simulator experiment with 32 participants using two automated driving styles (calm vs dynamic) and optional crossing pedestrian. Collected continuous subjective comfort ratings, physiological data (skin conductance, heart rate), motion data, eye tracking, and facial expression analysis.

Result: Dynamic driving style caused stronger discomfort; pedestrian crossing doubled comfort decrement with dynamic style. Facial expression analysis unreliable (only 9/24 showed reactions, mostly Happy not Fear). Neural network model using vehicle motion and skin conductance correlated well with reported perceived risk.

Conclusion: Facial expression recognition is unreliable for assessing perceived risk in automated vehicles, but neural network models using physiological and motion data show promise for objective risk assessment, reducing subjective bias in automated vehicle safety evaluation.

Abstract: Trust and perceived safety play a crucial role in the public acceptance of
automated vehicles. To understand perceived risk, an experiment was conducted
using a driving simulator under two automated driving styles and optionally
introducing a crossing pedestrian. Data was collected from 32 participants,
consisting of continuous subjective comfort ratings, motion, webcam footage for
facial expression, skin conductance, heart rate, and eye tracking. The
continuous subjective perceived risk ratings showed significant discomfort
associated with perceived risk during cornering and braking followed by relief
or even positive comfort on continuing the ride. The dynamic driving style
induced a stronger discomfort as compared to the calm driving style. The
crossing pedestrian did not affect discomfort with the calm driving style but
doubled the comfort decrement with the dynamic driving style. This illustrates
the importance of consequences of critical interactions in risk perception.
Facial expression was successfully analyzed for 24 participants but most
(15/24) did not show any detectable facial reaction to the critical event.
Among the 9 participants who did, 8 showed a Happy expression, and only 4
showed a Surprise expression. Fear was never dominant. This indicates that
facial expression recognition is not a reliable method for assessing perceived
risk in automated vehicles. To predict perceived risk a neural network model
was implemented using vehicle motion and skin conductance. The model correlated
well with reported perceived risk, demonstrating its potential for objective
perceived risk assessment in automated vehicles, reducing subjective bias and
highlighting areas for future research.

### [2] [PromptEnhancer: A Simple Approach to Enhance Text-to-Image Models via Chain-of-Thought Prompt Rewriting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04545)
*Linqing Wang,Ximing Xing,Yiji Cheng,Zhiyuan Zhao,Jiale Tao,Qixun Wang,Ruihuang Li,Xin Li,Mingrui Wu,Xinchi Deng,Chunyu Wang,Qinglin Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PromptEnhancer is a universal prompt rewriting framework that improves text-to-image generation by enhancing prompts through reinforcement learning with a specialized reward model, without modifying the underlying T2I model weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T2I diffusion models often fail to faithfully render complex user prompts, leading to mismatches between user intent and generated output, particularly in attribute binding, negation, and compositional relationships.

Method: A Chain-of-Thought rewriter trained through reinforcement learning guided by AlignEvaluator - a dedicated reward model trained on 24 key points derived from common T2I failure modes. The framework decouples the rewriter from the generator without modifying model weights.

Result: Extensive experiments on HunyuanImage 2.1 model show significant improvements in image-text alignment across various semantic and compositional challenges. The framework also introduces a new high-quality human preference benchmark.

Conclusion: PromptEnhancer effectively addresses T2I model limitations by providing a universal prompt enhancement solution that improves faithfulness to user prompts without requiring model-specific modifications, advancing the field of text-to-image generation alignment.

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in generating high-fidelity images. However, these
models often struggle to faithfully render complex user prompts, particularly
in aspects like attribute binding, negation, and compositional relationships.
This leads to a significant mismatch between user intent and the generated
output. To address this challenge, we introduce PromptEnhancer, a novel and
universal prompt rewriting framework that enhances any pretrained T2I model
without requiring modifications to its weights. Unlike prior methods that rely
on model-specific fine-tuning or implicit reward signals like image-reward
scores, our framework decouples the rewriter from the generator. We achieve
this by training a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rewriter through reinforcement
learning, guided by a dedicated reward model we term the AlignEvaluator. The
AlignEvaluator is trained to provide explicit and fine-grained feedback based
on a systematic taxonomy of 24 key points, which are derived from a
comprehensive analysis of common T2I failure modes. By optimizing the CoT
rewriter to maximize the reward from our AlignEvaluator, our framework learns
to generate prompts that are more precisely interpreted by T2I models.
Extensive experiments on the HunyuanImage 2.1 model demonstrate that
PromptEnhancer significantly improves image-text alignment across a wide range
of semantic and compositional challenges. Furthermore, we introduce a new,
high-quality human preference benchmark to facilitate future research in this
direction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext is a 2B-parameter DiT model that achieves SOTA image generation/editing with efficient training strategies, outperforming larger models like BAGEL (7B) and Flux-Kontext (12B).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many open-source multimodal models prioritize parameter scaling over training optimization, limiting efficiency and performance. The authors aim to develop a more efficient approach with better training strategies.

Method: Architectural modifications to SD3.5-Medium, large-scale pre-training on high-quality data, and a novel Progressive Dual-Task Reinforcement (PDTR) strategy that strengthens text-to-image generation and editing capabilities in a staged manner without negative interference.

Result: UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext demonstrates stronger image generation and editing than larger models. When extended to UniPic2-Metaquery (integrated with Qwen2.5-VL-7B), it achieves top-tier performance across diverse multimodal tasks with a simple scalable training paradigm.

Conclusion: The proposed training paradigm (Skywork UniPic 2.0) is effective and generalizable, enabling state-of-the-art performance with efficient parameter usage and optimized training strategies rather than simply scaling model size.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal models have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in unified image generation and editing. However, many prominent
open-source models prioritize scaling model parameters over optimizing training
strategies, limiting their efficiency and performance. In this work, we present
UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext, a 2B-parameter DiT model based on SD3.5-Medium, which
achieves state-of-the-art image generation and editing while extending
seamlessly into a unified multimodal framework. Our approach begins with
architectural modifications to SD3.5-Medium and large-scale pre-training on
high-quality data, enabling joint text-to-image generation and editing
capabilities. To enhance instruction following and editing consistency, we
propose a novel Progressive Dual-Task Reinforcement strategy (PDTR), which
effectively strengthens both tasks in a staged manner. We empirically validate
that the reinforcement phases for different tasks are mutually beneficial and
do not induce negative interference. After pre-training and reinforcement
strategies, UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext demonstrates stronger image generation and
editing capabilities than models with significantly larger generation
parameters-including BAGEL (7B) and Flux-Kontext (12B). Furthermore, following
the MetaQuery, we connect the UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext and Qwen2.5-VL-7B via a
connector and perform joint training to launch a unified multimodal model
UniPic2-Metaquery. UniPic2-Metaquery integrates understanding, generation, and
editing, achieving top-tier performance across diverse tasks with a simple and
scalable training paradigm. This consistently validates the effectiveness and
generalizability of our proposed training paradigm, which we formalize as
Skywork UniPic 2.0.

### [4] [Inpaint4Drag: Repurposing Inpainting Models for Drag-Based Image Editing via Bidirectional Warping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04582)
*Jingyi Lu,Kai Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Inpaint4Drag is a real-time drag-based image editing framework that uses pixel-space bidirectional warping and inpainting instead of latent space manipulation, achieving 0.01s warping previews and 0.3s inpainting at 512x512 resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing drag-based editing methods rely on latent space manipulation of generative models, which leads to limited precision, delayed feedback, and model-specific constraints that hinder user experience.

Method: The framework decomposes drag editing into pixel-space bidirectional warping (treating image regions as deformable materials) and image inpainting, transforming drag inputs into standard inpainting formats without requiring model architecture changes.

Result: Achieves real-time performance with 0.01s warping previews and 0.3s inpainting at 512x512 resolution, significantly faster than existing methods that take minutes per edit, while maintaining superior visual quality and precise control.

Conclusion: Inpaint4Drag serves as a universal adapter for any inpainting model, automatically benefiting from future inpainting improvements, and provides a more intuitive and efficient drag-based editing experience compared to latent space approaches.

Abstract: Drag-based image editing has emerged as a powerful paradigm for intuitive
image manipulation. However, existing approaches predominantly rely on
manipulating the latent space of generative models, leading to limited
precision, delayed feedback, and model-specific constraints. Accordingly, we
present Inpaint4Drag, a novel framework that decomposes drag-based editing into
pixel-space bidirectional warping and image inpainting. Inspired by elastic
object deformation in the physical world, we treat image regions as deformable
materials that maintain natural shape under user manipulation. Our method
achieves real-time warping previews (0.01s) and efficient inpainting (0.3s) at
512x512 resolution, significantly improving the interaction experience compared
to existing methods that require minutes per edit. By transforming drag inputs
directly into standard inpainting formats, our approach serves as a universal
adapter for any inpainting model without architecture modification,
automatically inheriting all future improvements in inpainting technology.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior visual
quality and precise control while maintaining real-time performance. Project

### [5] [DisPatch: Disarming Adversarial Patches in Object Detection with Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04597)
*Jin Ma,Mohammed Aldeen,Christopher Salas,Feng Luo,Mashrur Chowdhury,Mert Pesé,Long Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DISPATCH is a diffusion-based defense framework that regenerates entire images to neutralize adversarial patch attacks on object detectors, achieving state-of-the-art performance without requiring prior knowledge of attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object detectors are vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks that can conceal or create objects, leading to severe real-world consequences. Existing defenses lack generalizability against diverse and unknown attack types.

Method: Uses a 'regenerate and rectify' strategy with diffusion models to regenerate entire images to align with benign data, then identifies and replaces adversarial regions with their regenerated benign counterparts.

Result: Achieves 89.3% mAP.5 on hiding attacks, reduces attack success rate to 24.8% on untargeted creating attacks, and maintains strong robustness against adaptive attacks across multiple detectors.

Conclusion: DISPATCH provides an effective, attack-agnostic defense framework that outperforms state-of-the-art methods and offers practical protection for real-world object detection systems.

Abstract: Object detection is fundamental to various real-world applications, such as
security monitoring and surveillance video analysis. Despite their
advancements, state-of-theart object detectors are still vulnerable to
adversarial patch attacks, which can be easily applied to real-world objects to
either conceal actual items or create non-existent ones, leading to severe
consequences. Given the current diversity of adversarial patch attacks and
potential unknown threats, an ideal defense method should be effective,
generalizable, and robust against adaptive attacks. In this work, we introduce
DISPATCH, the first diffusion-based defense framework for object detection.
Unlike previous works that aim to "detect and remove" adversarial patches,
DISPATCH adopts a "regenerate and rectify" strategy, leveraging generative
models to disarm attack effects while preserving the integrity of the input
image. Specifically, we utilize the in-distribution generative power of
diffusion models to regenerate the entire image, aligning it with benign data.
A rectification process is then employed to identify and replace adversarial
regions with their regenerated benign counterparts. DISPATCH is attack-agnostic
and requires no prior knowledge of the existing patches. Extensive experiments
across multiple detectors and attacks demonstrate that DISPATCH consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art defenses on both hiding attacks and creating
attacks, achieving the best overall mAP.5 score of 89.3% on hiding attacks, and
lowering the attack success rate to 24.8% on untargeted creating attacks.
Moreover, it maintains strong robustness against adaptive attacks, making it a
practical and reliable defense for object detection systems.

### [6] [WATCH: World-aware Allied Trajectory and pose reconstruction for Camera and Human](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04600)
*Qijun Ying,Zhongyuan Hu,Rui Zhang,Ronghui Li,Yu Lu,Zijiao Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WATCH is a unified framework for global human motion reconstruction from monocular videos that addresses camera orientation and translation integration challenges through analytical heading angle decomposition and world model-inspired trajectory integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Global human motion reconstruction from monocular videos is challenging due to depth ambiguity, motion ambiguity, and entanglement between camera and human movements. Existing human-motion-centric approaches insufficiently exploit camera orientation information and ineffectively integrate camera translation cues.

Method: WATCH introduces an analytical heading angle decomposition technique for efficient camera orientation handling and a camera trajectory integration mechanism inspired by world models to effectively leverage camera translation information beyond naive approaches.

Result: Experiments on in-the-wild benchmarks show WATCH achieves state-of-the-art performance in end-to-end trajectory reconstruction, demonstrating effectiveness in jointly modeling camera-human motion relationships.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses the long-standing challenge of camera translation integration in global human motion reconstruction and provides new insights for this problem domain.

Abstract: Global human motion reconstruction from in-the-wild monocular videos is
increasingly demanded across VR, graphics, and robotics applications, yet
requires accurate mapping of human poses from camera to world coordinates-a
task challenged by depth ambiguity, motion ambiguity, and the entanglement
between camera and human movements. While human-motion-centric approaches excel
in preserving motion details and physical plausibility, they suffer from two
critical limitations: insufficient exploitation of camera orientation
information and ineffective integration of camera translation cues. We present
WATCH (World-aware Allied Trajectory and pose reconstruction for Camera and
Human), a unified framework addressing both challenges. Our approach introduces
an analytical heading angle decomposition technique that offers superior
efficiency and extensibility compared to existing geometric methods.
Additionally, we design a camera trajectory integration mechanism inspired by
world models, providing an effective pathway for leveraging camera translation
information beyond naive hard-decoding approaches. Through experiments on
in-the-wild benchmarks, WATCH achieves state-of-the-art performance in
end-to-end trajectory reconstruction. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness
of jointly modeling camera-human motion relationships and offers new insights
for addressing the long-standing challenge of camera translation integration in
global human motion reconstruction. The code will be available publicly.

*MinJu Jeon,Si-Woo Kim,Ye-Chan Kim,HyunGee Kim,Dong-Jin Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sali4Vid is a saliency-aware framework that improves dense video captioning by converting timestamp annotations into frame importance weights and using semantic-based adaptive caption retrieval to handle scene transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current end-to-end models for dense video captioning have two limitations: they apply timestamp supervision only to text while treating all video frames equally, and they retrieve captions from fixed-size video chunks, overlooking scene transitions.

Method: Proposes two key components: Saliency-aware Video Reweighting (converts timestamp annotations into sigmoid-based frame importance weights) and Semantic-based Adaptive Caption Retrieval (segments videos by frame similarity to capture scene transitions and improve caption retrieval).

Result: Sali4Vid achieves state-of-the-art results on YouCook2 and ViTT datasets.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the benefit of jointly improving video weighting and retrieval for dense video captioning, showing that saliency-aware approaches can significantly enhance performance.

Abstract: Dense video captioning aims to temporally localize events in video and
generate captions for each event. While recent works propose end-to-end models,
they suffer from two limitations: (1) applying timestamp supervision only to
text while treating all video frames equally, and (2) retrieving captions from
fixed-size video chunks, overlooking scene transitions. To address these, we
propose Sali4Vid, a simple yet effective saliency-aware framework. We introduce
Saliency-aware Video Reweighting, which converts timestamp annotations into
sigmoid-based frame importance weights, and Semantic-based Adaptive Caption
Retrieval, which segments videos by frame similarity to capture scene
transitions and improve caption retrieval. Sali4Vid achieves state-of-the-art
results on YouCook2 and ViTT, demonstrating the benefit of jointly improving
video weighting and retrieval for dense video captioning

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UAV-based traffic surveillance system using multi-scale template matching, Kalman filtering, and homography calibration for real-time vehicle detection, tracking, classification, and traffic violation analysis in urban environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional traffic monitoring systems have limited coverage, low adaptability, and poor scalability. There's a need for more comprehensive and flexible solutions for urban mobility and road safety challenges.

Method: Leverages multi-scale and multi-angle template matching, Kalman filtering, and homography-based calibration to process aerial video data from UAVs at 200m altitudes. Uses geofencing, motion filtering, and trajectory deviation analysis for violation detection.

Result: Achieved 91.8% detection precision, 90.5% F1-score, and tracking metrics of 92.1% MOTA and 93.7% MOTP. Successfully classified 5 vehicle types and detected traffic violations like unsafe lane changes, illegal parking, and crosswalk obstructions.

Conclusion: The system demonstrates scalability, accuracy, and practical relevance as an infrastructure-independent traffic monitoring solution for smart cities, supporting comprehensive urban mobility analytics and enforcement capabilities.

Abstract: Traffic congestion and violations pose significant challenges for urban
mobility and road safety. Traditional traffic monitoring systems, such as fixed
cameras and sensor-based methods, are often constrained by limited coverage,
low adaptability, and poor scalability. To address these challenges, this paper
introduces an advanced unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based traffic surveillance
system capable of accurate vehicle detection, classification, tracking, and
behavioral analysis in real-world, unconstrained urban environments. The system
leverages multi-scale and multi-angle template matching, Kalman filtering, and
homography-based calibration to process aerial video data collected from
altitudes of approximately 200 meters. A case study in urban area demonstrates
robust performance, achieving a detection precision of 91.8%, an F1-score of
90.5%, and tracking metrics (MOTA/MOTP) of 92.1% and 93.7%, respectively.
Beyond precise detection, the system classifies five vehicle types and
automatically detects critical traffic violations, including unsafe lane
changes, illegal double parking, and crosswalk obstructions, through the fusion
of geofencing, motion filtering, and trajectory deviation analysis. The
integrated analytics module supports origin-destination tracking, vehicle count
visualization, inter-class correlation analysis, and heatmap-based congestion
modeling. Additionally, the system enables entry-exit trajectory profiling,
vehicle density estimation across road segments, and movement direction
logging, supporting comprehensive multi-scale urban mobility analytics.
Experimental results confirms the system's scalability, accuracy, and practical
relevance, highlighting its potential as an enforcement-aware,
infrastructure-independent traffic monitoring solution for next-generation
smart cities.

### [9] [VCMamba: Bridging Convolutions with Multi-Directional Mamba for Efficient Visual Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04669)
*Mustafa Munir,Alex Zhang,Radu Marculescu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VCMamba is a hybrid vision backbone that combines CNNs' local feature extraction with multi-directional Mamba SSMs' global context modeling, achieving state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between CNNs (strong local features but limited global reasoning) and modern architectures like ViTs and SSMs (global context but weak local features), creating a model that leverages the strengths of both approaches.

Method: Uses a convolutional stem and hierarchical structure with convolutional blocks in early stages for local feature extraction, followed by multi-directional Mamba blocks in later stages for efficient long-range dependency modeling with linear complexity.

Result: VCMamba-B achieves 82.6% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K (surpassing PlainMamba-L3 by 0.3% with 37% fewer parameters) and 47.1 mIoU on ADE20K (exceeding EfficientFormer-L7 by 2.0 mIoU with 62% fewer parameters).

Conclusion: The hybrid CNN-Mamba architecture successfully combines the complementary strengths of convolutional networks for local features and state space models for global context, achieving superior performance with parameter efficiency across image classification and segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision Transformers (ViTs) and State Space Models (SSMs)
have challenged the dominance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in
computer vision. ViTs excel at capturing global context, and SSMs like Mamba
offer linear complexity for long sequences, yet they do not capture
fine-grained local features as effectively as CNNs. Conversely, CNNs possess
strong inductive biases for local features but lack the global reasoning
capabilities of transformers and Mamba. To bridge this gap, we introduce
\textit{VCMamba}, a novel vision backbone that integrates the strengths of CNNs
and multi-directional Mamba SSMs. VCMamba employs a convolutional stem and a
hierarchical structure with convolutional blocks in its early stages to extract
rich local features. These convolutional blocks are then processed by later
stages incorporating multi-directional Mamba blocks designed to efficiently
model long-range dependencies and global context. This hybrid design allows for
superior feature representation while maintaining linear complexity with
respect to image resolution. We demonstrate VCMamba's effectiveness through
extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K classification and ADE20K semantic
segmentation. Our VCMamba-B achieves 82.6% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K,
surpassing PlainMamba-L3 by 0.3% with 37% fewer parameters, and outperforming
Vision GNN-B by 0.3% with 64% fewer parameters. Furthermore, VCMamba-B obtains
47.1 mIoU on ADE20K, exceeding EfficientFormer-L7 by 2.0 mIoU while utilizing
62% fewer parameters. Code is available at

### [10] [Guideline-Consistent Segmentation via Multi-Agent Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04687)
*Vanshika Vats,Ashwani Rathee,James Davis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-agent framework that uses vision-language models to ensure semantic segmentation follows complex textual guidelines without retraining, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world semantic segmentation requires strict adherence to complex, paragraph-length labeling guidelines that both humans and automated systems often fail to follow, and traditional approaches require expensive task-specific retraining when guidelines evolve.

Method: Multi-agent training-free framework with Worker-Supervisor iterative refinement architecture: Worker performs segmentation, Supervisor critiques against retrieved guidelines, and lightweight reinforcement learning stop policy terminates the loop to balance accuracy and resource use.

Result: Notably outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on Waymo and ReasonSeg datasets, demonstrating strong generalization and instruction adherence.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses the challenge of following complex segmentation guidelines without requiring retraining, providing guideline-consistent masks while efficiently managing computational resources.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation in real-world applications often requires not only
accurate masks but also strict adherence to textual labeling guidelines. These
guidelines are typically complex and long, and both human and automated
labeling often fail to follow them faithfully. Traditional approaches depend on
expensive task-specific retraining that must be repeated as the guidelines
evolve. Although recent open-vocabulary segmentation methods excel with simple
prompts, they often fail when confronted with sets of paragraph-length
guidelines that specify intricate segmentation rules. To address this, we
introduce a multi-agent, training-free framework that coordinates
general-purpose vision-language models within an iterative Worker-Supervisor
refinement architecture. The Worker performs the segmentation, the Supervisor
critiques it against the retrieved guidelines, and a lightweight reinforcement
learning stop policy decides when to terminate the loop, ensuring
guideline-consistent masks while balancing resource use. Evaluated on the Waymo
and ReasonSeg datasets, our method notably outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, demonstrating strong generalization and instruction adherence.

*Satoshi Tanaka,Kok Seang Tan,Isamu Yamashita*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses domain adaptation for 3D object detection across different LiDAR sensor configurations, proposing two techniques: Downstream Fine-tuning and Partial Layer Fine-tuning to improve cross-configuration generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Different vehicle platforms use distinct sensor configurations, causing performance degradation when models trained on one configuration are applied to another due to point cloud distribution shifts. This domain gap for different sensor configurations remains largely unexplored compared to environmental domain gaps.

Method: Proposed two techniques: 1) Downstream Fine-tuning (dataset-specific fine-tuning after multi-dataset training) and 2) Partial Layer Fine-tuning (updating only a subset of layers to improve cross-configuration generalization). Used paired datasets from same geographic region with multiple sensor configurations.

Result: Joint training with Downstream Fine-tuning and Partial Layer Fine-tuning consistently outperforms naive joint training for each configuration.

Conclusion: Provides a practical and scalable solution for adapting 3D object detection models to diverse vehicle platforms with different sensor configurations.

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous driving have underscored the importance of
accurate 3D object detection, with LiDAR playing a central role due to its
robustness under diverse visibility conditions. However, different vehicle
platforms often deploy distinct sensor configurations, causing performance
degradation when models trained on one configuration are applied to another
because of shifts in the point cloud distribution. Prior work on multi-dataset
training and domain adaptation for 3D object detection has largely addressed
environmental domain gaps and density variation within a single LiDAR; in
contrast, the domain gap for different sensor configurations remains largely
unexplored. In this work, we address domain adaptation across different sensor
configurations in 3D object detection. We propose two techniques: Downstream
Fine-tuning (dataset-specific fine-tuning after multi-dataset training) and
Partial Layer Fine-tuning (updating only a subset of layers to improve
cross-configuration generalization). Using paired datasets collected in the
same geographic region with multiple sensor configurations, we show that joint
training with Downstream Fine-tuning and Partial Layer Fine-tuning consistently
outperforms naive joint training for each configuration. Our findings provide a
practical and scalable solution for adapting 3D object detection models to the
diverse vehicle platforms.

*Tianxiang Xue,Jiayi Zhao,Jingsheng Li,Changlu Chen,Kun Zhan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CD-Mamba is a hybrid cloud detection model that combines CNN's local spatial processing with Mamba's long-range dependency modeling to effectively detect clouds in remote sensing images obscured by cloud cover.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Remote sensing images are frequently obscured by cloud cover, which compromises data integrity and reliability. Effective cloud detection requires addressing both short-range spatial redundancies and long-range atmospheric similarities among cloud patches.

Method: Propose CD-Mamba, a hybrid model that integrates convolutional neural networks (for local spatial dependencies) and Mamba's state-space modeling (for long-range dependencies) into a unified cloud detection network to capture both pixelwise textural details and long-term patchwise dependencies.

Result: Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of CD-Mamba and demonstrate its superior performance over existing methods in cloud detection accuracy across diverse spatial scales.

Conclusion: The integration of convolution and Mamba's state-space modeling in CD-Mamba enables comprehensive cloud detection by simultaneously managing pixel-wise interactions and extensive patch-wise dependencies, making it an effective solution for remote sensing image analysis.

Abstract: Remote sensing images are frequently obscured by cloud cover, posing
significant challenges to data integrity and reliability. Effective cloud
detection requires addressing both short-range spatial redundancies and
long-range atmospheric similarities among cloud patches. Convolutional neural
networks are effective at capturing local spatial dependencies, while Mamba has
strong capabilities in modeling long-range dependencies. To fully leverage both
local spatial relations and long-range dependencies, we propose CD-Mamba, a
hybrid model that integrates convolution and Mamba's state-space modeling into
a unified cloud detection network. CD-Mamba is designed to comprehensively
capture pixelwise textural details and long term patchwise dependencies for
cloud detection. This design enables CD-Mamba to manage both pixel-wise
interactions and extensive patch-wise dependencies simultaneously, improving
detection accuracy across diverse spatial scales. Extensive experiments
validate the effectiveness of CD-Mamba and demonstrate its superior performance
over existing methods.

### [13] [Exploiting Unlabeled Structures through Task Consistency Training for Versatile Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04732)
*Shengqian Zhu,Jiafei Wu,Xiaogang Xu,Chengrong Yu,Ying Song,Zhang Yi,Guangjun Li,Junjie Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TCT framework addresses class imbalance in medical image segmentation using partially labeled datasets through task consistency training and uncertainty-weighted loss, without requiring extra models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VMIS approaches suffer from class imbalance due to unequal category distribution in partially labeled datasets, and existing pseudo-label methods require additional models and suffer from label noise degradation.

Method: Task Consistency Training (TCT) framework with main segmentation head for multi-channel predictions and multiple auxiliary task heads with consistency constraints, plus filtering strategy for low-consistency data and unified auxiliary uncertainty-weighted loss.

Result: Extensive experiments on eight abdominal datasets from diverse clinical sites demonstrate the approach's effectiveness in addressing class imbalance.

Conclusion: The proposed TCT framework successfully addresses class imbalance in versatile medical image segmentation without requiring additional models, effectively utilizing unlabeled anatomical structures while mitigating noise and task dominance issues.

Abstract: Versatile medical image segmentation (VMIS) targets the segmentation of
multiple classes, while obtaining full annotations for all classes is often
impractical due to the time and labor required. Leveraging partially labeled
datasets (PLDs) presents a promising alternative; however, current VMIS
approaches face significant class imbalance due to the unequal category
distribution in PLDs. Existing methods attempt to address this by generating
pseudo-full labels. Nevertheless, these typically require additional models and
often result in potential performance degradation from label noise. In this
work, we introduce a Task Consistency Training (TCT) framework to address class
imbalance without requiring extra models. TCT includes a backbone network with
a main segmentation head (MSH) for multi-channel predictions and multiple
auxiliary task heads (ATHs) for task-specific predictions. By enforcing a
consistency constraint between the MSH and ATH predictions, TCT effectively
utilizes unlabeled anatomical structures. To avoid error propagation from
low-consistency, potentially noisy data, we propose a filtering strategy to
exclude such data. Additionally, we introduce a unified auxiliary
uncertainty-weighted loss (UAUWL) to mitigate segmentation quality declines
caused by the dominance of specific tasks. Extensive experiments on eight
abdominal datasets from diverse clinical sites demonstrate our approach's
effectiveness.

*Dharsan Ravindran,Kevin Wang,Zhuoyuan Cao,Saleh Abdelrahman,Jeffery Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAM and SAM2 struggle with adverse weather segmentation due to lack of uncertainty quantification. Two uncertainty-aware methods (UAT-SAM and SAM2 with uncertainty loss) show improved performance in extreme weather driving scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision foundation models like SAM/SAM2 perform poorly in adverse weather conditions with high visual ambiguity, lacking uncertainty quantification needed for safety-critical autonomous driving applications.

Method: 1) Multi-step finetuning of SAM2 with uncertainty metrics incorporated into loss function; 2) Adaptation of Uncertainty-Aware Adapter (UAT) from medical imaging to driving contexts.

Result: UAT-SAM outperforms standard SAM in extreme weather, while SAM2 with uncertainty-aware loss achieves improved performance across diverse driving scenes on CamVid, BDD100K, and GTA datasets.

Conclusion: Explicit uncertainty modeling is valuable for enhancing segmentation robustness in safety-critical autonomous driving applications, particularly in challenging weather conditions.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision foundation models, such as the Segment Anything
Model (SAM) and its successor SAM2, have achieved state-of-the-art performance
on general image segmentation benchmarks. However, these models struggle in
adverse weather conditions where visual ambiguity is high, largely due to their
lack of uncertainty quantification. Inspired by progress in medical imaging,
where uncertainty-aware training has improved reliability in ambiguous cases,
we investigate two approaches to enhance segmentation robustness for autonomous
driving. First, we introduce a multi-step finetuning procedure for SAM2 that
incorporates uncertainty metrics directly into the loss function, improving
overall scene recognition. Second, we adapt the Uncertainty-Aware Adapter
(UAT), originally designed for medical image segmentation, to driving contexts.
We evaluate both methods on CamVid, BDD100K, and GTA driving datasets.
Experiments show that UAT-SAM outperforms standard SAM in extreme weather,
while SAM2 with uncertainty-aware loss achieves improved performance across
diverse driving scenes. These findings underscore the value of explicit
uncertainty modeling for safety-critical autonomous driving in challenging
environments.

Result: Achieves 5x faster processing while maintaining >90% accuracy across 25+ activity classes, with 9.3ms event detection and 11.8ms classification times, outperforming state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: WatchHAR enables smartwatches to function as standalone, privacy-aware continuous activity tracking devices with minimal latency and high accuracy.

Abstract: Despite advances in practical and multimodal fine-grained Human Activity
Recognition (HAR), a system that runs entirely on smartwatches in unconstrained
environments remains elusive. We present WatchHAR, an audio and inertial-based
HAR system that operates fully on smartwatches, addressing privacy and latency
issues associated with external data processing. By optimizing each component
of the pipeline, WatchHAR achieves compounding performance gains. We introduce
a novel architecture that unifies sensor data preprocessing and inference into
an end-to-end trainable module, achieving 5x faster processing while
maintaining over 90% accuracy across more than 25 activity classes. WatchHAR
outperforms state-of-the-art models for event detection and activity
classification while running directly on the smartwatch, achieving 9.3 ms
processing time for activity event detection and 11.8 ms for multimodal
activity classification. This research advances on-device activity recognition,
realizing smartwatches' potential as standalone, privacy-aware, and
minimally-invasive continuous activity tracking devices.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MCANet is a multi-label classification framework that uses multi-scale feature learning and class-specific attention to improve hurricane damage assessment from UAV images, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the RescueNet dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CNN-based methods struggle with capturing multi-scale spatial features and distinguishing visually similar damage types in post-hurricane damage assessment, which is critical for disaster response and recovery.

Method: Proposes MCANet with Res2Net-based hierarchical backbone for multi-scale context and multi-head class-specific residual attention module that focuses on different spatial granularities to balance local details with global context.

Result: Achieves 91.75% mAP on RescueNet dataset (4,494 UAV images), outperforming ResNet, Res2Net, VGG, MobileNet, EfficientNet, and ViT. With 8 attention heads, performance improves to 92.35% with over 6% boost for challenging classes like Road Blocked.

Conclusion: MCANet effectively localizes damage-relevant regions and provides interpretable results that can inform disaster response. Future work could integrate knowledge graphs and multimodal LLMs for improved adaptability and semantic understanding.

Abstract: Rapid and accurate post-hurricane damage assessment is vital for disaster
response and recovery. Yet existing CNN-based methods struggle to capture
multi-scale spatial features and to distinguish visually similar or
co-occurring damage types. To address these issues, we propose MCANet, a
multi-label classification framework that learns multi-scale representations
and adaptively attends to spatially relevant regions for each damage category.
MCANet employs a Res2Net-based hierarchical backbone to enrich spatial context
across scales and a multi-head class-specific residual attention module to
enhance discrimination. Each attention branch focuses on different spatial
granularities, balancing local detail with global context. We evaluate MCANet
on the RescueNet dataset of 4,494 UAV images collected after Hurricane Michael.
MCANet achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 91.75%, outperforming ResNet,
Res2Net, VGG, MobileNet, EfficientNet, and ViT. With eight attention heads,
performance further improves to 92.35%, boosting average precision for
challenging classes such as Road Blocked by over 6%. Class activation mapping
confirms MCANet's ability to localize damage-relevant regions, supporting
interpretability. Outputs from MCANet can inform post-disaster risk mapping,
emergency routing, and digital twin-based disaster response. Future work could
integrate disaster-specific knowledge graphs and multimodal large language
models to improve adaptability to unseen disasters and enrich semantic
understanding for real-world decision-making.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes dynamic human group detection in videos using Vision-Language Model features and global optimization across frames to handle changing groups, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting complex human groups requires both local appearance features and global scene context, and groups can dynamically change over time in videos, which previous methods don't handle well.

Method: Uses Vision-Language Model (VLM) augmented for group detection to extract local and global features, then performs global optimization using a graph with all frames' groupness probabilities from groupness-augmented CLIP features.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art group detection methods on public datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively detects dynamically changing human groups in videos by combining VLM features with global temporal optimization.

Abstract: This paper proposes dynamic human group detection in videos. For detecting
complex groups, not only the local appearance features of in-group members but
also the global context of the scene are important. Such local and global
appearance features in each frame are extracted using a Vision-Language Model
(VLM) augmented for group detection in our method. For further improvement, the
group structure should be consistent over time. While previous methods are
stabilized on the assumption that groups are not changed in a video, our method
detects dynamically changing groups by global optimization using a graph with
all frames' groupness probabilities estimated by our groupness-augmented CLIP
features. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art group detection methods on public datasets. Code:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FloodVision is a zero-shot framework that combines GPT-4o's semantic reasoning with a domain knowledge graph to estimate floodwater depth from RGB images without task-specific training, achieving 8.17 cm MAE and 20.5% improvement over baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing computer vision methods for flood detection suffer from accuracy limitations and poor generalization due to dependence on fixed object detectors and task-specific training, making them unsuitable for diverse flood scenarios.

Method: Combines GPT-4o's semantic reasoning with a structured domain knowledge graph containing canonical dimensions of urban objects. Dynamically identifies reference objects, retrieves verified heights to prevent hallucination, estimates submergence ratios, and applies statistical outlier filtering.

Result: Achieves mean absolute error of 8.17 cm on 110 crowdsourced images from MyCoast New York, reducing GPT-4o baseline error by 20.5% and outperforming prior CNN-based methods. Generalizes well across varying scenes and operates in near real-time.

Conclusion: FloodVision provides accurate, generalizable flood depth estimation suitable for integration into digital twin platforms and citizen-reporting apps, enhancing smart city flood resilience through zero-shot learning approach.

Abstract: Timely and accurate floodwater depth estimation is critical for road
accessibility and emergency response. While recent computer vision methods have
enabled flood detection, they suffer from both accuracy limitations and poor
generalization due to dependence on fixed object detectors and task-specific
training. To enable accurate depth estimation that can generalize across
diverse flood scenarios, this paper presents FloodVision, a zero-shot framework
that combines the semantic reasoning abilities of the foundation
vision-language model GPT-4o with a structured domain knowledge graph. The
knowledge graph encodes canonical real-world dimensions for common urban
objects including vehicles, people, and infrastructure elements to ground the
model's reasoning in physical reality. FloodVision dynamically identifies
visible reference objects in RGB images, retrieves verified heights from the
knowledge graph to mitigate hallucination, estimates submergence ratios, and
applies statistical outlier filtering to compute final depth values. Evaluated
on 110 crowdsourced images from MyCoast New York, FloodVision achieves a mean
absolute error of 8.17 cm, reducing the GPT-4o baseline 10.28 cm by 20.5% and
surpassing prior CNN-based methods. The system generalizes well across varying
scenes and operates in near real-time, making it suitable for future
integration into digital twin platforms and citizen-reporting apps for smart
city flood resilience.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes PIG framework that combines advantages of Two-Tower and Single-Tower approaches for text-to-video retrieval, achieving both high effectiveness and efficiency through pseudo-query generation and fine-grained interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CLIP-based approaches for text-to-video retrieval face trade-offs: Two-Tower frameworks have low effectiveness while Single-Tower frameworks have low efficiency. There's a need for a solution that achieves both high effectiveness and efficiency simultaneously.

Method: Proposes Hybrid-Tower framework with PIG method that generates pseudo-queries for each video, enabling fine-grained interaction between video features and textual features before receiving real queries. Maintains efficiency by adding no extra storage or computational overhead during inference.

Result: Achieves significant improvement over baselines with 1.6%~3.9% increase in R@1 across five text-video retrieval benchmarks. Matches Two-Tower efficiency while achieving near state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The Hybrid-Tower framework successfully hybridizes advantages of both Two-Tower and Single-Tower approaches, demonstrating that high effectiveness and efficiency can be achieved simultaneously in text-to-video retrieval tasks.

Abstract: The Text-to-Video Retrieval (T2VR) task aims to retrieve unlabeled videos by
textual queries with the same semantic meanings. Recent CLIP-based approaches
have explored two frameworks: Two-Tower versus Single-Tower framework, yet the
former suffers from low effectiveness, while the latter suffers from low
efficiency. In this study, we explore a new Hybrid-Tower framework that can
hybridize the advantages of the Two-Tower and Single-Tower framework, achieving
high effectiveness and efficiency simultaneously. We propose a novel hybrid
method, Fine-grained Pseudo-query Interaction and Generation for T2VR, ie, PIG,
which includes a new pseudo-query generator designed to generate a pseudo-query
for each video. This enables the video feature and the textual features of
pseudo-query to interact in a fine-grained manner, similar to the Single-Tower
approaches to hold high effectiveness, even before the real textual query is
received. Simultaneously, our method introduces no additional storage or
computational overhead compared to the Two-Tower framework during the inference
stage, thus maintaining high efficiency. Extensive experiments on five commonly
used text-video retrieval benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves a
significant improvement over the baseline, with an increase of $1.6\% \sim
3.9\%$ in R@1. Furthermore, our method matches the efficiency of Two-Tower
models while achieving near state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the
advantages of the Hybrid-Tower framework.

Conclusion: The results highlight the importance of preprocessing and learning-based approaches for robust lunar image registration across diverse conditions, with deep learning methods like SuperGlue showing superior performance.

Abstract: Accurate image registration is critical for lunar exploration, enabling
surface mapping, resource localization, and mission planning. Aligning data
from diverse lunar sensors -- optical (e.g., Orbital High Resolution Camera,
Narrow and Wide Angle Cameras), hyperspectral (Imaging Infrared Spectrometer),

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional skin disease diagnosis is costly and unavailable in low-resource settings, while existing automated methods are limited to dermoscopic datasets and narrow disease ranges.

Method: Curated large mobile-acquired dataset of 50+ skin disease categories, evaluated multiple CNN and Transformer architectures (particularly Swin Transformer), and incorporated Grad-CAM for interpretability.

Result: Transformer models, especially Swin Transformer, achieved superior performance by effectively capturing global contextual features in mobile-acquired skin lesion images.

Conclusion: Transformer-based approaches show strong potential for accessible AI-assisted dermatological screening and early diagnosis in resource-limited environments through mobile devices.

Abstract: Skin diseases are among the most prevalent health concerns worldwide, yet
conventional diagnostic methods are often costly, complex, and unavailable in
low-resource settings. Automated classification using deep learning has emerged
as a promising alternative, but existing studies are mostly limited to
dermoscopic datasets and a narrow range of disease classes. In this work, we
curate a large dataset of over 50 skin disease categories captured with mobile
devices, making it more representative of real-world conditions. We evaluate
multiple convolutional neural networks and Transformer-based architectures,
demonstrating that Transformer models, particularly the Swin Transformer,
achieve superior performance by effectively capturing global contextual
features. To enhance interpretability, we incorporate Gradient-weighted Class
Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), which highlights clinically relevant regions and
provides transparency in model predictions. Our results underscore the
potential of Transformer-based approaches for mobile-acquired skin lesion
classification, paving the way toward accessible AI-assisted dermatological

TL;DR: Mixture of Experts (MoE) provides well-calibrated predictive uncertainty estimates for semantic segmentation without architectural changes, outperforming ensemble methods especially on out-of-distribution data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing reliability of computer vision models in safety-critical applications like traffic scene perception by improving uncertainty estimation accuracy and calibration.

Method: Used MoE with gating network to dynamically weight expert predictions, evaluated three uncertainty extraction methods (predictive entropy, mutual information, expert variance) on A2D2 dataset with semantic split, and analyzed routing uncertainty via gate entropy.

Result: MoEs yield more reliable uncertainty estimates than ensembles in conditional correctness metrics under OOD data. Simple gating mechanisms provide better calibration than complex classwise gates. Increasing number of experts further enhances uncertainty calibration.

Conclusion: MoEs offer an efficient and effective approach for well-calibrated uncertainty estimation in semantic segmentation, particularly valuable for safety-critical applications where reliable uncertainty quantification is crucial.

Abstract: Estimating accurate and well-calibrated predictive uncertainty is important
for enhancing the reliability of computer vision models, especially in
safety-critical applications like traffic scene perception. While ensemble
methods are commonly used to quantify uncertainty by combining multiple models,
a mixture of experts (MoE) offers an efficient alternative by leveraging a
gating network to dynamically weight expert predictions based on the input.
Building on the promising use of MoEs for semantic segmentation in our previous
works, we show that well-calibrated predictive uncertainty estimates can be
extracted from MoEs without architectural modifications. We investigate three
methods to extract predictive uncertainty estimates: predictive entropy, mutual
information, and expert variance. We evaluate these methods for an MoE with two
experts trained on a semantical split of the A2D2 dataset. Our results show
that MoEs yield more reliable uncertainty estimates than ensembles in terms of
conditional correctness metrics under out-of-distribution (OOD) data.
Additionally, we evaluate routing uncertainty computed via gate entropy and
find that simple gating mechanisms lead to better calibration of routing
uncertainty estimates than more complex classwise gates. Finally, our
experiments on the Cityscapes dataset suggest that increasing the number of
experts can further enhance uncertainty calibration. Our code is available at

TL;DR: Proposes LFMT, a hybrid Mamba-Transformer framework for light field image super-resolution that uses Subspace Simple Scanning strategy and dual-stage modeling to efficiently extract spatial-angular and epipolar features while maintaining low computational complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Mamba-based methods with multi-directional scanning strategies lead to inefficient and redundant feature extraction when applied to complex light field data, needing more efficient feature extraction and better preservation of spatial-angular and disparity information.

Method: Introduces Subspace Simple Scanning (Sub-SS) strategy and Subspace Simple Mamba Block (SSMB) for efficient feature extraction. Uses dual-stage modeling: Stage I with Spatial-Angular Residual Subspace Mamba Block (SA-RSMB) for shallow features, Stage II with dual-branch parallel structure combining Epipolar Plane Mamba Block (EPMB) and Epipolar Plane Transformer Block (EPTB) for deep epipolar feature refinement.

Result: LFMT significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in light field image super-resolution, achieving substantial performance improvements while maintaining low computational complexity on both real-world and synthetic LF datasets.

Conclusion: The hybrid Mamba-Transformer framework LFMT successfully integrates the strengths of both models for comprehensive information exploration across spatial, angular, and epipolar-plane domains, providing an efficient and high-performance solution for LFSR tasks.

Abstract: Recently, Mamba-based methods, with its advantage in long-range information
modeling and linear complexity, have shown great potential in optimizing both
computational cost and performance of light field image super-resolution
(LFSR). However, current multi-directional scanning strategies lead to
inefficient and redundant feature extraction when applied to complex LF data.
To overcome this challenge, we propose a Subspace Simple Scanning (Sub-SS)
strategy, based on which we design the Subspace Simple Mamba Block (SSMB) to
achieve more efficient and precise feature extraction. Furthermore, we propose
a dual-stage modeling strategy to address the limitation of state space in
preserving spatial-angular and disparity information, thereby enabling a more
comprehensive exploration of non-local spatial-angular correlations.
Specifically, in stage I, we introduce the Spatial-Angular Residual Subspace
Mamba Block (SA-RSMB) for shallow spatial-angular feature extraction; in stage
II, we use a dual-branch parallel structure combining the Epipolar Plane Mamba
Block (EPMB) and Epipolar Plane Transformer Block (EPTB) for deep epipolar
feature refinement. Building upon meticulously designed modules and strategies,
we introduce a hybrid Mamba-Transformer framework, termed LFMT. LFMT integrates
the strengths of Mamba and Transformer models for LFSR, enabling comprehensive
information exploration across spatial, angular, and epipolar-plane domains.
Experimental results demonstrate that LFMT significantly outperforms current
state-of-the-art methods in LFSR, achieving substantial improvements in
performance while maintaining low computational complexity on both real-word

TL;DR: PropVG is an end-to-end proposal-based visual grounding framework that integrates object proposal generation with referential comprehension, using contrastive learning and multi-granularity discrimination to improve object identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of current end-to-end methods that rely only on referred targets for supervision and lack multi-granularity discrimination, which is crucial for robust object identification in complex scenarios.

Method: Proposes PropVG framework with Contrastive-based Refer Scoring (CRS) module using sentence- and word-level contrastive learning, and Multi-granularity Target Discrimination (MTD) module fusing object- and semantic-level information.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks (gRefCOCO, Ref-ZOM, R-RefCOCO, RefCOCO) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: PropVG successfully integrates proposal generation with referential comprehension without additional detectors, achieving improved performance through contrastive learning and multi-granularity discrimination techniques.

Abstract: Recent advances in visual grounding have largely shifted away from
traditional proposal-based two-stage frameworks due to their inefficiency and
high computational complexity, favoring end-to-end direct reference paradigms.
However, these methods rely exclusively on the referred target for supervision,
overlooking the potential benefits of prominent prospective targets. Moreover,
existing approaches often fail to incorporate multi-granularity discrimination,
which is crucial for robust object identification in complex scenarios. To
address these limitations, we propose PropVG, an end-to-end proposal-based
framework that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to seamlessly
integrate foreground object proposal generation with referential object
comprehension without requiring additional detectors. Furthermore, we introduce
a Contrastive-based Refer Scoring (CRS) module, which employs contrastive
learning at both sentence and word levels to enhance the capability in
understanding and distinguishing referred objects. Additionally, we design a
Multi-granularity Target Discrimination (MTD) module that fuses object- and
semantic-level information to improve the recognition of absent targets.
Extensive experiments on gRefCOCO (GREC/GRES), Ref-ZOM, R-RefCOCO, and RefCOCO
(REC/RES) benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of PropVG. The codes and

Motivation: The large scale and high dimensionality of simulation-generated temporal flow field data from scramjet engines present significant challenges for visual interpretation, feature differentiation, and cross-case comparison in combustion analysis.

Method: Uses pretrained Vision Transformers to extract embeddings from flow field images, applies dimensionality reduction and density-based clustering to uncover combustion modes, constructs temporal trajectories, and employs vision-language models with expert annotations to generate natural-language summaries.

Result: The system enhances hypothesis generation, supports interpretable pattern discovery, and improves knowledge discovery in large-scale scramjet combustion analysis, as demonstrated through expert-informed case studies and feedback.

Conclusion: TemporalFlowViz effectively bridges the gap between latent AI representations and expert reasoning, providing a powerful workflow for analyzing complex temporal combustion dynamics through coordinated multi-view exploration and contextual understanding.

Abstract: Understanding the complex combustion dynamics within scramjet engines is
critical for advancing high-speed propulsion technologies. However, the large
scale and high dimensionality of simulation-generated temporal flow field data
present significant challenges for visual interpretation, feature
differentiation, and cross-case comparison. In this paper, we present
TemporalFlowViz, a parameter-aware visual analytics workflow and system
designed to support expert-driven clustering, visualization, and interpretation
of temporal flow fields from scramjet combustion simulations. Our approach
leverages hundreds of simulated combustion cases with varying initial
conditions, each producing time-sequenced flow field images. We use pretrained
Vision Transformers to extract high-dimensional embeddings from these frames,
apply dimensionality reduction and density-based clustering to uncover latent
combustion modes, and construct temporal trajectories in the embedding space to
track the evolution of each simulation over time. To bridge the gap between
latent representations and expert reasoning, domain specialists annotate
representative cluster centroids with descriptive labels. These annotations are
used as contextual prompts for a vision-language model, which generates
natural-language summaries for individual frames and full simulation cases. The
system also supports parameter-based filtering, similarity-based case
retrieval, and coordinated multi-view exploration to facilitate in-depth
analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TemporalFlowViz through two
expert-informed case studies and expert feedback, showing TemporalFlowViz
enhances hypothesis generation, supports interpretable pattern discovery, and
enhances knowledge discovery in large-scale scramjet combustion analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniFHT is a pose-free 3D refractive index reconstruction framework that enables high-throughput flow cytometry tomographic imaging of irregularly shaped cells with complex rotations, overcoming limitations of traditional methods that require known poses and uniform rotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D quantitative phase imaging methods in flow cytometry assume uniform single-axis rotation and require known cell poses, which restricts applicability to near-spherical cells and prevents accurate imaging of irregularly shaped cells with complex rotations, limiting statistical analysis capabilities.

Method: Leverages Fourier diffraction theorem and implicit neural representations (INRs) to jointly optimize each cell's unknown rotational trajectory and volumetric structure under weak scattering assumptions, supporting arbitrary geometries and multi-axis rotations with continuous representation for sparse sampling.

Result: Produces high-fidelity 3D refractive index reconstructions with as few as 10 views or only 120 degrees of angular range, enabling accurate imaging of entire flowing cell populations regardless of shape or rotation complexity.

Conclusion: OmniFHT provides the first scalable and unbiased solution for in situ, high-throughput tomographic imaging of entire cell populations in flow cytometry, enabling comprehensive label-free morphometric analysis without pose constraints.

Abstract: High-throughput 3D quantitative phase imaging (QPI) in flow cytometry enables
label-free, volumetric characterization of individual cells by reconstructing
their refractive index (RI) distributions from multiple viewing angles during
flow through microfluidic channels. However, current imaging methods assume
that cells undergo uniform, single-axis rotation, which require their poses to
be known at each frame. This assumption restricts applicability to
near-spherical cells and prevents accurate imaging of irregularly shaped cells
with complex rotations. As a result, only a subset of the cellular population
can be analyzed, limiting the ability of flow-based assays to perform robust
statistical analysis. We introduce OmniFHT, a pose-free 3D RI reconstruction
framework that leverages the Fourier diffraction theorem and implicit neural
representations (INRs) for high-throughput flow cytometry tomographic imaging.
By jointly optimizing each cell's unknown rotational trajectory and volumetric
structure under weak scattering assumptions, OmniFHT supports arbitrary cell
geometries and multi-axis rotations. Its continuous representation also allows
accurate reconstruction from sparsely sampled projections and restricted
angular coverage, producing high-fidelity results with as few as 10 views or
only 120 degrees of angular range. OmniFHT enables, for the first time, in
situ, high-throughput tomographic imaging of entire flowing cell populations,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoRe-GS accelerates semantic 3D reconstruction by focusing on points of interest with color-based filtering, reducing training time by 25% while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile robotics applications like tele-guidance and disaster response require fast, accurate 3D reconstruction of specific objects rather than full scenes, but current methods are time-consuming.

Method: First generates coarse semantic Gaussian Splatting scene, then refines using novel color-based effective filtering to isolate semantic objects before full training completion.

Result: 25% reduction in training time compared to full semantic GS cycle, with higher novel-view-synthesis quality on both real-world outdoor and synthetic indoor datasets.

Conclusion: CoRe-GS successfully balances reconstruction quality with efficiency by focusing computational resources on semantically relevant areas, enabling faster mobile robotics applications.

Abstract: Mobile reconstruction for autonomous aerial robotics holds strong potential
for critical applications such as tele-guidance and disaster response. These
tasks demand both accurate 3D reconstruction and fast scene processing. Instead
of reconstructing the entire scene in detail, it is often more efficient to
focus on specific objects, i.e., points of interest (PoIs). Mobile robots
equipped with advanced sensing can usually detect these early during data
acquisition or preliminary analysis, reducing the need for full-scene
optimization. Gaussian Splatting (GS) has recently shown promise in delivering
high-quality novel view synthesis and 3D representation by an incremental
learning process. Extending GS with scene editing, semantics adds useful
per-splat features to isolate objects effectively.
  Semantic 3D Gaussian editing can already be achieved before the full training
cycle is completed, reducing the overall training time. Moreover, the
semantically relevant area, the PoI, is usually already known during capturing.
To balance high-quality reconstruction with reduced training time, we propose
CoRe-GS. We first generate a coarse segmentation-ready scene with semantic GS
and then refine it for the semantic object using our novel color-based
effective filtering for effective object isolation. This is speeding up the
training process to be about a quarter less than a full training cycle for
semantic GS. We evaluate our approach on two datasets, SCRREAM (real-world,
outdoor) and NeRDS 360 (synthetic, indoor), showing reduced runtime and higher
novel-view-synthesis quality.

*Trixia Simangan,Ahmed Nadeem Abbasi,Yipeng Hu,Shaheer U. Saeed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cryo-RL uses reinforcement learning to automate cryoablation probe placement for prostate cancer treatment, achieving expert-level performance with 8% Dice improvement over automated baselines and significantly reduced planning time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current cryoablation planning is manual, expertise-dependent, time-consuming, and leads to treatment variability, limiting scalability of this minimally invasive prostate cancer treatment.

Method: Reinforcement learning framework that models cryoablation planning as a Markov decision process, where an agent sequentially selects cryoprobe positions and ice sphere diameters in a simulated environment with clinical constraints.

Result: Achieved over 8 percentage-point Dice improvements compared to best automated baselines and matched human expert performance while requiring substantially less planning time on 583 retrospective prostate cancer cases.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning shows potential to deliver clinically viable, reproducible, and efficient cryoablation plans, automating a traditionally manual and variable process.

Abstract: Cryoablation is a minimally invasive localised treatment for prostate cancer
that destroys malignant tissue during de-freezing, while sparing surrounding
healthy structures. Its success depends on accurate preoperative planning of
cryoprobe placements to fully cover the tumour and avoid critical anatomy. This
planning is currently manual, expertise-dependent, and time-consuming, leading
to variability in treatment quality and limited scalability. In this work, we
introduce Cryo-RL, a reinforcement learning framework that models cryoablation
planning as a Markov decision process and learns an optimal policy for
cryoprobe placement. Within a simulated environment that models clinical
constraints and stochastic intraoperative variability, an agent sequentially
selects cryoprobe positions and ice sphere diameters. Guided by a reward
function based on tumour coverage, this agent learns a cryoablation strategy
that leads to optimal cryoprobe placements without the need for any
manually-designed plans. Evaluated on 583 retrospective prostate cancer cases,
Cryo-RL achieved over 8 percentage-point Dice improvements compared with the
best automated baselines, based on geometric optimisation, and matched human
expert performance while requiring substantially less planning time. These
results highlight the potential of reinforcement learning to deliver clinically
viable, reproducible, and efficient cryoablation plans.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pretrained computer vision models can predict fear levels from spider images with good accuracy (MAE 10.1-11.0), showing potential for adaptive exposure therapy systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable computerized exposure therapy where visual stimuli can be dynamically adjusted based on patient fear responses, requiring accurate fear prediction from images.

Method: Adapted three pretrained computer vision models using transfer learning to predict human fear ratings (0-100 scale) from 313 spider images, evaluated with cross-validation and explainability assessments.

Result: Models achieved average MAE between 10.1-11.0, performance degraded with smaller datasets, predictions were based on spider-related features, and higher errors occurred with distant views and artificial spiders.

Conclusion: Computer vision models show promise for predicting fear ratings in therapeutic applications, with explainability and sufficient dataset size being critical factors for effective emotion-aware technologies.

Abstract: Advances in computer vision have opened new avenues for clinical
applications, particularly in computerized exposure therapy where visual
stimuli can be dynamically adjusted based on patient responses. As a critical
step toward such adaptive systems, we investigated whether pretrained computer
vision models can accurately predict fear levels from spider-related images. We
adapted three diverse models using transfer learning to predict human fear
ratings (on a 0-100 scale) from a standardized dataset of 313 images. The
models were evaluated using cross-validation, achieving an average mean
absolute error (MAE) between 10.1 and 11.0. Our learning curve analysis
revealed that reducing the dataset size significantly harmed performance,
though further increases yielded no substantial gains. Explainability
assessments showed the models' predictions were based on spider-related
features. A category-wise error analysis further identified visual conditions
associated with higher errors (e.g., distant views and artificial/painted
spiders). These findings demonstrate the potential of explainable computer
vision models in predicting fear ratings, highlighting the importance of both
model explainability and a sufficient dataset size for developing effective
emotion-aware therapeutic technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data curation for training computer vision models for industrial wear and tear detection is expensive and time-consuming due to lack of datasets for different scenarios.

Method: Uses vision language model with 3D simulation and rendering engine to generate synthetic data for varying rust conditions.

Result: Model trained with synthetic data outperforms other approaches with mAP50 score of 0.87 on real rusted industrial object images.

Conclusion: The approach is effective for industrial wear detection and can be easily extended to other wear and tear scenarios.

Abstract: We propose an approach to generate synthetic data to train computer vision
(CV) models for industrial wear and tear detection. Wear and tear detection is
an important CV problem for predictive maintenance tasks in any industry.
However, data curation for training such models is expensive and time-consuming
due to the unavailability of datasets for different wear and tear scenarios.
Our approach employs a vision language model along with a 3D simulation and
rendering engine to generate synthetic data for varying rust conditions. We
evaluate our approach by training a CV model for rust detection using the
generated dataset and tested the trained model on real images of rusted
industrial objects. The model trained with the synthetic data generated by our
approach, outperforms the other approaches with a mAP50 score of 0.87. The
approach is customizable and can be easily extended to other industrial wear
and tear detection scenarios

*Maryam Adelipour,Gustavo Carneiro,Jeongkwon Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Simple attention-based MIL framework for automated sebocyte lipid droplet counting, showing baseline MLP outperforms attention-MIL in stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual counting of sebocyte lipid droplets is labor-intensive and subjective, requiring automated solutions for accurate quantification.

Method: Used Nile Red-stained sebocyte images annotated into 14 classes (~50,000 cells). Benchmarked baseline MLP vs attention-based MIL with ResNet-50 features using five-fold cross-validation.

Result: Baseline MLP achieved more stable performance (mean MAE = 5.6) compared to attention-based MIL (mean MAE = 10.7), though MIL occasionally performed better in specific folds.

Conclusion: Simple bag-level aggregation provides robust baseline for slide-level droplet counting, while attention-based MIL requires task-aligned pooling and regularization for optimal performance.

Abstract: Sebocytes are lipid-secreting cells whose differentiation is marked by the
accumulation of intracellular lipid droplets, making their quantification a key
readout in sebocyte biology. Manual counting is labor-intensive and subjective,
motivating automated solutions. Here, we introduce a simple attention-based
multiple instance learning (MIL) framework for sebocyte image analysis. Nile
Red-stained sebocyte images were annotated into 14 classes according to droplet
counts, expanded via data augmentation to about 50,000 cells. Two models were
benchmarked: a baseline multi-layer perceptron (MLP) trained on aggregated
patch-level counts, and an attention-based MIL model leveraging ResNet-50
features with instance weighting. Experiments using five-fold cross-validation
showed that the baseline MLP achieved more stable performance (mean MAE = 5.6)
compared with the attention-based MIL, which was less consistent (mean MAE =
10.7) but occasionally superior in specific folds. These findings indicate that
simple bag-level aggregation provides a robust baseline for slide-level droplet
counting, while attention-based MIL requires task-aligned pooling and
regularization to fully realize its potential in sebocyte image analysis.

### [32] [UniView: Enhancing Novel View Synthesis From A Single Image By Unifying Reference Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04932)
*Haowang Cui,Rui Chen,Tao Luo,Rui Li,Jiaze Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniView is a novel view synthesis model that leverages reference images from similar objects to provide strong priors, addressing ambiguity issues in single-image novel view synthesis through a retrieval system, MLLM-assisted selection, and multi-level feature integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-image novel view synthesis is highly ill-posed due to multiple explanations for unobserved areas. Current methods often generate severe distortions from ambiguity priors and interpolation near input views.

Method: Proposes UniView with: 1) retrieval and augmentation system with MLLM-assisted reference image selection, 2) plug-and-play adapter with multi-level isolation layers for dynamic reference feature generation, 3) decoupled triple attention mechanism to preserve original image details and align multi-branch features.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniView significantly improves novel view synthesis performance and outperforms state-of-the-art methods on challenging datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed UniView model effectively addresses the limitations of current single-image view synthesis methods by leveraging reference images and advanced feature integration mechanisms, achieving superior performance.

Abstract: The task of synthesizing novel views from a single image is highly ill-posed
due to multiple explanations for unobserved areas. Most current methods tend to
generate unseen regions from ambiguity priors and interpolation near input
views, which often lead to severe distortions. To address this limitation, we
propose a novel model dubbed as UniView, which can leverage reference images
from a similar object to provide strong prior information during view
synthesis. More specifically, we construct a retrieval and augmentation system
and employ a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to assist in selecting
reference images that meet our requirements. Additionally, a plug-and-play
adapter module with multi-level isolation layers is introduced to dynamically
generate reference features for the target views. Moreover, in order to
preserve the details of an original input image, we design a decoupled triple
attention mechanism, which can effectively align and integrate multi-branch
features into the synthesis process. Extensive experiments have demonstrated
that our UniView significantly improves novel view synthesis performance and
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the challenging datasets.

*Gehui Chen,Guan'an Wang,Xiaowen Huang,Jitao Sang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MFM-Mapper uses dual visual encoders and GPT-2 to efficiently connect pre-trained foundation models for video-to-audio generation, achieving better performance with only 16% of previous training requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training video-to-audio generation models from scratch is resource-intensive, so leveraging pre-trained foundation models through efficient mapping networks provides a more practical approach with cross-modal knowledge transfer.

Method: Proposes MFM-Mapper that fuses features from dual visual encoders and replaces linear mapping with GPT-2 for better feature alignment, treating cross-modal mapping as an autoregressive translation task.

Result: Achieves superior semantic and temporal consistency with remarkable training efficiency - requires only 16% of previous training scale while achieving competitive performance with larger models.

Conclusion: MFM-Mapper demonstrates that intelligent fusion of multiple foundation models with advanced mapping architectures can significantly improve video-to-audio generation efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Recent Video-to-Audio (V2A) generation relies on extracting semantic and
temporal features from video to condition generative models. Training these
models from scratch is resource intensive. Consequently, leveraging foundation
models (FMs) has gained traction due to their cross-modal knowledge transfer
and generalization capabilities. One prior work has explored fine-tuning a
lightweight mapper network to connect a pre-trained visual encoder with a
text-to-audio generation model for V2A. Inspired by this, we introduce the
Multiple Foundation Model Mapper (MFM-Mapper). Compared to the previous mapper
approach, MFM-Mapper benefits from richer semantic and temporal information by
fusing features from dual visual encoders. Furthermore, by replacing a linear
mapper with GPT-2, MFM-Mapper improves feature alignment, drawing parallels
between cross-modal features mapping and autoregressive translation tasks. Our
MFM-Mapper exhibits remarkable training efficiency. It achieves better
performance in semantic and temporal consistency with fewer training consuming,
requiring only 16\% of the training scale compared to previous mapper-based
work, yet achieves competitive performance with models trained on a much larger
scale.

*Tianpei Zhang,Jufeng Zhao,Yiming Zhu,Guangmang Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GD^2Fusion is a novel infrared-visible image fusion framework that handles dual-source degraded scenarios by integrating vision-language models for degradation perception with dual-domain (frequency/spatial) joint optimization, eliminating the need for manual pre-enhancement steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IVIF methods assume high-quality inputs and struggle with degraded scenarios, requiring multiple manual pre-enhancement steps that lead to error accumulation and performance degradation.

Method: Proposes Guided Dual-Domain Fusion framework with two modules: GFMSE for frequency-domain degradation perception/suppression and discriminative feature extraction, and GSMAF for cross-modal degradation filtering and adaptive feature aggregation in spatial domain.

Result: Extensive experiments show GD^2Fusion achieves superior fusion performance compared to existing algorithms and strategies in dual-source degraded scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework successfully integrates VLMs with dual-domain optimization to handle degraded fusion scenarios without manual pre-processing, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Most existing infrared-visible image fusion (IVIF) methods assume
high-quality inputs, and therefore struggle to handle dual-source degraded
scenarios, typically requiring manual selection and sequential application of
multiple pre-enhancement steps. This decoupled pre-enhancement-to-fusion
pipeline inevitably leads to error accumulation and performance degradation. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Guided Dual-Domain Fusion (GD^2Fusion),
a novel framework that synergistically integrates vision-language models (VLMs)
for degradation perception with dual-domain (frequency/spatial) joint
optimization. Concretely, the designed Guided Frequency Modality-Specific
Extraction (GFMSE) module performs frequency-domain degradation perception and
suppression and discriminatively extracts fusion-relevant sub-band features.
Meanwhile, the Guided Spatial Modality-Aggregated Fusion (GSMAF) module carries
out cross-modal degradation filtering and adaptive multi-source feature
aggregation in the spatial domain to enhance modality complementarity and
structural consistency. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments
demonstrate that GD^2Fusion achieves superior fusion performance compared with
existing algorithms and strategies in dual-source degraded scenarios. The code
will be publicly released after acceptance of this paper.

Abstract: Breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women
worldwide. Ultrasound imaging, widely used due to its safety and
cost-effectiveness, plays a key role in early detection, especially in patients
with dense breast tissue. This paper presents a comprehensive study on the

KNN) and deep convolutional neural networks (ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0,
GoogLeNet). Experimental results show that ResNet-18 achieves the highest
accuracy (99.7%) and perfect sensitivity for malignant lesions. Classical ML

TL;DR: SLVM is a biologically inspired vision model that achieves state-of-the-art performance for object perception in low-light traffic scenes, outperforming existing methods by significant margins while reducing computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing perception models struggle with fast adaptation and accurate prediction in low-light traffic environments due to severe illumination degradation and lack of reliable visual cues. There is also a lack of large-scale benchmarks specifically for low-light traffic scenes.

Method: Proposed Separable Learning Vision Model (SLVM) with four key components: light-adaptive pupillary mechanism for illumination-sensitive feature extraction, feature-level separable learning strategy, task-specific decoupled branches for multi-task learning, and spatial misalignment-aware fusion module for precise feature alignment.

Result: SLVM outperforms RT-DETR by 11.2% in detection, YOLOv12 by 6.1% in instance segmentation, and reduces endpoint error by 12.37% on Dark-traffic dataset. On LIS benchmark, it surpasses Swin Transformer+EnlightenGAN and ConvNeXt-T+EnlightenGAN by average 11 percentage points, and exceeds Mask RCNN by 3.1 percentage points.

Conclusion: SLVM provides an effective biologically inspired framework for low-light traffic perception with superior performance and efficiency. The Dark-traffic dataset serves as a valuable benchmark for future research in this domain.

Abstract: Fast and accurate object perception in low-light traffic scenes has attracted
increasing attention. However, due to severe illumination degradation and the
lack of reliable visual cues, existing perception models and methods struggle
to quickly adapt to and accurately predict in low-light environments. Moreover,
there is the absence of available large-scale benchmark specifically focused on
low-light traffic scenes. To bridge this gap, we introduce a physically
grounded illumination degradation method tailored to real-world low-light
settings and construct Dark-traffic, the largest densely annotated dataset to
date for low-light traffic scenes, supporting object detection, instance
segmentation, and optical flow estimation. We further propose the Separable
Learning Vision Model (SLVM), a biologically inspired framework designed to
enhance perception under adverse lighting. SLVM integrates four key components:
a light-adaptive pupillary mechanism for illumination-sensitive feature
extraction, a feature-level separable learning strategy for efficient
representation, task-specific decoupled branches for multi-task separable
learning, and a spatial misalignment-aware fusion module for precise
multi-feature alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SLVM achieves
state-of-the-art performance with reduced computational overhead. Notably, it
outperforms RT-DETR by 11.2 percentage points in detection, YOLOv12 by 6.1
percentage points in instance segmentation, and reduces endpoint error (EPE) of
baseline by 12.37% on Dark-traffic. On the LIS benchmark, the end-to-end
trained SLVM surpasses Swin Transformer+EnlightenGAN and
ConvNeXt-T+EnlightenGAN by an average of 11 percentage points across key
metrics, and exceeds Mask RCNN (with light enhancement) by 3.1 percentage
points. The Dark-traffic dataset and complete code is released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of aligning complex garments with arbitrary body shapes and diverse humanoid characters for fully automated virtual try-on without manual intervention.

Method: Uses SMPL as proxy representation, separates into clothing-to-SMPL (geometric learning-based approach) and body-to-SMPL (diffusion model with multi-view consistent appearance features) correspondence tasks.

Result: Handles complex geometries, non-manifold meshes, generalizes to various humanoid characters (humans, robots, cartoons, creatures, aliens), maintains computational efficiency, and supports clothing size/material customization.

Conclusion: Produces high-quality 3D clothing fittings automatically without human labor or 2D sewing patterns, enabling practical adoption for diverse virtual try-on applications.

Abstract: We present LUIVITON, an end-to-end system for fully automated virtual try-on,
capable of draping complex, multi-layer clothing onto diverse and arbitrarily
posed humanoid characters. To address the challenge of aligning complex
garments with arbitrary and highly diverse body shapes, we use SMPL as a proxy
representation and separate the clothing-to-body draping problem into two
correspondence tasks: 1) clothing-to-SMPL and 2) body-to-SMPL correspondence,
where each has its unique challenges. While we address the clothing-to-SMPL
fitting problem using a geometric learning-based approach for
partial-to-complete shape correspondence prediction, we introduce a diffusion
model-based approach for body-to-SMPL correspondence using multi-view
consistent appearance features and a pre-trained 2D foundation model. Our
method can handle complex geometries, non-manifold meshes, and generalizes
effectively to a wide range of humanoid characters -- including humans, robots,
cartoon subjects, creatures, and aliens, while maintaining computational
efficiency for practical adoption. In addition to offering a fully automatic
fitting solution, LUIVITON supports fast customization of clothing size,
allowing users to adjust clothing sizes and material properties after they have
been draped. We show that our system can produce high-quality 3D clothing
fittings without any human labor, even when 2D clothing sewing patterns are not
available.

TL;DR: ADClick is an interactive image segmentation tool that generates pixel-level anomaly annotations from minimal user input (clicks + text), enabling efficient labeling to improve anomaly detection models. ADClick-Seg extends this with cross-modal alignment for state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial anomaly detection typically requires pixel-level annotations which are costly and limit scalability. Existing methods struggle to leverage defective samples without extensive manual labeling.

Method: Proposes ADClick for interactive image segmentation using user clicks and text descriptions to generate annotations. Introduces ADClick-Seg with cross-modal framework aligning visual features and textual prompts via prototype-based approach.

Result: Achieves AP = 96.1% on MVTec AD with ADClick. ADClick-Seg achieves state-of-the-art: AP = 80.0%, PRO = 97.5%, Pixel-AUROC = 99.1% on MVTec AD multi-class task.

Conclusion: The approach enables efficient pixel-level annotation generation and significantly improves anomaly detection performance, demonstrating effectiveness of combining interactive segmentation with cross-modal alignment for industrial applications.

Abstract: Industrial product inspection is often performed using Anomaly Detection (AD)
frameworks trained solely on non-defective samples. Although defective samples
can be collected during production, leveraging them usually requires
pixel-level annotations, limiting scalability. To address this, we propose
ADClick, an Interactive Image Segmentation (IIS) algorithm for industrial
anomaly detection. ADClick generates pixel-wise anomaly annotations from only a
few user clicks and a brief textual description, enabling precise and efficient
labeling that significantly improves AD model performance (e.g., AP = 96.1\% on
MVTec AD). We further introduce ADClick-Seg, a cross-modal framework that
aligns visual features and textual prompts via a prototype-based approach for
anomaly detection and localization. By combining pixel-level priors with
language-guided cues, ADClick-Seg achieves state-of-the-art results on the
challenging ``Multi-class'' AD task (AP = 80.0\%, PRO = 97.5\%, Pixel-AUROC =
99.1\% on MVTec AD).

the detection and correction of MRI motion artifacts. Quantitative data were
extracted regarding utilized datasets, DL architectures, and performance
metrics. Results: DL, particularly generative models, show promise for reducing
motion artifacts and improving image quality; however, limited
generalizability, reliance on paired training data, and risk of visual
distortions remain key challenges that motivate standardized datasets and
reporting. Conclusions: AI-driven methods, particularly DL generative models,
show significant potential for improving MRI image quality by effectively
addressing motion artifacts. However, critical challenges must be addressed,
including the need for comprehensive public datasets, standardized reporting
protocols for artifact levels, and more advanced, adaptable DL techniques to
reduce reliance on extensive paired datasets. Addressing these aspects could
substantially enhance MRI diagnostic accuracy, reduce healthcare costs, and
improve patient care outcomes.

*Yangming Li,Chaoyu Liu,Lihao Liu,Simon Masnou,Carola-Bibian Schönlieb*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoSplat is a geometry-constrained optimization framework that uses first-order and second-order geometric priors to improve Gaussian splatting training, including better initialization, gradient updates, and densification with noise-robust estimation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous works used low-order geometric priors (e.g., normal vectors) that were unreliably estimated by noise-sensitive methods like local PCA, limiting the performance of Gaussian splatting optimization.

Method: Proposes GeoSplat framework that uses both first-order and second-order geometric quantities. Initializes Gaussian scales using principal curvatures for better surface coverage. Introduces efficient noise-robust estimation methods based on geometric structures like local manifolds to provide dynamic geometric priors.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple datasets for novel view synthesis show that GeoSplat significantly improves Gaussian splatting performance and outperforms previous baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed geometry-constrained optimization framework with robust geometric priors effectively enhances the entire training pipeline of Gaussian splatting, achieving superior performance in novel view synthesis tasks.

Abstract: A few recent works explored incorporating geometric priors to regularize the
optimization of Gaussian splatting, further improving its performance. However,
those early studies mainly focused on the use of low-order geometric priors
(e.g., normal vector), and they are also unreliably estimated by
noise-sensitive methods, like local principal component analysis. To address
their limitations, we first present GeoSplat, a general geometry-constrained
optimization framework that exploits both first-order and second-order
geometric quantities to improve the entire training pipeline of Gaussian
splatting, including Gaussian initialization, gradient update, and
densification. As an example, we initialize the scales of 3D Gaussian
primitives in terms of principal curvatures, leading to a better coverage of
the object surface than random initialization. Secondly, based on certain
geometric structures (e.g., local manifold), we introduce efficient and
noise-robust estimation methods that provide dynamic geometric priors for our
framework. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets for novel view
synthesis, showing that our framework: GeoSplat, significantly improves the
performance of Gaussian splatting and outperforms previous baselines.

### [42] [Scale-interaction transformer: a hybrid cnn-transformer model for facial beauty prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05078)
*Djamel Eddine Boukhari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid CNN-Transformer model called Scale-Interaction Transformer (SIT) achieves state-of-the-art performance in facial beauty prediction by explicitly modeling multi-scale feature interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Convolutional Neural Networks often process information at fixed scales and may overlook critical inter-dependencies between features at different granularity levels, which is crucial for accurate facial beauty prediction.

Method: The SIT architecture combines CNNs for multi-scale feature extraction with Transformers for relational modeling. It uses parallel convolutions to capture facial characteristics at varying receptive fields, then processes these multi-scale representations as sequences through a Transformer encoder with self-attention to model their interactions.

Result: The model achieves a Pearson Correlation of 0.9187 on the SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark dataset, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance and outperforming previous methods.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling the interplay between multi-scale visual cues is crucial for high-performance facial beauty prediction, and hybrid CNN-Transformer models show great potential for complex image regression tasks requiring holistic, context-aware understanding.

Abstract: Automated Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) is a challenging computer vision
task due to the complex interplay of local and global facial features that
influence human perception. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel at
feature extraction, they often process information at a fixed scale,
potentially overlooking the critical inter-dependencies between features at
different levels of granularity. To address this limitation, we introduce the
Scale-Interaction Transformer (SIT), a novel hybrid deep learning architecture
that synergizes the feature extraction power of CNNs with the relational
modeling capabilities of Transformers. The SIT first employs a multi-scale
module with parallel convolutions to capture facial characteristics at varying
receptive fields. These multi-scale representations are then framed as a
sequence and processed by a Transformer encoder, which explicitly models their
interactions and contextual relationships via a self-attention mechanism. We
conduct extensive experiments on the widely-used SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark
dataset, where the proposed SIT model establishes a new state-of-the-art. It
achieves a Pearson Correlation of 0.9187, outperforming previous methods. Our
findings demonstrate that explicitly modeling the interplay between multi-scale
visual cues is crucial for high-performance FBP. The success of the SIT
architecture highlights the potential of hybrid CNN-Transformer models for
complex image regression tasks that demand a holistic, context-aware
understanding.

### [43] [Robust Experts: the Effect of Adversarial Training on CNNs with Sparse Mixture-of-Experts Layers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05086)
*Svetlana Pavlitska,Haixi Fan,Konstantin Ditschuneit,J. Marius Zöllner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Using sparse mixture-of-experts layers in CNNs improves adversarial robustness without increasing inference cost, with some individual experts outperforming the full MoE model due to specialized robust subpaths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving CNN robustness against adversarial attacks is challenging and resource-intensive. The paper explores using sparse MoE layers to increase model capacity without additional inference costs.

Method: Replace selected residual blocks or convolutional layers with sparse MoE layers in ResNet architectures on CIFAR-100. Combine with adversarial training and analyze routing behavior with switch loss.

Result: Inserting a single MoE layer in deeper stages improves robustness under PGD and AutoPGD attacks. Switch loss causes routing collapse onto overused experts, concentrating adversarial training and making these paths more robust. Some individual experts outperform the full MoE model.

Conclusion: Sparse MoE layers effectively improve adversarial robustness, and robust subpaths emerge through specialization when routing collapses onto specific experts during adversarial training.

Abstract: Robustifying convolutional neural networks (CNNs) against adversarial attacks
remains challenging and often requires resource-intensive countermeasures. We
explore the use of sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) layers to improve robustness
by replacing selected residual blocks or convolutional layers, thereby
increasing model capacity without additional inference cost. On ResNet
architectures trained on CIFAR-100, we find that inserting a single MoE layer
in the deeper stages leads to consistent improvements in robustness under PGD
and AutoPGD attacks when combined with adversarial training. Furthermore, we
discover that when switch loss is used for balancing, it causes routing to
collapse onto a small set of overused experts, thereby concentrating
adversarial training on these paths and inadvertently making them more robust.
As a result, some individual experts outperform the gated MoE model in
robustness, suggesting that robust subpaths emerge through specialization. Our
code is available at https://github.com/KASTEL-MobilityLab/robust-sparse-moes.

### [44] [Semi-supervised Deep Transfer for Regression without Domain Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05092)
*Mainak Biswas,Ambedkar Dukkipati,Devarajan Sridharan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CRAFT is a source-free semi-supervised domain adaptation method for regression tasks that improves model performance when source data is unavailable and target labels are scarce, achieving up to 9% RMSE improvement over fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world applications like medicine face challenges where source models don't generalize to domain-shifted target data, source data cannot be shared due to privacy/constraints, and labeled target data is limited, particularly for regression tasks with continuous outputs.

Method: CRAFT builds on Contradistinguisher framework but adapts it for source-free semi-supervised transfer in regression tasks. It learns a shared model across labeled source and unlabeled target samples without intermediate representation alignment, leveraging unlabeled target data.

Result: CRAFT achieved up to 9% improvement in RMSE over fine-tuned models when labeled training examples were scarce, and outperformed four state-of-the-art source-free DA models by more than 3% on neuroscience datasets (EEG gaze prediction and MRI brain age prediction) and other real-world benchmarks.

Conclusion: CRAFT is an efficient approach for source-free, semi-supervised deep transfer for regression that is particularly valuable in biology and medicine where privacy constraints and data scarcity are common challenges.

Abstract: Deep learning models deployed in real-world applications (e.g., medicine)
face challenges because source models do not generalize well to domain-shifted
target data. Many successful domain adaptation (DA) approaches require full
access to source data. Yet, such requirements are unrealistic in scenarios
where source data cannot be shared either because of privacy concerns or
because it is too large and incurs prohibitive storage or computational costs.
Moreover, resource constraints may limit the availability of labeled targets.
We illustrate this challenge in a neuroscience setting where source data are
unavailable, labeled target data are meager, and predictions involve
continuous-valued outputs. We build upon Contradistinguisher (CUDA), an
efficient framework that learns a shared model across the labeled source and
unlabeled target samples, without intermediate representation alignment. Yet,
CUDA was designed for unsupervised DA, with full access to source data, and for
classification tasks. We develop CRAFT -- a Contradistinguisher-based
Regularization Approach for Flexible Training -- for source-free (SF),
semi-supervised transfer of pretrained models in regression tasks. We showcase
the efficacy of CRAFT in two neuroscience settings: gaze prediction with
electroencephalography (EEG) data and ``brain age'' prediction with structural
MRI data. For both datasets, CRAFT yielded up to 9% improvement in
root-mean-squared error (RMSE) over fine-tuned models when labeled training
examples were scarce. Moreover, CRAFT leveraged unlabeled target data and
outperformed four competing state-of-the-art source-free domain adaptation
models by more than 3%. Lastly, we demonstrate the efficacy of CRAFT on two
other real-world regression benchmarks. We propose CRAFT as an efficient
approach for source-free, semi-supervised deep transfer for regression that is
ubiquitous in biology and medicine.

*Arianna Rampini,Kanika Madan,Bruno Roy,AmirHossein Zamani,Derek Cheung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Transformer-based framework for fast 3D texture generation from single image and mesh, eliminating UV mapping and achieving 0.2s generation time with high fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing texture generation methods are slow, rely on UV maps, and often fail to remain faithful to reference images, creating challenges for realistic 3D content creation.

Method: Uses transformer-based framework with triplane representation and depth-based backprojection losses to predict 3D texture field directly from single image and mesh, eliminating UV mapping and differentiable rendering.

Result: Generates high-fidelity textures in 0.2s per shape, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in fidelity to input image and perceptual quality through qualitative, quantitative, and user preference evaluations.

Conclusion: The method enables scalable, high-quality, and controllable 3D content creation with practical efficiency and superior performance compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: High-quality textures are critical for realistic 3D content creation, yet
existing generative methods are slow, rely on UV maps, and often fail to remain
faithful to a reference image. To address these challenges, we propose a
transformer-based framework that predicts a 3D texture field directly from a
single image and a mesh, eliminating the need for UV mapping and differentiable
rendering, and enabling faster texture generation. Our method integrates a
triplane representation with depth-based backprojection losses, enabling
efficient training and faster inference. Once trained, it generates
high-fidelity textures in a single forward pass, requiring only 0.2s per shape.
Extensive qualitative, quantitative, and user preference evaluations
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on
single-image texture reconstruction in terms of both fidelity to the input
image and perceptual quality, highlighting its practicality for scalable,
high-quality, and controllable 3D content creation.

### [46] [SGS-3D: High-Fidelity 3D Instance Segmentation via Reliable Semantic Mask Splitting and Growing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05144)
*Chaolei Wang,Yang Luo,Jing Du,Siyu Chen,Yiping Chen,Ting Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SGS-3D is a training-free refinement method that improves 3D instance segmentation by splitting ambiguous masks using geometric primitives and growing them into complete instances, achieving better accuracy across diverse environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 2D-to-3D lifting approaches suffer from accumulated errors due to ambiguous semantic guidance and insufficient depth constraints, leading to imprecise instance-level segmentation.

Method: A 'split-then-grow' framework that purifies and splits ambiguous lifted masks using geometric primitives, then grows them into complete instances by jointly fusing semantic and geometric information with mask filtering and spatial continuity exploitation.

Result: Experimental results on ScanNet200, ScanNet++, and KITTI-360 show substantial improvements in segmentation accuracy and robustness against inaccurate masks from pre-trained models.

Conclusion: SGS-3D effectively addresses semantic ambiguity in 3D instance segmentation, maintains strong generalization across diverse environments, and provides high-fidelity object instances without requiring training.

Abstract: Accurate 3D instance segmentation is crucial for high-quality scene
understanding in the 3D vision domain. However, 3D instance segmentation based
on 2D-to-3D lifting approaches struggle to produce precise instance-level
segmentation, due to accumulated errors introduced during the lifting process
from ambiguous semantic guidance and insufficient depth constraints. To tackle
these challenges, we propose splitting and growing reliable semantic mask for
high-fidelity 3D instance segmentation (SGS-3D), a novel "split-then-grow"
framework that first purifies and splits ambiguous lifted masks using geometric
primitives, and then grows them into complete instances within the scene.
Unlike existing approaches that directly rely on raw lifted masks and sacrifice
segmentation accuracy, SGS-3D serves as a training-free refinement method that
jointly fuses semantic and geometric information, enabling effective
cooperation between the two levels of representation. Specifically, for
semantic guidance, we introduce a mask filtering strategy that leverages the
co-occurrence of 3D geometry primitives to identify and remove ambiguous masks,
thereby ensuring more reliable semantic consistency with the 3D object
instances. For the geometric refinement, we construct fine-grained object
instances by exploiting both spatial continuity and high-level features,
particularly in the case of semantic ambiguity between distinct objects.
Experimental results on ScanNet200, ScanNet++, and KITTI-360 demonstrate that
SGS-3D substantially improves segmentation accuracy and robustness against
inaccurate masks from pre-trained models, yielding high-fidelity object
instances while maintaining strong generalization across diverse indoor and
outdoor environments. Code is available in the supplementary materials.

*Ariel Basso Madjoukeng,Jérôme Fink,Pierre Poitier,Edith Belise Kenmogne,Benoit Frenay*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-supervised learning framework for sign language recognition that addresses limitations of contrastive learning by using free-negative pairs and a new data augmentation technique to improve feature discrimination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contrastive learning methods for sign language recognition treat all video parts equally and struggle with similar negative pairs due to shared movements between different signs, leading to non-discriminative features.

Method: Proposes a framework with two key components: (1) a self-supervised approach with free-negative pairs, and (2) a new data augmentation technique designed to work together for better representation learning.

Result: Shows considerable accuracy gains compared to several contrastive and self-supervised methods across linear evaluation, semi-supervised learning, and transferability between sign languages.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the limitations of traditional contrastive learning in SLR by focusing on relevant video parts and handling similar negative pairs, resulting in improved performance across multiple evaluation scenarios.

Abstract: Sign language recognition (SLR) is a machine learning task aiming to identify
signs in videos. Due to the scarcity of annotated data, unsupervised methods
like contrastive learning have become promising in this field. They learn
meaningful representations by pulling positive pairs (two augmented versions of
the same instance) closer and pushing negative pairs (different from the
positive pairs) apart. In SLR, in a sign video, only certain parts provide
information that is truly useful for its recognition. Applying contrastive
methods to SLR raises two issues: (i) contrastive learning methods treat all
parts of a video in the same way, without taking into account the relevance of
certain parts over others; (ii) shared movements between different signs make
negative pairs highly similar, complicating sign discrimination. These issues
lead to learning non-discriminative features for sign recognition and poor
results in downstream tasks. In response, this paper proposes a self-supervised
learning framework designed to learn meaningful representations for SLR. This
framework consists of two key components designed to work together: (i) a new
self-supervised approach with free-negative pairs; (ii) a new data augmentation
technique. This approach shows a considerable gain in accuracy compared to
several contrastive and self-supervised methods, across linear evaluation,
semi-supervised learning, and transferability between sign languages.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with generating precise symbolic graphics programs (SVGs) from text descriptions. A new benchmark shows proprietary models outperform open-source ones, but reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards can bridge this gap by improving SVG quality and semantic alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore LLMs' ability to generate precise symbolic graphics programs (SGPs) from natural language descriptions and understand how they comprehend the visual world through program synthesis.

Method: Introduced SGP-GenBench benchmark, then used reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards including format-validity gates and cross-modal rewards using vision encoders (SigLIP for text-image, DINO for image-image alignment).

Result: Frontier proprietary models significantly outperform open-source models on SVG generation. RL approach applied to Qwen-2.5-7B substantially improved SVG quality and semantics, achieving performance comparable to frontier systems.

Conclusion: Symbolic graphics programming provides a precise and interpretable framework for studying cross-modal grounding in LLMs, with RL effectively improving their ability to generate accurate visual programs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at program synthesis, yet their ability to
produce symbolic graphics programs (SGPs) that render into precise visual
content remains underexplored. We study symbolic graphics programming, where
the goal is to generate an SGP from a natural-language description. This task
also serves as a lens into how LLMs understand the visual world by prompting
them to generate images rendered from SGPs. Among various SGPs, our paper
sticks to scalable vector graphics (SVGs). We begin by examining the extent to
which LLMs can generate SGPs. To this end, we introduce SGP-GenBench, a
comprehensive benchmark covering object fidelity, scene fidelity, and
compositionality (attribute binding, spatial relations, numeracy). On
SGP-GenBench, we discover that frontier proprietary models substantially
outperform open-source models, and performance correlates well with general
coding capabilities. Motivated by this gap, we aim to improve LLMs' ability to
generate SGPs. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards
approach, where a format-validity gate ensures renderable SVG, and a
cross-modal reward aligns text and the rendered image via strong vision
encoders (e.g., SigLIP for text-image and DINO for image-image). Applied to
Qwen-2.5-7B, our method substantially improves SVG generation quality and
semantics, achieving performance on par with frontier systems. We further
analyze training dynamics, showing that RL induces (i) finer decomposition of
objects into controllable primitives and (ii) contextual details that improve
scene coherence. Our results demonstrate that symbolic graphics programming
offers a precise and interpretable lens on cross-modal grounding.

Method: Developed a rule-based data generation framework that applies 28 interoperable transformations to objects in grid environments with adjustable composition depth, extensive grid parametrization control, and unlimited sample generation per rule.

Result: Created millions of unique task rules (surpassing concurrent datasets by orders of magnitude) and demonstrated through baseline experiments that state-of-the-art vision models consistently fail to generalize to novel combinations of familiar elements despite strong in-domain performance.

Conclusion: COGITAO provides a comprehensive open-source benchmark for studying compositionality and generalization in visual domains, highlighting the need for improved compositional reasoning capabilities in AI systems.

Abstract: The ability to compose learned concepts and apply them in novel settings is
key to human intelligence, but remains a persistent limitation in
state-of-the-art machine learning models. To address this issue, we introduce
COGITAO, a modular and extensible data generation framework and benchmark
designed to systematically study compositionality and generalization in visual

rule-based tasks which apply a set of transformations to objects in grid-like
environments. It supports composition, at adjustable depth, over a set of 28
interoperable transformations, along with extensive control over grid
parametrization and object properties. This flexibility enables the creation of
millions of unique task rules -- surpassing concurrent datasets by several
orders of magnitude -- across a wide range of difficulties, while allowing
virtually unlimited sample generation per rule. We provide baseline experiments
using state-of-the-art vision models, highlighting their consistent failures to
generalize to novel combinations of familiar elements, despite strong in-domain
performance. COGITAO is fully open-sourced, including all code and datasets, to
