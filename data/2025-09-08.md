### [1] [Facial Emotion Recognition does not detect feeling unsafe in automated driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04490)
*Abel van Elburg,Konstantinos Gkentsidis,Mathieu Sarrazin,Sarah Barendswaard,Varun Kotian,Riender Happee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Study examines perceived risk in automated vehicles using driving simulator experiments, finding that driving style significantly impacts discomfort and facial expressions are unreliable for risk assessment, while neural network models using motion and physiological data show promise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand perceived risk and trust in automated vehicles, which are crucial for public acceptance, by examining how different driving styles and critical events affect passenger comfort and risk perception.

Method: Conducted driving simulator experiment with 32 participants using two automated driving styles (calm vs dynamic) with optional crossing pedestrian. Collected continuous subjective ratings, motion data, facial expressions, skin conductance, heart rate, and eye tracking.

Result: Dynamic driving style caused stronger discomfort; pedestrian doubled comfort decrement with dynamic style. Facial expressions unreliable - only 9/24 showed reactions (mostly Happy, not Fear). Neural network using motion and skin conductance correlated well with reported perceived risk.

Conclusion: Facial expression recognition is not reliable for assessing perceived risk in automated vehicles, but neural network models using vehicle motion and physiological data show potential for objective risk assessment, reducing subjective bias.

Abstract: Trust and perceived safety play a crucial role in the public acceptance of
automated vehicles. To understand perceived risk, an experiment was conducted
using a driving simulator under two automated driving styles and optionally
introducing a crossing pedestrian. Data was collected from 32 participants,
consisting of continuous subjective comfort ratings, motion, webcam footage for
facial expression, skin conductance, heart rate, and eye tracking. The
continuous subjective perceived risk ratings showed significant discomfort
associated with perceived risk during cornering and braking followed by relief
or even positive comfort on continuing the ride. The dynamic driving style
induced a stronger discomfort as compared to the calm driving style. The
crossing pedestrian did not affect discomfort with the calm driving style but
doubled the comfort decrement with the dynamic driving style. This illustrates
the importance of consequences of critical interactions in risk perception.
Facial expression was successfully analyzed for 24 participants but most
(15/24) did not show any detectable facial reaction to the critical event.
Among the 9 participants who did, 8 showed a Happy expression, and only 4
showed a Surprise expression. Fear was never dominant. This indicates that
facial expression recognition is not a reliable method for assessing perceived
risk in automated vehicles. To predict perceived risk a neural network model
was implemented using vehicle motion and skin conductance. The model correlated
well with reported perceived risk, demonstrating its potential for objective
perceived risk assessment in automated vehicles, reducing subjective bias and
highlighting areas for future research.

### [2] [PromptEnhancer: A Simple Approach to Enhance Text-to-Image Models via Chain-of-Thought Prompt Rewriting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04545)
*Linqing Wang,Ximing Xing,Yiji Cheng,Zhiyuan Zhao,Jiale Tao,Qixun Wang,Ruihuang Li,Xin Li,Mingrui Wu,Xinchi Deng,Chunyu Wang,Qinglin Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PromptEnhancer is a universal prompt rewriting framework that improves text-to-image generation by enhancing prompts through reinforcement learning with a specialized reward model, without modifying the base T2I model weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models often fail to accurately render complex user prompts, leading to mismatches between user intent and generated images, particularly in attribute binding, negation, and compositional relationships.

Method: A Chain-of-Thought rewriter trained through reinforcement learning guided by an AlignEvaluator reward model that provides fine-grained feedback based on 24 key points derived from common T2I failure modes.

Result: Extensive experiments on HunyuanImage 2.1 model show significant improvements in image-text alignment across various semantic and compositional challenges.

Conclusion: PromptEnhancer effectively enhances prompt interpretation for T2I models without weight modifications and introduces a new human preference benchmark for future research.

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in generating high-fidelity images. However, these
models often struggle to faithfully render complex user prompts, particularly
in aspects like attribute binding, negation, and compositional relationships.
This leads to a significant mismatch between user intent and the generated
output. To address this challenge, we introduce PromptEnhancer, a novel and
universal prompt rewriting framework that enhances any pretrained T2I model
without requiring modifications to its weights. Unlike prior methods that rely
on model-specific fine-tuning or implicit reward signals like image-reward
scores, our framework decouples the rewriter from the generator. We achieve
this by training a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rewriter through reinforcement
learning, guided by a dedicated reward model we term the AlignEvaluator. The
AlignEvaluator is trained to provide explicit and fine-grained feedback based
on a systematic taxonomy of 24 key points, which are derived from a
comprehensive analysis of common T2I failure modes. By optimizing the CoT
rewriter to maximize the reward from our AlignEvaluator, our framework learns
to generate prompts that are more precisely interpreted by T2I models.
Extensive experiments on the HunyuanImage 2.1 model demonstrate that
PromptEnhancer significantly improves image-text alignment across a wide range
of semantic and compositional challenges. Furthermore, we introduce a new,
high-quality human preference benchmark to facilitate future research in this
direction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext is a 2B-parameter DiT model that achieves state-of-the-art image generation and editing performance through architectural modifications, large-scale pre-training, and a novel Progressive Dual-Task Reinforcement strategy, outperforming larger models like BAGEL (7B) and Flux-Kontext (12B).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many open-source multimodal models prioritize scaling model parameters over optimizing training strategies, which limits their efficiency and performance. The authors aim to develop a more efficient and effective approach to unified image generation and editing.

Method: Architectural modifications to SD3.5-Medium, large-scale pre-training on high-quality data, and a novel Progressive Dual-Task Reinforcement (PDTR) strategy that strengthens both text-to-image generation and editing tasks in a staged manner without negative interference.

Result: UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext demonstrates stronger image generation and editing capabilities than models with significantly larger parameters. The unified multimodal model UniPic2-Metaquery achieves top-tier performance across diverse tasks with a simple and scalable training paradigm.

Conclusion: The proposed training paradigm (Skywork UniPic 2.0) is effective and generalizable, enabling state-of-the-art performance in unified multimodal understanding, generation, and editing with optimized efficiency compared to parameter-scaling approaches.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal models have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in unified image generation and editing. However, many prominent
open-source models prioritize scaling model parameters over optimizing training
strategies, limiting their efficiency and performance. In this work, we present
UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext, a 2B-parameter DiT model based on SD3.5-Medium, which
achieves state-of-the-art image generation and editing while extending
seamlessly into a unified multimodal framework. Our approach begins with
architectural modifications to SD3.5-Medium and large-scale pre-training on
high-quality data, enabling joint text-to-image generation and editing
capabilities. To enhance instruction following and editing consistency, we
propose a novel Progressive Dual-Task Reinforcement strategy (PDTR), which
effectively strengthens both tasks in a staged manner. We empirically validate
that the reinforcement phases for different tasks are mutually beneficial and
do not induce negative interference. After pre-training and reinforcement
strategies, UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext demonstrates stronger image generation and
editing capabilities than models with significantly larger generation
parameters-including BAGEL (7B) and Flux-Kontext (12B). Furthermore, following
the MetaQuery, we connect the UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext and Qwen2.5-VL-7B via a
connector and perform joint training to launch a unified multimodal model
UniPic2-Metaquery. UniPic2-Metaquery integrates understanding, generation, and
editing, achieving top-tier performance across diverse tasks with a simple and
scalable training paradigm. This consistently validates the effectiveness and
generalizability of our proposed training paradigm, which we formalize as
Skywork UniPic 2.0.

### [4] [Inpaint4Drag: Repurposing Inpainting Models for Drag-Based Image Editing via Bidirectional Warping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04582)
*Jingyi Lu,Kai Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Inpaint4Drag is a real-time drag-based image editing framework that uses pixel-space bidirectional warping and inpainting instead of latent space manipulation, achieving 0.01s warping previews and 0.3s inpainting at 512x512 resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing drag-based editing methods rely on latent space manipulation of generative models, which leads to limited precision, delayed feedback, and model-specific constraints that hinder user experience.

Method: The framework decomposes drag editing into pixel-space bidirectional warping (treating image regions as deformable materials) and image inpainting, transforming drag inputs into standard inpainting formats that work with any inpainting model.

Result: Achieves real-time warping previews (0.01s) and efficient inpainting (0.3s), significantly faster than existing methods that require minutes per edit, while maintaining superior visual quality and precise control.

Conclusion: Inpaint4Drag serves as a universal adapter for any inpainting model without architecture modifications, automatically benefiting from future inpainting technology improvements while providing real-time performance and enhanced user interaction.

Abstract: Drag-based image editing has emerged as a powerful paradigm for intuitive
image manipulation. However, existing approaches predominantly rely on
manipulating the latent space of generative models, leading to limited
precision, delayed feedback, and model-specific constraints. Accordingly, we
present Inpaint4Drag, a novel framework that decomposes drag-based editing into
pixel-space bidirectional warping and image inpainting. Inspired by elastic
object deformation in the physical world, we treat image regions as deformable
materials that maintain natural shape under user manipulation. Our method
achieves real-time warping previews (0.01s) and efficient inpainting (0.3s) at
512x512 resolution, significantly improving the interaction experience compared
to existing methods that require minutes per edit. By transforming drag inputs
directly into standard inpainting formats, our approach serves as a universal
adapter for any inpainting model without architecture modification,
automatically inheriting all future improvements in inpainting technology.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior visual
quality and precise control while maintaining real-time performance. Project

### [5] [DisPatch: Disarming Adversarial Patches in Object Detection with Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04597)
*Jin Ma,Mohammed Aldeen,Christopher Salas,Feng Luo,Mashrur Chowdhury,Mert Pesé,Long Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DISPATCH is a diffusion-based defense framework that regenerates entire images using diffusion models to neutralize adversarial patch attacks on object detectors, achieving state-of-the-art performance without requiring prior knowledge of attack patches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art object detectors remain vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks that can conceal or create objects, posing serious security risks. Existing defenses lack effectiveness against diverse and unknown attack types, necessitating a generalizable and robust solution.

Method: DISPATCH employs a 'regenerate and rectify' strategy using diffusion models to reconstruct the entire input image to align with benign data distribution, then identifies and replaces adversarial regions with their regenerated benign counterparts without requiring attack-specific knowledge.

Result: Extensive experiments show DISPATCH outperforms state-of-the-art defenses, achieving 89.3% mAP.5 on hiding attacks and reducing attack success rate to 24.8% on untargeted creating attacks, while maintaining strong robustness against adaptive attacks.

Conclusion: DISPATCH provides an effective, attack-agnostic defense framework that leverages generative models to neutralize adversarial patches while preserving image integrity, making it a practical and reliable solution for securing object detection systems.

Abstract: Object detection is fundamental to various real-world applications, such as
security monitoring and surveillance video analysis. Despite their
advancements, state-of-theart object detectors are still vulnerable to
adversarial patch attacks, which can be easily applied to real-world objects to
either conceal actual items or create non-existent ones, leading to severe
consequences. Given the current diversity of adversarial patch attacks and
potential unknown threats, an ideal defense method should be effective,
generalizable, and robust against adaptive attacks. In this work, we introduce
DISPATCH, the first diffusion-based defense framework for object detection.
Unlike previous works that aim to "detect and remove" adversarial patches,
DISPATCH adopts a "regenerate and rectify" strategy, leveraging generative
models to disarm attack effects while preserving the integrity of the input
image. Specifically, we utilize the in-distribution generative power of
diffusion models to regenerate the entire image, aligning it with benign data.
A rectification process is then employed to identify and replace adversarial
regions with their regenerated benign counterparts. DISPATCH is attack-agnostic
and requires no prior knowledge of the existing patches. Extensive experiments
across multiple detectors and attacks demonstrate that DISPATCH consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art defenses on both hiding attacks and creating
attacks, achieving the best overall mAP.5 score of 89.3% on hiding attacks, and
lowering the attack success rate to 24.8% on untargeted creating attacks.
Moreover, it maintains strong robustness against adaptive attacks, making it a
practical and reliable defense for object detection systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WATCH is a unified framework for global human motion reconstruction from monocular videos that addresses camera orientation and translation integration challenges through analytical heading angle decomposition and world model-inspired trajectory integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Global human motion reconstruction from monocular videos is challenged by depth ambiguity, motion ambiguity, and entanglement between camera and human movements. Existing human-motion-centric approaches suffer from insufficient exploitation of camera orientation information and ineffective integration of camera translation cues.

Method: WATCH introduces an analytical heading angle decomposition technique for efficient camera orientation handling and a camera trajectory integration mechanism inspired by world models for effective camera translation information utilization.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance in end-to-end trajectory reconstruction on in-the-wild benchmarks, demonstrating superior efficiency and extensibility compared to existing geometric methods.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the effectiveness of jointly modeling camera-human motion relationships and provides new insights for addressing the long-standing challenge of camera translation integration in global human motion reconstruction.

Abstract: Global human motion reconstruction from in-the-wild monocular videos is
increasingly demanded across VR, graphics, and robotics applications, yet
requires accurate mapping of human poses from camera to world coordinates-a
task challenged by depth ambiguity, motion ambiguity, and the entanglement
between camera and human movements. While human-motion-centric approaches excel
in preserving motion details and physical plausibility, they suffer from two
critical limitations: insufficient exploitation of camera orientation
information and ineffective integration of camera translation cues. We present
WATCH (World-aware Allied Trajectory and pose reconstruction for Camera and
Human), a unified framework addressing both challenges. Our approach introduces
an analytical heading angle decomposition technique that offers superior
efficiency and extensibility compared to existing geometric methods.
Additionally, we design a camera trajectory integration mechanism inspired by
world models, providing an effective pathway for leveraging camera translation
information beyond naive hard-decoding approaches. Through experiments on
in-the-wild benchmarks, WATCH achieves state-of-the-art performance in
end-to-end trajectory reconstruction. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness
of jointly modeling camera-human motion relationships and offers new insights
for addressing the long-standing challenge of camera translation integration in
global human motion reconstruction. The code will be available publicly.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sali4Vid is a saliency-aware framework that improves dense video captioning by converting timestamp annotations into frame importance weights and using semantic-based adaptive caption retrieval to handle scene transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing end-to-end dense video captioning models suffer from two limitations: (1) applying timestamp supervision only to text while treating all video frames equally, and (2) retrieving captions from fixed-size video chunks that overlook scene transitions.

Method: Proposes Sali4Vid with two key components: Saliency-aware Video Reweighting (converts timestamp annotations into sigmoid-based frame importance weights) and Semantic-based Adaptive Caption Retrieval (segments videos by frame similarity to capture scene transitions).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on YouCook2 and ViTT datasets.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the benefit of jointly improving video weighting and retrieval for dense video captioning through a simple yet effective saliency-aware framework.

Abstract: Dense video captioning aims to temporally localize events in video and
generate captions for each event. While recent works propose end-to-end models,
they suffer from two limitations: (1) applying timestamp supervision only to
text while treating all video frames equally, and (2) retrieving captions from
fixed-size video chunks, overlooking scene transitions. To address these, we
propose Sali4Vid, a simple yet effective saliency-aware framework. We introduce
Saliency-aware Video Reweighting, which converts timestamp annotations into
sigmoid-based frame importance weights, and Semantic-based Adaptive Caption
Retrieval, which segments videos by frame similarity to capture scene
transitions and improve caption retrieval. Sali4Vid achieves state-of-the-art
results on YouCook2 and ViTT, demonstrating the benefit of jointly improving
video weighting and retrieval for dense video captioning

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UAV-based traffic surveillance system using multi-scale template matching and Kalman filtering achieves 91.8% detection precision and detects traffic violations in urban environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional traffic monitoring systems have limited coverage, low adaptability, and poor scalability, creating challenges for urban mobility and road safety.

Method: Leverages multi-scale and multi-angle template matching, Kalman filtering, and homography-based calibration to process aerial video data from 200m altitudes. Uses geofencing, motion filtering, and trajectory deviation analysis for violation detection.

Conclusion: The system demonstrates scalability, accuracy, and practical relevance as an infrastructure-independent traffic monitoring solution for smart cities, supporting comprehensive urban mobility analytics.

Abstract: Traffic congestion and violations pose significant challenges for urban
mobility and road safety. Traditional traffic monitoring systems, such as fixed
cameras and sensor-based methods, are often constrained by limited coverage,
low adaptability, and poor scalability. To address these challenges, this paper
introduces an advanced unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based traffic surveillance
system capable of accurate vehicle detection, classification, tracking, and
behavioral analysis in real-world, unconstrained urban environments. The system
leverages multi-scale and multi-angle template matching, Kalman filtering, and
homography-based calibration to process aerial video data collected from
altitudes of approximately 200 meters. A case study in urban area demonstrates
robust performance, achieving a detection precision of 91.8%, an F1-score of
90.5%, and tracking metrics (MOTA/MOTP) of 92.1% and 93.7%, respectively.
Beyond precise detection, the system classifies five vehicle types and
automatically detects critical traffic violations, including unsafe lane
changes, illegal double parking, and crosswalk obstructions, through the fusion
of geofencing, motion filtering, and trajectory deviation analysis. The
integrated analytics module supports origin-destination tracking, vehicle count
visualization, inter-class correlation analysis, and heatmap-based congestion
modeling. Additionally, the system enables entry-exit trajectory profiling,
vehicle density estimation across road segments, and movement direction
logging, supporting comprehensive multi-scale urban mobility analytics.
Experimental results confirms the system's scalability, accuracy, and practical
relevance, highlighting its potential as an enforcement-aware,
infrastructure-independent traffic monitoring solution for next-generation
smart cities.

### [9] [VCMamba: Bridging Convolutions with Multi-Directional Mamba for Efficient Visual Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04669)
*Mustafa Munir,Alex Zhang,Radu Marculescu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VCMamba is a hybrid vision backbone that combines CNNs for local feature extraction with multi-directional Mamba SSMs for global context modeling, achieving state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between CNNs (good at local features but poor global reasoning) and modern architectures like ViTs and SSMs (good at global context but weak on local features), creating a model that leverages the strengths of both approaches.

Method: Uses a convolutional stem and hierarchical structure with convolutional blocks in early stages for local feature extraction, followed by multi-directional Mamba blocks in later stages for efficient long-range dependency modeling with linear complexity.

Result: VCMamba-B achieves 82.6% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K (surpassing PlainMamba-L3 by 0.3% with 37% fewer parameters) and 47.1 mIoU on ADE20K (exceeding EfficientFormer-L7 by 2.0 mIoU with 62% fewer parameters).

Conclusion: The hybrid CNN-Mamba architecture successfully combines the strengths of both approaches, providing superior feature representation with linear computational complexity and significantly fewer parameters compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision Transformers (ViTs) and State Space Models (SSMs)
have challenged the dominance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in
computer vision. ViTs excel at capturing global context, and SSMs like Mamba
offer linear complexity for long sequences, yet they do not capture
fine-grained local features as effectively as CNNs. Conversely, CNNs possess
strong inductive biases for local features but lack the global reasoning
capabilities of transformers and Mamba. To bridge this gap, we introduce
\textit{VCMamba}, a novel vision backbone that integrates the strengths of CNNs
and multi-directional Mamba SSMs. VCMamba employs a convolutional stem and a
hierarchical structure with convolutional blocks in its early stages to extract
rich local features. These convolutional blocks are then processed by later
stages incorporating multi-directional Mamba blocks designed to efficiently
model long-range dependencies and global context. This hybrid design allows for
superior feature representation while maintaining linear complexity with
respect to image resolution. We demonstrate VCMamba's effectiveness through
extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K classification and ADE20K semantic
segmentation. Our VCMamba-B achieves 82.6% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K,
surpassing PlainMamba-L3 by 0.3% with 37% fewer parameters, and outperforming
Vision GNN-B by 0.3% with 64% fewer parameters. Furthermore, VCMamba-B obtains
47.1 mIoU on ADE20K, exceeding EfficientFormer-L7 by 2.0 mIoU while utilizing
62% fewer parameters. Code is available at

### [10] [Guideline-Consistent Segmentation via Multi-Agent Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04687)
*Vanshika Vats,Ashwani Rathee,James Davis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-agent framework that uses vision-language models to ensure semantic segmentation adheres to complex textual guidelines without retraining, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world semantic segmentation requires strict adherence to complex, paragraph-length labeling guidelines that traditional methods and current open-vocabulary approaches fail to follow faithfully, necessitating expensive retraining when guidelines evolve.

Method: A training-free multi-agent framework with Worker-Supervisor architecture: Worker performs segmentation, Supervisor critiques against retrieved guidelines, and reinforcement learning stop policy terminates the loop to balance accuracy and resource use.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on Waymo and ReasonSeg datasets, demonstrating strong generalization and instruction adherence while maintaining guideline-consistent masks.

Conclusion: The proposed iterative refinement framework effectively addresses complex guideline adherence in semantic segmentation without costly retraining, showing superior performance and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation in real-world applications often requires not only
accurate masks but also strict adherence to textual labeling guidelines. These
guidelines are typically complex and long, and both human and automated
labeling often fail to follow them faithfully. Traditional approaches depend on
expensive task-specific retraining that must be repeated as the guidelines
evolve. Although recent open-vocabulary segmentation methods excel with simple
prompts, they often fail when confronted with sets of paragraph-length
guidelines that specify intricate segmentation rules. To address this, we
introduce a multi-agent, training-free framework that coordinates
general-purpose vision-language models within an iterative Worker-Supervisor
refinement architecture. The Worker performs the segmentation, the Supervisor
critiques it against the retrieved guidelines, and a lightweight reinforcement
learning stop policy decides when to terminate the loop, ensuring
guideline-consistent masks while balancing resource use. Evaluated on the Waymo
and ReasonSeg datasets, our method notably outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, demonstrating strong generalization and instruction adherence.

### [11] [Domain Adaptation for Different Sensor Configurations in 3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04711)
*Satoshi Tanaka,Kok Seang Tan,Isamu Yamashita*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses domain adaptation for 3D object detection across different LiDAR sensor configurations, proposing two techniques: Downstream Fine-tuning and Partial Layer Fine-tuning to improve cross-configuration generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Different vehicle platforms use distinct sensor configurations, causing performance degradation when models trained on one configuration are applied to another due to point cloud distribution shifts. This sensor configuration domain gap remains largely unexplored compared to environmental domain gaps.

Method: Two proposed techniques: 1) Downstream Fine-tuning (dataset-specific fine-tuning after multi-dataset training) and 2) Partial Layer Fine-tuning (updating only a subset of layers to improve cross-configuration generalization). Used paired datasets from same geographic region with multiple sensor configurations.

Result: Joint training with Downstream Fine-tuning and Partial Layer Fine-tuning consistently outperforms naive joint training for each configuration.

Conclusion: The findings provide a practical and scalable solution for adapting 3D object detection models to diverse vehicle platforms with different sensor configurations.

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous driving have underscored the importance of
accurate 3D object detection, with LiDAR playing a central role due to its
robustness under diverse visibility conditions. However, different vehicle
platforms often deploy distinct sensor configurations, causing performance
degradation when models trained on one configuration are applied to another
because of shifts in the point cloud distribution. Prior work on multi-dataset
training and domain adaptation for 3D object detection has largely addressed
environmental domain gaps and density variation within a single LiDAR; in
contrast, the domain gap for different sensor configurations remains largely
unexplored. In this work, we address domain adaptation across different sensor
configurations in 3D object detection. We propose two techniques: Downstream
Fine-tuning (dataset-specific fine-tuning after multi-dataset training) and
Partial Layer Fine-tuning (updating only a subset of layers to improve
cross-configuration generalization). Using paired datasets collected in the
same geographic region with multiple sensor configurations, we show that joint
training with Downstream Fine-tuning and Partial Layer Fine-tuning consistently
outperforms naive joint training for each configuration. Our findings provide a
practical and scalable solution for adapting 3D object detection models to the
diverse vehicle platforms.

*Tianxiang Xue,Jiayi Zhao,Jingsheng Li,Changlu Chen,Kun Zhan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CD-Mamba: A hybrid cloud detection model combining CNN for local spatial features and Mamba for long-range dependencies, achieving superior performance in remote sensing imagery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Remote sensing images are often obscured by cloud cover, compromising data integrity. Effective cloud detection requires addressing both short-range spatial redundancies and long-range atmospheric similarities among cloud patches.

Method: Propose CD-Mamba, a hybrid model that integrates convolutional neural networks (for local spatial dependencies) and Mamba's state-space modeling (for long-range dependencies) into a unified cloud detection network.

Result: Extensive experiments validate CD-Mamba's effectiveness and demonstrate superior performance over existing methods in cloud detection accuracy across diverse spatial scales.

Conclusion: The integration of convolution and Mamba's state-space modeling enables comprehensive capture of pixelwise textural details and long-term patchwise dependencies, significantly improving cloud detection in remote sensing imagery.

Abstract: Remote sensing images are frequently obscured by cloud cover, posing
significant challenges to data integrity and reliability. Effective cloud
detection requires addressing both short-range spatial redundancies and
long-range atmospheric similarities among cloud patches. Convolutional neural
networks are effective at capturing local spatial dependencies, while Mamba has
strong capabilities in modeling long-range dependencies. To fully leverage both
local spatial relations and long-range dependencies, we propose CD-Mamba, a
hybrid model that integrates convolution and Mamba's state-space modeling into
a unified cloud detection network. CD-Mamba is designed to comprehensively
capture pixelwise textural details and long term patchwise dependencies for
cloud detection. This design enables CD-Mamba to manage both pixel-wise
interactions and extensive patch-wise dependencies simultaneously, improving
detection accuracy across diverse spatial scales. Extensive experiments
validate the effectiveness of CD-Mamba and demonstrate its superior performance
over existing methods.

### [13] [Exploiting Unlabeled Structures through Task Consistency Training for Versatile Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04732)
*Shengqian Zhu,Jiafei Wu,Xiaogang Xu,Chengrong Yu,Ying Song,Zhang Yi,Guangjun Li,Junjie Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TCT framework addresses class imbalance in medical image segmentation using partial labels through consistency training between main and auxiliary heads, with filtering and uncertainty-weighted loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VMIS approaches suffer from class imbalance due to unequal category distribution in partially labeled datasets, and existing pseudo-label methods require additional models and suffer from label noise.

Method: Task Consistency Training (TCT) with main segmentation head and multiple auxiliary task heads, consistency constraints, filtering strategy for low-consistency data, and unified auxiliary uncertainty-weighted loss.

Result: Extensive experiments on eight abdominal datasets from diverse clinical sites demonstrate the approach's effectiveness.

Conclusion: TCT effectively addresses class imbalance in medical image segmentation without requiring extra models, leveraging consistency training and uncertainty-weighted loss to improve performance.

Abstract: Versatile medical image segmentation (VMIS) targets the segmentation of
multiple classes, while obtaining full annotations for all classes is often
impractical due to the time and labor required. Leveraging partially labeled
datasets (PLDs) presents a promising alternative; however, current VMIS
approaches face significant class imbalance due to the unequal category
distribution in PLDs. Existing methods attempt to address this by generating
pseudo-full labels. Nevertheless, these typically require additional models and
often result in potential performance degradation from label noise. In this
work, we introduce a Task Consistency Training (TCT) framework to address class
imbalance without requiring extra models. TCT includes a backbone network with
a main segmentation head (MSH) for multi-channel predictions and multiple
auxiliary task heads (ATHs) for task-specific predictions. By enforcing a
consistency constraint between the MSH and ATH predictions, TCT effectively
utilizes unlabeled anatomical structures. To avoid error propagation from
low-consistency, potentially noisy data, we propose a filtering strategy to
exclude such data. Additionally, we introduce a unified auxiliary
uncertainty-weighted loss (UAUWL) to mitigate segmentation quality declines
caused by the dominance of specific tasks. Extensive experiments on eight
abdominal datasets from diverse clinical sites demonstrate our approach's
effectiveness.

*Dharsan Ravindran,Kevin Wang,Zhuoyuan Cao,Saleh Abdelrahman,Jeffery Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper enhances SAM/SAM2 segmentation models for autonomous driving by incorporating uncertainty quantification to improve performance in adverse weather conditions, using multi-step finetuning with uncertainty loss and adapting medical imaging uncertainty techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision foundation models like SAM/SAM2 struggle in adverse weather conditions with high visual ambiguity due to lack of uncertainty quantification, which is critical for safety-critical autonomous driving applications.

Method: Two approaches: 1) Multi-step finetuning procedure for SAM2 incorporating uncertainty metrics into loss function, 2) Adapting Uncertainty-Aware Adapter (UAT) from medical imaging to driving contexts.

Result: UAT-SAM outperforms standard SAM in extreme weather, while SAM2 with uncertainty-aware loss achieves improved performance across diverse driving scenes on CamVid, BDD100K, and GTA datasets.

Conclusion: Explicit uncertainty modeling provides significant value for enhancing segmentation robustness in challenging environments for safety-critical autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision foundation models, such as the Segment Anything
Model (SAM) and its successor SAM2, have achieved state-of-the-art performance
on general image segmentation benchmarks. However, these models struggle in
adverse weather conditions where visual ambiguity is high, largely due to their
lack of uncertainty quantification. Inspired by progress in medical imaging,
where uncertainty-aware training has improved reliability in ambiguous cases,
we investigate two approaches to enhance segmentation robustness for autonomous
driving. First, we introduce a multi-step finetuning procedure for SAM2 that
incorporates uncertainty metrics directly into the loss function, improving
overall scene recognition. Second, we adapt the Uncertainty-Aware Adapter
(UAT), originally designed for medical image segmentation, to driving contexts.
We evaluate both methods on CamVid, BDD100K, and GTA driving datasets.
Experiments show that UAT-SAM outperforms standard SAM in extreme weather,
while SAM2 with uncertainty-aware loss achieves improved performance across
diverse driving scenes. These findings underscore the value of explicit
uncertainty modeling for safety-critical autonomous driving in challenging
environments.

maintaining over 90% accuracy across more than 25 activity classes. WatchHAR
outperforms state-of-the-art models for event detection and activity
classification while running directly on the smartwatch, achieving 9.3 ms
processing time for activity event detection and 11.8 ms for multimodal
activity classification. This research advances on-device activity recognition,
realizing smartwatches' potential as standalone, privacy-aware, and
minimally-invasive continuous activity tracking devices.

TL;DR: MCANet is a multi-label classification framework for hurricane damage assessment that uses multi-scale feature learning and class-specific attention to outperform existing methods on UAV imagery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CNN-based methods struggle with multi-scale spatial features and distinguishing visually similar damage types in post-hurricane damage assessment.

Method: Proposes MCANet with Res2Net-based hierarchical backbone for multi-scale context and multi-head class-specific residual attention module to focus on relevant spatial regions for each damage category.

Result: Achieves 91.75% mAP on RescueNet dataset (4,494 UAV images), outperforming ResNet, Res2Net, VGG, MobileNet, EfficientNet, and ViT. With 8 attention heads, improves to 92.35% mAP with over 6% boost for challenging classes like Road Blocked.

Conclusion: MCANet effectively localizes damage-relevant regions and can inform disaster response applications. Future work could integrate knowledge graphs and multimodal LLMs for improved adaptability and semantic understanding.

Abstract: Rapid and accurate post-hurricane damage assessment is vital for disaster
response and recovery. Yet existing CNN-based methods struggle to capture
multi-scale spatial features and to distinguish visually similar or
co-occurring damage types. To address these issues, we propose MCANet, a
multi-label classification framework that learns multi-scale representations
and adaptively attends to spatially relevant regions for each damage category.
MCANet employs a Res2Net-based hierarchical backbone to enrich spatial context
across scales and a multi-head class-specific residual attention module to
enhance discrimination. Each attention branch focuses on different spatial
granularities, balancing local detail with global context. We evaluate MCANet
on the RescueNet dataset of 4,494 UAV images collected after Hurricane Michael.
MCANet achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 91.75%, outperforming ResNet,
Res2Net, VGG, MobileNet, EfficientNet, and ViT. With eight attention heads,
performance further improves to 92.35%, boosting average precision for
challenging classes such as Road Blocked by over 6%. Class activation mapping
confirms MCANet's ability to localize damage-relevant regions, supporting
interpretability. Outputs from MCANet can inform post-disaster risk mapping,
emergency routing, and digital twin-based disaster response. Future work could
integrate disaster-specific knowledge graphs and multimodal large language
models to improve adaptability to unseen disasters and enrich semantic
understanding for real-world decision-making.

TL;DR: Proposes dynamic human group detection in videos using Vision-Language Model features and global optimization across frames to handle changing groups over time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods assume static groups in videos, but real-world groups change dynamically. Both local appearance features and global scene context are crucial for detecting complex human groups.

Method: Uses a Vision-Language Model (VLM) augmented for group detection to extract local and global appearance features. Employs global optimization with a graph structure using all frames' groupness probabilities estimated by groupness-augmented CLIP features.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art group detection methods on public datasets, demonstrating effectiveness in detecting dynamically changing groups.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully detects dynamic human groups by combining VLM-based feature extraction with temporal consistency optimization, addressing limitations of previous static approaches.

Abstract: This paper proposes dynamic human group detection in videos. For detecting
complex groups, not only the local appearance features of in-group members but
also the global context of the scene are important. Such local and global
appearance features in each frame are extracted using a Vision-Language Model
(VLM) augmented for group detection in our method. For further improvement, the
group structure should be consistent over time. While previous methods are
stabilized on the assumption that groups are not changed in a video, our method
detects dynamically changing groups by global optimization using a graph with
all frames' groupness probabilities estimated by our groupness-augmented CLIP
features. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art group detection methods on public datasets. Code:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FloodVision is a zero-shot flood depth estimation framework that combines GPT-4o's vision-language capabilities with a domain knowledge graph of real-world object dimensions to achieve accurate and generalizable flood depth measurements without task-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing computer vision methods for flood detection suffer from accuracy limitations and poor generalization due to dependence on fixed object detectors and task-specific training, making them unsuitable for diverse flood scenarios.

Method: Combines GPT-4o's semantic reasoning with a structured domain knowledge graph containing canonical dimensions of urban objects. Dynamically identifies reference objects, retrieves verified heights to prevent hallucination, estimates submergence ratios, and applies statistical outlier filtering.

Result: Achieves mean absolute error of 8.17 cm on 110 crowdsourced images from MyCoast New York, reducing GPT-4o baseline error by 20.5% and surpassing prior CNN-based methods. Generalizes well across varying scenes and operates in near real-time.

Conclusion: FloodVision provides an accurate, generalizable zero-shot solution for flood depth estimation suitable for integration into digital twin platforms and citizen-reporting apps for smart city flood resilience.

Abstract: Timely and accurate floodwater depth estimation is critical for road
accessibility and emergency response. While recent computer vision methods have
enabled flood detection, they suffer from both accuracy limitations and poor
generalization due to dependence on fixed object detectors and task-specific
training. To enable accurate depth estimation that can generalize across
diverse flood scenarios, this paper presents FloodVision, a zero-shot framework
that combines the semantic reasoning abilities of the foundation
vision-language model GPT-4o with a structured domain knowledge graph. The
knowledge graph encodes canonical real-world dimensions for common urban
objects including vehicles, people, and infrastructure elements to ground the
model's reasoning in physical reality. FloodVision dynamically identifies
visible reference objects in RGB images, retrieves verified heights from the
knowledge graph to mitigate hallucination, estimates submergence ratios, and
applies statistical outlier filtering to compute final depth values. Evaluated
on 110 crowdsourced images from MyCoast New York, FloodVision achieves a mean
absolute error of 8.17 cm, reducing the GPT-4o baseline 10.28 cm by 20.5% and
surpassing prior CNN-based methods. The system generalizes well across varying
scenes and operates in near real-time, making it suitable for future
integration into digital twin platforms and citizen-reporting apps for smart
city flood resilience.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes PIG, a Hybrid-Tower framework for text-to-video retrieval that combines advantages of Two-Tower (efficiency) and Single-Tower (effectiveness) approaches through pseudo-query generation and fine-grained interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CLIP-based T2VR approaches face trade-offs: Two-Tower framework has low effectiveness while Single-Tower has low efficiency. Need a solution that achieves both high effectiveness and efficiency simultaneously.

Method: PIG method with pseudo-query generator that creates pseudo-queries for each video, enabling fine-grained video-text feature interaction before real query is received. Maintains Two-Tower efficiency during inference.

Result: Achieves 1.6%-3.9% improvement in R@1 on five benchmarks. Matches Two-Tower efficiency while achieving near state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: Hybrid-Tower framework successfully hybridizes advantages of both approaches, demonstrating significant performance gains without sacrificing efficiency during inference.

Abstract: The Text-to-Video Retrieval (T2VR) task aims to retrieve unlabeled videos by
textual queries with the same semantic meanings. Recent CLIP-based approaches
have explored two frameworks: Two-Tower versus Single-Tower framework, yet the
former suffers from low effectiveness, while the latter suffers from low
efficiency. In this study, we explore a new Hybrid-Tower framework that can
hybridize the advantages of the Two-Tower and Single-Tower framework, achieving
high effectiveness and efficiency simultaneously. We propose a novel hybrid
method, Fine-grained Pseudo-query Interaction and Generation for T2VR, ie, PIG,
which includes a new pseudo-query generator designed to generate a pseudo-query
for each video. This enables the video feature and the textual features of
pseudo-query to interact in a fine-grained manner, similar to the Single-Tower
approaches to hold high effectiveness, even before the real textual query is
received. Simultaneously, our method introduces no additional storage or
computational overhead compared to the Two-Tower framework during the inference
stage, thus maintaining high efficiency. Extensive experiments on five commonly
used text-video retrieval benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves a
significant improvement over the baseline, with an increase of $1.6\% \sim
3.9\%$ in R@1. Furthermore, our method matches the efficiency of Two-Tower
models while achieving near state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the
advantages of the Hybrid-Tower framework.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate image registration is critical for lunar exploration tasks like surface mapping and resource localization, but aligning data from diverse lunar sensors (optical, hyperspectral, radar) is challenging due to resolution, illumination, and sensor distortion differences.

Method: Evaluated SIFT, ASIFT, AKAZE, RIFT2, and SuperGlue algorithms using cross-modality image pairs from equatorial and polar regions. Implemented preprocessing pipeline including georeferencing, resolution alignment, intensity normalization, and enhancements like adaptive histogram equalization, PCA, and shadow correction.

Result: SuperGlue consistently yielded the lowest root mean square error and fastest runtimes. Classical methods like SIFT and AKAZE performed well near equator but degraded under polar lighting conditions.

Conclusion: Preprocessing and learning-based approaches are crucial for robust lunar image registration across diverse conditions, with deep learning methods like SuperGlue showing superior performance over traditional feature matching techniques.

Abstract: Accurate image registration is critical for lunar exploration, enabling
surface mapping, resource localization, and mission planning. Aligning data
from diverse lunar sensors -- optical (e.g., Orbital High Resolution Camera,
Narrow and Wide Angle Cameras), hyperspectral (Imaging Infrared Spectrometer),
and radar (e.g., Dual-Frequency Synthetic Aperture Radar, Selene/Kaguya
mission) -- is challenging due to differences in resolution, illumination, and
sensor distortion. We evaluate five feature matching algorithms: SIFT, ASIFT,
AKAZE, RIFT2, and SuperGlue (a deep learning-based matcher), using
cross-modality image pairs from equatorial and polar regions. A preprocessing
pipeline is proposed, including georeferencing, resolution alignment, intensity
normalization, and enhancements like adaptive histogram equalization, principal
component analysis, and shadow correction. SuperGlue consistently yields the
lowest root mean square error and fastest runtimes. Classical methods such as
SIFT and AKAZE perform well near the equator but degrade under polar lighting.
The results highlight the importance of preprocessing and learning-based

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Skin disease diagnosis is costly and complex, especially in low-resource settings. Existing automated classification studies are limited to dermoscopic datasets and narrow disease ranges, creating a need for more accessible and comprehensive solutions using mobile devices.

Method: Curated a large dataset of over 50 skin disease categories captured with mobile devices. Evaluated multiple CNN and Transformer architectures, with Swin Transformer showing best performance. Incorporated Grad-CAM for interpretability and clinical relevance visualization.

Result: Transformer models, especially Swin Transformer, demonstrated superior performance in skin lesion classification by effectively capturing global contextual features. The mobile-acquired dataset proved representative of real-world conditions.

Conclusion: Transformer-based approaches show strong potential for accessible AI-assisted dermatological screening in resource-limited environments, with Grad-CAM providing transparent and clinically interpretable predictions for early diagnosis.

Abstract: Skin diseases are among the most prevalent health concerns worldwide, yet
conventional diagnostic methods are often costly, complex, and unavailable in
low-resource settings. Automated classification using deep learning has emerged
as a promising alternative, but existing studies are mostly limited to
dermoscopic datasets and a narrow range of disease classes. In this work, we
curate a large dataset of over 50 skin disease categories captured with mobile
devices, making it more representative of real-world conditions. We evaluate
multiple convolutional neural networks and Transformer-based architectures,
demonstrating that Transformer models, particularly the Swin Transformer,
achieve superior performance by effectively capturing global contextual
features. To enhance interpretability, we incorporate Gradient-weighted Class
Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), which highlights clinically relevant regions and
provides transparency in model predictions. Our results underscore the
potential of Transformer-based approaches for mobile-acquired skin lesion
classification, paving the way toward accessible AI-assisted dermatological

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mixture of Experts (MoE) provides well-calibrated predictive uncertainty estimates for semantic segmentation without architectural changes, outperforming ensemble methods especially on out-of-distribution data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing reliability of computer vision models in safety-critical applications like traffic scene perception by improving uncertainty estimation accuracy and calibration.

Method: Using MoE with gating network to dynamically weight expert predictions, extracting uncertainty via predictive entropy, mutual information, and expert variance. Evaluated on A2D2 and Cityscapes datasets with different expert configurations.

Result: MoEs yield more reliable uncertainty estimates than ensembles under OOD data. Simple gating mechanisms provide better calibration than complex classwise gates. Increasing number of experts further enhances uncertainty calibration.

Conclusion: MoEs offer an efficient and effective alternative to ensembles for uncertainty quantification in semantic segmentation, with potential for improved reliability in safety-critical vision applications.

Abstract: Estimating accurate and well-calibrated predictive uncertainty is important
for enhancing the reliability of computer vision models, especially in
safety-critical applications like traffic scene perception. While ensemble
methods are commonly used to quantify uncertainty by combining multiple models,
a mixture of experts (MoE) offers an efficient alternative by leveraging a
gating network to dynamically weight expert predictions based on the input.
Building on the promising use of MoEs for semantic segmentation in our previous
works, we show that well-calibrated predictive uncertainty estimates can be
extracted from MoEs without architectural modifications. We investigate three
methods to extract predictive uncertainty estimates: predictive entropy, mutual
information, and expert variance. We evaluate these methods for an MoE with two
experts trained on a semantical split of the A2D2 dataset. Our results show
that MoEs yield more reliable uncertainty estimates than ensembles in terms of
conditional correctness metrics under out-of-distribution (OOD) data.
Additionally, we evaluate routing uncertainty computed via gate entropy and
find that simple gating mechanisms lead to better calibration of routing
uncertainty estimates than more complex classwise gates. Finally, our
experiments on the Cityscapes dataset suggest that increasing the number of
experts can further enhance uncertainty calibration. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes LFMT, a hybrid Mamba-Transformer framework for light field image super-resolution that uses Subspace Simple Scanning strategy and dual-stage modeling to efficiently extract spatial-angular and epipolar features while maintaining low computational complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Mamba-based methods for light field super-resolution suffer from inefficient and redundant feature extraction due to multi-directional scanning strategies when applied to complex LF data, and state space models have limitations in preserving spatial-angular and disparity information.

Method: Introduces Subspace Simple Scanning (Sub-SS) strategy and Subspace Simple Mamba Block (SSMB) for efficient feature extraction. Uses dual-stage modeling: Stage I with Spatial-Angular Residual Subspace Mamba Block (SA-RSMB) for shallow features, Stage II with dual-branch parallel structure combining Epipolar Plane Mamba Block (EPMB) and Epipolar Plane Transformer Block (EPTB) for deep epipolar refinement.

Result: LFMT significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in light field image super-resolution, achieving substantial performance improvements while maintaining low computational complexity on both real-world and synthetic LF datasets.

Conclusion: The hybrid Mamba-Transformer framework successfully integrates the strengths of both models for comprehensive information exploration across spatial, angular, and epipolar-plane domains, providing an effective solution for light field super-resolution with optimal performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Recently, Mamba-based methods, with its advantage in long-range information
modeling and linear complexity, have shown great potential in optimizing both
computational cost and performance of light field image super-resolution
(LFSR). However, current multi-directional scanning strategies lead to
inefficient and redundant feature extraction when applied to complex LF data.
To overcome this challenge, we propose a Subspace Simple Scanning (Sub-SS)
strategy, based on which we design the Subspace Simple Mamba Block (SSMB) to
achieve more efficient and precise feature extraction. Furthermore, we propose
a dual-stage modeling strategy to address the limitation of state space in
preserving spatial-angular and disparity information, thereby enabling a more
comprehensive exploration of non-local spatial-angular correlations.
Specifically, in stage I, we introduce the Spatial-Angular Residual Subspace
Mamba Block (SA-RSMB) for shallow spatial-angular feature extraction; in stage
II, we use a dual-branch parallel structure combining the Epipolar Plane Mamba
Block (EPMB) and Epipolar Plane Transformer Block (EPTB) for deep epipolar
feature refinement. Building upon meticulously designed modules and strategies,
we introduce a hybrid Mamba-Transformer framework, termed LFMT. LFMT integrates
the strengths of Mamba and Transformer models for LFSR, enabling comprehensive
information exploration across spatial, angular, and epipolar-plane domains.
Experimental results demonstrate that LFMT significantly outperforms current
state-of-the-art methods in LFSR, achieving substantial improvements in
performance while maintaining low computational complexity on both real-word
and synthetic LF datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PropVG is an end-to-end proposal-based visual grounding framework that integrates foreground object proposal generation with referential object comprehension, using contrastive learning and multi-granularity discrimination to improve object identification in complex scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing end-to-end visual grounding methods rely only on referred targets for supervision and lack multi-granularity discrimination, limiting their robustness in complex scenarios. The authors aim to address these limitations while maintaining efficiency.

Method: Proposes PropVG framework with two key modules: 1) Contrastive-based Refer Scoring (CRS) module using contrastive learning at sentence and word levels, and 2) Multi-granularity Target Discrimination (MTD) module that fuses object- and semantic-level information. The framework integrates proposal generation with referential comprehension without additional detectors.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks including gRefCOCO, Ref-ZOM, R-RefCOCO, and RefCOCO demonstrate the effectiveness of PropVG, showing improved performance in visual grounding tasks.

Conclusion: PropVG successfully addresses limitations of existing methods by integrating proposal generation with referential comprehension and incorporating multi-granularity discrimination through contrastive learning, achieving state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent advances in visual grounding have largely shifted away from
traditional proposal-based two-stage frameworks due to their inefficiency and
high computational complexity, favoring end-to-end direct reference paradigms.
However, these methods rely exclusively on the referred target for supervision,
overlooking the potential benefits of prominent prospective targets. Moreover,
existing approaches often fail to incorporate multi-granularity discrimination,
which is crucial for robust object identification in complex scenarios. To
address these limitations, we propose PropVG, an end-to-end proposal-based
framework that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to seamlessly
integrate foreground object proposal generation with referential object
comprehension without requiring additional detectors. Furthermore, we introduce
a Contrastive-based Refer Scoring (CRS) module, which employs contrastive
learning at both sentence and word levels to enhance the capability in
understanding and distinguishing referred objects. Additionally, we design a
Multi-granularity Target Discrimination (MTD) module that fuses object- and
semantic-level information to improve the recognition of absent targets.
Extensive experiments on gRefCOCO (GREC/GRES), Ref-ZOM, R-RefCOCO, and RefCOCO
(REC/RES) benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of PropVG. The codes and
models are available at https://github.com/Dmmm1997/PropVG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The large scale and high dimensionality of simulation-generated temporal flow field data from scramjet engines present significant challenges for visual interpretation, feature differentiation, and cross-case comparison, making it difficult for experts to analyze combustion dynamics.

Method: Uses pretrained Vision Transformers to extract embeddings from flow field images, applies dimensionality reduction and density-based clustering to uncover combustion modes, constructs temporal trajectories, and employs vision-language models with expert annotations to generate natural-language summaries.

Result: The system effectively enhances hypothesis generation, supports interpretable pattern discovery, and improves knowledge discovery in large-scale scramjet combustion analysis, as demonstrated through expert-informed case studies and feedback.

Conclusion: TemporalFlowViz successfully bridges the gap between latent AI representations and expert reasoning, providing a powerful workflow for analyzing complex temporal combustion data through coordinated multi-view exploration and AI-assisted interpretation.

Abstract: Understanding the complex combustion dynamics within scramjet engines is
critical for advancing high-speed propulsion technologies. However, the large
scale and high dimensionality of simulation-generated temporal flow field data
present significant challenges for visual interpretation, feature
differentiation, and cross-case comparison. In this paper, we present
TemporalFlowViz, a parameter-aware visual analytics workflow and system
designed to support expert-driven clustering, visualization, and interpretation
of temporal flow fields from scramjet combustion simulations. Our approach
leverages hundreds of simulated combustion cases with varying initial
conditions, each producing time-sequenced flow field images. We use pretrained
Vision Transformers to extract high-dimensional embeddings from these frames,
apply dimensionality reduction and density-based clustering to uncover latent
combustion modes, and construct temporal trajectories in the embedding space to
track the evolution of each simulation over time. To bridge the gap between
latent representations and expert reasoning, domain specialists annotate
representative cluster centroids with descriptive labels. These annotations are
used as contextual prompts for a vision-language model, which generates
natural-language summaries for individual frames and full simulation cases. The
system also supports parameter-based filtering, similarity-based case
retrieval, and coordinated multi-view exploration to facilitate in-depth
analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TemporalFlowViz through two
expert-informed case studies and expert feedback, showing TemporalFlowViz
enhances hypothesis generation, supports interpretable pattern discovery, and
enhances knowledge discovery in large-scale scramjet combustion analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniFHT is a pose-free 3D refractive index reconstruction framework that enables high-throughput flow cytometry tomographic imaging of irregularly shaped cells with complex rotations, overcoming limitations of traditional methods that require known poses and uniform rotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D quantitative phase imaging methods assume uniform single-axis rotation and require known cell poses, which restricts applicability to near-spherical cells and prevents accurate imaging of irregularly shaped cells with complex rotations, limiting statistical analysis capabilities.

Method: Leverages Fourier diffraction theorem and implicit neural representations (INRs) to jointly optimize each cell's unknown rotational trajectory and volumetric structure under weak scattering assumptions, supporting arbitrary geometries and multi-axis rotations.

Result: Enables accurate reconstruction from sparsely sampled projections (as few as 10 views) and restricted angular coverage (only 120 degrees), producing high-fidelity results for entire flowing cell populations.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable and unbiased solution for label-free morphometric analysis in flow cytometry platforms, enabling in situ high-throughput tomographic imaging of diverse cell populations without pose constraints.

Abstract: High-throughput 3D quantitative phase imaging (QPI) in flow cytometry enables
label-free, volumetric characterization of individual cells by reconstructing
their refractive index (RI) distributions from multiple viewing angles during
flow through microfluidic channels. However, current imaging methods assume
that cells undergo uniform, single-axis rotation, which require their poses to
be known at each frame. This assumption restricts applicability to
near-spherical cells and prevents accurate imaging of irregularly shaped cells
with complex rotations. As a result, only a subset of the cellular population
can be analyzed, limiting the ability of flow-based assays to perform robust
statistical analysis. We introduce OmniFHT, a pose-free 3D RI reconstruction
framework that leverages the Fourier diffraction theorem and implicit neural
representations (INRs) for high-throughput flow cytometry tomographic imaging.
By jointly optimizing each cell's unknown rotational trajectory and volumetric
structure under weak scattering assumptions, OmniFHT supports arbitrary cell
geometries and multi-axis rotations. Its continuous representation also allows
accurate reconstruction from sparsely sampled projections and restricted
angular coverage, producing high-fidelity results with as few as 10 views or
only 120 degrees of angular range. OmniFHT enables, for the first time, in
situ, high-throughput tomographic imaging of entire flowing cell populations,
providing a scalable and unbiased solution for label-free morphometric analysis

*Hannah Schieber,Dominik Frischmann,Simon Boche,Victor Schaack,Angela Schoellig,Stefan Leutenegger,Daniel Roth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoRe-GS accelerates semantic 3D reconstruction by focusing on points of interest with coarse-to-fine segmentation and color-based filtering, reducing training time by 25% while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile robotics applications like tele-guidance and disaster response require fast, accurate 3D reconstruction of specific objects rather than full scenes, but current methods are time-consuming for full optimization.

Method: Uses Gaussian Splatting with semantic features to first create a coarse segmentation-ready scene, then refines specific objects using novel color-based effective filtering for isolation, enabling early object editing before full training completion.

Result: Achieves about 25% reduction in training time compared to full semantic GS training cycle, with higher novel-view-synthesis quality on both real-world outdoor (SCRREAM) and synthetic indoor (NeRDS 360) datasets.

Conclusion: CoRe-GS successfully balances reconstruction quality with efficiency by focusing computational resources on semantically relevant areas, making it suitable for time-critical mobile robotics applications.

Abstract: Mobile reconstruction for autonomous aerial robotics holds strong potential
for critical applications such as tele-guidance and disaster response. These
tasks demand both accurate 3D reconstruction and fast scene processing. Instead
of reconstructing the entire scene in detail, it is often more efficient to
focus on specific objects, i.e., points of interest (PoIs). Mobile robots
equipped with advanced sensing can usually detect these early during data
acquisition or preliminary analysis, reducing the need for full-scene
optimization. Gaussian Splatting (GS) has recently shown promise in delivering
high-quality novel view synthesis and 3D representation by an incremental
learning process. Extending GS with scene editing, semantics adds useful
per-splat features to isolate objects effectively.
  Semantic 3D Gaussian editing can already be achieved before the full training
cycle is completed, reducing the overall training time. Moreover, the
semantically relevant area, the PoI, is usually already known during capturing.
To balance high-quality reconstruction with reduced training time, we propose
CoRe-GS. We first generate a coarse segmentation-ready scene with semantic GS
and then refine it for the semantic object using our novel color-based
effective filtering for effective object isolation. This is speeding up the
training process to be about a quarter less than a full training cycle for
semantic GS. We evaluate our approach on two datasets, SCRREAM (real-world,
outdoor) and NeRDS 360 (synthetic, indoor), showing reduced runtime and higher
novel-view-synthesis quality.

*Trixia Simangan,Ahmed Nadeem Abbasi,Yipeng Hu,Shaheer U. Saeed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cryo-RL uses reinforcement learning to automate cryoablation planning for prostate cancer, achieving expert-level performance with 8% Dice improvement over automated baselines and significantly reduced planning time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current cryoablation planning is manual, expertise-dependent, time-consuming, and leads to variability in treatment quality and limited scalability.

Method: Reinforcement learning framework modeling cryoablation planning as Markov decision process, where an agent sequentially selects cryoprobe positions and ice sphere diameters in a simulated environment with clinical constraints.

Result: Achieved over 8 percentage-point Dice improvements compared to best automated baselines and matched human expert performance while requiring substantially less planning time on 583 retrospective prostate cancer cases.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning shows potential to deliver clinically viable, reproducible, and efficient cryoablation plans.

Abstract: Cryoablation is a minimally invasive localised treatment for prostate cancer
that destroys malignant tissue during de-freezing, while sparing surrounding
healthy structures. Its success depends on accurate preoperative planning of
cryoprobe placements to fully cover the tumour and avoid critical anatomy. This
planning is currently manual, expertise-dependent, and time-consuming, leading
to variability in treatment quality and limited scalability. In this work, we
introduce Cryo-RL, a reinforcement learning framework that models cryoablation
planning as a Markov decision process and learns an optimal policy for
cryoprobe placement. Within a simulated environment that models clinical
constraints and stochastic intraoperative variability, an agent sequentially
selects cryoprobe positions and ice sphere diameters. Guided by a reward
function based on tumour coverage, this agent learns a cryoablation strategy
that leads to optimal cryoprobe placements without the need for any
manually-designed plans. Evaluated on 583 retrospective prostate cancer cases,
Cryo-RL achieved over 8 percentage-point Dice improvements compared with the
best automated baselines, based on geometric optimisation, and matched human
expert performance while requiring substantially less planning time. These
results highlight the potential of reinforcement learning to deliver clinically
viable, reproducible, and efficient cryoablation plans.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pretrained computer vision models can predict human fear ratings from spider images with good accuracy (MAE 10.1-11.0), showing potential for adaptive exposure therapy systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable computerized exposure therapy where visual stimuli can be dynamically adjusted based on patient responses, by investigating if computer vision models can accurately predict fear levels from images.

Method: Adapted three diverse pretrained computer vision models using transfer learning to predict human fear ratings (0-100 scale) from 313 spider images, evaluated with cross-validation, learning curve analysis, and explainability assessments.

Result: Models achieved average MAE between 10.1-11.0. Learning curves showed performance degrades with smaller datasets but plateaus with larger ones. Models focused on spider-related features, with higher errors for distant views and artificial spiders.

Conclusion: Computer vision models show promise for predicting fear ratings in therapeutic applications, emphasizing the importance of model explainability and sufficient dataset size for emotion-aware technologies.

Abstract: Advances in computer vision have opened new avenues for clinical
applications, particularly in computerized exposure therapy where visual
stimuli can be dynamically adjusted based on patient responses. As a critical
step toward such adaptive systems, we investigated whether pretrained computer
vision models can accurately predict fear levels from spider-related images. We
adapted three diverse models using transfer learning to predict human fear
ratings (on a 0-100 scale) from a standardized dataset of 313 images. The
models were evaluated using cross-validation, achieving an average mean
absolute error (MAE) between 10.1 and 11.0. Our learning curve analysis
revealed that reducing the dataset size significantly harmed performance,
though further increases yielded no substantial gains. Explainability
assessments showed the models' predictions were based on spider-related
features. A category-wise error analysis further identified visual conditions
associated with higher errors (e.g., distant views and artificial/painted
spiders). These findings demonstrate the potential of explainable computer
vision models in predicting fear ratings, highlighting the importance of both
model explainability and a sufficient dataset size for developing effective
emotion-aware therapeutic technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data curation for industrial wear and tear detection models is expensive and time-consuming due to lack of datasets for different scenarios.

Method: Uses vision language model with 3D simulation and rendering engine to generate synthetic data for varying rust conditions.

Result: Model trained with synthetic data outperforms other approaches with mAP50 score of 0.87 on real rusted industrial object images.

Conclusion: The approach is effective for industrial wear detection and can be extended to other wear and tear scenarios.

Abstract: We propose an approach to generate synthetic data to train computer vision
(CV) models for industrial wear and tear detection. Wear and tear detection is
an important CV problem for predictive maintenance tasks in any industry.
However, data curation for training such models is expensive and time-consuming
due to the unavailability of datasets for different wear and tear scenarios.
Our approach employs a vision language model along with a 3D simulation and
rendering engine to generate synthetic data for varying rust conditions. We
evaluate our approach by training a CV model for rust detection using the
generated dataset and tested the trained model on real images of rusted
industrial objects. The model trained with the synthetic data generated by our
approach, outperforms the other approaches with a mAP50 score of 0.87. The
approach is customizable and can be easily extended to other industrial wear
and tear detection scenarios

*Maryam Adelipour,Gustavo Carneiro,Jeongkwon Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Simple attention-based MIL framework for automated sebocyte lipid droplet counting, showing baseline MLP outperforms attention-based MIL in stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual counting of sebocyte lipid droplets is labor-intensive and subjective, requiring automated solutions for accurate quantification.

Method: Used Nile Red-stained sebocyte images annotated into 14 classes, expanded via data augmentation. Benchmarked baseline MLP vs attention-based MIL with ResNet-50 features and instance weighting using five-fold cross-validation.

Result: Baseline MLP achieved more stable performance (mean MAE = 5.6) compared to attention-based MIL (mean MAE = 10.7), though MIL occasionally performed better in specific folds.

Conclusion: Simple bag-level aggregation provides robust baseline for slide-level droplet counting, while attention-based MIL requires task-aligned pooling and regularization to reach full potential.

Abstract: Sebocytes are lipid-secreting cells whose differentiation is marked by the
accumulation of intracellular lipid droplets, making their quantification a key
readout in sebocyte biology. Manual counting is labor-intensive and subjective,
motivating automated solutions. Here, we introduce a simple attention-based
multiple instance learning (MIL) framework for sebocyte image analysis. Nile
Red-stained sebocyte images were annotated into 14 classes according to droplet
counts, expanded via data augmentation to about 50,000 cells. Two models were
benchmarked: a baseline multi-layer perceptron (MLP) trained on aggregated
patch-level counts, and an attention-based MIL model leveraging ResNet-50
features with instance weighting. Experiments using five-fold cross-validation
showed that the baseline MLP achieved more stable performance (mean MAE = 5.6)
compared with the attention-based MIL, which was less consistent (mean MAE =
10.7) but occasionally superior in specific folds. These findings indicate that
simple bag-level aggregation provides a robust baseline for slide-level droplet
counting, while attention-based MIL requires task-aligned pooling and
regularization to fully realize its potential in sebocyte image analysis.

*Haowang Cui,Rui Chen,Tao Luo,Rui Li,Jiaze Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniView improves novel view synthesis from single images by leveraging reference images from similar objects to provide strong priors, reducing distortions in unseen regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for single-image novel view synthesis often produce severe distortions in unobserved areas due to ambiguity priors and interpolation near input views.

Method: Proposes UniView with retrieval/augmentation system using MLLM for reference selection, plug-and-play adapter with multi-level isolation layers, and decoupled triple attention mechanism for feature alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments show UniView significantly improves novel view synthesis performance and outperforms state-of-the-art methods on challenging datasets.

Conclusion: Leveraging reference images from similar objects provides strong prior information that effectively addresses the ill-posed nature of single-image view synthesis, reducing distortions.

Abstract: The task of synthesizing novel views from a single image is highly ill-posed
due to multiple explanations for unobserved areas. Most current methods tend to
generate unseen regions from ambiguity priors and interpolation near input
views, which often lead to severe distortions. To address this limitation, we
propose a novel model dubbed as UniView, which can leverage reference images
from a similar object to provide strong prior information during view
synthesis. More specifically, we construct a retrieval and augmentation system
and employ a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to assist in selecting
reference images that meet our requirements. Additionally, a plug-and-play
adapter module with multi-level isolation layers is introduced to dynamically
generate reference features for the target views. Moreover, in order to
preserve the details of an original input image, we design a decoupled triple
attention mechanism, which can effectively align and integrate multi-branch
features into the synthesis process. Extensive experiments have demonstrated
that our UniView significantly improves novel view synthesis performance and
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the challenging datasets.

*Gehui Chen,Guan'an Wang,Xiaowen Huang,Jitao Sang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MFM-Mapper uses dual visual encoders and GPT-2 to efficiently connect pre-trained foundation models for video-to-audio generation, achieving better performance with only 16% of previous training scale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing V2A generation methods require intensive training from scratch. Leveraging foundation models offers cross-modal knowledge transfer, but previous mapper approaches have limitations in feature richness and alignment.

Method: Proposes MFM-Mapper that fuses features from dual visual encoders and uses GPT-2 (instead of linear mapper) for better cross-modal feature alignment, treating it as an autoregressive translation task.

Result: Achieves superior semantic and temporal consistency with remarkable training efficiency - requires only 16% of training scale compared to previous mapper-based work while achieving competitive performance.

Conclusion: MFM-Mapper demonstrates that fusing multiple foundation model features with advanced mapping architectures (GPT-2) significantly improves V2A generation efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Recent Video-to-Audio (V2A) generation relies on extracting semantic and
temporal features from video to condition generative models. Training these
models from scratch is resource intensive. Consequently, leveraging foundation
models (FMs) has gained traction due to their cross-modal knowledge transfer
and generalization capabilities. One prior work has explored fine-tuning a
lightweight mapper network to connect a pre-trained visual encoder with a
text-to-audio generation model for V2A. Inspired by this, we introduce the
Multiple Foundation Model Mapper (MFM-Mapper). Compared to the previous mapper
approach, MFM-Mapper benefits from richer semantic and temporal information by
fusing features from dual visual encoders. Furthermore, by replacing a linear
mapper with GPT-2, MFM-Mapper improves feature alignment, drawing parallels
between cross-modal features mapping and autoregressive translation tasks. Our
MFM-Mapper exhibits remarkable training efficiency. It achieves better
performance in semantic and temporal consistency with fewer training consuming,
requiring only 16\% of the training scale compared to previous mapper-based
work, yet achieves competitive performance with models trained on a much larger
scale.

*Tianpei Zhang,Jufeng Zhao,Yiming Zhu,Guangmang Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GD^2Fusion is a novel infrared-visible image fusion framework that handles dual-source degraded scenarios by integrating vision-language models for degradation perception with dual-domain (frequency/spatial) joint optimization, eliminating the need for manual pre-enhancement steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing infrared-visible image fusion methods assume high-quality inputs and struggle with degraded scenarios, requiring multiple manual pre-enhancement steps that lead to error accumulation and performance degradation.

Method: Proposes Guided Dual-Domain Fusion (GD^2Fusion) with two modules: Guided Frequency Modality-Specific Extraction (GFMSE) for frequency-domain degradation perception and feature extraction, and Guided Spatial Modality-Aggregated Fusion (GSMAF) for cross-modal degradation filtering and feature aggregation in spatial domain.

Result: Extensive experiments show GD^2Fusion achieves superior fusion performance compared to existing algorithms and strategies in dual-source degraded scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework successfully integrates vision-language models with dual-domain optimization to handle degraded fusion scenarios without manual pre-processing, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Most existing infrared-visible image fusion (IVIF) methods assume
high-quality inputs, and therefore struggle to handle dual-source degraded
scenarios, typically requiring manual selection and sequential application of
multiple pre-enhancement steps. This decoupled pre-enhancement-to-fusion
pipeline inevitably leads to error accumulation and performance degradation. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Guided Dual-Domain Fusion (GD^2Fusion),
a novel framework that synergistically integrates vision-language models (VLMs)
for degradation perception with dual-domain (frequency/spatial) joint
optimization. Concretely, the designed Guided Frequency Modality-Specific
Extraction (GFMSE) module performs frequency-domain degradation perception and
suppression and discriminatively extracts fusion-relevant sub-band features.
Meanwhile, the Guided Spatial Modality-Aggregated Fusion (GSMAF) module carries
out cross-modal degradation filtering and adaptive multi-source feature
aggregation in the spatial domain to enhance modality complementarity and
structural consistency. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments
demonstrate that GD^2Fusion achieves superior fusion performance compared with
existing algorithms and strategies in dual-source degraded scenarios. The code
will be publicly released after acceptance of this paper.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Breast cancer is a leading cause of cancer mortality in women, and ultrasound imaging is crucial for early detection, especially in dense breast tissue where mammography is less effective. There's a need for accurate AI-based diagnostic tools to support clinical workflows.

Classical ML models showed competitive performance when enhanced with deep feature extraction, though outperformed by CNNs. Grad-CAM successfully highlighted diagnostically relevant image regions.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the feasibility of deploying high-performing, interpretable AI systems for ultrasound-based breast cancer detection, supporting the integration of such tools into clinical workflows for improved diagnostic accuracy and transparency.

Abstract: Breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women
worldwide. Ultrasound imaging, widely used due to its safety and
cost-effectiveness, plays a key role in early detection, especially in patients
with dense breast tissue. This paper presents a comprehensive study on the
application of machine learning and deep learning techniques for breast cancer
classification using ultrasound images. Using datasets such as BUSI, BUS-BRA,
and BrEaST-Lesions USG, we evaluate classical machine learning models (SVM,
KNN) and deep convolutional neural networks (ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0,
GoogLeNet). Experimental results show that ResNet-18 achieves the highest
accuracy (99.7%) and perfect sensitivity for malignant lesions. Classical ML

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed SLVM model and Dark-traffic dataset for low-light traffic scene perception, achieving state-of-the-art performance in object detection, instance segmentation, and optical flow estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing perception models struggle with low-light traffic scenes due to severe illumination degradation and lack of reliable visual cues, with no large-scale benchmark available for this specific domain.

Method: Introduced physically grounded illumination degradation method and created Dark-traffic dataset. Proposed SLVM framework with four components: light-adaptive pupillary mechanism, feature-level separable learning, task-specific decoupled branches, and spatial misalignment-aware fusion module.

Result: SLVM outperforms RT-DETR by 11.2% in detection, YOLOv12 by 6.1% in instance segmentation, reduces EPE by 12.37% on Dark-traffic. On LIS benchmark, surpasses Swin Transformer+EnlightenGAN and ConvNeXt-T+EnlightenGAN by average 11 percentage points, exceeds Mask RCNN by 3.1 percentage points.

Conclusion: SLVM achieves state-of-the-art performance with reduced computational overhead, providing an effective solution for low-light traffic scene perception. The Dark-traffic dataset and code are publicly available.

Abstract: Fast and accurate object perception in low-light traffic scenes has attracted
increasing attention. However, due to severe illumination degradation and the
lack of reliable visual cues, existing perception models and methods struggle
to quickly adapt to and accurately predict in low-light environments. Moreover,
there is the absence of available large-scale benchmark specifically focused on
low-light traffic scenes. To bridge this gap, we introduce a physically
grounded illumination degradation method tailored to real-world low-light
settings and construct Dark-traffic, the largest densely annotated dataset to
date for low-light traffic scenes, supporting object detection, instance
segmentation, and optical flow estimation. We further propose the Separable
Learning Vision Model (SLVM), a biologically inspired framework designed to
enhance perception under adverse lighting. SLVM integrates four key components:
a light-adaptive pupillary mechanism for illumination-sensitive feature
extraction, a feature-level separable learning strategy for efficient
representation, task-specific decoupled branches for multi-task separable
learning, and a spatial misalignment-aware fusion module for precise
multi-feature alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SLVM achieves
state-of-the-art performance with reduced computational overhead. Notably, it
outperforms RT-DETR by 11.2 percentage points in detection, YOLOv12 by 6.1
percentage points in instance segmentation, and reduces endpoint error (EPE) of
baseline by 12.37% on Dark-traffic. On the LIS benchmark, the end-to-end
trained SLVM surpasses Swin Transformer+EnlightenGAN and
ConvNeXt-T+EnlightenGAN by an average of 11 percentage points across key
metrics, and exceeds Mask RCNN (with light enhancement) by 3.1 percentage
points. The Dark-traffic dataset and complete code is released at

TL;DR: LUIVITON is an automated virtual try-on system that drapes multi-layer clothing onto diverse humanoid characters using SMPL proxy representation and dual correspondence tasks with geometric learning and diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable fully automated virtual try-on for complex clothing on diverse humanoid characters with arbitrary poses, addressing challenges of garment-body alignment and handling complex geometries.

Method: Uses SMPL as proxy representation with two correspondence tasks: clothing-to-SMPL via geometric learning for shape correspondence, and body-to-SMPL via diffusion model using multi-view consistent appearance features and pre-trained 2D foundation model.

Result: System handles complex geometries, non-manifold meshes, and generalizes to various humanoid characters (humans, robots, cartoons, creatures, aliens) while maintaining computational efficiency and supporting clothing size customization.

Conclusion: LUIVITON provides high-quality 3D clothing fittings without human labor, works without 2D sewing patterns, and offers practical automated virtual try-on solution for diverse applications.

Abstract: We present LUIVITON, an end-to-end system for fully automated virtual try-on,
capable of draping complex, multi-layer clothing onto diverse and arbitrarily
posed humanoid characters. To address the challenge of aligning complex
garments with arbitrary and highly diverse body shapes, we use SMPL as a proxy
representation and separate the clothing-to-body draping problem into two
correspondence tasks: 1) clothing-to-SMPL and 2) body-to-SMPL correspondence,
where each has its unique challenges. While we address the clothing-to-SMPL
fitting problem using a geometric learning-based approach for
partial-to-complete shape correspondence prediction, we introduce a diffusion
model-based approach for body-to-SMPL correspondence using multi-view
consistent appearance features and a pre-trained 2D foundation model. Our
method can handle complex geometries, non-manifold meshes, and generalizes
effectively to a wide range of humanoid characters -- including humans, robots,
cartoon subjects, creatures, and aliens, while maintaining computational
efficiency for practical adoption. In addition to offering a fully automatic
fitting solution, LUIVITON supports fast customization of clothing size,
allowing users to adjust clothing sizes and material properties after they have
been draped. We show that our system can produce high-quality 3D clothing
fittings without any human labor, even when 2D clothing sewing patterns are not
available.

TL;DR: ADClick is an interactive image segmentation tool that generates pixel-level anomaly annotations from minimal user input (clicks + text), enabling efficient labeling that boosts anomaly detection performance. ADClick-Seg extends this with cross-modal alignment for state-of-the-art results on multi-class anomaly detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial anomaly detection typically requires pixel-level annotations of defective samples, which limits scalability. The authors aim to overcome this by developing a tool that can generate precise annotations with minimal user effort.

Method: Proposed ADClick for interactive image segmentation using few user clicks and brief text descriptions. Introduced ADClick-Seg, a cross-modal framework that aligns visual features and textual prompts via prototype-based approach for anomaly detection and localization.

Result: ADClick achieved AP = 96.1% on MVTec AD. ADClick-Seg achieved state-of-the-art results: AP = 80.0%, PRO = 97.5%, Pixel-AUROC = 99.1% on MVTec AD's challenging multi-class anomaly detection task.

Conclusion: The proposed interactive annotation approach enables efficient pixel-level labeling that significantly improves anomaly detection performance, with ADClick-Seg setting new benchmarks for multi-class industrial anomaly detection.

Abstract: Industrial product inspection is often performed using Anomaly Detection (AD)
frameworks trained solely on non-defective samples. Although defective samples
can be collected during production, leveraging them usually requires
pixel-level annotations, limiting scalability. To address this, we propose
ADClick, an Interactive Image Segmentation (IIS) algorithm for industrial
anomaly detection. ADClick generates pixel-wise anomaly annotations from only a
few user clicks and a brief textual description, enabling precise and efficient
labeling that significantly improves AD model performance (e.g., AP = 96.1\% on
MVTec AD). We further introduce ADClick-Seg, a cross-modal framework that
aligns visual features and textual prompts via a prototype-based approach for
anomaly detection and localization. By combining pixel-level priors with
language-guided cues, ADClick-Seg achieves state-of-the-art results on the
challenging ``Multi-class'' AD task (AP = 80.0\%, PRO = 97.5\%, Pixel-AUROC =
99.1\% on MVTec AD).

Motivation: To systematically review and assess the effectiveness of artificial intelligence methods for addressing MRI motion artifacts, which degrade image quality and diagnostic accuracy.

Method: Comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis focusing on deep learning approaches, particularly generative models, with quantitative data extraction on datasets, architectures, and performance metrics.

Result: Deep learning generative models demonstrate potential for reducing motion artifacts and improving MRI image quality, but face limitations in generalizability, reliance on paired training data, and risk of visual distortions.

magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) motion artifacts, assessing current
developments, effectiveness, challenges, and future research directions.
Methods: A comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted,
focusing on deep learning (DL) approaches, particularly generative models, for
the detection and correction of MRI motion artifacts. Quantitative data were
extracted regarding utilized datasets, DL architectures, and performance
metrics. Results: DL, particularly generative models, show promise for reducing
motion artifacts and improving image quality; however, limited
generalizability, reliance on paired training data, and risk of visual
distortions remain key challenges that motivate standardized datasets and
reporting. Conclusions: AI-driven methods, particularly DL generative models,
show significant potential for improving MRI image quality by effectively
addressing motion artifacts. However, critical challenges must be addressed,
including the need for comprehensive public datasets, standardized reporting
protocols for artifact levels, and more advanced, adaptable DL techniques to
reduce reliance on extensive paired datasets. Addressing these aspects could
substantially enhance MRI diagnostic accuracy, reduce healthcare costs, and
improve patient care outcomes.

*Yangming Li,Chaoyu Liu,Lihao Liu,Simon Masnou,Carola-Bibian Schönlieb*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoSplat is a geometry-constrained optimization framework that uses first-order and second-order geometric priors to improve Gaussian splatting training, including better initialization, gradient updates, and densification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous works used low-order geometric priors (like normal vectors) that were unreliably estimated by noise-sensitive methods, limiting the performance of Gaussian splatting.

Method: The framework exploits both first-order and second-order geometric quantities, initializes Gaussian scales using principal curvatures, and introduces efficient noise-robust estimation methods based on geometric structures like local manifolds.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple datasets for novel view synthesis show that GeoSplat significantly improves Gaussian splatting performance and outperforms previous baselines.

Conclusion: GeoSplat provides a general geometry-constrained optimization approach that effectively enhances the entire training pipeline of Gaussian splatting through robust geometric priors.

Abstract: A few recent works explored incorporating geometric priors to regularize the
optimization of Gaussian splatting, further improving its performance. However,
those early studies mainly focused on the use of low-order geometric priors
(e.g., normal vector), and they are also unreliably estimated by
noise-sensitive methods, like local principal component analysis. To address
their limitations, we first present GeoSplat, a general geometry-constrained
optimization framework that exploits both first-order and second-order
geometric quantities to improve the entire training pipeline of Gaussian
splatting, including Gaussian initialization, gradient update, and
densification. As an example, we initialize the scales of 3D Gaussian
primitives in terms of principal curvatures, leading to a better coverage of
the object surface than random initialization. Secondly, based on certain
geometric structures (e.g., local manifold), we introduce efficient and
noise-robust estimation methods that provide dynamic geometric priors for our
framework. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets for novel view
synthesis, showing that our framework: GeoSplat, significantly improves the
performance of Gaussian splatting and outperforms previous baselines.

### [42] [Scale-interaction transformer: a hybrid cnn-transformer model for facial beauty prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05078)
*Djamel Eddine Boukhari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid CNN-Transformer model called Scale-Interaction Transformer (SIT) achieves state-of-the-art results in facial beauty prediction by modeling multi-scale feature interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Convolutional Neural Networks often process information at fixed scales and may overlook critical inter-dependencies between features at different granularity levels in facial beauty prediction tasks.

Method: The SIT architecture combines CNNs for feature extraction with Transformers for relational modeling. It uses a multi-scale module with parallel convolutions to capture facial characteristics at varying receptive fields, then processes these representations as sequences through a Transformer encoder with self-attention to model their interactions.

Result: The SIT model achieved a Pearson Correlation of 0.9187 on the SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark dataset, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance and outperforming previous methods.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling the interplay between multi-scale visual cues is crucial for high-performance facial beauty prediction, and hybrid CNN-Transformer models show great potential for complex image regression tasks requiring holistic, context-aware understanding.

Abstract: Automated Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) is a challenging computer vision
task due to the complex interplay of local and global facial features that
influence human perception. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel at
feature extraction, they often process information at a fixed scale,
potentially overlooking the critical inter-dependencies between features at
different levels of granularity. To address this limitation, we introduce the
Scale-Interaction Transformer (SIT), a novel hybrid deep learning architecture
that synergizes the feature extraction power of CNNs with the relational
modeling capabilities of Transformers. The SIT first employs a multi-scale
module with parallel convolutions to capture facial characteristics at varying
receptive fields. These multi-scale representations are then framed as a
sequence and processed by a Transformer encoder, which explicitly models their
interactions and contextual relationships via a self-attention mechanism. We
conduct extensive experiments on the widely-used SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark
dataset, where the proposed SIT model establishes a new state-of-the-art. It
achieves a Pearson Correlation of 0.9187, outperforming previous methods. Our
findings demonstrate that explicitly modeling the interplay between multi-scale
visual cues is crucial for high-performance FBP. The success of the SIT
architecture highlights the potential of hybrid CNN-Transformer models for
complex image regression tasks that demand a holistic, context-aware
understanding.

### [43] [Robust Experts: the Effect of Adversarial Training on CNNs with Sparse Mixture-of-Experts Layers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05086)
*Svetlana Pavlitska,Haixi Fan,Konstantin Ditschuneit,J. Marius Zöllner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Using sparse mixture-of-experts layers in CNNs improves adversarial robustness without increasing inference cost, with individual experts sometimes outperforming the full MoE model due to specialized robust subpaths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance CNN robustness against adversarial attacks without resource-intensive countermeasures by leveraging sparse MoE layers to increase model capacity efficiently.

Method: Replace selected residual blocks or convolutional layers with sparse MoE layers in ResNet architectures on CIFAR-100, combined with adversarial training and switch loss for expert balancing.

Result: Single MoE layer insertion in deeper stages consistently improves robustness under PGD and AutoPGD attacks. Switch loss causes routing collapse onto few experts, concentrating adversarial training and creating specialized robust subpaths.

Conclusion: Sparse MoE layers effectively improve adversarial robustness, and the emergent specialization of individual experts suggests robust subpaths can be more effective than the full gated MoE model.

Abstract: Robustifying convolutional neural networks (CNNs) against adversarial attacks
remains challenging and often requires resource-intensive countermeasures. We
explore the use of sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) layers to improve robustness
by replacing selected residual blocks or convolutional layers, thereby
increasing model capacity without additional inference cost. On ResNet
architectures trained on CIFAR-100, we find that inserting a single MoE layer
in the deeper stages leads to consistent improvements in robustness under PGD
and AutoPGD attacks when combined with adversarial training. Furthermore, we
discover that when switch loss is used for balancing, it causes routing to
collapse onto a small set of overused experts, thereby concentrating
adversarial training on these paths and inadvertently making them more robust.
As a result, some individual experts outperform the gated MoE model in
robustness, suggesting that robust subpaths emerge through specialization. Our
code is available at https://github.com/KASTEL-MobilityLab/robust-sparse-moes.

### [44] [Semi-supervised Deep Transfer for Regression without Domain Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05092)
*Mainak Biswas,Ambedkar Dukkipati,Devarajan Sridharan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CRAFT is a source-free semi-supervised domain adaptation method for regression tasks that improves model performance when source data is unavailable and labeled target data is scarce, achieving up to 9% RMSE improvement over fine-tuned models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world applications like medicine face challenges where source models don't generalize to domain-shifted target data, and source data cannot be shared due to privacy concerns or computational costs. Labeled target data is often limited, especially for regression tasks with continuous outputs.

Method: CRAFT builds upon Contradistinguisher (CUDA) framework but adapts it for source-free semi-supervised transfer in regression tasks. It learns a shared model across labeled source and unlabeled target samples without intermediate representation alignment, specifically designed for when source data is unavailable.

Result: CRAFT achieved up to 9% improvement in RMSE over fine-tuned models when labeled training examples were scarce. It outperformed four competing state-of-the-art source-free domain adaptation models by more than 3% on neuroscience datasets (EEG gaze prediction and structural MRI brain age prediction) and two other real-world regression benchmarks.

Conclusion: CRAFT is an efficient approach for source-free, semi-supervised deep transfer for regression tasks that are common in biology and medicine, effectively addressing challenges of unavailable source data and limited labeled target data.

Abstract: Deep learning models deployed in real-world applications (e.g., medicine)
face challenges because source models do not generalize well to domain-shifted
target data. Many successful domain adaptation (DA) approaches require full
access to source data. Yet, such requirements are unrealistic in scenarios
where source data cannot be shared either because of privacy concerns or
because it is too large and incurs prohibitive storage or computational costs.
Moreover, resource constraints may limit the availability of labeled targets.
We illustrate this challenge in a neuroscience setting where source data are
unavailable, labeled target data are meager, and predictions involve
continuous-valued outputs. We build upon Contradistinguisher (CUDA), an
efficient framework that learns a shared model across the labeled source and
unlabeled target samples, without intermediate representation alignment. Yet,
CUDA was designed for unsupervised DA, with full access to source data, and for
classification tasks. We develop CRAFT -- a Contradistinguisher-based
Regularization Approach for Flexible Training -- for source-free (SF),
semi-supervised transfer of pretrained models in regression tasks. We showcase
the efficacy of CRAFT in two neuroscience settings: gaze prediction with
electroencephalography (EEG) data and ``brain age'' prediction with structural
MRI data. For both datasets, CRAFT yielded up to 9% improvement in
root-mean-squared error (RMSE) over fine-tuned models when labeled training
examples were scarce. Moreover, CRAFT leveraged unlabeled target data and
outperformed four competing state-of-the-art source-free domain adaptation
models by more than 3%. Lastly, we demonstrate the efficacy of CRAFT on two
other real-world regression benchmarks. We propose CRAFT as an efficient
approach for source-free, semi-supervised deep transfer for regression that is
ubiquitous in biology and medicine.

*Arianna Rampini,Kanika Madan,Bruno Roy,AmirHossein Zamani,Derek Cheung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A transformer-based framework for fast 3D texture generation from single images and meshes, eliminating UV mapping and achieving high-fidelity results in 0.2s per shape.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing texture generation methods are slow, rely on UV maps, and often fail to remain faithful to reference images, creating challenges for realistic 3D content creation.

Method: Transformer-based framework that predicts 3D texture field directly from single image and mesh, using triplane representation with depth-based backprojection losses for efficient training.

Result: Generates high-fidelity textures in single forward pass (0.2s per shape), outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in fidelity to input image and perceptual quality.

Conclusion: Practical solution for scalable, high-quality, and controllable 3D content creation with faster inference and improved faithfulness to reference images.

Abstract: High-quality textures are critical for realistic 3D content creation, yet
existing generative methods are slow, rely on UV maps, and often fail to remain
faithful to a reference image. To address these challenges, we propose a
transformer-based framework that predicts a 3D texture field directly from a
single image and a mesh, eliminating the need for UV mapping and differentiable
rendering, and enabling faster texture generation. Our method integrates a
triplane representation with depth-based backprojection losses, enabling
efficient training and faster inference. Once trained, it generates
high-fidelity textures in a single forward pass, requiring only 0.2s per shape.
Extensive qualitative, quantitative, and user preference evaluations
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on
single-image texture reconstruction in terms of both fidelity to the input
image and perceptual quality, highlighting its practicality for scalable,
high-quality, and controllable 3D content creation.

### [46] [SGS-3D: High-Fidelity 3D Instance Segmentation via Reliable Semantic Mask Splitting and Growing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05144)
*Chaolei Wang,Yang Luo,Jing Du,Siyu Chen,Yiping Chen,Ting Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SGS-3D is a training-free refinement method that uses a "split-then-grow" approach with geometric primitives to purify ambiguous 2D-to-3D lifted masks and grow them into complete 3D instances, significantly improving segmentation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D instance segmentation methods based on 2D-to-3D lifting struggle with precise instance-level segmentation due to accumulated errors from ambiguous semantic guidance and insufficient depth constraints during the lifting process.

Method: A "split-then-grow" framework that first purifies and splits ambiguous lifted masks using geometric primitives, then grows them into complete instances. Uses mask filtering with 3D geometry primitives for semantic consistency and exploits spatial continuity with high-level features for geometric refinement.

Result: Experimental results on ScanNet200, ScanNet++, and KITTI-360 show substantial improvements in segmentation accuracy and robustness against inaccurate masks from pre-trained models, with strong generalization across diverse indoor and outdoor environments.

Conclusion: SGS-3D effectively addresses the limitations of 2D-to-3D lifting approaches by jointly fusing semantic and geometric information, producing high-fidelity 3D object instances without requiring additional training.

Abstract: Accurate 3D instance segmentation is crucial for high-quality scene
understanding in the 3D vision domain. However, 3D instance segmentation based
on 2D-to-3D lifting approaches struggle to produce precise instance-level
segmentation, due to accumulated errors introduced during the lifting process
from ambiguous semantic guidance and insufficient depth constraints. To tackle
these challenges, we propose splitting and growing reliable semantic mask for
high-fidelity 3D instance segmentation (SGS-3D), a novel "split-then-grow"
framework that first purifies and splits ambiguous lifted masks using geometric
primitives, and then grows them into complete instances within the scene.
Unlike existing approaches that directly rely on raw lifted masks and sacrifice
segmentation accuracy, SGS-3D serves as a training-free refinement method that
jointly fuses semantic and geometric information, enabling effective
cooperation between the two levels of representation. Specifically, for
semantic guidance, we introduce a mask filtering strategy that leverages the
co-occurrence of 3D geometry primitives to identify and remove ambiguous masks,
thereby ensuring more reliable semantic consistency with the 3D object
instances. For the geometric refinement, we construct fine-grained object
instances by exploiting both spatial continuity and high-level features,
particularly in the case of semantic ambiguity between distinct objects.
Experimental results on ScanNet200, ScanNet++, and KITTI-360 demonstrate that
SGS-3D substantially improves segmentation accuracy and robustness against
inaccurate masks from pre-trained models, yielding high-fidelity object
instances while maintaining strong generalization across diverse indoor and
outdoor environments. Code is available in the supplementary materials.

*Ariel Basso Madjoukeng,Jérôme Fink,Pierre Poitier,Edith Belise Kenmogne,Benoit Frenay*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel self-supervised learning framework for sign language recognition that addresses issues with contrastive learning by introducing free-negative pairs and a new data augmentation technique, achieving significant accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contrastive learning methods in sign language recognition treat all video parts equally and struggle with similar negative pairs due to shared movements between signs, leading to non-discriminative features.

Method: Proposes a self-supervised framework with two key components: (1) a new self-supervised approach using free-negative pairs, and (2) a novel data augmentation technique designed to work together for better sign representation learning.

Result: Shows considerable gain in accuracy compared to several contrastive and self-supervised methods across linear evaluation, semi-supervised learning, and transferability between sign languages.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the limitations of traditional contrastive learning in SLR by focusing on relevant video parts and handling similar negative pairs, resulting in improved performance across multiple evaluation scenarios.

Abstract: Sign language recognition (SLR) is a machine learning task aiming to identify
signs in videos. Due to the scarcity of annotated data, unsupervised methods
like contrastive learning have become promising in this field. They learn
meaningful representations by pulling positive pairs (two augmented versions of
the same instance) closer and pushing negative pairs (different from the
positive pairs) apart. In SLR, in a sign video, only certain parts provide
information that is truly useful for its recognition. Applying contrastive
methods to SLR raises two issues: (i) contrastive learning methods treat all
parts of a video in the same way, without taking into account the relevance of
certain parts over others; (ii) shared movements between different signs make
negative pairs highly similar, complicating sign discrimination. These issues
lead to learning non-discriminative features for sign recognition and poor
results in downstream tasks. In response, this paper proposes a self-supervised
learning framework designed to learn meaningful representations for SLR. This
framework consists of two key components designed to work together: (i) a new
self-supervised approach with free-negative pairs; (ii) a new data augmentation
technique. This approach shows a considerable gain in accuracy compared to
several contrastive and self-supervised methods, across linear evaluation,
semi-supervised learning, and transferability between sign languages.

Result: Extensive experiments show models trained on ModelNet-R exhibit significant performance improvements. Point-SkipNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on ModelNet-R with substantially lower parameter count compared to contemporary models.

Conclusion: This research highlights the crucial role of dataset quality in optimizing model efficiency for 3D point cloud classification, demonstrating that both improved datasets and efficient network architectures are essential for advancing the field.

Abstract: The classification of 3D point clouds is crucial for applications such as

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with generating precise symbolic graphics programs (SVGs) from text descriptions. A reinforcement learning approach with verifiable rewards significantly improves SVG generation quality, achieving performance comparable to frontier models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore LLMs' ability to generate precise symbolic graphics programs (SVGs) from natural language descriptions and understand how they comprehend the visual world through program synthesis.

Method: Proposed reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards - format-validity gate ensures renderable SVG, cross-modal reward aligns text and rendered images using vision encoders (SigLIP for text-image, DINO for image-image). Applied to Qwen-2.5-7B model.

Result: Frontier proprietary models outperform open-source models on SGP-GenBench benchmark. The RL approach substantially improves SVG generation quality and semantics, achieving performance on par with frontier systems. RL induces finer object decomposition and contextual details for better scene coherence.

Conclusion: Symbolic graphics programming provides a precise and interpretable framework for studying cross-modal grounding in LLMs, and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards effectively bridges the performance gap between open-source and proprietary models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at program synthesis, yet their ability to
produce symbolic graphics programs (SGPs) that render into precise visual
content remains underexplored. We study symbolic graphics programming, where
the goal is to generate an SGP from a natural-language description. This task
also serves as a lens into how LLMs understand the visual world by prompting
them to generate images rendered from SGPs. Among various SGPs, our paper
sticks to scalable vector graphics (SVGs). We begin by examining the extent to
which LLMs can generate SGPs. To this end, we introduce SGP-GenBench, a
comprehensive benchmark covering object fidelity, scene fidelity, and
compositionality (attribute binding, spatial relations, numeracy). On
SGP-GenBench, we discover that frontier proprietary models substantially
outperform open-source models, and performance correlates well with general
coding capabilities. Motivated by this gap, we aim to improve LLMs' ability to
generate SGPs. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards
approach, where a format-validity gate ensures renderable SVG, and a
cross-modal reward aligns text and the rendered image via strong vision
encoders (e.g., SigLIP for text-image and DINO for image-image). Applied to
Qwen-2.5-7B, our method substantially improves SVG generation quality and
semantics, achieving performance on par with frontier systems. We further
analyze training dynamics, showing that RL induces (i) finer decomposition of
objects into controllable primitives and (ii) contextual details that improve
scene coherence. Our results demonstrate that symbolic graphics programming
offers a precise and interpretable lens on cross-modal grounding.

Result: Baseline experiments show state-of-the-art vision models consistently fail to generalize to novel combinations of familiar elements despite strong in-domain performance.

Conclusion: COGITAO provides a comprehensive open-source benchmark to support continued research on compositionality and generalization in visual domains, highlighting current model limitations.

Abstract: The ability to compose learned concepts and apply them in novel settings is
key to human intelligence, but remains a persistent limitation in
state-of-the-art machine learning models. To address this issue, we introduce
COGITAO, a modular and extensible data generation framework and benchmark
designed to systematically study compositionality and generalization in visual

rule-based tasks which apply a set of transformations to objects in grid-like
environments. It supports composition, at adjustable depth, over a set of 28
interoperable transformations, along with extensive control over grid
parametrization and object properties. This flexibility enables the creation of
millions of unique task rules -- surpassing concurrent datasets by several
orders of magnitude -- across a wide range of difficulties, while allowing
virtually unlimited sample generation per rule. We provide baseline experiments
using state-of-the-art vision models, highlighting their consistent failures to
generalize to novel combinations of familiar elements, despite strong in-domain
performance. COGITAO is fully open-sourced, including all code and datasets, to
support continued research in this field.

maintain a global camera token pool, which enhances the reliability of camera
pose estimation without sacrificing efficiency. These designs enable WinT3R to
achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of online reconstruction quality,
camera pose estimation, and reconstruction speed, as validated by extensive
