We present HumbleBench, a new\nhallucination benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' ability to reject plausible\nbut incorrect answers across three hallucination types: object, relation, and\nattribute. Built from a panoptic scene graph dataset, we leverage fine-grained\nscene graph annotations to extract ground-truth entities and relations, and\nprompt GPT-4-Turbo to generate multiple-choice questions, followed by a\nrigorous manual filtering process. Each question includes a \"None of the above\"\noption, requiring models not only to recognize correct visual information but\nalso to identify when no provided answer is valid. We evaluate a variety of\nstate-of-the-art MLLMs -- including both general-purpose and specialized\nreasoning models -- on HumbleBench and share valuable findings and insights\nwith the community. By incorporating explicit false-option rejection,\nHumbleBench fills a key gap in current evaluation suites, providing a more\nrealistic measure of MLLM reliability in safety-critical settings.
