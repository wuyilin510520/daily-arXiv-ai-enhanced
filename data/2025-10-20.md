Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GAZE pipeline automates conversion of raw video to structured supervision for world-model training using AI pre-annotation and human validation, achieving 80% reduction in human review time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual annotation for world model training is slow and expensive, creating bottlenecks in creating large-scale multimodal datasets.

Method: Three-step pipeline: (1) normalize 360-degree video formats into standard views, (2) apply AI models for dense multimodal pre-annotation (scene understanding, object tracking, audio transcription, etc.), (3) consolidate into structured output for human validation with auto-skipping of low-salience segments.

Result: ~19 minutes saved per review hour, >80% reduction in human review volume, generates high-fidelity privacy-aware datasets with increased label density and consistency.

Conclusion: GAZE provides scalable blueprint for generating high-quality world model training data without sacrificing throughput or governance, enabling efficient cross-modal dynamics learning.

Abstract: Training robust world models requires large-scale, precisely labeled
multimodal datasets, a process historically bottlenecked by slow and expensive
manual annotation. We present a production-tested GAZE pipeline that automates
the conversion of raw, long-form video into rich, task-ready supervision for
world-model training. Our system (i) normalizes proprietary 360-degree formats
into standard views and shards them for parallel processing; (ii) applies a
suite of AI models (scene understanding, object tracking, audio transcription,
PII/NSFW/minor detection) for dense, multimodal pre-annotation; and (iii)
consolidates signals into a structured output specification for rapid human
validation.
  The GAZE workflow demonstrably yields efficiency gains (~19 minutes saved per
review hour) and reduces human review volume by >80% through conservative
auto-skipping of low-salience segments. By increasing label density and
consistency while integrating privacy safeguards and chain-of-custody metadata,
our method generates high-fidelity, privacy-aware datasets directly consumable
for learning cross-modal dynamics and action-conditioned prediction. We detail
our orchestration, model choices, and data dictionary to provide a scalable
blueprint for generating high-quality world model training data without
sacrificing throughput or governance.

*Yang Shi,Jingchao Wang,Liangsi Lu,Mingxuan Huang,Ruixin He,Yifeng Xie,Hanqian Liu,Minzhe Guo,Yangyang Liang,Weipeng Zhang,Zimeng Li,Xuhang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes PC-UNet with PVMC-Loss for PET image denoising that maintains physical consistency while reducing radiation exposure from low-dose scans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PET imaging faces limitations due to high radiation doses; lowering doses increases Poisson noise that current denoising methods can't handle without causing distortions and artifacts.

Method: Developed Poisson Consistent U-Net (PC-UNet) with Poisson Variance and Mean Consistency Loss (PVMC-Loss) that incorporates physical data constraints and is statistically unbiased in variance and gradient adaptation.

Result: Tests on PET datasets show PC-UNet improves physical consistency and image fidelity compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: PC-UNet effectively integrates physical information into PET denoising, providing robust performance even with minor data mismatches.

Abstract: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is crucial in medicine, but its clinical
use is limited due to high signal-to-noise ratio doses increasing radiation
exposure. Lowering doses increases Poisson noise, which current denoising
methods fail to handle, causing distortions and artifacts. We propose a Poisson
Consistent U-Net (PC-UNet) model with a new Poisson Variance and Mean
Consistency Loss (PVMC-Loss) that incorporates physical data to improve image
fidelity. PVMC-Loss is statistically unbiased in variance and gradient
adaptation, acting as a Generalized Method of Moments implementation, offering
robustness to minor data mismatches. Tests on PET datasets show PC-UNet
improves physical consistency and image fidelity, proving its ability to
integrate physical information effectively.

### [3] [DeLeaker: Dynamic Inference-Time Reweighting For Semantic Leakage Mitigation in Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15015)
*Mor Ventura,Michael Toker,Or Patashnik,Yonatan Belinkov,Roi Reichart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeLeaker is a lightweight, optimization-free inference-time method that mitigates semantic leakage in text-to-image models by dynamically reweighting attention maps to suppress cross-entity interactions while strengthening entity identity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image models suffer from semantic leakage where unintended features transfer between distinct entities, and existing mitigation strategies are often optimization-based or require external inputs.

Method: DeLeaker directly intervenes on the model's attention maps during diffusion process, dynamically reweighting them to suppress excessive cross-entity interactions while strengthening each entity's identity.

Result: DeLeaker consistently outperforms all baselines, even those with external information, achieving effective leakage mitigation without compromising fidelity or quality.

Conclusion: Attention control is valuable for mitigating semantic leakage, paving the way for more semantically precise text-to-image models.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have advanced rapidly, yet they remain vulnerable
to semantic leakage, the unintended transfer of semantically related features
between distinct entities. Existing mitigation strategies are often
optimization-based or dependent on external inputs. We introduce DeLeaker, a
lightweight, optimization-free inference-time approach that mitigates leakage
by directly intervening on the model's attention maps. Throughout the diffusion
process, DeLeaker dynamically reweights attention maps to suppress excessive
cross-entity interactions while strengthening the identity of each entity. To
support systematic evaluation, we introduce SLIM (Semantic Leakage in IMages),
the first dataset dedicated to semantic leakage, comprising 1,130
human-verified samples spanning diverse scenarios, together with a novel
automatic evaluation framework. Experiments demonstrate that DeLeaker
consistently outperforms all baselines, even when they are provided with
external information, achieving effective leakage mitigation without
compromising fidelity or quality. These results underscore the value of
attention control and pave the way for more semantically precise T2I models.

*Mingxuan Liu,Honglin He,Elisa Ricci,Wayne Wu,Bolei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UrbanVerse is a data-driven real-to-sim system that converts crowd-sourced city-tour videos into physics-aware, interactive simulation scenes for training urban embodied AI agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing simulation scenes for training urban AI agents lack scalability and fail to capture real-world complexity, limiting the development of robust navigation systems.

Method: UrbanVerse consists of UrbanVerse-100K (100k+ annotated urban 3D assets) and UrbanVerse-Gen (automatic pipeline that extracts scene layouts from videos and instantiates metric-scale 3D simulations using retrieved assets).

Result: UrbanVerse provides 160 high-quality scenes from 24 countries with human-evaluated realism comparable to manually crafted scenes. Navigation policies trained in UrbanVerse show +6.3% improvement in simulation and +30.1% in zero-shot sim-to-real transfer, achieving 300m real-world mission with only 2 interventions.

Conclusion: UrbanVerse enables scalable, realistic urban simulation for training embodied AI agents, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities and significant improvements in real-world performance.

Abstract: Urban embodied AI agents, ranging from delivery robots to quadrupeds, are
increasingly populating our cities, navigating chaotic streets to provide
last-mile connectivity. Training such agents requires diverse, high-fidelity
urban environments to scale, yet existing human-crafted or procedurally
generated simulation scenes either lack scalability or fail to capture
real-world complexity. We introduce UrbanVerse, a data-driven real-to-sim
system that converts crowd-sourced city-tour videos into physics-aware,
interactive simulation scenes. UrbanVerse consists of: (i) UrbanVerse-100K, a
repository of 100k+ annotated urban 3D assets with semantic and physical
attributes, and (ii) UrbanVerse-Gen, an automatic pipeline that extracts scene
layouts from video and instantiates metric-scale 3D simulations using retrieved
assets. Running in IsaacSim, UrbanVerse offers 160 high-quality constructed
scenes from 24 countries, along with a curated benchmark of 10 artist-designed
test scenes. Experiments show that UrbanVerse scenes preserve real-world
semantics and layouts, achieving human-evaluated realism comparable to manually
crafted scenes. In urban navigation, policies trained in UrbanVerse exhibit
scaling power laws and strong generalization, improving success by +6.3% in
simulation and +30.1% in zero-shot sim-to-real transfer comparing to prior
methods, accomplishing a 300 m real-world mission with only two interventions.

### [5] [NANO3D: A Training-Free Approach for Efficient 3D Editing Without Masks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15019)
*Junliang Ye,Shenghao Xie,Ruowen Zhao,Zhengyi Wang,Hongyu Yan,Wenqiang Zu,Lei Ma,Jun Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Nano3D is a training-free framework for precise 3D object editing that uses FlowEdit and region-aware merging strategies to achieve superior 3D consistency without requiring masks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D editing methods are inefficient, inconsistent, and often damage unedited regions. Most rely on multi-view rendering and reconstruction, which introduces artifacts and limits practicality.

Method: Integrates FlowEdit into TRELLIS for localized edits guided by front-view renderings, and introduces Voxel/Slat-Merge strategies that adaptively preserve structural fidelity between edited and unedited areas.

Result: Nano3D achieves superior 3D consistency and visual quality compared to existing methods. Also created Nano3D-Edit-100k, the first large-scale 3D editing dataset with over 100,000 high-quality editing pairs.

Conclusion: The work addresses long-standing challenges in 3D editing algorithms and data availability, improving generality and reliability while laying groundwork for feed-forward 3D editing models.

Abstract: 3D object editing is essential for interactive content creation in gaming,
animation, and robotics, yet current approaches remain inefficient,
inconsistent, and often fail to preserve unedited regions. Most methods rely on
editing multi-view renderings followed by reconstruction, which introduces
artifacts and limits practicality. To address these challenges, we propose
Nano3D, a training-free framework for precise and coherent 3D object editing
without masks. Nano3D integrates FlowEdit into TRELLIS to perform localized
edits guided by front-view renderings, and further introduces region-aware
merging strategies, Voxel/Slat-Merge, which adaptively preserve structural
fidelity by ensuring consistency between edited and unedited areas. Experiments
demonstrate that Nano3D achieves superior 3D consistency and visual quality
compared with existing methods. Based on this framework, we construct the first
large-scale 3D editing datasets Nano3D-Edit-100k, which contains over 100,000
high-quality 3D editing pairs. This work addresses long-standing challenges in
both algorithm design and data availability, significantly improving the
generality and reliability of 3D editing, and laying the groundwork for the
development of feed-forward 3D editing models. Project

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ECHO is a framework for creating image generation benchmarks from real-world social media posts, revealing novel capabilities and better distinguishing model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lag behind emerging capabilities in image generation models and fail to capture real-world user interactions and novel use cases.

Method: Constructed benchmarks directly from social media posts showcasing novel prompts and user judgments, creating a dataset of over 31,000 prompts from GPT-4o Image Gen.

Result: ECHO discovered creative tasks absent from existing benchmarks, better distinguished state-of-the-art models, and surfaced community feedback for designing quality metrics.

Conclusion: ECHO provides a framework for creating timely benchmarks that better reflect real-world model usage and emerging capabilities in image generation.

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation, often driven by proprietary systems like
GPT-4o Image Gen, regularly introduce new capabilities that reshape how users
interact with these models. Existing benchmarks often lag behind and fail to
capture these emerging use cases, leaving a gap between community perceptions
of progress and formal evaluation. To address this, we present ECHO, a
framework for constructing benchmarks directly from real-world evidence of
model use: social media posts that showcase novel prompts and qualitative user
judgments. Applying this framework to GPT-4o Image Gen, we construct a dataset
of over 31,000 prompts curated from such posts. Our analysis shows that ECHO
(1) discovers creative and complex tasks absent from existing benchmarks, such
as re-rendering product labels across languages or generating receipts with
specified totals, (2) more clearly distinguishes state-of-the-art models from
alternatives, and (3) surfaces community feedback that we use to inform the
design of metrics for model quality (e.g., measuring observed shifts in color,
identity, and structure). Our website is at https://echo-bench.github.io.

### [7] [LoRAverse: A Submodular Framework to Retrieve Diverse Adapters for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15022)
*Mert Sonmezer,Matthew Zheng,Pinar Yanardag*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a submodular framework for selecting relevant and diverse LoRA models from large databases to address navigation challenges in diffusion model personalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Users struggle to navigate and select suitable LoRA adapters from over 100K available models due to volume, diversity, and lack of structured organization.

Method: Frames LoRA model selection as a combinatorial optimization problem and introduces a novel submodular framework for selecting relevant and diverse models.

Result: Quantitative and qualitative experiments show the method generates diverse outputs across various domains.

Conclusion: The proposed submodular framework effectively addresses the LoRA model selection challenge by providing relevant and diverse model recommendations.

Abstract: Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) models have revolutionized the personalization of
pre-trained diffusion models by enabling fine-tuning through low-rank,
factorized weight matrices specifically optimized for attention layers. These
models facilitate the generation of highly customized content across a variety
of objects, individuals, and artistic styles without the need for extensive
retraining. Despite the availability of over 100K LoRA adapters on platforms
like Civit.ai, users often face challenges in navigating, selecting, and
effectively utilizing the most suitable adapters due to their sheer volume,
diversity, and lack of structured organization. This paper addresses the
problem of selecting the most relevant and diverse LoRA models from this vast
database by framing the task as a combinatorial optimization problem and
proposing a novel submodular framework. Our quantitative and qualitative
experiments demonstrate that our method generates diverse outputs across a wide
range of domains.

*Mattia Segu,Marta Tintore Gazulla,Yongqin Xian,Luc Van Gool,Federico Tombari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MOBIUS is a family of foundation models for universal instance segmentation designed for efficient edge deployment, reducing computational costs while maintaining state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing foundation models for instance-level perception have high computational costs that limit adoption on resource-constrained platforms like mobile devices.

Method: Proposes three key components: (i) bottleneck pixel decoder for efficient multi-scale and multi-modal fusion, (ii) language-guided uncertainty calibration loss for adaptive decoder pruning, and (iii) streamlined unified training strategy.

Result: Reduces pixel and transformer decoder FLOPs by up to 55% and 75% respectively while maintaining state-of-the-art performance, achieving this in just one-third of training iterations compared to efficient baselines.

Conclusion: MOBIUS establishes a new benchmark for efficient segmentation across both high-performance computing platforms and mobile devices without trading accuracy for reduced complexity.

Abstract: Scaling up model size and training data has advanced foundation models for
instance-level perception, achieving state-of-the-art in-domain and zero-shot
performance across object detection and segmentation. However, their high
computational cost limits adoption on resource-constrained platforms. We first
examine the limitations of existing architectures in enabling efficient edge
deployment without compromising performance. We then introduce MOBIUS, a family
of foundation models for universal instance segmentation, designed for
Pareto-optimal downscaling to support deployment across devices ranging from
high-end accelerators to mobile hardware. To reduce training and inference
demands, we propose: (i) a bottleneck pixel decoder for efficient multi-scale
and multi-modal fusion, (ii) a language-guided uncertainty calibration loss for
adaptive decoder pruning, and (iii) a streamlined, unified training strategy.
Unlike efficient baselines that trade accuracy for reduced complexity, MOBIUS
reduces pixel and transformer decoder FLOPs by up to 55% and 75%, respectively,
while maintaining state-of-the-art performance in just a third of the training
iterations. MOBIUS establishes a new benchmark for efficient segmentation on
both high-performance computing platforms and mobile devices.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COGS is a data-efficient framework that equips MLLMs with advanced reasoning abilities for artificial image domains by decomposing seed questions into primitive factors and systematically recomposing them to generate synthetic training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs lack reasoning capabilities in domains with scarce annotations like charts, documents, and webpages, despite the abundance of such artificial image domains in practice.

Method: Decompose seed questions into perception and reasoning factors, then systematically recompose them with new images to generate synthetic question-answer pairs with subquestions and intermediate answers for reinforcement learning with factor-level process rewards.

Result: COGS substantially improves performance on unseen chart reasoning questions, especially on reasoning-heavy and compositional questions, and enables better transfer across datasets through factor-level mixture training.

Conclusion: The framework induces generalizable reasoning capabilities rather than dataset-specific overfitting and extends beyond charts to other domains like webpages.

Abstract: Pretrained multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong
performance on diverse multimodal tasks, but remain limited in reasoning
capabilities for domains where annotations are difficult to collect. In this
work, we focus on artificial image domains such as charts, rendered documents,
and webpages, which are abundant in practice yet lack large-scale human
annotated reasoning datasets. We introduce COGS (COmposition-Grounded
instruction Synthesis), a data-efficient framework for equipping MLLMs with
advanced reasoning abilities from a small set of seed questions. The key idea
is to decompose each seed question into primitive perception and reasoning
factors, which can then be systematically recomposed with new images to
generate large collections of synthetic question-answer pairs. Each generated
question is paired with subquestions and intermediate answers, enabling
reinforcement learning with factor-level process rewards. Experiments on chart
reasoning show that COGS substantially improves performance on unseen
questions, with the largest gains on reasoning-heavy and compositional
questions. Moreover, training with a factor-level mixture of different seed
data yields better transfer across multiple datasets, suggesting that COGS
induces generalizable capabilities rather than dataset-specific overfitting. We
further demonstrate that the framework extends beyond charts to other domains
such as webpages.

*Yichen Li,Zhiyi Li,Brandon Feng,Dinghuai Zhang,Antonio Torralba*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GDGen is a unified framework that integrates rigid body, articulated body, and soft body dynamics using a potential energy perspective, enabling geometry-agnostic simulation of diverse physical systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop generalist embodied agents in digital twin environments by creating a unified system that can handle various physical dynamics (rigid, articulated, soft bodies) from simple motion observations.

Method: Uses potential energy minimization principle, extends elastodynamics with directional stiffness, employs specialized networks for material properties and neural fields for geometry-agnostic deformation representation.

Result: GDGen robustly unifies diverse simulation paradigms and provides a versatile foundation for interactive virtual environments and robotic agent training.

Conclusion: The framework successfully integrates multiple physical dynamics into a unified system, offering practical applications for digital twins and embodied AI training.

Abstract: Digital twin worlds with realistic interactive dynamics presents a new
opportunity to develop generalist embodied agents in scannable environments
with complex physical behaviors. To this end, we present GDGen (Generalized
Representation for Generalized Dynamics Generation), a framework that takes a
potential energy perspective to seamlessly integrate rigid body, articulated
body, and soft body dynamics into a unified, geometry-agnostic system. GDGen
operates from the governing principle that the potential energy for any stable
physical system should be low. This fresh perspective allows us to treat the
world as one holistic entity and infer underlying physical properties from
simple motion observations. We extend classic elastodynamics by introducing
directional stiffness to capture a broad spectrum of physical behaviors,
covering soft elastic, articulated, and rigid body systems. We propose a
specialized network to model the extended material property and employ a neural
field to represent deformation in a geometry-agnostic manner. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that GDGen robustly unifies diverse simulation
paradigms, offering a versatile foundation for creating interactive virtual
environments and training robotic agents in complex, dynamically rich
scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces COLIPRI, a comprehensive language-image pre-training framework for 3D medical imaging that addresses data scarcity by incorporating report generation objectives and combining vision-language with vision-only pre-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome data limitations in 3D medical vision-language pre-training by leveraging both image-only and paired image-text datasets through additional inductive biases.

Method: Proposed COLIPRI framework that combines report generation objectives with vision-language pre-training and vision-only pre-training, utilizing best practices from 3D medical imaging domain.

Result: COLIPRI encoders achieve state-of-the-art performance in report generation, classification probing, and zero-shot classification, while remaining competitive for semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: Injecting inductive biases through report generation and combined pre-training strategies effectively addresses data scarcity in 3D medical vision-language learning, leading to superior performance across multiple tasks.

Abstract: Vision-language pre-training, i.e., aligning images with paired text, is a
powerful paradigm to create encoders that can be directly used for tasks such
as classification and retrieval, and for downstream tasks such as segmentation
and report generation. In the 3D medical image domain, these capabilities allow
vision-language encoders (VLEs) to support radiologists by retrieving patients
with similar abnormalities or predicting likelihoods of abnormality. While the
methodology holds promise, data availability limits the capabilities of current
3D VLEs.
  In this paper, we alleviate the lack of data by injecting additional
inductive biases: introducing a report generation objective and pairing
vision-language pre-training with vision-only pre-training. This allows us to
leverage both image-only and paired image-text 3D datasets, increasing the
total amount of data to which our model is exposed. Through these additional
inductive biases, paired with best practices of the 3D medical imaging domain,
we develop the Comprehensive Language-image Pre-training (COLIPRI) encoder
family. Our COLIPRI encoders achieve state-of-the-art performance in report
generation, classification probing, and zero-shot classification, and remain
competitive for semantic segmentation.

TL;DR: DRIFT is a lightweight method that transfers reasoning knowledge from text-only LLMs to multimodal models using gradient-space injection, avoiding resource-intensive training while improving multimodal reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal LLMs lag behind text-only counterparts in reasoning ability, and existing methods (supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning) are resource-intensive. Model merging shows inconsistent results across different model families.

Method: DRIFT precomputes a reasoning prior as parameter-space difference between reasoning and multimodal variants, then uses it to bias gradients during multimodal fine-tuning to transfer reasoning knowledge without destabilizing multimodal alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments on MathVista and MathVerse benchmarks show DRIFT consistently improves reasoning performance over naive merging and supervised fine-tuning, matching or surpassing training-heavy methods at much lower cost.

Conclusion: DRIFT provides an efficient alternative to resource-intensive methods for enhancing multimodal reasoning, achieving strong performance through lightweight gradient-space knowledge transfer.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are rapidly advancing, yet their
reasoning ability often lags behind that of strong text-only counterparts.
Existing methods to bridge this gap rely on supervised fine-tuning over
large-scale multimodal reasoning data or reinforcement learning, both of which
are resource-intensive. A promising alternative is model merging, which
interpolates parameters between reasoning-enhanced LLMs and multimodal
variants. However, our analysis shows that naive merging is not always a "free
lunch": its effectiveness varies drastically across model families, with some
(e.g., LLaVA, Idefics) benefiting while others (e.g., Qwen) suffer performance
degradation. To address this, we propose Directional Reasoning Injection for
Fine-Tuning (DRIFT) MLLMs, a lightweight method that transfers reasoning
knowledge in the gradient space, without destabilizing multimodal alignment.
DRIFT precomputes a reasoning prior as the parameter-space difference between
reasoning and multimodal variants, then uses it to bias gradients during
multimodal fine-tuning. This approach preserves the simplicity of standard
supervised fine-tuning pipelines while enabling efficient reasoning transfer.
Extensive experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks, including MathVista
and MathVerse, demonstrate that DRIFT consistently improves reasoning
performance over naive merging and supervised fine-tuning, while matching or
surpassing training-heavy methods at a fraction of the cost.

### [13] [A solution to generalized learning from small training sets found in everyday infant experiences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15060)
*Frangil Ramirez,Elizabeth Clerkin,David J. Crandall,Linda B. Smith*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Infants' visual experiences have a 'lumpy' structure with clusters of similar images that helps them learn object categories efficiently from limited data, and mimicking this structure improves machine learning generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how infants can generalize object categories from limited visual experiences, despite the common belief that large diverse datasets are needed for robust learning.

Method: Analyzed egocentric images from 14 infants (7-11 months old) and conducted computational experiments to test if mimicking infant visual experience structure improves machine learning.

Result: Infant visual input shows lumpy similarity structure with clusters of highly similar images. Computational experiments confirmed this structure improves generalization from small datasets.

Conclusion: The natural lumpiness of infant visual experience supports early category learning and may offer principles for efficient learning across various problems and learners.

Abstract: Young children readily recognize and generalize visual objects labeled by
common nouns, suggesting that these basic level object categories may be given.
Yet if they are, how they arise remains unclear. We propose that the answer
lies in the statistics of infant daily life visual experiences. Whereas large
and diverse datasets typically support robust learning and generalization in
human and machine learning, infants achieve this generalization from limited
experiences. We suggest that the resolution of this apparent contradiction lies
in the visual diversity of daily life, repeated experiences with single object
instances. Analyzing egocentric images from 14 infants (aged 7 to 11 months) we
show that their everyday visual input exhibits a lumpy similarity structure,
with clusters of highly similar images interspersed with rarer, more variable
ones, across eight early-learned categories. Computational experiments show
that mimicking this structure in machines improves generalization from small
datasets in machine learning. The natural lumpiness of infant experience may
thus support early category learning and generalization and, more broadly,
offer principles for efficient learning across a variety of problems and kinds
of learners.

### [14] [SaLon3R: Structure-aware Long-term Generalizable 3D Reconstruction from Unposed Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15072)
*Jiaxin Guo,Tongfan Guan,Wenzhen Dong,Wenzhao Zheng,Wenting Wang,Yue Wang,Yeung Yam,Yun-Hui Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SaLon3R is a novel framework for structure-aware, long-term 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction that eliminates redundancy through anchor primitives and resolves geometric inconsistencies using a 3D Point Transformer, achieving efficient reconstruction of over 50 views at 10+ FPS with 50-90% redundancy removal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting methods predict per-pixel Gaussians and combine all views, leading to substantial redundancies and geometric inconsistencies in long-duration video sequences.

Method: Introduces compact anchor primitives with differentiable saliency-aware Gaussian quantization, coupled with a 3D Point Transformer that refines anchor attributes and saliency to resolve cross-frame inconsistencies. Uses a 3D reconstruction backbone to predict dense Gaussians and saliency maps, then compresses redundant Gaussians into anchors prioritizing high-complexity regions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on novel view synthesis and depth estimation, with 50-90% redundancy removal, reconstruction of over 50 views at over 10 FPS, and superior efficiency, robustness, and generalization for long-term 3D reconstruction.

Conclusion: SaLon3R effectively resolves artifacts and prunes redundant 3DGS in a single feed-forward pass without known camera parameters or test-time optimization, demonstrating significant improvements in efficiency and geometric fidelity for long-term generalizable 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled generalizable,
on-the-fly reconstruction of sequential input views. However, existing methods
often predict per-pixel Gaussians and combine Gaussians from all views as the
scene representation, leading to substantial redundancies and geometric
inconsistencies in long-duration video sequences. To address this, we propose
SaLon3R, a novel framework for Structure-aware, Long-term 3DGS Reconstruction.
To our best knowledge, SaLon3R is the first online generalizable GS method
capable of reconstructing over 50 views in over 10 FPS, with 50% to 90%
redundancy removal. Our method introduces compact anchor primitives to
eliminate redundancy through differentiable saliency-aware Gaussian
quantization, coupled with a 3D Point Transformer that refines anchor
attributes and saliency to resolve cross-frame geometric and photometric
inconsistencies. Specifically, we first leverage a 3D reconstruction backbone
to predict dense per-pixel Gaussians and a saliency map encoding regional
geometric complexity. Redundant Gaussians are compressed into compact anchors
by prioritizing high-complexity regions. The 3D Point Transformer then learns
spatial structural priors in 3D space from training data to refine anchor
attributes and saliency, enabling regionally adaptive Gaussian decoding for
geometric fidelity. Without known camera parameters or test-time optimization,
our approach effectively resolves artifacts and prunes the redundant 3DGS in a
single feed-forward pass. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate our
state-of-the-art performance on both novel view synthesis and depth estimation,

TL;DR: TGT introduces a framework for text-to-video generation using trajectories paired with localized text descriptions, enabling precise control over both appearance and motion of multiple objects through Location-Aware Cross-Attention and dual-CFG scheme.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard text-to-video methods have limited ability to control subject composition, especially in complex multi-object scenarios where existing approaches using bounding boxes or segmentation masks struggle with precision and entity correspondence.

Method: Proposes Text-Grounded Trajectories (TGT) framework with Location-Aware Cross-Attention (LACA) to integrate trajectory and text signals, dual-CFG scheme for separate local/global text guidance, and a data processing pipeline that produces trajectories with localized descriptions from annotated video clips.

Result: TGT achieves higher visual quality, more accurate text alignment, and improved motion controllability compared to prior approaches, enabling intuitive control over multiple objects' appearance and motion.

Conclusion: The TGT framework successfully addresses limitations in multi-object video generation by using text-grounded trajectories as intuitive motion handles, providing precise control over both appearance and motion of visual entities.

Abstract: Text-to-video generation has advanced rapidly in visual fidelity, whereas
standard methods still have limited ability to control the subject composition
of generated scenes. Prior work shows that adding localized text control
signals, such as bounding boxes or segmentation masks, can help. However, these
methods struggle in complex scenarios and degrade in multi-object settings,
offering limited precision and lacking a clear correspondence between
individual trajectories and visual entities as the number of controllable
objects increases. We introduce Text-Grounded Trajectories (TGT), a framework
that conditions video generation on trajectories paired with localized text
descriptions. We propose Location-Aware Cross-Attention (LACA) to integrate
these signals and adopt a dual-CFG scheme to separately modulate local and
global text guidance. In addition, we develop a data processing pipeline that
produces trajectories with localized descriptions of tracked entities, and we
annotate two million high quality video clips to train TGT. Together, these
components enable TGT to use point trajectories as intuitive motion handles,
pairing each trajectory with text to control both appearance and motion.
Extensive experiments show that TGT achieves higher visual quality, more
accurate text alignment, and improved motion controllability compared with
prior approaches. Website: https://textgroundedtraj.github.io.

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework that combines diffusion models as priors with Bayesian inverse problems for medical imaging tasks, enabling robust performance without requiring paired training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between data-driven diffusion models and domain knowledge in medical imaging, addressing limitations of classical mathematical priors that fail to capture complex brain anatomy.

Method: Uses score-based diffusion priors trained on diverse brain MRI data, paired with flexible forward models for tasks like super-resolution, bias field correction, and inpainting.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on heterogeneous clinical and research MRI data, producing consistent high-quality solutions and improving anatomical fidelity of existing deep learning outputs.

Conclusion: Diffusion priors show strong potential as versatile tools for brain MRI analysis, successfully combining data-driven modeling with domain knowledge for robust inverse problem solving.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful generative models in
medical imaging. However, it remains a major challenge to combine these
data-driven models with domain knowledge to guide brain imaging problems. In
neuroimaging, Bayesian inverse problems have long provided a successful
framework for inference tasks, where incorporating domain knowledge of the
imaging process enables robust performance without requiring extensive training
data. However, the anatomical modeling component of these approaches typically
relies on classical mathematical priors that often fail to capture the complex
structure of brain anatomy. In this work, we present the first general-purpose
application of diffusion models as priors for solving a wide range of medical
imaging inverse problems. Our approach leverages a score-based diffusion prior
trained extensively on diverse brain MRI data, paired with flexible forward
models that capture common image processing tasks such as super-resolution,
bias field correction, inpainting, and combinations thereof. We further
demonstrate how our framework can refine outputs from existing deep learning
methods to improve anatomical fidelity. Experiments on heterogeneous clinical
and research MRI data show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance producing consistent, high-quality solutions without requiring
paired training datasets. These results highlight the potential of diffusion
priors as versatile tools for brain MRI analysis.

TL;DR: FFT-MIL enhances WSI classification by adding a frequency-domain branch to capture global dependencies, improving performance across multiple MIL methods and datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MIL methods for WSI classification struggle with capturing global dependencies due to large image sizes and local patch embeddings, limiting robust diagnostic prediction.

Method: Proposes FFT-MIL framework with frequency-domain branch using Fast Fourier Transform to extract low-frequency crops, processed through FFT-Block with convolutional layers and Min-Max normalization, then fused with spatial patch features.

Result: Integration improved macro F1 scores by average 3.51% and AUC by 1.51% across six MIL methods on three datasets (BRACS, LUAD, IMP), showing consistent gains.

Conclusion: Frequency-domain learning effectively captures global dependencies in WSI classification, complementing spatial features and advancing MIL-based computational pathology.

Abstract: Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification relies on Multiple Instance Learning
(MIL) with spatial patch features, yet existing methods struggle to capture
global dependencies due to the immense size of WSIs and the local nature of
patch embeddings. This limitation hinders the modeling of coarse structures
essential for robust diagnostic prediction.
  We propose Fourier Transform Multiple Instance Learning (FFT-MIL), a
framework that augments MIL with a frequency-domain branch to provide compact
global context. Low-frequency crops are extracted from WSIs via the Fast
Fourier Transform and processed through a modular FFT-Block composed of
convolutional layers and Min-Max normalization to mitigate the high variance of
frequency data. The learned global frequency feature is fused with spatial
patch features through lightweight integration strategies, enabling
compatibility with diverse MIL architectures.
  FFT-MIL was evaluated across six state-of-the-art MIL methods on three public
datasets (BRACS, LUAD, and IMP). Integration of the FFT-Block improved macro F1
scores by an average of 3.51% and AUC by 1.51%, demonstrating consistent gains
across architectures and datasets. These results establish frequency-domain
learning as an effective and efficient mechanism for capturing global
dependencies in WSI classification, complementing spatial features and
advancing the scalability and accuracy of MIL-based computational pathology.

TL;DR: XModBench is a tri-modal benchmark for evaluating cross-modal consistency in Omni-modal LLMs, revealing that current models like Gemini 2.5 Pro struggle with modality-invariant reasoning and exhibit significant modality disparities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on general cross-modal QA but don't measure whether OLLMs achieve true modality-invariant reasoning or exhibit modality-specific biases.

Method: Developed XModBench with 60,828 multiple-choice questions spanning 5 task families and systematically covering all 6 modality compositions in question-answer pairs.

Result: Even top models like Gemini 2.5 Pro show: (i) <60% accuracy on spatial/temporal reasoning, (ii) significant performance drops with audio vs text, (iii) directional imbalance with vision as context.

Conclusion: Current OLLMs are far from achieving true modality-invariant reasoning, and XModBench serves as a fundamental diagnostic tool for evaluating and improving cross-modal competence.

Abstract: Omni-modal large language models (OLLMs) aim to unify audio, vision, and text
understanding within a single framework. While existing benchmarks primarily
evaluate general cross-modal question-answering ability, it remains unclear
whether OLLMs achieve modality-invariant reasoning or exhibit modality-specific
biases. We introduce XModBench, a large-scale tri-modal benchmark explicitly
designed to measure cross-modal consistency. XModBench comprises 60,828
multiple-choice questions spanning five task families and systematically covers
all six modality compositions in question-answer pairs, enabling fine-grained
diagnosis of an OLLM's modality-invariant reasoning, modality disparity, and
directional imbalance. Experiments show that even the strongest model, Gemini
2.5 Pro, (i) struggles with spatial and temporal reasoning, achieving less than
60% accuracy, (ii) reveals persistent modality disparities, with performance
dropping substantially when the same semantic content is conveyed through audio
rather than text, and (iii) shows systematic directional imbalance, exhibiting
lower consistency when vision serves as context compared to text. These
findings indicate that current OLLMs remain far from truly modality-invariant
reasoning and position XModBench as a fundamental diagnostic tool for
evaluating and improving cross-modal competence. All data and evaluation tools
will be available at https://xingruiwang.github.io/projects/XModBench/.

TL;DR: UniFilter is a unified multimodal data quality classifier that filters both image-text caption and interleaved document data to improve MLLM pre-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality data filtering for image-text interleaved document data is under-explored in MLLM pre-training, limiting model performance.

Method: Train UniFilter using semi-synthetic approach with raw images and generated text across four quality levels, then apply it to filter DataComp captions and OBELICS interleaved data.

Result: MLLMs pre-trained on UniFilter-filtered data show enhanced zero-shot reasoning, in-context learning, and better performance on various benchmarks after fine-tuning.

Conclusion: UniFilter effectively improves multimodal data quality for MLLM pre-training, leading to stronger downstream performance, with released resources for community use.

Abstract: The Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are continually pre-trained on a
mixture of image-text caption data and interleaved document data, while the
high-quality data filtering towards image-text interleaved document data is
under-explored. We propose to train an efficient MLLM as a Unified Mulitmodal
Data Quality Classifier to Filter both high-quality image-text caption and
interleaved data (UniFilter). To address the challenge of collecting diverse
labeled multimodal data, we introduce a semi-synthetic approach that leverages
readily available raw images and generates corresponding text across four
quality levels. This method enables efficient creation of sample-score pairs
for both caption and interleaved document data to train UniFilter. We apply
UniFilter to curate high-quality caption data from DataComp caption dataset and
interleaved data from the OBELICS image-text interleaved dataset. MLLMs
pre-trained on the filtered data demonstrate significantly enhanced
capabilities compared to those trained on baseline-filtered data, achieving
stronger zero-shot reasoning and in-context learning capabilities. After visual
supervised fine-tuning, these UniFilter-induced MLLMs achieve stronger
performance on various benchmarks, highlighting the downstream benefits of
high-quality multimodal pre-training. We release the synthetic training data
used for training UniFilter, the UniFilter model checkpoints, and the
high-quality interleaved document subset OBELICS-HQ, curated by UniFilter, to
the community for reproduction and further development.

Motivation: Reproducibility remains a critical challenge in foundation model training for histopathology, hindered by software randomness, hardware non-determinism, and inconsistent hyperparameter reporting.

Method: Trained a CLIP model on QUILT-1M dataset and systematically evaluated the impact of different hyperparameter settings and augmentation strategies across three downstream histopathology datasets (PatchCamelyon, LC25000-Lung, and LC25000-Colon).

Result: Identified clear trends: RandomResizedCrop values of 0.7-0.8 performed best, distributed training without local loss improved stability, learning rates below 5.0e-5 degraded performance, and LC25000 (Colon) dataset provided the most reproducible benchmark.

Conclusion: Reproducibility in computational pathology depends on both transparent documentation and carefully chosen experimental configurations, with practical rules provided to guide future reproducible foundation model development for digital pathology.

Abstract: Reproducibility remains a critical challenge in foundation model training for
histopathology, often hindered by software randomness, hardware
non-determinism, and inconsistent hyperparameter reporting. To investigate
these issues, we trained a CLIP model on the QUILT-1M dataset and
systematically evaluated the impact of different hyperparameter settings and
augmentation strategies across three downstream histopathology datasets
(PatchCamelyon, LC25000-Lung, and LC25000-Colon). Despite variability across
runs, we identified clear trends: RandomResizedCrop values of 0.7-0.8
outperformed more aggressive (0.6) or conservative (0.9) settings, distributed
training without local loss improved stability, and learning rates below 5.0e-5
consistently degraded performance across all datasets. The LC25000 (Colon)
dataset consistently provided the most reproducible benchmark. These findings
highlight that reproducibility in computational pathology depends not only on
transparent documentation but also on carefully chosen experimental

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative data augmentation methods struggle to preserve essential image details while aligning with varied text prompts due to entanglement with non-essential input attributes.

Method: Proposes a framework using salient concept-aware image embedding model to reduce influence of irrelevant visual details during synthesis, maintaining intuitive image-text alignment.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art augmentation methods across eight fine-grained vision datasets with 0.73% and 6.5% accuracy improvements under conventional and long-tail settings.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances training dataset diversity and improves downstream model robustness by preserving class-discriminative features with controlled variations.

Abstract: Recent generative data augmentation methods conditioned on both image and
text prompts struggle to balance between fidelity and diversity, as it is
challenging to preserve essential image details while aligning with varied text
prompts. This challenge arises because representations in the synthesis process
often become entangled with non-essential input image attributes such as
environmental contexts, creating conflicts with text prompts intended to modify
these elements. To address this, we propose a personalized image generation
framework that uses a salient concept-aware image embedding model to reduce the
influence of irrelevant visual details during the synthesis process, thereby
maintaining intuitive alignment between image and text inputs. By generating
images that better preserve class-discriminative features with additional
controlled variations, our framework effectively enhances the diversity of
training datasets and thereby improves the robustness of downstream models. Our
approach demonstrates superior performance across eight fine-grained vision
datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art augmentation methods with averaged
classification accuracy improvements by 0.73% and 6.5% under conventional and
long-tail settings, respectively.

Motivation: Prenatal CHD diagnosis faces challenges with imbalanced, low-quality datasets and lack of multimodal integration, limiting AI model performance and clinical decision support.

Method: Proposed a robust multimodal transformer architecture with cross-attention mechanism to fuse feature representations from image (ultrasound/echocardiographic) and tabular (clinical records) data.

Result: Achieved 11% improvement over image-only and 50% improvement over tabular-only approaches, with F1 score of 79.8 ± 4.8% on the CARDIUM dataset.

Conclusion: The CARDIUM dataset and multimodal approach significantly enhance prenatal CHD detection, with publicly released resources to advance research in this field.

Abstract: Prenatal diagnosis of Congenital Heart Diseases (CHDs) holds great potential
for Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven solutions. However, collecting
high-quality diagnostic data remains difficult due to the rarity of these
conditions, resulting in imbalanced and low-quality datasets that hinder model
performance. Moreover, no public efforts have been made to integrate multiple
sources of information, such as imaging and clinical data, further limiting the
ability of AI models to support and enhance clinical decision-making. To
overcome these challenges, we introduce the Congenital Anomaly Recognition with
Diagnostic Images and Unified Medical records (CARDIUM) dataset, the first
publicly available multimodal dataset consolidating fetal ultrasound and
echocardiographic images along with maternal clinical records for prenatal CHD
detection. Furthermore, we propose a robust multimodal transformer architecture
that incorporates a cross-attention mechanism to fuse feature representations
from image and tabular data, improving CHD detection by 11% and 50% over image
and tabular single-modality approaches, respectively, and achieving an F1 score
of 79.8 $\pm$ 4.8% in the CARDIUM dataset. We will publicly release our dataset

Conclusion: DriveGen3D successfully addresses limitations of existing methods by integrating accelerated video generation with dynamic 3D reconstruction, enabling high-quality controllable driving scene synthesis with computational efficiency.

Abstract: We present DriveGen3D, a novel framework for generating high-quality and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard MRI analysis tools fail with large lesions like tumors, so inpainting is needed to synthesize healthy tissues in tumor areas to enable reliable use of general-purpose segmentation and registration pipelines.

Method: Combines model ensembling with post-processing strategies (median filtering, histogram matching, pixel averaging) and adds a lightweight U-Net enhancement stage for anatomical refinement.

Result: The proposed pipeline improves anatomical plausibility and visual fidelity of inpainted regions, yielding higher accuracy and more robust outcomes than individual baseline models.

Conclusion: By combining established models with targeted post-processing, the approach achieves improved and more accessible inpainting outcomes, supporting broader clinical deployment and sustainable research.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the primary imaging modality used in the
diagnosis, assessment, and treatment planning for brain pathologies. However,
most automated MRI analysis tools, such as segmentation and registration
pipelines, are optimized for healthy anatomies and often fail when confronted
with large lesions such as tumors. To overcome this, image inpainting
techniques aim to locally synthesize healthy brain tissues in tumor regions,
enabling the reliable application of general-purpose tools. In this work, we
systematically evaluate state-of-the-art inpainting models and observe a
saturation in their standalone performance. In response, we introduce a
methodology combining model ensembling with efficient post-processing
strategies such as median filtering, histogram matching, and pixel averaging.
Further anatomical refinement is achieved via a lightweight U-Net enhancement
stage. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that our proposed pipeline
improves the anatomical plausibility and visual fidelity of inpainted regions,
yielding higher accuracy and more robust outcomes than individual baseline
models. By combining established models with targeted post-processing, we
achieve improved and more accessible inpainting outcomes, supporting broader

TL;DR: QCFace introduces a hard margin strategy to decouple recognizability from identity representation in face recognition, overcoming mutual overlapping gradient problems and achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current face recognition methods have limitations: recognizability is only partially captured through soft margin constraints, leading to weaker quality representation and lower discrimination for low-quality faces, and mutual overlapping gradients cause instability and entangled representations.

Method: Proposes Quality Control Face (QCFace) - a hard margin strategy that enables clear decoupling of recognizability from identity representation. Uses a novel hard-margin-based loss function with guidance factor for hypersphere planning to simultaneously optimize recognition ability and explicit recognizability representation.

Result: Extensive experiments confirm QCFace provides robust and quantifiable recognizability encoding and achieves state-of-the-art performance in both verification and identification benchmarks compared to existing recognizability-based losses.

Conclusion: QCFace effectively addresses the limitations of current methods by introducing a hard margin strategy that decouples recognizability from identity, leading to improved performance and more stable optimization in face recognition systems.

Abstract: Recognizability, a key perceptual factor in human face processing, strongly
affects the performance of face recognition (FR) systems in both verification
and identification tasks. Effectively using recognizability to enhance feature
representation remains challenging. In deep FR, the loss function plays a
crucial role in shaping how features are embedded. However, current methods
have two main drawbacks: (i) recognizability is only partially captured through
soft margin constraints, resulting in weaker quality representation and lower
discrimination, especially for low-quality or ambiguous faces; (ii) mutual
overlapping gradients between feature direction and magnitude introduce
undesirable interactions during optimization, causing instability and confusion
in hypersphere planning, which may result in poor generalization, and entangled
representations where recognizability and identity are not cleanly separated.
To address these issues, we introduce a hard margin strategy - Quality Control
Face (QCFace), which overcomes the mutual overlapping gradient problem and
enables the clear decoupling of recognizability from identity representation.
Based on this strategy, a novel hard-margin-based loss function employs a
guidance factor for hypersphere planning, simultaneously optimizing for
recognition ability and explicit recognizability representation. Extensive
experiments confirm that QCFace not only provides robust and quantifiable
recognizability encoding but also achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
verification and identification benchmarks compared to existing
recognizability-based losses.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a hyperbolic classification framework for Single Positive Multi-Label Learning (SPMLL) using hyperbolic balls to model label relationships, achieving competitive performance with improved interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses limitations in SPMLL where training samples have only one positive label despite multiple categories, and existing methods lack explicit geometric definitions for different relationship types.

Method: Represents each label as a hyperbolic ball to model relationships through geometric interactions (inclusion, overlap, separation), with temperature-adaptive hyperbolic ball classifier and physics-inspired double-well regularization.

Result: Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (MS-COCO, PASCAL VOC, NUS-WIDE, CUB-200-2011) show competitive performance with superior interpretability, and statistical analysis reveals strong correlation with real-world co-occurrence patterns.

Conclusion: Establishes hyperbolic geometry as a more robust paradigm for structured classification under incomplete supervision, enabling rich inter-label relationship modeling.

Abstract: Single Positive Multi-Label Learning (SPMLL) addresses the challenging
scenario where each training sample is annotated with only one positive label
despite potentially belonging to multiple categories, making it difficult to
capture complex label relationships and hierarchical structures. While existing
methods implicitly model label relationships through distance-based similarity,
lacking explicit geometric definitions for different relationship types. To
address these limitations, we propose the first hyperbolic classification
framework for SPMLL that represents each label as a hyperbolic ball rather than
a point or vector, enabling rich inter-label relationship modeling through
geometric ball interactions. Our ball-based approach naturally captures
multiple relationship types simultaneously: inclusion for hierarchical
structures, overlap for co-occurrence patterns, and separation for semantic
independence. Further, we introduce two key component innovations: a
temperature-adaptive hyperbolic ball classifier and a physics-inspired
double-well regularization that guides balls toward meaningful configurations.
To validate our approach, extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets
(MS-COCO, PASCAL VOC, NUS-WIDE, CUB-200-2011) demonstrate competitive
performance with superior interpretability compared to existing methods.
Furthermore, statistical analysis reveals strong correlation between learned
embeddings and real-world co-occurrence patterns, establishing hyperbolic
geometry as a more robust paradigm for structured classification under
incomplete supervision.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SVG introduces a VAE-free latent diffusion model using self-supervised DINO features for more efficient training, faster inference, and better semantic structure in visual generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VAE+diffusion models suffer from limited training efficiency, slow inference, and poor transferability due to VAE latent spaces lacking clear semantic separation and discriminative structure.

Method: SVG constructs a semantically structured latent space using frozen DINO features for clear semantic discriminability, with a lightweight residual branch capturing fine details. Diffusion models are trained directly on this space.

Result: SVG enables accelerated diffusion training, supports few-step sampling, improves generative quality, and preserves semantic capabilities of self-supervised representations.

Conclusion: SVG provides a principled pathway toward task-general, high-quality visual representations by leveraging semantically structured latent spaces without VAEs.

Abstract: Recent progress in diffusion-based visual generation has largely relied on
latent diffusion models with variational autoencoders (VAEs). While effective
for high-fidelity synthesis, this VAE+diffusion paradigm suffers from limited
training efficiency, slow inference, and poor transferability to broader vision
tasks. These issues stem from a key limitation of VAE latent spaces: the lack
of clear semantic separation and strong discriminative structure. Our analysis
confirms that these properties are crucial not only for perception and
understanding tasks, but also for the stable and efficient training of latent
diffusion models. Motivated by this insight, we introduce SVG, a novel latent
diffusion model without variational autoencoders, which leverages
self-supervised representations for visual generation. SVG constructs a feature
space with clear semantic discriminability by leveraging frozen DINO features,
while a lightweight residual branch captures fine-grained details for
high-fidelity reconstruction. Diffusion models are trained directly on this
semantically structured latent space to facilitate more efficient learning. As
a result, SVG enables accelerated diffusion training, supports few-step
sampling, and improves generative quality. Experimental results further show
that SVG preserves the semantic and discriminative capabilities of the
underlying self-supervised representations, providing a principled pathway
toward task-general, high-quality visual representations.

*Fei Wang,Li Shen,Liang Ding,Chao Xue,Ye Liu,Changxing Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoMe is a progressive layer pruning framework that uses concatenation-based merging and hierarchical distillation to reduce LLM size while maintaining performance, achieving 83% accuracy retention when pruning 30% of LLaMA-2-7b parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing structured pruning methods that cause performance degradation, use incompetent weight aggregation, and lack effective post-training recovery mechanisms for LLMs.

Method: Progressive layer pruning with channel sensitivity metric using activation intensity and weight norms, concatenation-based layer merging to fuse critical channels across adjacent layers, and hierarchical distillation for knowledge transfer.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on seven benchmarks; pruned model retains 83% of original average accuracy when removing 30% of LLaMA-2-7b parameters.

Conclusion: CoMe effectively reduces LLM size while preserving capabilities through progressive pruning, concatenation-based merging, and hierarchical distillation, outperforming existing structured pruning methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models excel at natural language processing tasks, but their
massive size leads to high computational and storage demands. Recent works have
sought to reduce their model size through layer-wise structured pruning.
However, they tend to ignore retaining the capabilities in the pruned part. In
this work, we re-examine structured pruning paradigms and uncover several key
limitations: 1) notable performance degradation due to direct layer removal, 2)
incompetent linear weight layer aggregation, and 3) the lack of effective
post-training recovery mechanisms. To address these limitations, we propose
CoMe, including a progressive layer pruning framework with a
Concatenation-based Merging technology and a hierarchical distillation
post-training process. Specifically, we introduce a channel sensitivity metric
that utilizes activation intensity and weight norms for fine-grained channel
selection. Subsequently, we employ a concatenation-based layer merging method
to fuse the most critical channels across adjacent layers, enabling progressive
model size reduction. Finally, we propose a hierarchical distillation protocol
that leverages the correspondences between the original and pruned model layers
established during pruning, thereby enabling efficient knowledge transfer.
Experiments on seven benchmarks show that CoMe achieves state-of-the-art
performance; when pruning 30% of LLaMA-2-7b's parameters, the pruned model
retains 83% of its original average accuracy. Our code is available at

*Shengkai Hu,Haozhe Qi,Jun Wan,Jiaxing Huang,Lefei Zhang,Hang Sun,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proto-Former is a unified facial landmark detection framework that enables joint training across multiple datasets with different landmark definitions through prototype learning and adaptive architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing facial landmark detection methods are limited to single-dataset training due to different landmark definitions across datasets, which hinders model generalization and unified model development.

Method: Proto-Former uses an Adaptive Prototype-Aware Encoder (APAE) for feature extraction and prototype learning, and a Progressive Prototype-Aware Decoder (PPAD) that refines prototypes to generate attention prompts. It also employs a Prototype-Aware (PA) loss to stabilize prototype expert selection during multi-dataset training.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that Proto-Former achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating effective generalization across different datasets.

Conclusion: Proto-Former successfully addresses the limitations of single-dataset training in facial landmark detection by enabling joint training across multiple datasets through prototype learning and adaptive architecture, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved facial landmark
detection. However, existing facial landmark detection datasets often define
different numbers of landmarks, and most mainstream methods can only be trained
on a single dataset. This limits the model generalization to different datasets
and hinders the development of a unified model. To address this issue, we
propose Proto-Former, a unified, adaptive, end-to-end facial landmark detection
framework that explicitly enhances dataset-specific facial structural
representations (i.e., prototype). Proto-Former overcomes the limitations of
single-dataset training by enabling joint training across multiple datasets
within a unified architecture. Specifically, Proto-Former comprises two key
components: an Adaptive Prototype-Aware Encoder (APAE) that performs adaptive
feature extraction and learns prototype representations, and a Progressive
Prototype-Aware Decoder (PPAD) that refines these prototypes to generate
prompts that guide the model's attention to key facial regions. Furthermore, we
introduce a novel Prototype-Aware (PA) loss, which achieves optimal path
finding by constraining the selection weights of prototype experts. This loss
function effectively resolves the problem of prototype expert addressing
instability during multi-dataset training, alleviates gradient conflicts, and
enables the extraction of more accurate facial structure features. Extensive
experiments on widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that our Proto-Former
achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

*Joshua Li,Brendan Chharawala,Chang Shu,Xue Bin Peng,Pengcheng Xi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SHARE is a method that uses scene geometry to accurately ground 3D human motion reconstruction from monocular RGB videos, improving human placement in 3D space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current human motion reconstruction methods struggle with accurately placing humans in 3D space, which is important for realistic character interactions in gaming, AR/VR, and robotics.

Method: SHARE estimates human meshes and segmentation masks for every frame, uses scene point maps at keyframes, and iteratively refines human positions by comparing human meshes against human point maps extracted using masks, while preserving relative root joint positions.

Result: SHARE enables more accurate 3D human placement while reconstructing the surrounding scene, and outperforms existing methods in extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The approach facilitates accurate human motion reconstruction for both curated datasets and in-the-wild web videos.

Abstract: Animating realistic character interactions with the surrounding environment
is important for autonomous agents in gaming, AR/VR, and robotics. However,
current methods for human motion reconstruction struggle with accurately
placing humans in 3D space. We introduce Scene-Human Aligned REconstruction
(SHARE), a technique that leverages the scene geometry's inherent spatial cues
to accurately ground human motion reconstruction. Each reconstruction relies
solely on a monocular RGB video from a stationary camera. SHARE first estimates
a human mesh and segmentation mask for every frame, alongside a scene point map
at keyframes. It iteratively refines the human's positions at these keyframes
by comparing the human mesh against the human point map extracted from the
scene using the mask. Crucially, we also ensure that non-keyframe human meshes
remain consistent by preserving their relative root joint positions to keyframe
root joints during optimization. Our approach enables more accurate 3D human
placement while reconstructing the surrounding scene, facilitating use cases on
both curated datasets and in-the-wild web videos. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SHARE outperforms existing methods.

*Shuntaro Suzuki,Shunya Nagashima,Masayuki Hirata,Komei Sugiura*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cortical-SSM is a novel deep state space model that captures integrated dependencies across temporal, spatial, and frequency domains for EEG/ECoG motor imagery classification, outperforming baselines on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG/ECoG signals for motor imagery classification have applications in communication assistance and rehabilitation, but face challenges from physiological artifacts and limitations of Transformer models in capturing fine-grained dependencies.

Method: Proposed Cortical-SSM architecture that extends deep state space models to capture integrated dependencies across temporal, spatial, and frequency domains of EEG/ECoG signals.

Result: Outperformed baseline methods on three benchmarks: two large-scale public MI EEG datasets (>50 subjects) and a clinical MI ECoG dataset from an ALS patient. Visual explanations show the model captures neurophysiologically relevant regions.

Conclusion: Cortical-SSM effectively addresses limitations of existing approaches by capturing comprehensive dependencies in EEG/ECoG signals, demonstrating superior performance and neurophysiological relevance.

Abstract: Classification of electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocorticogram (ECoG)
signals obtained during motor imagery (MI) has substantial application
potential, including for communication assistance and rehabilitation support
for patients with motor impairments. These signals remain inherently
susceptible to physiological artifacts (e.g., eye blinking, swallowing), which
pose persistent challenges. Although Transformer-based approaches for
classifying EEG and ECoG signals have been widely adopted, they often struggle
to capture fine-grained dependencies within them. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Cortical-SSM, a novel architecture that extends deep
state space models to capture integrated dependencies of EEG and ECoG signals
across temporal, spatial, and frequency domains. We validated our method across
three benchmarks: 1) two large-scale public MI EEG datasets containing more
than 50 subjects, and 2) a clinical MI ECoG dataset recorded from a patient
with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Our method outperformed baseline methods on
the three benchmarks. Furthermore, visual explanations derived from our model
indicate that it effectively captures neurophysiologically relevant regions of
both EEG and ECoG signals.

*Ana Davila,Jacinto Colan,Yasuhisa Hasegawa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel staged adaptive fine-tuning approach for surgical tool detection that uses linear probing and gradual freezing to improve efficiency and performance with limited annotated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited availability of annotated surgical data makes it challenging to train robust deep learning models for automated surgical tool detection in minimally invasive surgery.

Method: Two-step approach: linear probing to condition classification layers on pre-trained CNNs, followed by gradual freezing to dynamically reduce fine-tunable layers. Uses ResNet-50 and DenseNet-121 pre-trained on ImageNet.

Result: Achieved 96.4% mAP on Cholec80 dataset, outperforming existing approaches. Method also generalized well to CATARACTS dataset for ophthalmic surgery.

Conclusion: Gradual freezing fine-tuning is a promising technique for improving tool detection in diverse surgical procedures and has broader applications in general image classification.

Abstract: Minimally invasive surgery can benefit significantly from automated surgical
tool detection, enabling advanced analysis and assistance. However, the limited
availability of annotated data in surgical settings poses a challenge for
training robust deep learning models. This paper introduces a novel staged
adaptive fine-tuning approach consisting of two steps: a linear probing stage
to condition additional classification layers on a pre-trained CNN-based
architecture and a gradual freezing stage to dynamically reduce the
fine-tunable layers, aiming to regulate adaptation to the surgical domain. This
strategy reduces network complexity and improves efficiency, requiring only a
single training loop and eliminating the need for multiple iterations. We
validated our method on the Cholec80 dataset, employing CNN architectures
(ResNet-50 and DenseNet-121) pre-trained on ImageNet for detecting surgical
tools in cholecystectomy endoscopic videos. Our results demonstrate that our
method improves detection performance compared to existing approaches and
established fine-tuning techniques, achieving a mean average precision (mAP) of
96.4%. To assess its broader applicability, the generalizability of the
fine-tuning strategy was further confirmed on the CATARACTS dataset, a distinct
domain of minimally invasive ophthalmic surgery. These findings suggest that
gradual freezing fine-tuning is a promising technique for improving tool
presence detection in diverse surgical procedures and may have broader
applications in general image classification tasks.

*Haisheng Su,Junjie Zhang,Feixiang Song,Sanping Zhou,Wei Wu,Nanning Zheng,Junchi Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreqPDE introduces frequency-aware depth embedding to enhance 3D object detection from multi-view 2D images by addressing depth discontinuity and cross-view consistency issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods rely on depth prediction with LiDAR supervision but suffer from depth discontinuity at object boundaries, poor detection of small objects, and lack cross-view consistency and scale invariance.

Method: Three main modules: Frequency-aware Spatial Pyramid Encoder (FSPE) for feature pyramid construction, Cross-view Scale-invariant Depth Predictor (CSDP) for pixel-level depth estimation, and Positional Depth Encoder (PDE) for generating 3D depth-aware features with hybrid depth supervision.

Result: Extensive experiments on nuScenes dataset demonstrate the method's effectiveness and superiority in 3D object detection.

Conclusion: FreqPDE successfully addresses depth quality issues and improves 3D detection performance by incorporating frequency-aware features and cross-view consistency mechanisms.

Abstract: Detecting 3D objects accurately from multi-view 2D images is a challenging
yet essential task in the field of autonomous driving. Current methods resort
to integrating depth prediction to recover the spatial information for object
query decoding, which necessitates explicit supervision from LiDAR points
during the training phase. However, the predicted depth quality is still
unsatisfactory such as depth discontinuity of object boundaries and
indistinction of small objects, which are mainly caused by the sparse
supervision of projected points and the use of high-level image features for
depth prediction. Besides, cross-view consistency and scale invariance are also
overlooked in previous methods. In this paper, we introduce Frequency-aware
Positional Depth Embedding (FreqPDE) to equip 2D image features with spatial
information for 3D detection transformer decoder, which can be obtained through
three main modules. Specifically, the Frequency-aware Spatial Pyramid Encoder
(FSPE) constructs a feature pyramid by combining high-frequency edge clues and
low-frequency semantics from different levels respectively. Then the Cross-view
Scale-invariant Depth Predictor (CSDP) estimates the pixel-level depth
distribution with cross-view and efficient channel attention mechanism.
Finally, the Positional Depth Encoder (PDE) combines the 2D image features and
3D position embeddings to generate the 3D depth-aware features for query
decoding. Additionally, hybrid depth supervision is adopted for complementary
depth learning from both metric and distribution aspects. Extensive experiments
conducted on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority
of our proposed method.

*Ting-Yu Yen,Yu-Sheng Chiu,Shih-Hsuan Hung,Peter Wonka,Hung-Kuo Chu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PFGS is a pose-aware 3D Gaussian Splatting framework that reconstructs complete 3D objects from multi-pose images by iteratively fusing auxiliary pose views into a unified main pose representation using global and local registration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGS methods assume static single-pose captures, leading to incomplete reconstructions that miss occluded regions. PFGS addresses the practical need for complete object reconstruction from multi-pose image captures.

Method: PFGS iteratively fuses auxiliary pose images into a unified 3DGS representation of the main pose using pose-aware fusion strategy with global and local registration. It leverages background features for per-pose camera pose estimation and foundation models for cross-pose registration.

Result: PFGS consistently outperforms strong baselines in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, producing more complete reconstructions and higher-fidelity 3DGS models.

Conclusion: PFGS successfully overcomes limitations of existing methods by intelligently incorporating 3D foundation models into the registration process, resolving background inconsistency issues and enabling complete object reconstruction from multi-pose captures.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled high-quality,
real-time novel-view synthesis from multi-view images. However, most existing
methods assume the object is captured in a single, static pose, resulting in
incomplete reconstructions that miss occluded or self-occluded regions. We
introduce PFGS, a pose-aware 3DGS framework that addresses the practical
challenge of reconstructing complete objects from multi-pose image captures.
Given images of an object in one main pose and several auxiliary poses, PFGS
iteratively fuses each auxiliary set into a unified 3DGS representation of the
main pose. Our pose-aware fusion strategy combines global and local
registration to merge views effectively and refine the 3DGS model. While recent
advances in 3D foundation models have improved registration robustness and
efficiency, they remain limited by high memory demands and suboptimal accuracy.
PFGS overcomes these challenges by incorporating them more intelligently into
the registration process: it leverages background features for per-pose camera
pose estimation and employs foundation models for cross-pose registration. This
design captures the best of both approaches while resolving background
inconsistency issues. Experimental results demonstrate that PFGS consistently
outperforms strong baselines in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations,
producing more complete reconstructions and higher-fidelity 3DGS models.

*Peng Ren,Hai Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LILAC enables real-time, long-sequence human motion stylization using a streaming VAE-Diffusion architecture with causal decoding, achieving smooth transitions without future frame dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing streaming motion generation methods suffer from computational overhead and temporal instability, while high-quality VAE-Diffusion approaches are limited to offline processing.

Method: Extends offline VAE-Diffusion framework to online setting using latent-space streaming architecture with sliding-window causal design and decoded motion feature injection for smooth transitions.

Result: Achieves real-time arbitrary motion stylization with favorable balance between quality and responsiveness, demonstrated on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: LILAC successfully bridges the gap between offline quality and real-time performance for motion stylization through causal streaming architecture.

Abstract: Generating long and stylized human motions in real time is critical for
applications that demand continuous and responsive character control. Despite
its importance, existing streaming approaches often operate directly in the raw
motion space, leading to substantial computational overhead and making it
difficult to maintain temporal stability. In contrast, latent-space
VAE-Diffusion-based frameworks alleviate these issues and achieve high-quality
stylization, but they are generally confined to offline processing. To bridge
this gap, LILAC (Long-sequence Incremental Low-latency Arbitrary Motion
Stylization via Streaming VAE-Diffusion with Causal Decoding) builds upon a
recent high-performing offline framework for arbitrary motion stylization and
extends it to an online setting through a latent-space streaming architecture
with a sliding-window causal design and the injection of decoded motion
features to ensure smooth motion transitions. This architecture enables
long-sequence real-time arbitrary stylization without relying on future frames
or modifying the diffusion model architecture, achieving a favorable balance
between stylization quality and responsiveness as demonstrated by experiments
on benchmark datasets. Supplementary video and examples are available at the

TL;DR: Proposes a unified framework for underwater open-vocabulary instance segmentation to address visual degradation and semantic misalignment in marine environments, outperforming existing methods on the new MARIS benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing underwater instance segmentation approaches are limited to close-vocabulary prediction and cannot recognize novel marine categories. Transfer from natural images to underwater scenes suffers from severe visual degradation (color attenuation) and semantic misalignment due to lack of underwater class definitions.

Method: A unified framework with two components: Geometric Prior Enhancement Module (GPEM) that leverages stable part-level and structural cues to maintain object consistency under degraded visual conditions, and Semantic Alignment Injection Mechanism (SAIM) that enriches language embeddings with domain-specific priors to mitigate semantic ambiguity.

Result: The framework consistently outperforms existing open-vocabulary baselines in both In-Domain and Cross-Domain settings on the MARIS benchmark, establishing a strong foundation for future underwater perception research.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses the challenges of underwater open-vocabulary instance segmentation by combining geometric priors and semantic alignment mechanisms, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Most existing underwater instance segmentation approaches are constrained by
close-vocabulary prediction, limiting their ability to recognize novel marine
categories. To support evaluation, we introduce \textbf{MARIS}
(\underline{Mar}ine Open-Vocabulary \underline{I}nstance
\underline{S}egmentation), the first large-scale fine-grained benchmark for
underwater Open-Vocabulary (OV) segmentation, featuring a limited set of seen
categories and diverse unseen categories. Although OV segmentation has shown
promise on natural images, our analysis reveals that transfer to underwater
scenes suffers from severe visual degradation (e.g., color attenuation) and
semantic misalignment caused by lack underwater class definitions. To address
these issues, we propose a unified framework with two complementary components.
The Geometric Prior Enhancement Module (\textbf{GPEM}) leverages stable
part-level and structural cues to maintain object consistency under degraded
visual conditions. The Semantic Alignment Injection Mechanism (\textbf{SAIM})
enriches language embeddings with domain-specific priors, mitigating semantic
ambiguity and improving recognition of unseen categories. Experiments show that
our framework consistently outperforms existing OV baselines both In-Domain and
Cross-Domain setting on MARIS, establishing a strong foundation for future
underwater perception research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical adoption of multi-shot DWI is limited by severe motion-induced phase artifacts from respiration and peristalsis, compounded by multi-organ, multi-slice, multi-direction and multi-b-value complexities.

Method: Models inter-shot phase variations as high-order Locally Smooth Phase (LoSP) integrated into low-rank Hankel matrix reconstruction. The algorithm's rank parameter is automatically set via prompt learning trained exclusively on synthetic abdominal DWI data emulating physiological motion.

Conclusion: Eliminates navigator signals and realistic data supervision, providing interpretable, robust solution for high-resolution multi-organ multi-shot DWI with scanner-agnostic performance, signifying transformative potential for precision oncology.

Abstract: Clinical adoption of multi-shot diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging
(multi-shot DWI) for body-wide tumor diagnostics is limited by severe
motion-induced phase artifacts from respiration, peristalsis, and so on,
compounded by multi-organ, multi-slice, multi-direction and multi-b-value
complexities. Here, we introduce a reconstruction framework, LoSP-Prompt, that
overcomes these challenges through physics-informed modeling and
synthetic-data-driven prompt learning. We model inter-shot phase variations as
a high-order Locally Smooth Phase (LoSP), integrated into a low-rank Hankel
matrix reconstruction. Crucially, the algorithm's rank parameter is
automatically set via prompt learning trained exclusively on synthetic
abdominal DWI data emulating physiological motion. Validated across 10,000+
clinical images (43 subjects, 4 scanner models, 5 centers), LoSP-Prompt: (1)
Achieved twice the spatial resolution of clinical single-shot DWI, enhancing
liver lesion conspicuity; (2) Generalized to seven diverse anatomical regions
(liver, kidney, sacroiliac, pelvis, knee, spinal cord, brain) with a single

suppression, and noise reduction (11 radiologists' evaluations on a 5-point
scale, $p<0.05$), achieving 4-5 points (excellent) on kidney DWI, 4 points
(good to excellent) on liver, sacroiliac and spinal cord DWI, and 3-4 points
(good) on knee and tumor brain. The approach eliminates navigator signals and
realistic data supervision, providing an interpretable, robust solution for
high-resolution multi-organ multi-shot DWI. Its scanner-agnostic performance
signifies transformative potential for precision oncology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Learning to Detect (LoD) is a framework that improves jailbreak attack detection in Large Vision-Language Models by focusing on task-specific learning rather than attack-specific learning, achieving better generalization to unknown attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing jailbreak detection methods for LVLMs either lack generalization to unseen attacks (attack-specific learning) or have limited accuracy and efficiency (heuristic approaches).

Method: LoD uses a Multi-modal Safety Concept Activation Vector module for safety-oriented representation learning and a Safety Pattern Auto-Encoder module for unsupervised attack classification, shifting from attack-specific to task-specific learning.

Result: Extensive experiments show consistently higher detection AUROC on diverse unknown attacks while improving efficiency compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed LoD framework effectively addresses jailbreak vulnerability in LVLMs by providing generalized detection capabilities for unknown attacks through task-specific learning approach.

Abstract: Despite extensive alignment efforts, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, posing serious safety risks. To address
this, existing detection methods either learn attack-specific parameters, which
hinders generalization to unseen attacks, or rely on heuristically sound
principles, which limit accuracy and efficiency. To overcome these limitations,
we propose Learning to Detect (LoD), a general framework that accurately
detects unknown jailbreak attacks by shifting the focus from attack-specific
learning to task-specific learning. This framework includes a Multi-modal
Safety Concept Activation Vector module for safety-oriented representation
learning and a Safety Pattern Auto-Encoder module for unsupervised attack
classification. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves
consistently higher detection AUROC on diverse unknown attacks while improving
efficiency. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Semantic4Safety uses zero-shot semantic segmentation on street-view imagery to create interpretable streetscape indicators and analyzes their causal impacts on different accident types using XGBoost, SHAP, GPS weighting, and ATE estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in constructing street-level indicators that capture accident-related features and quantifying their causal impacts across different accident types using street-view imagery.

Method: Apply zero-shot semantic segmentation to derive 11 interpretable streetscape indicators, integrate road type as contextual information, train XGBoost multi-class classifier, use SHAP for feature interpretation, and apply GPS weighting and ATE estimation for causal inference.

Result: Uncovered heterogeneous, accident-type-specific causal patterns: scene complexity, exposure, and roadway geometry features dominate predictive power; larger drivable area and emergency space reduce risk, while excessive visual openness increases risk.

Conclusion: Semantic4Safety bridges predictive modeling with causal inference, supporting targeted interventions and high-risk corridor diagnosis, offering a scalable, data-informed tool for urban road safety planning.

Abstract: Street-view imagery (SVI) offers a fine-grained lens on traffic risk, yet two
fundamental challenges persist: (1) how to construct street-level indicators
that capture accident-related features, and (2) how to quantify their causal
impacts across different accident types. To address these challenges, we
propose Semantic4Safety, a framework that applies zero-shot semantic
segmentation to SVIs to derive 11 interpretable streetscape indicators, and
integrates road type as contextual information to analyze approximately 30,000
accident records in Austin. Specifically, we train an eXtreme Gradient Boosting
(XGBoost) multi-class classifier and use Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP)
to interpret both global and local feature contributions, and then apply
Generalized Propensity Score (GPS) weighting and Average Treatment Effect (ATE)
estimation to control confounding and quantify causal effects. Results uncover
heterogeneous, accident-type-specific causal patterns: features capturing scene
complexity, exposure, and roadway geometry dominate predictive power; larger
drivable area and emergency space reduce risk, whereas excessive visual

*Feifei Zhang,Zhenhong Jia,Sensen Song,Fei Shi,Dayong Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PCMambaNet introduces a Predictive-Corrective paradigm that decouples modeling tasks to accelerate learning, achieving state-of-the-art brain MRI segmentation accuracy within only 1-5 epochs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End-to-end deep learning suffers from slow convergence and heavy reliance on large datasets, limiting efficiency in data-scarce domains like medical imaging.

Method: Uses two modules: Predictive Prior Module (PPM) generates coarse approximations using anatomical knowledge (bilateral symmetry), and Corrective Residual Network (CRN) learns residual errors to refine challenging regions and pathological boundaries.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on high-resolution brain MRI segmentation while converging within only 1-5 epochs - performance unattainable by conventional end-to-end models.

Conclusion: By explicitly incorporating domain knowledge to simplify learning objectives, PCMambaNet effectively mitigates data inefficiency and overfitting, demonstrating dramatic acceleration in convergence.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of the end-to-end paradigm in deep learning,
it often suffers from slow convergence and heavy reliance on large-scale
datasets, which fundamentally limits its efficiency and applicability in
data-scarce domains such as medical imaging. In this work, we introduce the
Predictive-Corrective (PC) paradigm, a framework that decouples the modeling
task to fundamentally accelerate learning. Building upon this paradigm, we
propose a novel network, termed PCMambaNet. PCMambaNet is composed of two
synergistic modules. First, the Predictive Prior Module (PPM) generates a
coarse approximation at low computational cost, thereby anchoring the search
space. Specifically, the PPM leverages anatomical knowledge-bilateral
symmetry-to predict a 'focus map' of diagnostically relevant asymmetric
regions. Next, the Corrective Residual Network (CRN) learns to model the
residual error, focusing the network's full capacity on refining these
challenging regions and delineating precise pathological boundaries. Extensive
experiments on high-resolution brain MRI segmentation demonstrate that
PCMambaNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while converging within only 1-5
epochs-a performance unattainable by conventional end-to-end models. This
dramatic acceleration highlights that by explicitly incorporating domain
knowledge to simplify the learning objective, PCMambaNet effectively mitigates
data inefficiency and overfitting.

*Xuchen Li,Xuzhao Li,Shiyu Hu,Kaiqi Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes EARL framework for video reasoning that dynamically selects relevant frames and performs localized re-sampling to improve evidence quality and reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing Video LLMs where static uniform frame sampling causes information dilution and obscures critical evidence, and pixel-space video reasoning agents lack rigorous reward mechanisms for evidence purity.

Method: Evidence-aware reinforcement learning (EARL) framework that transforms models into active interrogators of evidence, dynamically selecting most relevant frames and performing localized re-sampling around key frames for fine-grained temporal detail.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on five video reasoning benchmarks: 59.8% on LongVideoBench, 69.0% on MVBench, and 64.9% on VideoMME with 7B model.

Conclusion: Demonstrates importance of prioritizing evidence purity and effectiveness of the EARL framework for long-form video reasoning, enabling models to "Select Less, Reason More".

Abstract: Long-form video reasoning remains a major challenge for Video Large Language
Models (Video LLMs), as static uniform frame sampling leads to information
dilution and obscures critical evidence. Furthermore, existing pixel-space
video reasoning agents, which are designed to actively interact with the video
to acquire new visual information, remain suboptimal due to their lack of
rigorous reward mechanisms to enforce evidence purity and their inability to
perform temporal information supplementation beyond pre-sampled frames. To
address this critical gap, we propose a novel evidence-prioritized adaptive
framework built upon our core philosophy: "Select Less, Reason More." Our core
contribution is the evidence-aware reinforcement learning (EARL) framework,
which transforms the model into an active interrogator of evidence. EARL is
precisely engineered to dynamically select the most relevant frames and,
crucially, to perform localized re-sampling around the selected key frames to
access fine-grained temporal detail. Extensive experiments on five demanding
video reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our EARL-trained model achieves new
state-of-the-art among open-source Video LLMs, simultaneously learning an
effective and high-purity visual evidence selection policy. Impressively, our
7B model achieves 59.8% on LongVideoBench, 69.0% on MVBench and 64.9% on
VideoMME. These results highlight the importance of prioritizing evidence
purity and the effectiveness of our framework.

*Nengbo Zhang,Hann Woei Ho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAVR-Net is a multi-view learning framework for Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) action recognition that combines RGB frames, optical flow, and segmentation masks with cross-view attention and multi-scale feature pyramids to improve motion recognition accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-based MAV motion recognition models relying solely on RGB data often fail to capture complex spatial-temporal characteristics, limiting their ability to distinguish different actions in autonomous aerial swarms.

Method: Uses ResNet-based encoders for feature extraction from three complementary data types (RGB frames, optical flow, segmentation masks), incorporates multi-scale feature pyramids, cross-view attention modules for modality dependencies, and multi-view alignment loss for semantic consistency.

Result: Achieved 97.8% accuracy on Short MAV dataset, 96.5% on Medium MAV dataset, and 92.8% on Long MAV dataset, clearly outperforming existing approaches.

Conclusion: The multi-view learning approach combining complementary data types with cross-view attention and feature alignment significantly improves MAV motion recognition performance compared to traditional single-view methods.

Abstract: Recognizing the motion of Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) is crucial for
enabling cooperative perception and control in autonomous aerial swarms. Yet,
vision-based recognition models relying only on RGB data often fail to capture
the complex spatial temporal characteristics of MAV motion, which limits their
ability to distinguish different actions. To overcome this problem, this paper
presents MAVR-Net, a multi-view learning-based MAV action recognition
framework. Unlike traditional single-view methods, the proposed approach
combines three complementary types of data, including raw RGB frames, optical
flow, and segmentation masks, to improve the robustness and accuracy of MAV
motion recognition. Specifically, ResNet-based encoders are used to extract
discriminative features from each view, and a multi-scale feature pyramid is
adopted to preserve the spatiotemporal details of MAV motion patterns. To
enhance the interaction between different views, a cross-view attention module
is introduced to model the dependencies among various modalities and feature
scales. In addition, a multi-view alignment loss is designed to ensure semantic
consistency and strengthen cross-view feature representations. Experimental
results on benchmark MAV action datasets show that our method clearly
outperforms existing approaches, achieving 97.8\%, 96.5\%, and 92.8\% accuracy
on the Short MAV, Medium MAV, and Long MAV datasets, respectively.

### [45] [DPTrack:Directional Kernel-Guided Prompt Learning for Robust Nighttime Aerial Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15449)
*Zhiqiang Zhu,Xinbo Gao,Wen Lu,Jie Li,Zhaoyang Wang,Mingqian Ge*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DPTrack is a prompt-based aerial tracker for nighttime scenarios that encodes object attribute features into directional kernels with fine-grained cues to generate precise prompts, overcoming limitations of existing trackers that rely solely on spatial localization supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing nighttime aerial trackers based on prompt learning rely only on spatial localization supervision, which fails to provide fine-grained cues for target features and produces vague prompts, resulting in poor tracking performance.

Method: DPTrack hierarchically captures object's topological structure using visual bionics, encodes topology-aware features into directional kernels, and uses a kernel-guided prompt module with channel-category correspondence to propagate kernels across search regions to generate precise prompts with spatial gating.

Result: Extensive evaluations on established benchmarks demonstrate DPTrack's superior performance compared to existing nighttime aerial trackers.

Conclusion: DPTrack effectively addresses the limitations of vague prompts in nighttime aerial tracking by incorporating fine-grained attribute cues through directional kernels and topological structure analysis, achieving robust tracking performance.

Abstract: Existing nighttime aerial trackers based on prompt learning rely solely on
spatial localization supervision, which fails to provide fine-grained cues that
point to target features and inevitably produces vague prompts. This limitation
impairs the tracker's ability to accurately focus on the object features and
results in trackers still performing poorly. To address this issue, we propose
DPTrack, a prompt-based aerial tracker designed for nighttime scenarios by
encoding the given object's attribute features into the directional kernel
enriched with fine-grained cues to generate precise prompts. Specifically,
drawing inspiration from visual bionics, DPTrack first hierarchically captures
the object's topological structure, leveraging topological attributes to enrich
the feature representation. Subsequently, an encoder condenses these
topology-aware features into the directional kernel, which serves as the core
guidance signal that explicitly encapsulates the object's fine-grained
attribute cues. Finally, a kernel-guided prompt module built on
channel-category correspondence attributes propagates the kernel across the
features of the search region to pinpoint the positions of target features and
convert them into precise prompts, integrating spatial gating for robust
nighttime tracking. Extensive evaluations on established benchmarks demonstrate
DPTrack's superior performance. Our code will be available at

### [46] [Improving Micro-Expression Recognition with Phase-Aware Temporal Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15466)
*Vu Tram Anh Khuong,Luu Tu Nguyen,Thanh Ha Le,Thi Duyen Ngo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A phase-aware temporal augmentation method for micro-expression recognition that decomposes expressions into onset-to-apex and apex-to-offset phases, generating separate dynamic images for each phase to enrich motion diversity and improve recognition performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Micro-expression recognition faces data scarcity issues that limit generalization and motion pattern diversity. Existing methods rely on simple spatial augmentations and overlook temporal strategies that could better exploit motion characteristics.

Method: Proposes a dual-phase dynamic image augmentation strategy that decomposes each micro-expression sequence into onset-to-apex and apex-to-offset phases, generating separate dynamic images for each phase to capture complementary temporal cues.

Result: Extensive experiments on CASME-II and SAMM datasets using six deep architectures show consistent improvements in accuracy, unweighted F1-score, and unweighted average recall. When combined with spatial augmentations, achieves up to 10% relative improvement.

Conclusion: The proposed phase-aware temporal augmentation is simple, model-agnostic, and effective in low-resource settings, offering a promising direction for robust and generalizable micro-expression recognition.

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are brief, involuntary facial movements that reveal
genuine emotions, typically lasting less than half a second. Recognizing these
subtle expressions is critical for applications in psychology, security, and
behavioral analysis. Although deep learning has enabled significant advances in
micro-expression recognition (MER), its effectiveness is limited by the
scarcity of annotated ME datasets. This data limitation not only hinders
generalization but also restricts the diversity of motion patterns captured
during training. Existing MER studies predominantly rely on simple spatial
augmentations (e.g., flipping, rotation) and overlook temporal augmentation
strategies that can better exploit motion characteristics. To address this gap,
this paper proposes a phase-aware temporal augmentation method based on dynamic
image. Rather than encoding the entire expression as a single onset-to-offset
dynamic image (DI), our approach decomposes each expression sequence into two
motion phases: onset-to-apex and apex-to-offset. A separate DI is generated for
each phase, forming a Dual-phase DI augmentation strategy. These phase-specific
representations enrich motion diversity and introduce complementary temporal
cues that are crucial for recognizing subtle facial transitions. Extensive
experiments on CASME-II and SAMM datasets using six deep architectures,
including CNNs, Vision Transformer, and the lightweight LEARNet, demonstrate
consistent performance improvements in recognition accuracy, unweighted
F1-score, and unweighted average recall, which are crucial for addressing class
imbalance in MER. When combined with spatial augmentations, our method achieves
up to a 10\% relative improvement. The proposed augmentation is simple,
model-agnostic, and effective in low-resource settings, offering a promising
direction for robust and generalizable MER.

*Lingfeng Xuan,Chang Nie,Yiqing Xu,Zhe Liu,Yanzi Miao,Hesheng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MRASfM is a specialized Structure-from-Motion framework for multi-camera driving scenes that improves pose estimation reliability, removes road surface outliers, boosts efficiency, and enables multi-scene aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard SfM struggles with driving scenes due to unreliable pose estimation, excessive road surface outliers, and low reconstruction efficiency in multi-camera systems.

Method: Leverages fixed camera relationships for pose estimation, uses plane model to clean road surface points, treats multi-camera as single BA unit, and employs coarse-to-fine scene association and assembly for multi-scene aggregation.

Result: Achieves 0.124 absolute pose error on nuScenes dataset, demonstrates robustness in challenging conditions, and shows state-of-the-art performance in large-scale validation.

Conclusion: MRASfM effectively addresses SfM limitations in driving scenes with reliable pose estimation, clean reconstruction, high efficiency, and multi-scene aggregation capabilities.

Abstract: Structure from Motion (SfM) estimates camera poses and reconstructs point
clouds, forming a foundation for various tasks. However, applying SfM to
driving scenes captured by multi-camera systems presents significant
difficulties, including unreliable pose estimation, excessive outliers in road
surface reconstruction, and low reconstruction efficiency. To address these
limitations, we propose a Multi-camera Reconstruction and Aggregation
Structure-from-Motion (MRASfM) framework specifically designed for driving
scenes. MRASfM enhances the reliability of camera pose estimation by leveraging
the fixed spatial relationships within the multi-camera system during the
registration process. To improve the quality of road surface reconstruction,
our framework employs a plane model to effectively remove erroneous points from
the triangulated road surface. Moreover, treating the multi-camera set as a
single unit in Bundle Adjustment (BA) helps reduce optimization variables to
boost efficiency. In addition, MRASfM achieves multi-scene aggregation through
scene association and assembly modules in a coarse-to-fine fashion. We deployed
multi-camera systems on actual vehicles to validate the generalizability of
MRASfM across various scenes and its robustness in challenging conditions
through real-world applications. Furthermore, large-scale validation results on
public datasets show the state-of-the-art performance of MRASfM, achieving
0.124 absolute pose error on the nuScenes dataset.

*Jinghao Huang,Yaxiong Chen,Ganchao Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Multi-Semantic Adaptive Mining (MSAM) for drone video-text retrieval, addressing unique challenges of drone videos like overhead perspectives and structural homogeneity through adaptive semantic learning and cross-modal feature fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Drone videos have unique characteristics (overhead perspectives, structural homogeneity, diverse semantic expressions) that challenge existing cross-modal methods designed for ground-level views, requiring dedicated retrieval mechanisms for drone scenarios.

Method: MSAM uses multi-semantic adaptive learning with dynamic frame changes and region-specific semantic extraction. It includes adaptive semantic construction, distribution-driven semantic learning, diversity semantic terms, and cross-modal interactive feature fusion pooling to minimize background noise.

Result: Extensive experiments on self-constructed drone video-text datasets show MSAM outperforms existing methods in drone video-text retrieval tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed MSAM method effectively addresses drone video-text retrieval challenges and demonstrates superior performance, with source code and datasets to be made publicly available.

Abstract: With the advancement of drone technology, the volume of video data increases
rapidly, creating an urgent need for efficient semantic retrieval. We are the
first to systematically propose and study the drone video-text retrieval (DVTR)
task. Drone videos feature overhead perspectives, strong structural
homogeneity, and diverse semantic expressions of target combinations, which
challenge existing cross-modal methods designed for ground-level views in
effectively modeling their characteristics. Therefore, dedicated retrieval
mechanisms tailored for drone scenarios are necessary. To address this issue,
we propose a novel approach called Multi-Semantic Adaptive Mining (MSAM). MSAM
introduces a multi-semantic adaptive learning mechanism, which incorporates
dynamic changes between frames and extracts rich semantic information from
specific scene regions, thereby enhancing the deep understanding and reasoning
of drone video content. This method relies on fine-grained interactions between
words and drone video frames, integrating an adaptive semantic construction
module, a distribution-driven semantic learning term and a diversity semantic
term to deepen the interaction between text and drone video modalities and
improve the robustness of feature representation. To reduce the interference of
complex backgrounds in drone videos, we introduce a cross-modal interactive
feature fusion pooling mechanism that focuses on feature extraction and
matching in target regions, minimizing noise effects. Extensive experiments on
two self-constructed drone video-text datasets show that MSAM outperforms other
existing methods in the drone video-text retrieval task. The source code and
dataset will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MER methods relying on optical flow typically focus only on the onset-to-apex phase, neglecting the important temporal dynamics in the apex-to-offset phase.

Method: Proposed Combined Optical Flow (COF) that integrates both onset-to-apex and apex-to-offset phases to provide more comprehensive motion analysis for micro-expression recognition.

Result: Experimental results on CASMEII and SAMM datasets show that COF outperforms single optical flow-based methods.

Conclusion: COF is effective in capturing micro-expression dynamics by providing a more comprehensive motion analysis through integration of both facial movement phases.

Abstract: Facial micro-expressions are brief, involuntary facial movements that reveal
hidden emotions. Most Micro-Expression Recognition (MER) methods that rely on
optical flow typically focus on the onset-to-apex phase, neglecting the
apex-to-offset phase, which holds key temporal dynamics. This study introduces
a Combined Optical Flow (COF), integrating both phases to enhance feature
representation. COF provides a more comprehensive motion analysis, improving
MER performance. Experimental results on CASMEII and SAMM datasets show that
COF outperforms single optical flow-based methods, demonstrating its
effectiveness in capturing micro-expression dynamics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A pipeline for generating high-quality 3D reconstructions of agricultural plants using autonomous UAV image capture and iterative deformation to correct for leaf motion caused by wind and drone downwash.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D phenotyping of plants is crucial for understanding plant growth, yield prediction, and disease control, but current methods struggle with environmental factors like wind and drone-induced motion.

Method: Autonomous UAV image capture with ArUco markers, using an iterative deformation approach that estimates motion via optical flow between input images and intermediate 3D reconstructions to gradually align the scene.

Result: The pipeline improves reconstruction quality of state-of-the-art methods and enables extraction of high-resolution 3D meshes after a few iterations of motion correction.

Conclusion: The method successfully addresses leaf motion challenges in plant 3D reconstruction and will be made publicly available along with a dataset of various crops captured at different time points.

Abstract: 3D phenotyping of plants plays a crucial role for understanding plant growth,
yield prediction, and disease control. We present a pipeline capable of
generating high-quality 3D reconstructions of individual agricultural plants.
To acquire data, a small commercially available UAV captures images of a
selected plant. Apart from placing ArUco markers, the entire image acquisition
process is fully autonomous, controlled by a self-developed Android application
running on the drone's controller. The reconstruction task is particularly
challenging due to environmental wind and downwash of the UAV. Our proposed
pipeline supports the integration of arbitrary state-of-the-art 3D
reconstruction methods. To mitigate errors caused by leaf motion during image
capture, we use an iterative method that gradually adjusts the input images
through deformation. Motion is estimated using optical flow between the
original input images and intermediate 3D reconstructions rendered from the
corresponding viewpoints. This alignment gradually reduces scene motion,
resulting in a canonical representation. After a few iterations, our pipeline
improves the reconstruction of state-of-the-art methods and enables the
extraction of high-resolution 3D meshes. We will publicly release the source
code of our reconstruction pipeline. Additionally, we provide a dataset
consisting of multiple plants from various crops, captured across different
points in time.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiMA is a hierarchical architecture combining Transformer and Mamba modules for efficient low-light RAW image enhancement, achieving superior performance with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of simultaneously achieving strong enhancement quality and high efficiency in low-light RAW image processing, overcoming limitations of existing deep learning approaches.

Method: Proposes HiMA with Transformer for large-scale features and Mamba for small-scale features, plus Local Distribution Adjustment (LoDA) for uneven illumination and Multi-prior Fusion (MPF) for detail enhancement.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on multiple public datasets with superior performance and fewer parameters.

Conclusion: HiMA provides an effective solution for efficient low-light RAW image enhancement by leveraging complementary strengths of different modules and addressing local illumination variations.

Abstract: Low-light RAW image enhancement remains a challenging task. Although numerous
deep learning based approaches have been proposed, they still suffer from
inherent limitations. A key challenge is how to simultaneously achieve strong
enhancement quality and high efficiency. In this paper, we rethink the
architecture for efficient low-light image signal processing (ISP) and
introduce a Hierarchical Mixing Architecture (HiMA). HiMA leverages the
complementary strengths of Transformer and Mamba modules to handle features at
large and small scales, respectively, thereby improving efficiency while
avoiding the ambiguities observed in prior two-stage frameworks. To further
address uneven illumination with strong local variations, we propose Local
Distribution Adjustment (LoDA), which adaptively aligns feature distributions
across different local regions. In addition, to fully exploit the denoised
outputs from the first stage, we design a Multi-prior Fusion (MPF) module that
integrates spatial and frequency-domain priors for detail enhancement.
Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving superior performance with
fewer parameters. Code will be released at https://github.com/Cynicarlos/HiMA.

TL;DR: ORCA introduces learnable task and visual prompts to adapt pre-trained diffusion models for robotic control, achieving state-of-the-art performance without fine-tuning the base model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-trained visual representations are task-agnostic when frozen during policy learning, and naive textual conditioning fails in control tasks due to domain gaps between diffusion training data and robotic environments.

Method: Proposes ORCA with learnable task prompts that adapt to control environments and visual prompts that capture frame-specific details, enabling task-adaptive representations from pre-trained diffusion models.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on various robotic control benchmarks, significantly surpassing prior methods.

Conclusion: Dynamic visual information specific to control tasks is crucial, and ORCA's adaptive prompting strategy effectively bridges the domain gap for improved robotic control.

Abstract: While pre-trained visual representations have significantly advanced
imitation learning, they are often task-agnostic as they remain frozen during
policy learning. In this work, we explore leveraging pre-trained text-to-image
diffusion models to obtain task-adaptive visual representations for robotic
control, without fine-tuning the model itself. However, we find that naively
applying textual conditions - a successful strategy in other vision domains -
yields minimal or even negative gains in control tasks. We attribute this to
the domain gap between the diffusion model's training data and robotic control
environments, leading us to argue for conditions that consider the specific,
dynamic visual information required for control. To this end, we propose ORCA,
which introduces learnable task prompts that adapt to the control environment
and visual prompts that capture fine-grained, frame-specific details. Through
facilitating task-adaptive representations with our newly devised conditions,
our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on various robotic control
benchmarks, significantly surpassing prior methods.

*Ignacio Serna*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Latent Feature Alignment (LFA) is a novel method that identifies biased subpopulations in face recognition models without requiring predefined attribute labels, using latent directions to discover semantically coherent groups and interpretable attributes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current face recognition models exhibit systematic biases affecting certain subpopulations, but conventional bias evaluation requires expensive labeled attributes and is limited to predefined categories.

Method: LFA uses latent directions in the feature space to identify subpopulations, enabling semantically coherent grouping and discovery of interpretable directions corresponding to attributes like age, ethnicity, or attire.

Result: Across four state-of-the-art models (ArcFace, CosFace, ElasticFace, PartialFC) and two benchmarks (RFW, CelebA), LFA consistently outperforms k-means and nearest-neighbor search in intra-group semantic coherence while uncovering interpretable latent directions.

Conclusion: LFA provides a practical method for representation auditing of face recognition models, enabling identification and interpretation of biased subpopulations without predefined attribute annotations.

Abstract: Modern face recognition models achieve high overall accuracy but continue to
exhibit systematic biases that disproportionately affect certain
subpopulations. Conventional bias evaluation frameworks rely on labeled
attributes to form subpopulations, which are expensive to obtain and limited to
predefined categories. We introduce Latent Feature Alignment (LFA), an
attribute-label-free algorithm that uses latent directions to identify
subpopulations. This yields two main benefits over standard clustering: (i)
semantically coherent grouping, where faces sharing common attributes are
grouped together more reliably than by proximity-based methods, and (ii)
discovery of interpretable directions, which correspond to semantic attributes
such as age, ethnicity, or attire. Across four state-of-the-art recognition
models (ArcFace, CosFace, ElasticFace, PartialFC) and two benchmarks (RFW,
CelebA), LFA consistently outperforms k-means and nearest-neighbor search in
intra-group semantic coherence, while uncovering interpretable latent
directions aligned with demographic and contextual attributes. These results
position LFA as a practical method for representation auditing of face
recognition models, enabling practitioners to identify and interpret biased
subpopulations without predefined attribute annotations.

TL;DR: Custom CNN architectures for satellite land use classification achieve 97.23% accuracy on EuroSAT dataset without pre-trained models, using a novel balanced multi-task attention mechanism that combines spatial and spectral feature extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop specialized convolutional neural network architectures for satellite imagery classification that don't rely on pre-trained models and address specific failure modes in satellite data analysis.

Method: Three progressive architectural iterations: baseline CNN, CBAM-enhanced, and balanced multi-task attention mechanism combining Coordinate Attention for spatial features and Squeeze-Excitation blocks for spectral features with learnable fusion parameter. Uses progressive DropBlock regularization and class-balanced loss weighting.

Result: Achieved 97.23% test accuracy on EuroSAT dataset, Cohen's Kappa of 0.9692, with all classes exceeding 94.46% accuracy. Performance within 1.34% of fine-tuned ResNet-50 while requiring no external data.

Conclusion: Systematic architectural design for domain-specific applications is effective, with spatial and spectral modalities being equally important for satellite imagery classification as indicated by the learnable fusion parameter converging to approximately 0.57.

Abstract: This work presents a systematic investigation of custom convolutional neural
network architectures for satellite land use classification, achieving 97.23%
test accuracy on the EuroSAT dataset without reliance on pre-trained models.
Through three progressive architectural iterations (baseline: 94.30%,
CBAM-enhanced: 95.98%, and balanced multi-task attention: 97.23%) we identify
and address specific failure modes in satellite imagery classification. Our
principal contribution is a novel balanced multi-task attention mechanism that
combines Coordinate Attention for spatial feature extraction with
Squeeze-Excitation blocks for spectral feature extraction, unified through a
learnable fusion parameter. Experimental results demonstrate that this
learnable parameter autonomously converges to alpha approximately 0.57,
indicating near-equal importance of spatial and spectral modalities for
satellite imagery. We employ progressive DropBlock regularization (5-20% by
network depth) and class-balanced loss weighting to address overfitting and
confusion pattern imbalance. The final 12-layer architecture achieves Cohen's
Kappa of 0.9692 with all classes exceeding 94.46% accuracy, demonstrating
confidence calibration with a 24.25% gap between correct and incorrect
predictions. Our approach achieves performance within 1.34% of fine-tuned
ResNet-50 (98.57%) while requiring no external data, validating the efficacy of
systematic architectural design for domain-specific applications. Complete
code, trained models, and evaluation scripts are publicly available.

TL;DR: SiM2P is a 3D diffusion framework that generates synthetic FDG-PET images from MRI and basic patient data, significantly improving dementia diagnosis accuracy from 75.0% to 84.7% while being more accessible and cost-effective than actual PET scans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FDG-PET is valuable for dementia diagnosis but is less accessible and more expensive than MRI. The goal is to make PET's diagnostic benefits more widely available by simulating PET images from routinely available MRI data.

Method: SiM2P uses a 3D diffusion bridge-based framework to learn probabilistic mapping from MRI and basic patient information (demographics) to generate synthetic FDG-PET images. It requires only 20 site-specific cases for local deployment.

Result: In blinded clinical studies, SiM2P improved diagnostic accuracy for differentiating Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and healthy controls from 75.0% to 84.7% (p<0.05). Simulated PET images received higher diagnostic certainty and better interrater agreement than MRI alone.

Conclusion: SiM2P makes FDG-PET's diagnostic benefits more accessible in resource-limited settings, potentially improving early dementia detection and differential diagnosis using only routine MRI and basic patient information.

Abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is an
established tool in the diagnostic workup of patients with suspected dementing
disorders. However, compared to the routinely available magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), FDG-PET remains significantly less accessible and substantially
more expensive. Here, we present SiM2P, a 3D diffusion bridge-based framework
that learns a probabilistic mapping from MRI and auxiliary patient information
to simulate FDG-PET images of diagnostic quality. In a blinded clinical reader
study, two neuroradiologists and two nuclear medicine physicians rated the
original MRI and SiM2P-simulated PET images of patients with Alzheimer's
disease, behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia, and cognitively healthy
controls. SiM2P significantly improved the overall diagnostic accuracy of
differentiating between three groups from 75.0% to 84.7% (p<0.05). Notably, the
simulated PET images received higher diagnostic certainty ratings and achieved
superior interrater agreement compared to the MRI images. Finally, we developed
a practical workflow for local deployment of the SiM2P framework. It requires
as few as 20 site-specific cases and only basic demographic information. This
approach makes the established diagnostic benefits of FDG-PET imaging more
accessible to patients with suspected dementing disorders, potentially
improving early detection and differential diagnosis in resource-limited
settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yiiitong/SiM2P.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in historical document analysis where structured content appears in degraded, non-standard forms, particularly in low-resource archival contexts with motion blur, handwriting variation, and cluttered backgrounds.

Method: Created dataset from 127 WWII-era archival video segments containing clapperboards, with 9,813 annotated frames and 94,573 word-level text instances. Used rotated bounding boxes as 4-point polygons for precise OCR applications, providing both full-frame annotations and cropped word images.

Result: Benchmarked six recognition and seven detection models under zero-shot and fine-tuned conditions. Despite small training set (18 videos), fine-tuning led to substantial performance gains, demonstrating suitability for few-shot learning scenarios.

Conclusion: ClapperText provides a realistic and culturally grounded resource for advancing robust OCR and document understanding in low-resource archival contexts, with the dataset and evaluation code publicly available.

Abstract: This paper presents ClapperText, a benchmark dataset for handwritten and
printed text recognition in visually degraded and low-resource settings. The
dataset is derived from 127 World War II-era archival video segments containing
clapperboards that record structured production metadata such as date,
location, and camera-operator identity. ClapperText includes 9,813 annotated
frames and 94,573 word-level text instances, 67% of which are handwritten and
1,566 are partially occluded. Each instance includes transcription, semantic
category, text type, and occlusion status, with annotations available as
rotated bounding boxes represented as 4-point polygons to support spatially
precise OCR applications. Recognizing clapperboard text poses significant
challenges, including motion blur, handwriting variation, exposure
fluctuations, and cluttered backgrounds, mirroring broader challenges in
historical document analysis where structured content appears in degraded,
non-standard forms. We provide both full-frame annotations and cropped word
images to support downstream tasks. Using a consistent per-video evaluation
protocol, we benchmark six representative recognition and seven detection
models under zero-shot and fine-tuned conditions. Despite the small training
set (18 videos), fine-tuning leads to substantial performance gains,
highlighting ClapperText's suitability for few-shot learning scenarios. The
dataset offers a realistic and culturally grounded resource for advancing
robust OCR and document understanding in low-resource archival contexts. The

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A vision-guided 3D layout generation system that uses image generation and parsing to create coherent 3D scenes from prompts, outperforming existing methods in layout richness and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of traditional optimization-based methods (manual rules), deep generative models (lack richness/diversity), and LLM-based approaches (poor spatial relationship capture) in 3D scene generation.

Method: 1) Build asset library with 2,037 scene assets and 147 3D layouts; 2) Use fine-tuned image generation model to expand prompts into images; 3) Develop image parsing module to recover 3D layouts from visual semantics and geometry; 4) Optimize layouts using scene graphs and visual semantics.

Result: Extensive user testing shows the algorithm significantly outperforms existing methods in layout richness and quality.

Conclusion: The proposed vision-guided system effectively generates artistic and coherent 3D scene layouts, with code and dataset available for public use.

Abstract: Generating artistic and coherent 3D scene layouts is crucial in digital
content creation. Traditional optimization-based methods are often constrained
by cumbersome manual rules, while deep generative models face challenges in
producing content with richness and diversity. Furthermore, approaches that
utilize large language models frequently lack robustness and fail to accurately
capture complex spatial relationships. To address these challenges, this paper
presents a novel vision-guided 3D layout generation system. We first construct
a high-quality asset library containing 2,037 scene assets and 147 3D scene
layouts. Subsequently, we employ an image generation model to expand prompt
representations into images, fine-tuning it to align with our asset library. We
then develop a robust image parsing module to recover the 3D layout of scenes
based on visual semantics and geometric information. Finally, we optimize the
scene layout using scene graphs and overall visual semantics to ensure logical
coherence and alignment with the images. Extensive user testing demonstrates
that our algorithm significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of
layout richness and quality. The code and dataset will be available at

Motivation: Existing DeepFake detection methods struggle with pose variations, occlusions, and artifacts in real-world conditions, requiring more robust detection approaches.

Method: Proposes a multi-view architecture with three specialized encoders: global view for boundary inconsistencies, middle view for texture/color alignment, and local view for distortions in expressive facial regions, plus a face orientation encoder for pose classification.

Result: Experimental results on challenging datasets demonstrate superior performance in detecting manipulated images, outperforming conventional single-view approaches even under challenging pose and lighting conditions.

Conclusion: The multi-view architecture effectively enhances DeepFake detection by comprehensively analyzing facial features at multiple levels and ensuring robust performance across various viewing angles.

Abstract: DeepFake technology has advanced significantly in recent years, enabling the
creation of highly realistic synthetic face images. Existing DeepFake detection
methods often struggle with pose variations, occlusions, and artifacts that are
difficult to detect in real-world conditions. To address these challenges, we
propose a multi-view architecture that enhances DeepFake detection by analyzing
facial features at multiple levels. Our approach integrates three specialized
encoders, a global view encoder for detecting boundary inconsistencies, a
middle view encoder for analyzing texture and color alignment, and a local view
encoder for capturing distortions in expressive facial regions such as the
eyes, nose, and mouth, where DeepFake artifacts frequently occur. Additionally,
we incorporate a face orientation encoder, trained to classify face poses,
ensuring robust detection across various viewing angles. By fusing features
from these encoders, our model achieves superior performance in detecting
manipulated images, even under challenging pose and lighting
conditions.Experimental results on challenging datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method, outperforming conventional single-view approaches

Result: Drastic parameter reduction (99.98%) while achieving superior performance, faster training, and lower memory usage. GAN successfully identifies experimental issues like photobleaching, artifacts, and inaccurate labeling.

Conclusion: Lightweight CycleGAN establishes a practical tool for both modality transfer and validating experimental accuracy in microscopy workflows, offering computational efficiency and diagnostic capabilities.

Abstract: Lightweight deep learning models offer substantial reductions in
computational cost and environmental impact, making them crucial for scientific
applications. We present a lightweight CycleGAN for modality transfer in
fluorescence microscopy (confocal to super-resolution STED/deconvolved STED),
addressing the common challenge of unpaired datasets. By replacing the
traditional channel-doubling strategy in the U-Net-based generator with a fixed
channel approach, we drastically reduce trainable parameters from 41.8 million
to approximately nine thousand, achieving superior performance with faster
training and lower memory usage. We also introduce the GAN as a diagnostic tool
for experimental and labeling quality. When trained on high-quality images, the
GAN learns the characteristics of optimal imaging; deviations between its
generated outputs and new experimental images can reveal issues such as
photobleaching, artifacts, or inaccurate labeling. This establishes the model
as a practical tool for validating experimental accuracy and image fidelity in
microscopy workflows.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Two standardization methods for Spatio-Temporal Image Fusion (STIF) are proposed: traditional upscaling and a sharpening approach called ABSIS, both significantly improving USTFIP method accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To facilitate STIF applications by standardizing images with different spatial and spectral resolutions from various sensors.

Method: Two approaches: 1) Traditional upscaling of fine-resolution images, 2) ABSIS sharpening method that blends fine-resolution features with coarse-resolution attributes.

Result: Both methods significantly increased USTFIP accuracy, with ABSIS improving spectral accuracy by up to 49.46% and spatial accuracy by up to 78.40%.

Conclusion: Standardization approaches, particularly the ABSIS sharpening method, substantially enhance STIF method performance and accuracy.

Abstract: Spatio-Temporal Image Fusion (STIF) methods usually require sets of images
with matching spatial and spectral resolutions captured by different sensors.
To facilitate the application of STIF methods, we propose and compare two
different standardization approaches. The first method is based on traditional
upscaling of the fine-resolution images. The second method is a sharpening
approach called Anomaly Based Satellite Image Standardization (ABSIS) that
blends the overall features found in the fine-resolution image series with the
distinctive attributes of a specific coarse-resolution image to produce images
that more closely resemble the outcome of aggregating the fine-resolution
images. Both methods produce a significant increase in accuracy of the Unpaired
Spatio Temporal Fusion of Image Patches (USTFIP) STIF method, with the
sharpening approach increasing the spectral and spatial accuracies of the fused
images by up to 49.46\% and 78.40\%, respectively.

Conclusion: FlexiReID provides a flexible and effective solution for multimodal person re-identification that supports diverse retrieval modes and demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Multimodal person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to match pedestrian images
across different modalities. However, most existing methods focus on limited
cross-modal settings and fail to support arbitrary query-retrieval
combinations, hindering practical deployment. We propose FlexiReID, a flexible

features and a cross-modal query fusion module to enhance multimodal feature
extraction. To facilitate comprehensive evaluation, we construct CIRS-PEDES, a
unified dataset extending four popular Re-ID datasets to include all four
modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlexiReID achieves

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QFCA is a real-time zero-shot anomaly localization method for textures that uses quantized feature correspondence analysis to achieve 10x speedup with minimal accuracy loss, making it practical for real-world applications like assembly line monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing anomaly localization methods for textures have high running times that make them impractical for real-world deployment scenarios such as assembly line monitoring.

Method: Proposes QFCA - a quantized version of feature correspondence analysis (FCA) that adapts patch statistics comparison to work on histograms of quantized values, plus a PCA-based feature preprocessing step to enhance contrast between normal and anomalous features.

Result: Achieves 10x speedup with little to no loss in accuracy compared to existing methods, and improves detection precision on complex textures through the PCA preprocessing.

Conclusion: QFCA provides a practical real-time solution for zero-shot anomaly localization in textures that outperforms prior art in speed while maintaining competitive accuracy.

Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly localization is a rising field in computer vision research,
with important progress in recent years. This work focuses on the problem of
detecting and localizing anomalies in textures, where anomalies can be defined
as the regions that deviate from the overall statistics, violating the
stationarity assumption. The main limitation of existing methods is their high
running time, making them impractical for deployment in real-world scenarios,
such as assembly line monitoring. We propose a real-time method, named QFCA,
which implements a quantized version of the feature correspondence analysis
(FCA) algorithm. By carefully adapting the patch statistics comparison to work
on histograms of quantized values, we obtain a 10x speedup with little to no
loss in accuracy. Moreover, we introduce a feature preprocessing step based on
principal component analysis, which enhances the contrast between normal and
anomalous features, improving the detection precision on complex textures. Our
method is thoroughly evaluated against prior art, comparing favorably with
existing methods. Project page:

Motivation: Current self-supervised denoising methods face computational and memory constraints, forcing trade-offs between inference speed and reconstruction quality, especially in biomedical imaging where clean training data is scarce.

Method: Built on Noise2Noise framework, N2D introduces a multistage denoising pipeline that disrupts spatial noise correlations to create smooth intermediate structures, then refines them to recover fine details directly from noisy input.

Result: Extensive testing shows N2D outperforms existing dataset-free techniques while requiring only a fraction of computational resources, achieving both efficiency and high performance.

Conclusion: N2D provides an efficient, low-cost, data-free solution for biomedical imaging, overcoming challenges of scarce clean data while enabling practical fast inference.

Abstract: Current self-supervised denoising techniques achieve impressive results, yet
their real-world application is frequently constrained by substantial
computational and memory demands, necessitating a compromise between inference
speed and reconstruction quality. In this paper, we present an
ultra-lightweight model that addresses this challenge, achieving both fast
denoising and high quality image restoration. Built upon the Noise2Noise
training framework-which removes the reliance on clean reference images or
explicit noise modeling-we introduce an innovative multistage denoising
pipeline named Noise2Detail (N2D). During inference, this approach disrupts the
spatial correlations of noise patterns to produce intermediate smooth
structures, which are subsequently refined to recapture fine details directly
from the noisy input. Extensive testing reveals that Noise2Detail surpasses
existing dataset-free techniques in performance, while requiring only a
fraction of the computational resources. This combination of efficiency, low
computational cost, and data-free approach make it a valuable tool for
biomedical imaging, overcoming the challenges of scarce clean training data-due
to rare and complex imaging modalities-while enabling fast inference for
practical use.

Abstract: Domain adaptation is a crucial and increasingly important task in remote
sensing, aiming to transfer knowledge from a source domain a differently
distributed target domain. It has broad applications across various real-world
applications, including remote sensing element interpretation, ecological
environment monitoring, and urban/rural planning. However, domain adaptation in
remote sensing poses significant challenges due to differences in data, such as
variations in ground sampling distance, imaging modes from various sensors,
geographical landscapes, and environmental conditions. In recent years, deep
learning has emerged as a powerful tool for feature representation and
cross-domain knowledge transfer, leading to widespread adoption in remote
sensing tasks. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of significant
advancements in deep learning based domain adaptation for remote sensing. We
first introduce the preliminary knowledge to clarify key concepts, mathematical
notations, and the taxonomy of methodologies. We then organize existing
algorithms from multiple perspectives, including task categorization, input
mode, supervision paradigm, and algorithmic granularity, providing readers with
a structured understanding of the field. Next, we review widely used datasets
and summarize the performance of state-of-the-art methods to provide an
overview of current progress. We also identify open challenges and potential
directions to guide future research in domain adaptation for remote sensing.
Compared to previous surveys, this work addresses a broader range of domain
adaptation tasks in remote sensing, rather than concentrating on a few
subfields. It also presents a systematic taxonomy, providing a more
comprehensive and organized understanding of the field. As a whole, this survey
can inspire the research community, foster understanding, and guide future work

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A weakly supervised medical image segmentation method using only four extreme points as annotation, leveraging SAM2 for initial pseudo labels and refining them with uncertainty-aware techniques to achieve performance comparable to fully supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the high annotation cost of fully supervised medical image segmentation by developing a weakly supervised approach that requires only minimal extreme point annotations instead of pixel-level labels.

Method: Uses bounding boxes from extreme points as SAM2 prompts for initial pseudo labels, then refines them with enhanced FGEPM algorithm with Monte Carlo dropout uncertainty, dual-branch USC loss, and box alignment loss for spatial consistency.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to and even surpassing fully supervised methods on BUSI and UNS ultrasound datasets while significantly reducing annotation cost.

Conclusion: The proposed weakly supervised framework is effective and practical for ultrasound image segmentation, offering a viable alternative to costly fully supervised approaches.

Abstract: Automatic medical image segmentation is a fundamental step in computer-aided
diagnosis, yet fully supervised approaches demand extensive pixel-level
annotations that are costly and time-consuming. To alleviate this burden, we
propose a weakly supervised segmentation framework that leverages only four
extreme points as annotation. Specifically, bounding boxes derived from the
extreme points are used as prompts for the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) to
generate reliable initial pseudo labels. These pseudo labels are progressively
refined by an enhanced Feature-Guided Extreme Point Masking (FGEPM) algorithm,
which incorporates Monte Carlo dropout-based uncertainty estimation to
construct a unified gradient uncertainty cost map for boundary tracing.
Furthermore, a dual-branch Uncertainty-aware Scale Consistency (USC) loss and a
box alignment loss are introduced to ensure spatial consistency and precise
boundary alignment during training. Extensive experiments on two public
ultrasound datasets, BUSI and UNS, demonstrate that our method achieves
performance comparable to, and even surpassing fully supervised counterparts
while significantly reducing annotation cost. These results validate the
effectiveness and practicality of the proposed weakly supervised framework for
ultrasound image segmentation.

Motivation: Addresses limitations of supervised learning for brain tumor segmentation when annotated datasets are limited, costly, or inconsistent, providing a scalable alternative for neuroimaging workflows.

Method: Uses multimodal early-late fusion strategy across MRI sequences, trains vision transformer autoencoder on healthy brain MRIs only, and employs SAM for post-processing to refine tumor contours via reconstruction-based error maps.

Result: Achieves lesion-wise Dice scores of 0.437 (Whole Tumor), 0.316 (Tumor Core), 0.350 (Enhancing Tumor) on test set, and 89.4% anomaly detection rate on validation set for various tumor types including gliomas and meningiomas.

Conclusion: Transformer-based unsupervised models show potential as scalable, label-efficient tools for neuro-oncological imaging, overcoming challenges in detecting small or non-enhancing lesions.

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) presents a complementary alternative to
supervised learning for brain tumor segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI), particularly when annotated datasets are limited, costly, or
inconsistent. In this work, we propose a novel Multimodal Vision Transformer
Autoencoder (MViT-AE) trained exclusively on healthy brain MRIs to detect and
localize tumors via reconstruction-based error maps. This unsupervised paradigm
enables segmentation without reliance on manual labels, addressing a key
scalability bottleneck in neuroimaging workflows. Our method is evaluated in
the BraTS-GoAT 2025 Lighthouse dataset, which includes various types of tumors
such as gliomas, meningiomas, and pediatric brain tumors. To enhance
performance, we introduce a multimodal early-late fusion strategy that
leverages complementary information across multiple MRI sequences, and a
post-processing pipeline that integrates the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to
refine predicted tumor contours. Despite the known challenges of UAD,
particularly in detecting small or non-enhancing lesions, our method achieves
clinically meaningful tumor localization, with lesion-wise Dice Similarity
Coefficient of 0.437 (Whole Tumor), 0.316 (Tumor Core), and 0.350 (Enhancing
Tumor) on the test set, and an anomaly Detection Rate of 89.4% on the
validation set. These findings highlight the potential of transformer-based
unsupervised models to serve as scalable, label-efficient tools for

TL;DR: UniMedVL is a unified multimodal medical AI framework that simultaneously handles both image understanding and generation tasks within a single architecture, addressing the gap between specialized medical image interpretation and generation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical AI systems disrupt the unified diagnostic process by separating image understanding (interpretation) from image generation (synthesis), creating gaps in data representation, feature integration, and multimodal capabilities.

Method: Proposed a multi-level framework using Observation-Knowledge-Analysis (OKA) paradigm: 1) Created UniMed-5M dataset with 5.6M multimodal pairs for observation, 2) Progressive Curriculum Learning for medical knowledge acquisition, 3) UniMedVL unified model architecture for simultaneous image understanding and generation.

Result: UniMedVL achieves superior performance on five medical image understanding benchmarks and matches specialized models in generation quality across eight medical imaging modalities. The unified architecture enables bidirectional knowledge sharing where generation tasks enhance visual understanding features.

Conclusion: Integrating traditionally separate medical AI capabilities within a single unified framework unlocks improvements across diverse medical vision-language tasks, demonstrating that bidirectional knowledge sharing between understanding and generation enhances overall performance.

Abstract: Medical diagnostic applications require models that can process multimodal
medical inputs (images, patient histories, lab results) and generate diverse
outputs including both textual reports and visual content (annotations,
segmentation masks, and images). Despite this need, existing medical AI systems
disrupt this unified process: medical image understanding models interpret
images but cannot generate visual outputs, while medical image generation
models synthesize images but cannot provide textual explanations. This leads to
gaps in data representation, feature integration, and task-level multimodal
capabilities. To this end, we propose a multi-level framework that draws
inspiration from diagnostic workflows through the
Observation-Knowledge-Analysis (OKA) paradigm. Specifically, at the observation
level, we construct UniMed-5M, a dataset comprising over 5.6M samples that
reformat diverse unimodal data into multimodal pairs for foundational
observation. At the knowledge level, we propose Progressive Curriculum Learning
that systematically introduces medical multimodal knowledge. At the analysis
level, we introduce UniMedVL, the first medical unified multimodal model for
the simultaneous analysis of image understanding and generation tasks within a
single architecture. UniMedVL achieves superior performance on five medical
image understanding benchmarks, while matching specialized models in generation
quality across eight medical imaging modalities. Crucially, our unified
architecture enables bidirectional knowledge sharing: generation tasks enhance
visual understanding features, demonstrating that integrating traditionally
separate capabilities within a single medical framework unlocks improvements
across diverse medical vision-language tasks. Code is available at

Result: DGME-T improves top-1 accuracy from 81.78% to 86.14% and macro F1 from 82.08% to 87.81% on modern clips, and boosts World-War-II footage performance from 83.43% to 84.62% accuracy and 81.72% to 82.63% macro F1.

Conclusion: Structured motion priors and transformer representations are complementary, and even a small, carefully calibrated motion head can substantially enhance robustness in degraded film analysis.

Abstract: Camera movement classification (CMC) models trained on contemporary,
high-quality footage often degrade when applied to archival film, where noise,
missing frames, and low contrast obscure motion cues. We bridge this gap by
assembling a unified benchmark that consolidates two modern corpora into four
canonical classes and restructures the HISTORIAN collection into five balanced
categories. Building on this benchmark, we introduce DGME-T, a lightweight
extension to the Video Swin Transformer that injects directional grid motion
encoding, derived from optical flow, via a learnable and normalised late-fusion
layer. DGME-T raises the backbone's top-1 accuracy from 81.78% to 86.14% and
its macro F1 from 82.08% to 87.81% on modern clips, while still improving the
demanding World-War-II footage from 83.43% to 84.62% accuracy and from 81.72%
to 82.63% macro F1. A cross-domain study further shows that an intermediate
fine-tuning stage on modern data increases historical performance by more than
five percentage points. These results demonstrate that structured motion priors
and transformer representations are complementary and that even a small,
carefully calibrated motion head can substantially enhance robustness in
degraded film analysis. Related resources are available at

Conclusion: Ditto framework successfully overcomes data scarcity in video editing through scalable AI-generated data, establishing new state-of-the-art in instruction-based video editing with improved temporal coherence and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Instruction-based video editing promises to democratize content creation, yet
its progress is severely hampered by the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality
training data. We introduce Ditto, a holistic framework designed to tackle this
fundamental challenge. At its heart, Ditto features a novel data generation
pipeline that fuses the creative diversity of a leading image editor with an
in-context video generator, overcoming the limited scope of existing models. To
make this process viable, our framework resolves the prohibitive cost-quality
trade-off by employing an efficient, distilled model architecture augmented by
a temporal enhancer, which simultaneously reduces computational overhead and
improves temporal coherence. Finally, to achieve full scalability, this entire
pipeline is driven by an intelligent agent that crafts diverse instructions and
rigorously filters the output, ensuring quality control at scale. Using this
framework, we invested over 12,000 GPU-days to build Ditto-1M, a new dataset of
one million high-fidelity video editing examples. We trained our model, Editto,
on Ditto-1M with a curriculum learning strategy. The results demonstrate
superior instruction-following ability and establish a new state-of-the-art in
instruction-based video editing.

TL;DR: SEGA introduces a stepwise evolution paradigm for content-aware layout generation, using hierarchical reasoning with coarse-to-fine strategy and layout design principles to improve harmony with background images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing single-step reasoning methods fail at complex element layout planning due to lack of feedback-based self-correction mechanisms, leading to high failure rates.

Method: SEGA uses hierarchical reasoning: coarse-level module estimates layout planning, then refining module performs fine-level reasoning. Incorporates layout design principles as prior knowledge.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmark datasets. Also presents GenPoster-100K, a new large-scale poster dataset with rich meta-information annotation.

Conclusion: The stepwise evolution paradigm with hierarchical reasoning and design principles effectively addresses content-aware layout generation challenges, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the content-aware layout generation problem, which
aims to automatically generate layouts that are harmonious with a given
background image. Existing methods usually deal with this task with a
single-step reasoning framework. The lack of a feedback-based self-correction
mechanism leads to their failure rates significantly increasing when faced with
complex element layout planning. To address this challenge, we introduce SEGA,
a novel Stepwise Evolution Paradigm for Content-Aware Layout Generation.
Inspired by the systematic mode of human thinking, SEGA employs a hierarchical
reasoning framework with a coarse-to-fine strategy: first, a coarse-level
module roughly estimates the layout planning results; then, another refining
module performs fine-level reasoning regarding the coarse planning results.
Furthermore, we incorporate layout design principles as prior knowledge into
the model to enhance its layout planning ability. Besides, we present
GenPoster-100K that is a new large-scale poster dataset with rich
meta-information annotation. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach by achieving the state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmark
datasets. Our project page is at: https://brucew91.github.io/SEGA.github.io/

### [72] [NDM: A Noise-driven Detection and Mitigation Framework against Implicit Sexual Intentions in Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15752)
*Yitong Sun,Yao Huang,Ruochen Zhang,Huanran Chen,Shouwei Ruan,Ranjie Duan,Xingxing Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NDM is a noise-driven framework that detects and mitigates implicit sexual content in text-to-image diffusion models while preserving generative quality, using noise-based detection and adaptive negative guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models are vulnerable to generating inappropriate content from implicit sexual prompts that bypass existing detection methods, creating ethical concerns without compromising model quality.

Method: Proposes NDM with two innovations: 1) noise-based detection using early-stage predicted noise separability, and 2) noise-enhanced adaptive negative guidance that optimizes initial noise by suppressing prominent regions' attention.

Result: NDM achieves superior performance over SOTA methods (SLD, UCE, RECE) on both natural and adversarial datasets, effectively detecting and mitigating implicit malicious intentions.

Conclusion: NDM successfully addresses the challenge of implicit sexual content in T2I generation through noise-driven detection and mitigation while maintaining the model's original generative capabilities.

Abstract: Despite the impressive generative capabilities of text-to-image (T2I)
diffusion models, they remain vulnerable to generating inappropriate content,
especially when confronted with implicit sexual prompts. Unlike explicit
harmful prompts, these subtle cues, often disguised as seemingly benign terms,
can unexpectedly trigger sexual content due to underlying model biases, raising
significant ethical concerns. However, existing detection methods are primarily
designed to identify explicit sexual content and therefore struggle to detect
these implicit cues. Fine-tuning approaches, while effective to some extent,
risk degrading the model's generative quality, creating an undesirable
trade-off. To address this, we propose NDM, the first noise-driven detection
and mitigation framework, which could detect and mitigate implicit malicious
intention in T2I generation while preserving the model's original generative
capabilities. Specifically, we introduce two key innovations: first, we
leverage the separability of early-stage predicted noise to develop a
noise-based detection method that could identify malicious content with high
accuracy and efficiency; second, we propose a noise-enhanced adaptive negative
guidance mechanism that could optimize the initial noise by suppressing the
prominent region's attention, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of adaptive
negative guidance for sexual mitigation. Experimentally, we validate NDM on
both natural and adversarial datasets, demonstrating its superior performance
over existing SOTA methods, including SLD, UCE, and RECE, etc. Code and

*Jort de Jong,Mike Holenderski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A regularization method for semantic segmentation that uses SLIC superpixels to improve boundary alignment when training with coarse annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine pixel-level annotations are expensive and difficult to obtain, while coarse annotations are more practical but lead to poor boundary alignment in segmentation models.

Method: Proposes a regularization method for encoder-decoder architectures with superpixel-based upsampling that encourages segmented pixels to form SLIC superpixels based on color and position, independent of segmentation annotations.

Result: Significant improvement in boundary recall compared to state-of-the-art models when trained on coarse annotations, evaluated on SUIM, Cityscapes, and PanNuke datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed superpixel-based regularization effectively addresses boundary alignment issues in semantic segmentation when only coarse annotations are available.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is the task of classifying each pixel in an image.
Training a segmentation model achieves best results using annotated images,
where each pixel is annotated with the corresponding class. When obtaining fine
annotations is difficult or expensive, it may be possible to acquire coarse
annotations, e.g. by roughly annotating pixels in an images leaving some pixels
around the boundaries between classes unlabeled. Segmentation with coarse
annotations is difficult, in particular when the objective is to optimize the
alignment of boundaries between classes. This paper proposes a regularization
method for models with an encoder-decoder architecture with superpixel based
upsampling. It encourages the segmented pixels in the decoded image to be
SLIC-superpixels, which are based on pixel color and position, independent of
the segmentation annotation. The method is applied to FCN-16 fully
convolutional network architecture and evaluated on the SUIM, Cityscapes, and
PanNuke data sets. It is shown that the boundary recall improves significantly
compared to state-of-the-art models when trained on coarse annotations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address issues with high-frequency fidelity and rare activation spikes in latent diffusion models, particularly at low step counts and ultra-high resolutions.

Method: Combines per-sample micro clamping to gently limit extreme values without washing out texture, and Adaptive Quantile Clip (AQClip) that adapts allowed value corridors per region using either local structure statistics or attention entropy guidance.

Result: Produces cleaner, sharper results at low step counts and ultra-high resolutions with negligible overhead, showing consistent qualitative improvements across SD/SDXL backbones and synergy with CFG/Rescale.

Conclusion: QSilk provides an effective stabilization solution that requires no training or fine-tuning, offers minimal user controls, and enables slightly higher guidance without artifacts.

Abstract: We present QSilk, a lightweight, always-on stabilization layer for latent
diffusion that improves high-frequency fidelity while suppressing rare
activation spikes. QSilk combines (i) a per-sample micro clamp that gently
limits extreme values without washing out texture, and (ii) Adaptive Quantile
Clip (AQClip), which adapts the allowed value corridor per region. AQClip can
operate in a proxy mode using local structure statistics or in an attention
entropy guided mode (model confidence). Integrated into the CADE 2.5 rendering
pipeline, QSilk yields cleaner, sharper results at low step counts and
ultra-high resolutions with negligible overhead. It requires no training or
fine-tuning and exposes minimal user controls. We report consistent qualitative
improvements across SD/SDXL backbones and show synergy with CFG/Rescale,
enabling slightly higher guidance without artifacts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Concept Bottleneck Models suffer from input-to-concept mapping bias and limited controllability, which restricts their practical value and damages the responsibility of concept-based methods.

Method: Proposes LDCBM with filter grouping loss and joint concept supervision to automatically group visual features into semantically meaningful components without requiring region annotation.

Result: Experiments on three diverse datasets show LDCBM achieves higher concept and class accuracy, outperforming previous CBMs in both interpretability and classification performance.

Conclusion: By grounding concepts in visual evidence, LDCBM overcomes fundamental limitations of prior models and enhances the reliability of interpretable AI.

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) enhance interpretability by predicting
human-understandable concepts as intermediate representations. However,
existing CBMs often suffer from input-to-concept mapping bias and limited
controllability, which restricts their practical value, directly damage the
responsibility of strategy from concept-based methods. We propose a lightweight
Disentangled Concept Bottleneck Model (LDCBM) that automatically groups visual
features into semantically meaningful components without region annotation. By
introducing a filter grouping loss and joint concept supervision, our method
improves the alignment between visual patterns and concepts, enabling more
transparent and robust decision-making. Notably, Experiments on three diverse
datasets demonstrate that LDCBM achieves higher concept and class accuracy,
outperforming previous CBMs in both interpretability and classification
performance. By grounding concepts in visual evidence, our method overcomes a
fundamental limitation of prior models and enhances the reliability of

*Haowei Zhu,Tianxiang Pan,Rui Qin,Jun-Hai Yong,Bin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReCon is a novel data augmentation framework that enhances structure-controllable generative models for object detection by integrating region-guided rectification and region-aligned cross-attention during diffusion sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative approaches for data augmentation require complex post-processing or extensive fine-tuning, and suffer from content-position mismatches and semantic leakage, making large-scale annotated data acquisition costly and time-consuming.

Method: ReCon integrates region-guided rectification using feedback from pre-trained perception models to fix misgenerated regions during diffusion sampling, and proposes region-aligned cross-attention to enforce spatial-semantic alignment between image regions and textual cues.

Result: Extensive experiments show ReCon substantially improves the quality and trainability of generated data, achieving consistent performance gains across various datasets, backbone architectures, and data scales.

Conclusion: ReCon effectively overcomes limitations of current generative approaches by improving semantic consistency and image fidelity through its novel rectification and alignment mechanisms during the diffusion process.

Abstract: The scale and quality of datasets are crucial for training robust perception
models. However, obtaining large-scale annotated data is both costly and
time-consuming. Generative models have emerged as a powerful tool for data
augmentation by synthesizing samples that adhere to desired distributions.
However, current generative approaches often rely on complex post-processing or
extensive fine-tuning on massive datasets to achieve satisfactory results, and
they remain prone to content-position mismatches and semantic leakage. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce ReCon, a novel augmentation framework
that enhances the capacity of structure-controllable generative models for
object detection. ReCon integrates region-guided rectification into the
diffusion sampling process, using feedback from a pre-trained perception model
to rectify misgenerated regions within diffusion sampling process. We further
propose region-aligned cross-attention to enforce spatial-semantic alignment
between image regions and their textual cues, thereby improving both semantic
consistency and overall image fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
ReCon substantially improve the quality and trainability of generated data,
achieving consistent performance gains across various datasets, backbone
architectures, and data scales. Our code is available at

TL;DR: ERNet is an efficient feed-forward model for non-rigid sequential point cloud registration that handles noisy/partial inputs and prevents error accumulation using a two-stage deformation graph prediction pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in non-rigid point cloud registration including local minima from non-convex objectives under noisy/partial inputs, and error accumulation over long sequences that causes tracking failures.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: first estimates frame-wise coarse graph nodes for robust initialization, then refines their trajectories over time in sliding-window fashion using temporal information.

Result: Outperforms previous state-of-the-art on DeformingThings4D and D-FAUST datasets, and achieves more than 4x speedup compared to previous best methods.

Conclusion: ERNet provides an efficient and accurate solution for sequential non-rigid registration that is robust to noise and partial inputs while preventing error accumulation.

Abstract: Registering an object shape to a sequence of point clouds undergoing
non-rigid deformation is a long-standing challenge. The key difficulties stem
from two factors: (i) the presence of local minima due to the non-convexity of
registration objectives, especially under noisy or partial inputs, which
hinders accurate and robust deformation estimation, and (ii) error accumulation
over long sequences, leading to tracking failures. To address these challenges,
we introduce to adopt a scalable data-driven approach and propose ERNet, an
efficient feed-forward model trained on large deformation datasets. It is
designed to handle noisy and partial inputs while effectively leveraging
temporal information for accurate and consistent sequential registration. The
key to our design is predicting a sequence of deformation graphs through a
two-stage pipeline, which first estimates frame-wise coarse graph nodes for
robust initialization, before refining their trajectories over time in a
sliding-window fashion. Extensive experiments show that our proposed approach
(i) outperforms previous state-of-the-art on both the DeformingThings4D and
D-FAUST datasets, and (ii) achieves more than 4x speedup compared to the
previous best, offering significant efficiency improvement.

TL;DR: VISTA is a multi-agent system that autonomously improves text-to-video generation through iterative prompt refinement, achieving significant quality improvements over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time optimization methods struggle with video generation's multi-faceted nature, and video quality remains critically dependent on precise user prompts.

Method: VISTA decomposes user ideas into structured temporal plans, identifies best videos through pairwise tournaments, critiques them with specialized agents (visual, audio, contextual), and uses a reasoning agent to rewrite prompts for iterative improvement.

Result: VISTA consistently improves video quality and alignment with user intent, achieving up to 60% pairwise win rate against state-of-the-art baselines, with human evaluators preferring VISTA outputs in 66.4% of comparisons.

Conclusion: VISTA demonstrates that autonomous multi-agent systems can effectively improve text-to-video generation through iterative self-improvement, outperforming existing methods in both single- and multi-scene scenarios.

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in text-to-video synthesis, generated video quality
remains critically dependent on precise user prompts. Existing test-time
optimization methods, successful in other domains, struggle with the
multi-faceted nature of video. In this work, we introduce VISTA (Video
Iterative Self-improvemenT Agent), a novel multi-agent system that autonomously
improves video generation through refining prompts in an iterative loop. VISTA
first decomposes a user idea into a structured temporal plan. After generation,
the best video is identified through a robust pairwise tournament. This winning
video is then critiqued by a trio of specialized agents focusing on visual,
audio, and contextual fidelity. Finally, a reasoning agent synthesizes this
feedback to introspectively rewrite and enhance the prompt for the next
generation cycle. Experiments on single- and multi-scene video generation
scenarios show that while prior methods yield inconsistent gains, VISTA
consistently improves video quality and alignment with user intent, achieving
up to 60% pairwise win rate against state-of-the-art baselines. Human
evaluators concur, preferring VISTA outputs in 66.4% of comparisons.

*Jiayi Lin,Jiabo Huang,Shaogang Gong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RelateSeg introduces neuro-symbolic spatial reasoning using first-order logic to improve open-vocabulary semantic segmentation by enforcing spatial relational constraints between objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language model approaches for OVSS lack understanding of spatial relations between objects, limiting their ability to accurately segment scenes with multiple objects.

Method: Proposes RelateSeg that automatically extracts spatial relations, encodes them as first-order logic formulas using pseudo categories, and formulates these constraints in a neural network using fuzzy logic relaxation for end-to-end learning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across four benchmark datasets, with particular advantages on images containing multiple categories, using only one auxiliary loss and no additional parameters.

Conclusion: Neuro-symbolic spatial reasoning effectively improves open-vocabulary semantic segmentation by enforcing spatial relational consistency.

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS) assigns pixel-level labels from
an open set of categories, requiring generalization to unseen and unlabelled
objects. Using vision-language models (VLMs) to correlate local image patches
with potential unseen object categories suffers from a lack of understanding of
spatial relations of objects in a scene. To solve this problem, we introduce
neuro-symbolic (NeSy) spatial reasoning in OVSS. In contrast to contemporary
VLM correlation-based approaches, we propose Relational Segmentor (RelateSeg)
to impose explicit spatial relational constraints by first order logic (FOL)
formulated in a neural network architecture. This is the first attempt to
explore NeSy spatial reasoning in OVSS. Specifically, RelateSeg automatically
extracts spatial relations, e.g., <cat, to-right-of, person>, and encodes them
as first-order logic formulas using our proposed pseudo categories. Each pixel
learns to predict both a semantic category (e.g., "cat") and a spatial pseudo
category (e.g., "right of person") simultaneously, enforcing relational
constraints (e.g., a "cat" pixel must lie to the right of a "person"). Finally,
these logic constraints are formulated in a deep network architecture by fuzzy
logic relaxation, enabling end-to-end learning of spatial-relationally
consistent segmentation. RelateSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance in
terms of average mIoU across four benchmark datasets and particularly shows
clear advantages on images containing multiple categories, with the cost of
only introducing a single auxiliary loss function and no additional parameters,
validating the effectiveness of NeSy spatial reasoning in OVSS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3DPR is an image-based relighting model that uses generative priors from multi-view OLAT images to render novel relit views of human heads from monocular portrait inputs, achieving superior identity preservation and lighting effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional graphics methods for relighting human heads from monocular images are underconstrained and limited by model assumptions. There's a need for more accurate image-based relighting that preserves identity and captures complex lighting effects.

Method: Uses a pre-trained generative head model for face geometry priors, an encoder-based inversion process to embed input portraits, and a triplane-based reflectance network trained on a new large-scale 4K OLAT dataset to synthesize high-fidelity OLAT images for relighting.

Result: 3DPR outperforms previous methods in quantitative and qualitative evaluations, particularly in preserving identity and capturing lighting effects like specularities, self-shadows, and subsurface scattering.

Conclusion: The proposed 3DPR framework successfully leverages generative priors and a new OLAT dataset to achieve physically accurate environmental relighting from monocular portrait inputs, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Rendering novel, relit views of a human head, given a monocular portrait
image as input, is an inherently underconstrained problem. The traditional
graphics solution is to explicitly decompose the input image into geometry,
material and lighting via differentiable rendering; but this is constrained by
the multiple assumptions and approximations of the underlying models and
parameterizations of these scene components. We propose 3DPR, an image-based
relighting model that leverages generative priors learnt from multi-view
One-Light-at-A-Time (OLAT) images captured in a light stage. We introduce a new
diverse and large-scale multi-view 4K OLAT dataset of 139 subjects to learn a
high-quality prior over the distribution of high-frequency face reflectance. We
leverage the latent space of a pre-trained generative head model that provides
a rich prior over face geometry learnt from in-the-wild image datasets. The
input portrait is first embedded in the latent manifold of such a model through
an encoder-based inversion process. Then a novel triplane-based reflectance
network trained on our lightstage data is used to synthesize high-fidelity OLAT
images to enable image-based relighting. Our reflectance network operates in
the latent space of the generative head model, crucially enabling a relatively
small number of lightstage images to train the reflectance model. Combining the
generated OLATs according to a given HDRI environment maps yields physically
accurate environmental relighting results. Through quantitative and qualitative
evaluations, we demonstrate that 3DPR outperforms previous methods,
particularly in preserving identity and in capturing lighting effects such as
specularities, self-shadows, and subsurface scattering. Project Page:

TL;DR: Memory-SAM is a training-free pipeline that automatically generates prompts for SAM2 using DINOv3 features and FAISS retrieval from prior cases, achieving superior tongue segmentation performance without manual intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised models need large annotated datasets and SAM-family models require manual prompts, creating barriers for reliable TCM tongue analysis.

Method: Uses dense DINOv3 features and FAISS retrieval to automatically generate foreground/background point prompts from a memory of prior cases, guiding SAM2 without training or manual clicks.

Result: Achieves mIoU 0.9863 on mixed test data, significantly outperforming FCN (0.8188) and detector-to-box SAM baseline (0.1839), with clear gains in real-world conditions.

Conclusion: Retrieval-to-prompt enables data-efficient, robust segmentation of irregular tongue boundaries, providing a practical solution for TCM analysis without manual intervention.

Abstract: Accurate tongue segmentation is crucial for reliable TCM analysis. Supervised
models require large annotated datasets, while SAM-family models remain
prompt-driven. We present Memory-SAM, a training-free, human-prompt-free
pipeline that automatically generates effective prompts from a small memory of
prior cases via dense DINOv3 features and FAISS retrieval. Given a query image,
mask-constrained correspondences to the retrieved exemplar are distilled into
foreground/background point prompts that guide SAM2 without manual clicks or
model fine-tuning. We evaluate on 600 expert-annotated images (300 controlled,
300 in-the-wild). On the mixed test split, Memory-SAM achieves mIoU 0.9863,
surpassing FCN (0.8188) and a detector-to-box SAM baseline (0.1839). On
controlled data, ceiling effects above 0.98 make small differences less
meaningful given annotation variability, while our method shows clear gains
under real-world conditions. Results indicate that retrieval-to-prompt enables
data-efficient, robust segmentation of irregular boundaries in tongue imaging.

Motivation: To advance native image generation by unifying text-to-image generation and image editing within a single architecture, addressing challenges in image editing and pushing the frontier of native image generation capabilities.

Method: Uses an Autoregressive + Diffusion architecture where an autoregressive model generates discrete image tokens conditioned on multimodal inputs, and these hidden states serve as conditioning signals for a diffusion model to generate high-fidelity images.

Result: Achieves superior performance over existing models on various text-to-image and image-editing benchmarks, demonstrating strong image generation and editing capabilities with enhanced coherence and realism.

Conclusion: The model successfully integrates reasoning strength and instruction following of autoregressive models with fine-detail rendering ability of diffusion models, while identifying that data quality/scale and reinforcement learning are key factors for advancing native image generation.

Abstract: We present BLIP3o-NEXT, a fully open-source foundation model in the BLIP3
series that advances the next frontier of native image generation. BLIP3o-NEXT
unifies text-to-image generation and image editing within a single
architecture, demonstrating strong image generation and image editing
capabilities. In developing the state-of-the-art native image generation model,
we identify four key insights: (1) Most architectural choices yield comparable
performance; an architecture can be deemed effective provided it scales
efficiently and supports fast inference; (2) The successful application of
reinforcement learning can further push the frontier of native image
generation; (3) Image editing still remains a challenging task, yet instruction
following and the consistency between generated and reference images can be
significantly enhanced through post-training and data engine; (4) Data quality
and scale continue to be decisive factors that determine the upper bound of
model performance. Building upon these insights, BLIP3o-NEXT leverages an
Autoregressive + Diffusion architecture in which an autoregressive model first
generates discrete image tokens conditioned on multimodal inputs, whose hidden
states are then used as conditioning signals for a diffusion model to generate
high-fidelity images. This architecture integrates the reasoning strength and
instruction following of autoregressive models with the fine-detail rendering
ability of diffusion models, achieving a new level of coherence and realism.
Extensive evaluations of various text-to-image and image-editing benchmarks
show that BLIP3o-NEXT achieves superior performance over existing models.

TL;DR: BiomedXPro is an evolutionary framework that uses LLMs to generate diverse, interpretable natural-language prompt pairs for biomedical vision-language models, improving performance and trustworthiness in clinical diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current prompt optimization methods produce uninterpretable latent vectors or single prompts, lacking transparency and failing to capture the multi-faceted nature of clinical diagnosis, which limits trust in high-stakes medical settings.

Method: Uses evolutionary framework with LLM as biomedical knowledge extractor and adaptive optimizer to automatically generate diverse ensemble of interpretable natural-language prompt pairs for disease diagnosis.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art prompt-tuning methods across multiple biomedical benchmarks, especially in data-scarce few-shot settings, with strong semantic alignment between discovered prompts and clinically significant features.

Conclusion: BiomedXPro provides verifiable basis for model predictions through diverse interpretable prompts, representing critical advancement toward trustworthy and clinically-aligned AI systems.

Abstract: The clinical adoption of biomedical vision-language models is hindered by
prompt optimization techniques that produce either uninterpretable latent
vectors or single textual prompts. This lack of transparency and failure to
capture the multi-faceted nature of clinical diagnosis, which relies on
integrating diverse observations, limits their trustworthiness in high-stakes
settings. To address this, we introduce BiomedXPro, an evolutionary framework
that leverages a large language model as both a biomedical knowledge extractor
and an adaptive optimizer to automatically generate a diverse ensemble of
interpretable, natural-language prompt pairs for disease diagnosis. Experiments
on multiple biomedical benchmarks show that BiomedXPro consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art prompt-tuning methods, particularly in data-scarce few-shot
settings. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates a strong semantic alignment
between the discovered prompts and statistically significant clinical features,
grounding the model's performance in verifiable concepts. By producing a
diverse ensemble of interpretable prompts, BiomedXPro provides a verifiable
basis for model predictions, representing a critical step toward the
development of more trustworthy and clinically-aligned AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of large-scale, high-quality real-world 3D scans makes it challenging to train generalizable generative models for creating explorable 3D urban scenes.

Method: Synergizes satellite imagery (for coarse geometry) with open-domain diffusion models (for close-up appearances), using a curriculum-driven iterative refinement strategy to progressively enhance geometry and textures.

Result: Skyfall-GS provides improved cross-view consistent geometry and more realistic textures compared to state-of-the-art approaches, enabling city-block scale 3D scene creation with real-time immersive exploration.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully creates large-scale, geometrically accurate 3D urban scenes without costly 3D annotations, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Synthesizing large-scale, explorable, and geometrically accurate 3D urban
scenes is a challenging yet valuable task in providing immersive and embodied
applications. The challenges lie in the lack of large-scale and high-quality
real-world 3D scans for training generalizable generative models. In this
paper, we take an alternative route to create large-scale 3D scenes by
synergizing the readily available satellite imagery that supplies realistic
coarse geometry and the open-domain diffusion model for creating high-quality
close-up appearances. We propose \textbf{Skyfall-GS}, the first city-block
scale 3D scene creation framework without costly 3D annotations, also featuring
real-time, immersive 3D exploration. We tailor a curriculum-driven iterative
refinement strategy to progressively enhance geometric completeness and
photorealistic textures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Skyfall-GS
provides improved cross-view consistent geometry and more realistic textures
compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance machine intelligence by developing multimodal perception capabilities similar to human sensing, requiring models that can understand and reason across different modalities like vision and audio.

Method: Three key innovations: (1) OmniAlignNet for aligning vision and audio embeddings in shared latent space, (2) Temporal Embedding Grouping for relative temporal alignment, (3) Constrained Rotary Time Embedding for absolute temporal encoding. Plus a curation pipeline generating 24M multimodal conversations.

Result: Outperforms Qwen2.5-Omni with +19.05 on DailyOmni (cross-modal), +1.7 on MMAR (audio), +3.9 on Video-MME (vision), using only 0.2T training tokens (6x reduction from Qwen2.5-Omni's 1.2T). Modalities reinforce each other in perception and reasoning.

Conclusion: OmniVinci demonstrates effective omni-modal capabilities with efficient training, showing advantages in downstream applications including robotics, medical AI, and smart factory scenarios.

Abstract: Advancing machine intelligence requires developing the ability to perceive
across multiple modalities, much as humans sense the world. We introduce
OmniVinci, an initiative to build a strong, open-source, omni-modal LLM. We
carefully study the design choices across model architecture and data curation.
For model architecture, we present three key innovations: (i) OmniAlignNet for
strengthening alignment between vision and audio embeddings in a shared
omni-modal latent space; (ii) Temporal Embedding Grouping for capturing
relative temporal alignment between vision and audio signals; and (iii)
Constrained Rotary Time Embedding for encoding absolute temporal information in
omni-modal embeddings. We introduce a curation and synthesis pipeline that
generates 24M single-modal and omni-modal conversations. We find that
modalities reinforce one another in both perception and reasoning. Our model,
OmniVinci, outperforms Qwen2.5-Omni with +19.05 on DailyOmni (cross-modal
understanding), +1.7 on MMAR (audio), and +3.9 on Video-MME (vision), while
using just 0.2T training tokens - a 6 times reduction compared to
Qwen2.5-Omni's 1.2T. We finally demonstrate omni-modal advantages in downstream
applications spanning robotics, medical AI, and smart factory.
