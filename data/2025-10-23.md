*Nathan Mankovich,Kai-Hendrik Cohrs,Homer Durand,Vasileios Sitokonstantinou,Tristan Williams,Gustau Camps-Valls*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper reviews dimensionality reduction techniques for Earth observation data to address challenges of high-dimensional data and improve machine learning effectiveness across various applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Earth observation generates massive datasets that are crucial for societal challenges but suffer from high dimensionality issues like sparsity and inefficiency that limit machine learning models.

Method: The paper provides a comprehensive review and handbook of dimensionality reduction techniques, specifically feature extraction methods, for remote sensing data throughout the value chain.

Result: The review identifies how dimensionality reduction preserves essential data properties while reducing complexity and enhancing tasks like compression, visualization, anomaly detection, and prediction.

Conclusion: The paper serves as a guide for applying dimensionality reduction in remote sensing and identifies opportunities for under-explored algorithms and future research directions.

Abstract: Earth observation involves collecting, analyzing, and processing an
ever-growing mass of data. Automatically harvesting information is crucial for
addressing significant societal, economic, and environmental challenges,
ranging from environmental monitoring to urban planning and disaster
management. However, the high dimensionality of these data poses challenges in
terms of sparsity, inefficiency, and the curse of dimensionality, which limits
the effectiveness of machine learning models. Dimensionality reduction (DR)
techniques, specifically feature extraction, address these challenges by
preserving essential data properties while reducing complexity and enhancing
tasks such as data compression, cleaning, fusion, visualization, anomaly
detection, and prediction. This review provides a handbook for leveraging DR
across the RS data value chain and identifies opportunities for under-explored
DR algorithms and their application in future research.

*Yuichiro Takeuchi,Yusuke Imoto,Shunya Kato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ninja Codes are stealthy neural fiducial markers that blend into environments while enabling 6-DoF location tracking for AR, robotics, and other applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional fiducial markers are too conspicuous for aesthetic reasons, limiting their use in real-world applications where visual stealth is important.

Method: An encoder network applies subtle visual alterations to images to create Ninja Codes, using an end-to-end deep steganography-inspired approach with joint training of creation and detection modules.

Result: Ninja Codes provide reliable 6-DoF location tracking under common indoor lighting conditions while successfully concealing themselves within diverse environmental textures using regular printers and RGB cameras.

Conclusion: Ninja Codes offer particular value in scenarios where conventional markers' conspicuous appearance is undesirable, enabling stealthy location tracking for various applications.

Abstract: In this paper we describe Ninja Codes, neurally-generated fiducial markers
that can be made to naturally blend into various real-world environments. An
encoder network converts arbitrary images into Ninja Codes by applying visually
modest alterations; the resulting codes, printed and pasted onto surfaces, can
provide stealthy 6-DoF location tracking for a wide range of applications
including augmented reality, robotics, motion-based user interfaces, etc. Ninja
Codes can be printed using off-the-shelf color printers on regular printing
paper, and can be detected using any device equipped with a modern RGB camera
and capable of running inference. Using an end-to-end process inspired by prior
work on deep steganography, we jointly train a series of network modules that
perform the creation and detection of Ninja Codes. Through experiments, we
demonstrate Ninja Codes' ability to provide reliable location tracking under
common indoor lighting conditions, while successfully concealing themselves
within diverse environmental textures. We expect Ninja Codes to offer
particular value in scenarios where the conspicuous appearances of conventional
fiducial markers make them undesirable for aesthetic and other reasons.

### [3] [Robust Driving QA through Metadata-Grounded Context and Task-Specific Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19001)
*Seungjun Yu,Junsung Park,Youngsun Lim,Hyunjung Shim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-phase vision-language QA system for autonomous driving that uses multimodal LLMs with camera inputs, temporal history, and chain-of-thought prompting to answer perception, prediction, and planning questions, achieving significant accuracy improvements over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a robust question-answering system for autonomous driving that can handle high-level perception, prediction, and planning tasks by leveraging multimodal language models with proper contextual grounding and prompting strategies.

Method: Two-phase approach: Phase-1 uses Qwen2.5-VL-32B with six-camera inputs, temporal history, chain-of-thought prompting with few-shot exemplars, and self-consistency ensemble. Phase-2 augments with nuScenes scene metadata and category-specific question instructions for different task types.

Result: Achieved 67.37% overall accuracy, with Phase-1 reaching 65.1% (vs 62.61% zero-shot) and 66.85% with self-consistency. System maintains 96% accuracy under severe visual corruption, significantly outperforming baseline Qwen2.5 models.

Conclusion: Carefully engineered prompts and contextual grounding can greatly enhance high-level driving QA performance with pretrained vision-language models, demonstrating the importance of proper prompting strategies and multimodal context integration.

Abstract: We present a two-phase vision-language QA system for autonomous driving that
answers high-level perception, prediction, and planning questions. In Phase-1,
a large multimodal LLM (Qwen2.5-VL-32B) is conditioned on six-camera inputs, a
short temporal window of history, and a chain-of-thought prompt with few-shot
exemplars. A self-consistency ensemble (multiple sampled reasoning chains)
further improves answer reliability. In Phase-2, we augment the prompt with
nuScenes scene metadata (object annotations, ego-vehicle state, etc.) and
category-specific question instructions (separate prompts for perception,
prediction, planning tasks). In experiments on a driving QA benchmark, our
approach significantly outperforms the baseline Qwen2.5 models. For example,
using 5 history frames and 10-shot prompting in Phase-1 yields 65.1% overall
accuracy (vs.62.61% with zero-shot); applying self-consistency raises this to
66.85%. Phase-2 achieves 67.37% overall. Notably, the system maintains 96%
accuracy under severe visual corruption. These results demonstrate that
carefully engineered prompts and contextual grounding can greatly enhance
high-level driving QA with pretrained vision-language models.

### [4] [$Δ$t-Mamba3D: A Time-Aware Spatio-Temporal State-Space Model for Breast Cancer Risk Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19003)
*Zhengbo Zhou,Dooman Arefan,Margarita Zuley,Shandong Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Time-Aware Δt-Mamba3D is a novel state-space architecture for longitudinal medical imaging that handles irregular time intervals and high-resolution images efficiently, achieving superior breast cancer risk prediction performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods fail to fully exploit spatial and temporal cues in sequential radiological images captured at irregular intervals, often compromising spatial information or being computationally inefficient.

Method: A state-space architecture with continuous-time selective scanning that integrates true time differences between exams into state transitions, complemented by a multi-scale 3D neighborhood fusion module for spatio-temporal relationships.

Result: Superior performance in breast cancer risk prediction, improving validation c-index by 2-5 percentage points and achieving higher 1-5 year AUC scores compared to recurrent, transformer, and state-space models.

Conclusion: The model efficiently processes long patient screening histories with linear complexity, forming a new framework for longitudinal image analysis.

Abstract: Longitudinal analysis of sequential radiological images is hampered by a
fundamental data challenge: how to effectively model a sequence of
high-resolution images captured at irregular time intervals. This data
structure contains indispensable spatial and temporal cues that current methods
fail to fully exploit. Models often compromise by either collapsing spatial
information into vectors or applying spatio-temporal models that are
computationally inefficient and incompatible with non-uniform time steps. We
address this challenge with Time-Aware $\Delta$t-Mamba3D, a novel state-space
architecture adapted for longitudinal medical imaging. Our model simultaneously
encodes irregular inter-visit intervals and rich spatio-temporal context while
remaining computationally efficient. Its core innovation is a continuous-time
selective scanning mechanism that explicitly integrates the true time
difference between exams into its state transitions. This is complemented by a
multi-scale 3D neighborhood fusion module that robustly captures
spatio-temporal relationships. In a comprehensive breast cancer risk prediction
benchmark using sequential screening mammogram exams, our model shows superior
performance, improving the validation c-index by 2-5 percentage points and
achieving higher 1-5 year AUC scores compared to established variants of
recurrent, transformer, and state-space models. Thanks to its linear
complexity, the model can efficiently process long and complex patient
screening histories of mammograms, forming a new framework for longitudinal
image analysis.

### [5] [MoAlign: Motion-Centric Representation Alignment for Video Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19022)
*Aritra Bhowmik,Denis Korzhenkov,Cees G. M. Snoek,Amirhossein Habibian,Mohsen Ghafoorian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A motion-centric alignment framework that disentangles motion features from pretrained video encoders to improve temporal coherence and physical plausibility in text-to-video diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-video diffusion models often fail to generate temporally coherent and physically plausible motion due to insufficient understanding of complex motions. Existing methods using pretrained video encoders mix appearance and dynamics into entangled features, limiting alignment effectiveness.

Method: Proposes learning a disentangled motion subspace from a pretrained video encoder optimized to predict ground-truth optical flow. Then aligns latent features of text-to-video diffusion model to this motion subspace.

Result: Improves physical commonsense in state-of-the-art video diffusion model while preserving adherence to textual prompts, validated on VideoPhy, VideoPhy2, VBench, and VBench-2.0 benchmarks and user study.

Conclusion: The motion-centric alignment framework successfully enables generative models to internalize motion knowledge and generate more plausible videos with better temporal coherence and physical realism.

Abstract: Text-to-video diffusion models have enabled high-quality video synthesis, yet
often fail to generate temporally coherent and physically plausible motion. A
key reason is the models' insufficient understanding of complex motions that
natural videos often entail. Recent works tackle this problem by aligning
diffusion model features with those from pretrained video encoders. However,
these encoders mix video appearance and dynamics into entangled features,
limiting the benefit of such alignment. In this paper, we propose a
motion-centric alignment framework that learns a disentangled motion subspace
from a pretrained video encoder. This subspace is optimized to predict
ground-truth optical flow, ensuring it captures true motion dynamics. We then
align the latent features of a text-to-video diffusion model to this new
subspace, enabling the generative model to internalize motion knowledge and
generate more plausible videos. Our method improves the physical commonsense in
a state-of-the-art video diffusion model, while preserving adherence to textual
prompts, as evidenced by empirical evaluations on VideoPhy, VideoPhy2, VBench,
and VBench-2.0, along with a user study.

### [6] [PoSh: Using Scene Graphs To Guide LLMs-as-a-Judge For Detailed Image Descriptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19060)
*Amith Ananthram,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Lorena A. Bradford,Julia Demarest,Adam Purvis,Keith Krut,Robert Stein,Rina Elster Pantalony,Mohit Bansal,Kathleen McKeown*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PoSh is a new metric for evaluating detailed image descriptions that uses scene graphs to guide LLM judges, providing fine-grained error analysis and better correlation with human judgments than existing metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard evaluation metrics like CIDEr and SPICE were designed for short texts and don't effectively assess detailed image descriptions, which require sensitivity to attributes, relations, and localized error detection.

Method: PoSh uses scene graphs as structured rubrics to guide LLMs-as-a-Judge, producing aggregate scores based on fine-grained errors in compositional understanding. The method is validated using a new dataset called DOCENT containing artwork with expert references and human judgments.

Result: PoSh achieves stronger correlations (+0.05 Spearman ρ) with human judgments than alternatives, is robust across image types, and works well as a reward function that outperforms standard supervised fine-tuning. It reveals that foundation models struggle with full coverage of images with rich scene dynamics.

Conclusion: PoSh and DOCENT provide better tools for evaluating detailed image descriptions and establish a challenging new benchmark for VLM progress, enabling advances in areas like assistive text generation.

Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced into detailed image
description, evaluation remains a challenge. Standard metrics (e.g. CIDEr,
SPICE) were designed for short texts and tuned to recognize errors that are now
uncommon, such as object misidentification. In contrast, long texts require
sensitivity to attribute and relation attachments and scores that localize
errors to particular text spans. In this work, we introduce PoSh, a metric for
detailed image description that uses scene graphs as structured rubrics to
guide LLMs-as-a-Judge, producing aggregate scores grounded in fine-grained
errors (e.g. mistakes in compositional understanding). PoSh is replicable,
interpretable and a better proxy for human raters than existing metrics
(including GPT4o-as-a-Judge). To validate PoSh, we introduce a challenging new
dataset, DOCENT. This novel benchmark contains artwork, paired with
expert-written references, and model-generated descriptions, augmented with
granular and coarse judgments of their quality from art history students. Thus,
DOCENT enables evaluating both detailed image description metrics and detailed
image description itself in a challenging new domain. We show that PoSh
achieves stronger correlations (+0.05 Spearman $\rho$) with the human judgments
in DOCENT than the best open-weight alternatives, is robust to image type
(using CapArena, an existing dataset of web imagery) and is a capable reward
function, outperforming standard supervised fine-tuning. Then, using PoSh, we
characterize the performance of open and closed models in describing the
paintings, sketches and statues in DOCENT and find that foundation models
struggle to achieve full, error-free coverage of images with rich scene
dynamics, establishing a demanding new task to gauge VLM progress. Through both
PoSh and DOCENT, we hope to enable advances in important areas such as
assistive text generation.

### [7] [UniHPR: Unified Human Pose Representation via Singular Value Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19078)
*Zhongyu Jiang,Wenhao Chai,Lei Li,Zhuoran Zhou,Cheng-Yen Yang,Jenq-Neng Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniHPR is a unified Human Pose Representation learning pipeline that aligns embeddings from images, 2D and 3D human poses using a novel singular value-based contrastive learning loss, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 3D pose estimation and enabling cross-modal pose retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is growing interest in multi-modal alignment for human-centric applications, but limited research on correlating diverse human pose representations (images, 2D keypoints, 3D skeletons, mesh models) using contrastive learning paradigms.

Method: Proposed UniHPR pipeline with novel singular value-based contrastive learning loss to align multiple human pose representations simultaneously from images, 2D and 3D poses.

Result: Achieved MPJPE 49.9mm on Human3.6M and PA-MPJPE 51.6mm on 3DPW with cross-domain evaluation. Enabled 2D/3D pose retrieval with 9.24mm MPJPE error on Human3.6M.

Conclusion: UniHPR effectively aligns diverse human pose representations and demonstrates strong performance on pose estimation tasks while enabling cross-modal retrieval capabilities.

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing effective
alignment pipelines to generate unified representations from different
modalities for multi-modal fusion and generation. As an important component of
Human-Centric applications, Human Pose representations are critical in many
downstream tasks, such as Human Pose Estimation, Action Recognition,
Human-Computer Interaction, Object tracking, etc. Human Pose representations or
embeddings can be extracted from images, 2D keypoints, 3D skeletons, mesh
models, and lots of other modalities. Yet, there are limited instances where
the correlation among all of those representations has been clearly researched
using a contrastive paradigm. In this paper, we propose UniHPR, a unified Human
Pose Representation learning pipeline, which aligns Human Pose embeddings from
images, 2D and 3D human poses. To align more than two data representations at
the same time, we propose a novel singular value-based contrastive learning
loss, which better aligns different modalities and further boosts performance.
To evaluate the effectiveness of the aligned representation, we choose 2D and
3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE) as our evaluation tasks. In our evaluation, with
a simple 3D human pose decoder, UniHPR achieves remarkable performance metrics:
MPJPE 49.9mm on the Human3.6M dataset and PA-MPJPE 51.6mm on the 3DPW dataset
with cross-domain evaluation. Meanwhile, we are able to achieve 2D and 3D pose
retrieval with our unified human pose representations in Human3.6M dataset,
where the retrieval error is 9.24mm in MPJPE.

Conclusion: The proposed attention-enhanced 3D U-Net model effectively improves brain tumor segmentation performance, offering valuable insights for reliable diagnosis in clinical settings.

Abstract: In the realm of medical diagnostics, rapid advancements in Artificial
Intelligence (AI) have significantly yielded remarkable improvements in brain
tumor segmentation. Encoder-Decoder architectures, such as U-Net, have played a
transformative role by effectively extracting meaningful representations in 3D
brain tumor segmentation from Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. However,
standard U-Net models encounter challenges in accurately delineating tumor
regions, especially when dealing with irregular shapes and ambiguous
boundaries. Additionally, training robust segmentation models on
high-resolution MRI data, such as the BraTS datasets, necessitates high
computational resources and often faces challenges associated with class
imbalance. This study proposes the integration of the attention mechanism into
the 3D U-Net model, enabling the model to capture intricate details and
prioritize informative regions during the segmentation process. Additionally, a
tumor detection algorithm based on digital image processing techniques is
utilized to address the issue of imbalanced training data and mitigate bias.
This study aims to enhance the performance of brain tumor segmentation,
ultimately improving the reliability of diagnosis. The proposed model is
thoroughly evaluated and assessed on the BraTS 2020 dataset using various
performance metrics to accomplish this goal. The obtained results indicate that
the model outperformed related studies, exhibiting dice of 0.975, specificity
of 0.988, and sensitivity of 0.995, indicating the efficacy of the proposed
model in improving brain tumor segmentation, offering valuable insights for
reliable diagnosis in clinical settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper applies Federated Proximal (FedProx) method to non-IID ultrasound breast cancer imaging datasets for enhanced tumor segmentation while preserving patient privacy, achieving 96% accuracy with a modified U-Net model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Breast cancer is a leading cause of death among women, requiring early detection. Ultrasound imaging is cost-effective but medical data privacy challenges limit AI model development. Non-IID data distribution in federated learning affects model accuracy for tumor boundary delineation.

Method: Applied Federated Proximal (FedProx) method to non-IID ultrasonic breast cancer imaging datasets. Incorporated a modified U-Net model with attention mechanisms to enhance tumor segmentation accuracy while preserving patient privacy.

Result: The approach resulted in a global model with 96% accuracy, demonstrating effectiveness in enhancing tumor segmentation accuracy while maintaining patient privacy.

Conclusion: FedProx shows potential as a promising approach for training precise machine learning models on non-IID local medical datasets, balancing accuracy with privacy preservation.

Abstract: Breast cancer is a leading cause of death among women worldwide, emphasizing
the need for early detection and accurate diagnosis. As such Ultrasound
Imaging, a reliable and cost-effective tool, is used for this purpose, however
the sensitive nature of medical data makes it challenging to develop accurate
and private artificial intelligence models. A solution is Federated Learning as
it is a promising technique for distributed machine learning on sensitive
medical data while preserving patient privacy. However, training on
non-Independent and non-Identically Distributed (non-IID) local datasets can
impact the accuracy and generalization of the trained model, which is crucial
for accurate tumour boundary delineation in BC segmentation. This study aims to
tackle this challenge by applying the Federated Proximal (FedProx) method to
non-IID Ultrasonic Breast Cancer Imaging datasets. Moreover, we focus on
enhancing tumour segmentation accuracy by incorporating a modified U-Net model
with attention mechanisms. Our approach resulted in a global model with 96%
accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in enhancing tumour
segmentation accuracy while preserving patient privacy. Our findings suggest
that FedProx has the potential to be a promising approach for training precise
machine learning models on non-IID local medical datasets.

*Yunzhe Wang,Soham Hans,Volkan Ustun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: X-Ego-CS dataset provides synchronized first-person video streams from Counter-Strike 2 matches, enabling multi-agent decision-making research. Cross-Ego Contrastive Learning (CECL) aligns teammates' egocentric views to improve tactical awareness and location prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video understanding approaches rely on third-person views and overlook the synchronous, egocentric nature of multi-agent learning in team sports and esports.

Method: Created X-Ego-CS dataset with 124 hours of synchronized first-person gameplay footage from 45 professional Counter-Strike 2 matches. Proposed Cross-Ego Contrastive Learning (CECL) to align teammates' egocentric visual streams for team-level tactical awareness.

Result: CECL demonstrated effectiveness in teammate-opponent location prediction task, enhancing agents' ability to infer both teammate and opponent positions from single first-person view using state-of-the-art video encoders.

Conclusion: X-Ego-CS and CECL establish foundation for cross-egocentric multi-agent benchmarking in esports, positioning gameplay understanding as testbed for multi-agent modeling and tactical learning with implications for spatiotemporal reasoning and human-AI teaming.

Abstract: Human team tactics emerge from each player's individual perspective and their
ability to anticipate, interpret, and adapt to teammates' intentions. While
advances in video understanding have improved the modeling of team interactions
in sports, most existing work relies on third-person broadcast views and
overlooks the synchronous, egocentric nature of multi-agent learning. We
introduce X-Ego-CS, a benchmark dataset consisting of 124 hours of gameplay
footage from 45 professional-level matches of the popular e-sports game
Counter-Strike 2, designed to facilitate research on multi-agent
decision-making in complex 3D environments. X-Ego-CS provides cross-egocentric
video streams that synchronously capture all players' first-person perspectives
along with state-action trajectories. Building on this resource, we propose
Cross-Ego Contrastive Learning (CECL), which aligns teammates' egocentric
visual streams to foster team-level tactical situational awareness from an
individual's perspective. We evaluate CECL on a teammate-opponent location
prediction task, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing an agent's
ability to infer both teammate and opponent positions from a single
first-person view using state-of-the-art video encoders. Together, X-Ego-CS and
CECL establish a foundation for cross-egocentric multi-agent benchmarking in
esports. More broadly, our work positions gameplay understanding as a testbed
for multi-agent modeling and tactical learning, with implications for
spatiotemporal reasoning and human-AI teaming in both virtual and real-world
domains. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/HATS-ICT/x-ego.

### [12] [Malaria Detection from Blood Cell Images Using XceptionNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19182)
*Warisa Nusrat,Mostafijur Rahman,Ayatullah Faruk Mollah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning networks applied to detect malaria from blood cell images, with Residual Attention Network and XceptionNet achieving over 97% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual malaria diagnosis through microscope observation is prone to errors due to lack of expertise and manual involvement, requiring automated computer-aided diagnosis.

Method: Applied six deep convolutional networks (AlexNet, XceptionNet, VGG-19, Residual Attention Network, DenseNet-121, Custom-CNN) to extract features from blood cell images and classify them as malaria infected or healthy.

Result: Residual Attention Network achieved 97.28% accuracy and XceptionNet achieved 97.55% accuracy, outperforming other methods on the same dataset.

Conclusion: Deep learning methods provide reliable automatic malaria detection while minimizing manual involvement, demonstrating practical feasibility for real-world applications.

Abstract: Malaria, which primarily spreads with the bite of female anopheles mosquitos,
often leads to death of people - specifically children in the age-group of 0-5
years. Clinical experts identify malaria by observing RBCs in blood smeared
images with a microscope. Lack of adequate professional knowledge and skills,
and most importantly manual involvement may cause incorrect diagnosis.
Therefore, computer aided automatic diagnosis stands as a preferred substitute.
In this paper, well-demonstrated deep networks have been applied to extract
deep intrinsic features from blood cell images and thereafter classify them as
malaria infected or healthy cells. Among the six deep convolutional networks
employed in this work viz. AlexNet, XceptionNet, VGG-19, Residual Attention
Network, DenseNet-121 and Custom-CNN. Residual Attention Network and
XceptionNet perform relatively better than the rest on a publicly available
malaria cell image dataset. They yield an average accuracy of 97.28% and 97.55%
respectively, that surpasses other related methods on the same dataset. These
findings highly encourage the reality of deep learning driven method for
automatic and reliable detection of malaria while minimizing direct manual
involvement.

### [13] [PruneHal: Reducing Hallucinations in Multi-modal Large Language Models through Adaptive KV Cache Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19183)
*Fengyuan Sun,Hui Chen,Xinhao Xu,Dandan Zheng,Jingdong Chen,Jun Zhou,Jungong Han,Guiguang Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PruneHal is a training-free method that uses adaptive KV cache pruning to reduce hallucinations in multi-modal large language models by focusing attention on critical visual tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in MLLMs are strongly associated with insufficient attention to visual tokens, where redundant visual tokens disperse the model's attention from the most informative ones.

Method: Proposes PruneHal, a training-free method that leverages adaptive KV cache pruning to enhance focus on critical visual information without requiring additional training or incurring extra inference costs.

Result: Evaluated on several hallucination benchmarks using four mainstream MLLMs, achieving robust and outstanding results that demonstrate effectiveness and superiority.

Conclusion: PruneHal is a simple yet effective, model-agnostic method that can be seamlessly integrated with different decoding strategies to mitigate hallucinations in MLLMs.

Abstract: While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant
progress in recent years, the issue of hallucinations remains a major
challenge. To mitigate this phenomenon, existing solutions either introduce
additional data for further training or incorporate external or internal
information during inference. However, these approaches inevitably introduce
extra computational costs. In this paper, we observe that hallucinations in
MLLMs are strongly associated with insufficient attention allocated to visual
tokens. In particular, the presence of redundant visual tokens disperses the
model's attention, preventing it from focusing on the most informative ones. As
a result, critical visual cues are often under-attended, which in turn
exacerbates the occurrence of hallucinations. Building on this observation, we
propose \textbf{PruneHal}, a training-free, simple yet effective method that
leverages adaptive KV cache pruning to enhance the model's focus on critical
visual information, thereby mitigating hallucinations. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to apply token pruning for hallucination mitigation
in MLLMs. Notably, our method don't require additional training and incurs
nearly no extra inference cost. Moreover, PruneHal is model-agnostic and can be
seamlessly integrated with different decoding strategies, including those
specifically designed for hallucination mitigation. We evaluate PruneHal on
several widely used hallucination evaluation benchmarks using four mainstream
MLLMs, achieving robust and outstanding results that highlight the
effectiveness and superiority of our method. Our code will be publicly
available.

*Takehiro Aoshima,Yusuke Shinohara,Park Byeongseon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Video Consistency Distance (VCD), a novel metric for enhancing temporal consistency in image-to-video generation through reward-based fine-tuning of video diffusion models.


<details>

Motivation: Conventional reward functions mainly focus on overall video quality but often fail to maintain temporal consistency in image-to-video generation tasks, leading to incoherent video sequences.

Method: Defines VCD in the frequency space of video frame features to capture frame information effectively through frequency-domain analysis, and integrates it into a reward-based fine-tuning framework for video diffusion models.

Result: Experimental results across multiple I2V datasets show that fine-tuning with VCD significantly enhances temporal consistency without degrading other performance metrics compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: VCD effectively addresses temporal consistency limitations in I2V generation and provides a robust solution for improving video coherence while maintaining overall quality.

Abstract: Reward-based fine-tuning of video diffusion models is an effective approach
to improve the quality of generated videos, as it can fine-tune models without
requiring real-world video datasets. However, it can sometimes be limited to
specific performances because conventional reward functions are mainly aimed at
enhancing the quality across the whole generated video sequence, such as
aesthetic appeal and overall consistency. Notably, the temporal consistency of
the generated video often suffers when applying previous approaches to
image-to-video (I2V) generation tasks. To address this limitation, we propose
Video Consistency Distance (VCD), a novel metric designed to enhance temporal
consistency, and fine-tune a model with the reward-based fine-tuning framework.
To achieve coherent temporal consistency relative to a conditioning image, VCD
is defined in the frequency space of video frame features to capture frame
information effectively through frequency-domain analysis. Experimental results
across multiple I2V datasets demonstrate that fine-tuning a video generation
model with VCD significantly enhances temporal consistency without degrading
other performance compared to the previous method.

TL;DR: Dream4Drive is a synthetic data generation framework that creates multi-view photorealistic videos for autonomous driving perception tasks, addressing the limitation of existing methods that overlook downstream perception evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing driving world models focus on generation quality metrics but neglect evaluation of downstream perception tasks, which are crucial for autonomous driving performance. Current synthetic data approaches require double training epochs compared to real-only baselines, making their benefits questionable.

Method: Dream4Drive decomposes input videos into 3D-aware guidance maps, renders 3D assets onto these maps, and fine-tunes a driving world model to produce edited multi-view photorealistic videos. It also introduces DriveObj3D, a large-scale 3D asset dataset for driving scenarios.

Result: The framework enables unprecedented flexibility in generating multi-view corner cases at scale, significantly boosting corner case perception in autonomous driving. Experiments show Dream4Drive effectively enhances downstream perception models across various training epochs.

Conclusion: Dream4Drive provides a novel approach to synthetic data generation that genuinely benefits downstream perception tasks in autonomous driving, overcoming limitations of existing methods and demonstrating practical value through comprehensive experimental validation.

Abstract: Recent advancements in driving world models enable controllable generation of
high-quality RGB videos or multimodal videos. Existing methods primarily focus
on metrics related to generation quality and controllability. However, they
often overlook the evaluation of downstream perception tasks, which are
$\mathbf{really\ crucial}$ for the performance of autonomous driving. Existing
methods usually leverage a training strategy that first pretrains on synthetic
data and finetunes on real data, resulting in twice the epochs compared to the
baseline (real data only). When we double the epochs in the baseline, the
benefit of synthetic data becomes negligible. To thoroughly demonstrate the
benefit of synthetic data, we introduce Dream4Drive, a novel synthetic data
generation framework designed for enhancing the downstream perception tasks.
Dream4Drive first decomposes the input video into several 3D-aware guidance
maps and subsequently renders the 3D assets onto these guidance maps. Finally,
the driving world model is fine-tuned to produce the edited, multi-view
photorealistic videos, which can be used to train the downstream perception
models. Dream4Drive enables unprecedented flexibility in generating multi-view
corner cases at scale, significantly boosting corner case perception in
autonomous driving. To facilitate future research, we also contribute a
large-scale 3D asset dataset named DriveObj3D, covering the typical categories
in driving scenarios and enabling diverse 3D-aware video editing. We conduct
comprehensive experiments to show that Dream4Drive can effectively boost the
performance of downstream perception models under various training epochs.

TL;DR: MoE-GS is a unified framework that integrates multiple specialized experts via a Volume-aware Pixel Router for dynamic Gaussian splatting, improving rendering quality while addressing efficiency through distillation and optimization techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dynamic scene reconstruction methods show inconsistent performance across diverse scenes, with no single approach effectively handling all dynamic challenges in 3D Gaussian Splatting.

Method: Proposes Mixture of Experts for Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (MoE-GS) with a Volume-aware Pixel Router that adaptively blends expert outputs through differentiable weight splatting. Also explores efficiency improvements via single-pass multi-expert rendering, gate-aware Gaussian pruning, and distillation to transfer MoE performance to individual experts.

Result: Extensive experiments on N3V and Technicolor datasets demonstrate that MoE-GS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods with improved efficiency.

Conclusion: MoE-GS is the first approach incorporating Mixture-of-Experts techniques into dynamic Gaussian splatting, providing a unified framework that delivers superior performance across diverse dynamic scenes.

Abstract: Recent advances in dynamic scene reconstruction have significantly benefited
from 3D Gaussian Splatting, yet existing methods show inconsistent performance
across diverse scenes, indicating no single approach effectively handles all
dynamic challenges. To overcome these limitations, we propose Mixture of
Experts for Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (MoE-GS), a unified framework
integrating multiple specialized experts via a novel Volume-aware Pixel Router.
Our router adaptively blends expert outputs by projecting volumetric
Gaussian-level weights into pixel space through differentiable weight
splatting, ensuring spatially and temporally coherent results. Although MoE-GS
improves rendering quality, the increased model capacity and reduced FPS are
inherent to the MoE architecture. To mitigate this, we explore two
complementary directions: (1) single-pass multi-expert rendering and gate-aware
Gaussian pruning, which improve efficiency within the MoE framework, and (2) a
distillation strategy that transfers MoE performance to individual experts,
enabling lightweight deployment without architectural changes. To the best of
our knowledge, MoE-GS is the first approach incorporating Mixture-of-Experts
techniques into dynamic Gaussian splatting. Extensive experiments on the N3V
and Technicolor datasets demonstrate that MoE-GS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods with improved efficiency. Video demonstrations are

### [17] [SFGFusion: Surface Fitting Guided 3D Object Detection with 4D Radar and Camera Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19215)
*Xiaozhi Li,Huijun Di,Jian Li,Feng Liu,Wei Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SFGFusion is a camera-4D imaging radar fusion network that uses surface fitting to enhance spatial representation and cross-modal interaction for 3D object detection in autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D imaging radar offers advantages like low cost and long-range detection but suffers from sparse point clouds and low resolution, limiting object geometric representation and hindering multi-modal fusion.

Method: Estimates quadratic surface parameters from image and radar data to enhance spatial representation, uses predicted depth to transform image features to BEV space and generate dense pseudo-point clouds, and employs pillar-based encoding for radar point clouds before fusion in BEV space.

Result: Achieves superior performance on TJ4DRadSet and view-of-delft (VoD) object detection benchmarks.

Conclusion: SFGFusion effectively fuses camera and 4D radar features through surface fitting guidance, improving object detection performance for autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: 3D object detection is essential for autonomous driving. As an emerging
sensor, 4D imaging radar offers advantages as low cost, long-range detection,
and accurate velocity measurement, making it highly suitable for object
detection. However, its sparse point clouds and low resolution limit object
geometric representation and hinder multi-modal fusion. In this study, we
introduce SFGFusion, a novel camera-4D imaging radar detection network guided
by surface fitting. By estimating quadratic surface parameters of objects from
image and radar data, the explicit surface fitting model enhances spatial
representation and cross-modal interaction, enabling more reliable prediction
of fine-grained dense depth. The predicted depth serves two purposes: 1) in an
image branch to guide the transformation of image features from perspective
view (PV) to a unified bird's-eye view (BEV) for multi-modal fusion, improving
spatial mapping accuracy; and 2) in a surface pseudo-point branch to generate
dense pseudo-point cloud, mitigating the radar point sparsity. The original
radar point cloud is also encoded in a separate radar branch. These two point
cloud branches adopt a pillar-based method and subsequently transform the
features into the BEV space. Finally, a standard 2D backbone and detection head
are used to predict object labels and bounding boxes from BEV features.
Experimental results show that SFGFusion effectively fuses camera and 4D radar
features, achieving superior performance on the TJ4DRadSet and view-of-delft
(VoD) object detection benchmarks.

Motivation: GEO space objects are difficult to detect in optical imaging due to weak signals, complex stellar backgrounds, and environmental interference.

Method: Wavelet transform for single-frame feature enhancement and noise suppression, followed by multi-frame temporal trajectory completion using Hungarian algorithm with post-processing steps including temporal matching, interpolation, noise filtering, and trajectory refinement.

Result: Achieved 90.14% F1 score on the public SpotGEO dataset, demonstrating effective detection performance.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses GEO object detection challenges through combined single-frame enhancement and multi-frame trajectory completion, showing promising results on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Space objects in Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) present significant
detection challenges in optical imaging due to weak signals, complex stellar
backgrounds, and environmental interference. In this paper, we enhance
high-frequency features of GEO targets while suppressing background noise at
the single-frame level through wavelet transform. Building on this, we propose
a multi-frame temporal trajectory completion scheme centered on the Hungarian
algorithm for globally optimal cross-frame matching. To effectively mitigate
missing and false detections, a series of key steps including temporal matching
and interpolation completion, temporal-consistency-based noise filtering, and
progressive trajectory refinement are designed in the post-processing pipeline.
Experimental results on the public SpotGEO dataset demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an F_1 score of 90.14%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FadeLead is a collaborative perception framework that learns to encapsulate background context into compact foreground features, enabling effective information sharing under bandwidth constraints without transmitting background data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bandwidth constraints in vehicular networks make transmitting entire feature maps impractical. Current foreground-centric methods discard background context, which contains essential information for perception tasks.

Method: Uses a curricular learning strategy that leverages background cues early in training but progressively prunes them away, forcing the model to internalize context into foreground representations without transmitting background itself.

Result: Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world benchmarks show FadeLead outperforms prior methods under different bandwidth settings.

Conclusion: Context-enriched foreground sharing through FadeLead provides an effective solution for collaborative perception under bandwidth constraints, maintaining essential background context without transmitting it.

Abstract: Collaborative perception enhances the reliability and spatial coverage of
autonomous vehicles by sharing complementary information across vehicles,
offering a promising solution to long-tail scenarios that challenge
single-vehicle perception. However, the bandwidth constraints of vehicular
networks make transmitting the entire feature map impractical. Recent methods,
therefore, adopt a foreground-centric paradigm, transmitting only predicted
foreground-region features while discarding the background, which encodes
essential context. We propose FadeLead, a foreground-centric framework that
overcomes this limitation by learning to encapsulate background context into
compact foreground features during training. At the core of our design is a
curricular learning strategy that leverages background cues early on but
progressively prunes them away, forcing the model to internalize context into
foreground representations without transmitting background itself. Extensive
experiments on both simulated and real-world benchmarks show that FadeLead
outperforms prior methods under different bandwidth settings, underscoring the
effectiveness of context-enriched foreground sharing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a comprehensive survey of 4D generation and reconstruction from the unique perspective of 4D representations, addressing the fast-evolving developments in neural fields, geometric/motion deep learning, and 3D generative AI.

Method: The survey takes a selective approach by focusing on representative works to highlight desirable properties and challenges of different 4D representations under various computation, application, and data scenarios.

Result: The survey organizes 4D representations based on three key pillars (geometry, motion, interaction), covers popular representations like NeRFs and 3DGS, and discusses under-explored areas like structured models and long-range motions.

Conclusion: The main goal is to help readers select and customize appropriate 4D representations for their tasks, while also discussing the role of LLMs and VFMs in 4D applications, current limitations, available datasets, and future directions.

Abstract: We present a survey on 4D generation and reconstruction, a fast-evolving
subfield of computer graphics whose developments have been propelled by recent
advances in neural fields, geometric and motion deep learning, as well 3D
generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). While our survey is not the first
of its kind, we build our coverage of the domain from a unique and distinctive
perspective of 4D representations\/}, to model 3D geometry evolving over time
while exhibiting motion and interaction. Specifically, instead of offering an
exhaustive enumeration of many works, we take a more selective approach by
focusing on representative works to highlight both the desirable properties and
ensuing challenges of each representation under different computation,
application, and data scenarios. The main take-away message we aim to convey to
the readers is on how to select and then customize the appropriate 4D
representations for their tasks. Organizationally, we separate the 4D
representations based on three key pillars: geometry, motion, and interaction.
Our discourse will not only encompass the most popular representations of
today, such as neural radiance fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS),
but also bring attention to relatively under-explored representations in the 4D
context, such as structured models and long-range motions. Throughout our
survey, we will reprise the role of large language models (LLMs) and video
foundational models (VFMs) in a variety of 4D applications, while steering our
discussion towards their current limitations and how they can be addressed. We
also provide a dedicated coverage on what 4D datasets are currently available,
as well as what is lacking, in driving the subfield forward. Project

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between computational cost and perceptual quality in real-world image super-resolution, particularly the structural inaccuracies caused by distillation artifacts in one-step diffusion models.

Method: Proposes a SR framework that enhances one-step diffusion model using ControlNet mechanism for semantic edge guidance, with a hybrid loss combining L2, LPIPS, and edge-aware AME loss.

Result: Effectively improves structural integrity and realism while maintaining one-step generation efficiency, achieving superior balance between output quality and inference speed.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses structural inaccuracies in one-step diffusion models for real-world super-resolution through semantic edge guidance and hybrid loss optimization.

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) must handle complex degradations
and inherent reconstruction ambiguities. While generative models have improved
perceptual quality, a key trade-off remains with computational cost. One-step
diffusion models offer speed but often produce structural inaccuracies due to
distillation artifacts. To address this, we propose a novel SR framework that
enhances a one-step diffusion model using a ControlNet mechanism for semantic
edge guidance. This integrates edge information to provide dynamic structural
control during single-pass inference. We also introduce a hybrid loss combining
L2, LPIPS, and an edge-aware AME loss to optimize for pixel accuracy,
perceptual quality, and geometric precision. Experiments show our method
effectively improves structural integrity and realism while maintaining the
efficiency of one-step generation, achieving a superior balance between output
quality and inference speed. The results of test datasets will be published at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes MobiAct, a lightweight MAV action recognition framework using MobileNetV4 backbone with knowledge distillation and attention mechanisms to achieve high accuracy with low computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MAV motion recognition approaches use computationally intensive models unsuitable for resource-limited platforms, creating a trade-off between accuracy and speed.

Method: Uses MobileNetV4 backbone with Stage-wise Orthogonal Knowledge Distillation from ResNet18 teacher, parameter-free attention mechanism, and hybrid loss training strategy.

Result: Achieves 92.12% average accuracy across three datasets, consumes only 136.16 pJ energy, processes 8.84 actions/second, and decodes actions 2x faster than leading methods.

Conclusion: MobiAct enables efficient, low-energy MAV action recognition with superior speed while maintaining high accuracy, making it suitable for resource-constrained aerial platforms.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient recognition of Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) motion is
essential for enabling real-time perception and coordination in autonomous
aerial swarm. However, most existing approaches rely on large, computationally
intensive models that are unsuitable for resource-limited MAV platforms, which
results in a trade-off between recognition accuracy and inference speed. To
address these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight MAV action
recognition framework, MobiAct, designed to achieve high accuracy with low
computational cost. Specifically, MobiAct adopts MobileNetV4 as the backbone
network and introduces a Stage-wise Orthogonal Knowledge Distillation (SOKD)
strategy to effectively transfer MAV motion features from a teacher network
(ResNet18) to a student network, thereby enhancing knowledge transfer
efficiency. Furthermore, a parameter-free attention mechanism is integrated
into the architecture to improve recognition accuracy without increasing model
complexity. In addition, a hybrid loss training strategy is developed to
combine multiple loss objectives, which ensures stable and robust optimization
during training. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MobiAct
achieves low-energy and low-computation MAV action recognition, while
maintaining the fastest action decoding speed among compared methods. Across
all three self-collected datasets, MobiAct achieves an average recognition
accuracy of 92.12%, while consuming only 136.16 pJ of energy and processing
recognition at a rate of 8.84 actions per second. Notably, MobiAct decodes
actions up to 2 times faster than the leading method, with highly comparable
recognition accuracy, highlighting its superior efficiency in MAV action
recognition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing T2I diffusion models struggle with generating the correct number of objects specified in prompts, and current approaches are limited to differentiable regression-based counting networks, excluding superior detector-based models.

Method: Proposes Detector-to-Differentiable (D2D) framework that uses custom activation functions to convert detector logits into soft binary indicators, optimizing noise prior at inference time with pre-trained T2I models.

Result: Substantial improvements in object counting accuracy across multiple benchmarks (up to 13.7% on D2D-Small), with minimal degradation in image quality and computational overhead.

Conclusion: D2D successfully bridges the gap between non-differentiable detection models and T2I generation, enabling superior counting ability to guide numeracy generation effectively.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved strong performance in
semantic alignment, yet they still struggle with generating the correct number
of objects specified in prompts. Existing approaches typically incorporate
auxiliary counting networks as external critics to enhance numeracy. However,
since these critics must provide gradient guidance during generation, they are
restricted to regression-based models that are inherently differentiable, thus
excluding detector-based models with superior counting ability, whose
count-via-enumeration nature is non-differentiable. To overcome this
limitation, we propose Detector-to-Differentiable (D2D), a novel framework that
transforms non-differentiable detection models into differentiable critics,
thereby leveraging their superior counting ability to guide numeracy
generation. Specifically, we design custom activation functions to convert
detector logits into soft binary indicators, which are then used to optimize
the noise prior at inference time with pre-trained T2I models. Our extensive
experiments on SDXL-Turbo, SD-Turbo, and Pixart-DMD across four benchmarks of
varying complexity (low-density, high-density, and multi-object scenarios)
demonstrate consistent and substantial improvements in object counting accuracy
(e.g., boosting up to 13.7% on D2D-Small, a 400-prompt, low-density benchmark),
with minimal degradation in overall image quality and computational overhead.

Result: Extensive experiments show RIL significantly narrows the performance gap with state-of-the-art open- and closed-source VLMs and surpasses them in several instances.

Conclusion: The unified learning strategy of reinforcement and imitation empowers student models to achieve significant performance gains, making lightweight VLMs competitive with leading closed-source models.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their
large scale often renders them impractical for resource-constrained
environments. This paper introduces Unified Reinforcement and Imitation
Learning (RIL), a novel and efficient training algorithm designed to create
powerful, lightweight VLMs. RIL distinctively combines the strengths of
reinforcement learning with adversarial imitation learning. This enables
smaller student VLMs not only to mimic the sophisticated text generation of
large teacher models but also to systematically improve their generative
capabilities through reinforcement signals. Key to our imitation framework is
an LLM-based discriminator that adeptly distinguishes between student and
teacher outputs, complemented by guidance from multiple large teacher VLMs to
ensure diverse learning. This unified learning strategy, leveraging both
reinforcement and imitation, empowers student models to achieve significant
performance gains, making them competitive with leading closed-source VLMs.
Extensive experiments on diverse vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that
RIL significantly narrows the performance gap with state-of-the-art open- and
closed-source VLMs and, in several instances, surpasses them.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on MSDS and DeepSignDB datasets show TS-GATR surpasses current state-of-the-art approaches with consistently lower Equal Error Rates (EER) across various scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed TS-GATR method effectively addresses signature verification challenges by modeling both spatial and temporal dependencies, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Handwritten signature verification is a crucial aspect of identity
authentication, with applications in various domains such as finance and
e-commerce. However, achieving high accuracy in signature verification remains
challenging due to intra-user variability and the risk of forgery. This paper
introduces a novel approach for dynamic signature verification: the
Temporal-Spatial Graph Attention Transformer (TS-GATR). TS-GATR combines the
Graph Attention Network (GAT) and the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to model both
spatial and temporal dependencies in signature data. TS-GATR enhances
verification performance by representing signatures as graphs, where each node
captures dynamic features (e.g. position, velocity, pressure), and by using
attention mechanisms to model their complex relationships. The proposed method
further employs a Dual-Graph Attention Transformer (DGATR) module, which
utilizes k-step and k-nearest neighbor adjacency graphs to model local and
global spatial features, respectively. To capture long-term temporal
dependencies, the model integrates GRU, thereby enhancing its ability to learn
dynamic features during signature verification. Comprehensive experiments
conducted on benchmark datasets such as MSDS and DeepSignDB show that TS-GATR
surpasses current state-of-the-art approaches, consistently achieving lower

*Panagiotis Agrafiotis,Begüm Demir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Seabed-Net is a unified multi-task framework that simultaneously predicts bathymetry and pixel-based seabed classification from remote sensing imagery, outperforming traditional methods and single-task baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches treat bathymetry depth estimation and seabed classification as isolated tasks, forfeiting mutual benefits and hindering adoption of deep learning methods for shallow-water mapping.

Method: Uses dual-branch encoders for bathymetry estimation and seabed classification, integrates cross-task features via Attention Feature Fusion module and windowed Swin-Transformer fusion block, and balances objectives through dynamic task uncertainty weighting.

Result: Achieves up to 75% lower RMSE than traditional methods, reduces bathymetric RMSE by 10-30% compared to state-of-the-art baselines, and improves seabed classification accuracy up to 8%. Shows enhanced spatial consistency and sharper habitat boundaries.

Conclusion: Jointly modeling depth with substrate and seabed habitats yields synergistic gains, offering a robust open solution for integrated shallow-water mapping.

Abstract: Accurate, detailed, and regularly updated bathymetry, coupled with complex
semantic content, is essential for under-mapped shallow-water environments
facing increasing climatological and anthropogenic pressures. However, existing
approaches that derive either depth or seabed classes from remote sensing
imagery treat these tasks in isolation, forfeiting the mutual benefits of their
interaction and hindering the broader adoption of deep learning methods. To
address these limitations, we introduce Seabed-Net, a unified multi-task
framework that simultaneously predicts bathymetry and pixel-based seabed
classification from remote sensing imagery of various resolutions. Seabed-Net
employs dual-branch encoders for bathymetry estimation and pixel-based seabed
classification, integrates cross-task features via an Attention Feature Fusion
module and a windowed Swin-Transformer fusion block, and balances objectives
through dynamic task uncertainty weighting. In extensive evaluations at two
heterogeneous coastal sites, it consistently outperforms traditional empirical
models and traditional machine learning regression methods, achieving up to
75\% lower RMSE. It also reduces bathymetric RMSE by 10-30\% compared to
state-of-the-art single-task and multi-task baselines and improves seabed
classification accuracy up to 8\%. Qualitative analyses further demonstrate
enhanced spatial consistency, sharper habitat boundaries, and corrected depth
biases in low-contrast regions. These results confirm that jointly modeling
depth with both substrate and seabed habitats yields synergistic gains,
offering a robust, open solution for integrated shallow-water mapping. Code and
pretrained weights are available at https://github.com/pagraf/Seabed-Net.

*Juncheng Wang,Lei Shang,Ziqi Liu,Wang Lu,Xixu Hu,Zhe Hu,Jindong Wang,Shujun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates scale shift (discrepancies in head scale distributions) as a key challenge for domain generalization in crowd localization, proposes a benchmark called ScaleBench, analyzes 20 DG algorithms, provides theoretical analysis, and introduces a new algorithm called Catto to mitigate scale shift effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing crowd localization approaches suffer from performance degradation due to scale shift between training and testing data in domain generalization scenarios, which remains insufficiently explored.

Method: The authors conduct systematic examination of scale shift effects, establish ScaleBench benchmark, reproduce 20 DG algorithms, provide theoretical analysis, and propose Causal Feature Decomposition and Anisotropic Processing (Catto) algorithm.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate limitations of existing DG algorithms and reveal four significant insights about scale shift, showing the importance and complexity of this problem in crowd localization.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes the importance of Scale Shift Domain Generalization as a novel research direction and provides analytical insights for future research in mitigating scale shift effects in crowd localization.

Abstract: Crowd localization plays a crucial role in visual scene understanding towards
predicting each pedestrian location in a crowd, thus being applicable to
various downstream tasks. However, existing approaches suffer from significant
performance degradation due to discrepancies in head scale distributions (scale
shift) between training and testing data, a challenge known as domain
generalization (DG). This paper aims to comprehend the nature of scale shift
within the context of domain generalization for crowd localization models. To
this end, we address four critical questions: (i) How does scale shift
influence crowd localization in a DG scenario? (ii) How can we quantify this
influence? (iii) What causes this influence? (iv) How to mitigate the
influence? Initially, we conduct a systematic examination of how crowd
localization performance varies with different levels of scale shift. Then, we
establish a benchmark, ScaleBench, and reproduce 20 advanced DG algorithms to
quantify the influence. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the
limitations of existing algorithms and underscore the importance and complexity
of scale shift, a topic that remains insufficiently explored. To deepen our
understanding, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis on scale shift.
Building on these insights, we further propose an effective algorithm called
Causal Feature Decomposition and Anisotropic Processing (Catto) to mitigate the
influence of scale shift in DG settings. Later, we also provide extensive
analytical experiments, revealing four significant insights for future
research. Our results emphasize the importance of this novel and applicable
research direction, which we term Scale Shift Domain Generalization.

*Tian Xia,Zihan Ma,Xinlong Wang,Qing Liu,Xiaowei He,Tianming Liu,Yudan Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BrainMCLIP is a parameter-efficient fMRI-to-image decoding method that aligns brain activity to multiple CLIP layers using functional hierarchy, eliminating the need for VAE pipelines while achieving competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fMRI decoding methods overlook rich object information in CLIP's intermediate layers and contradict the brain's functional hierarchy by relying on parameter-intensive VAE pipelines.

Method: Multi-layer fusion approach aligning fMRI signals from different visual areas to corresponding CLIP layers, with Cross-Reconstruction strategy and multi-granularity loss.

Result: Achieves highly competitive performance, excels on high-level semantic metrics matching/surpassing SOTA methods, with 71.7% parameter reduction compared to VAE-based methods.

Conclusion: BrainMCLIP effectively captures visual details through intermediate CLIP features, balancing semantic accuracy and detail fidelity without requiring separate VAE pipelines.

Abstract: Decoding images from fMRI often involves mapping brain activity to CLIP's
final semantic layer. To capture finer visual details, many approaches add a
parameter-intensive VAE-based pipeline. However, these approaches overlook rich
object information within CLIP's intermediate layers and contradicts the
brain's functionally hierarchical. We introduce BrainMCLIP, which pioneers a
parameter-efficient, multi-layer fusion approach guided by human visual
system's functional hierarchy, eliminating the need for such a separate VAE
pathway. BrainMCLIP aligns fMRI signals from functionally distinct visual areas
(low-/high-level) to corresponding intermediate and final CLIP layers,
respecting functional hierarchy. We further introduce a Cross-Reconstruction
strategy and a novel multi-granularity loss. Results show BrainMCLIP achieves
highly competitive performance, particularly excelling on high-level semantic
metrics where it matches or surpasses SOTA(state-of-the-art) methods, including
those using VAE pipelines. Crucially, it achieves this with substantially fewer
parameters, demonstrating a reduction of
71.7\%(Table.\ref{tab:compare_clip_vae}) compared to top VAE-based SOTA
methods, by avoiding the VAE pathway. By leveraging intermediate CLIP features,
it effectively captures visual details often missed by CLIP-only approaches,
striking a compelling balance between semantic accuracy and detail fidelity
without requiring a separate VAE pipeline.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free framework for open-vocabulary segmentation and recognition using EfficientNetB0 for unsupervised segmentation and CLIP for object recognition via vision-language alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a flexible and generalizable framework for open-vocabulary image segmentation and object recognition without requiring extensive training.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: 1) Unsupervised segmentation using EfficientNetB0 features decomposed via SVD and clustered hierarchically, 2) Segment-level recognition using CLIP's vision-language alignment with adaptive cluster determination and SVD projection for cross-modal alignment.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on COCO, ADE20K, and PASCAL VOC benchmarks in terms of Hungarian mIoU, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates effectiveness, flexibility, and generalizability for open-vocabulary segmentation and recognition tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel training-free framework for open-vocabulary image
segmentation and object recognition (OVSR), which leverages EfficientNetB0, a
convolutional neural network, for unsupervised segmentation and CLIP, a
vision-language model, for open-vocabulary object recognition. The proposed
framework adopts a two stage pipeline: unsupervised image segmentation followed
by segment-level recognition via vision-language alignment. In the first stage,
pixel-wise features extracted from EfficientNetB0 are decomposed using singular
value decomposition to obtain latent representations, which are then clustered
using hierarchical clustering to segment semantically meaningful regions. The
number of clusters is adaptively determined by the distribution of singular
values. In the second stage, the segmented regions are localized and encoded
into image embeddings using the Vision Transformer backbone of CLIP. Text
embeddings are precomputed using CLIP's text encoder from category-specific
prompts, including a generic something else prompt to support open set
recognition. The image and text embeddings are concatenated and projected into
a shared latent feature space via SVD to enhance cross-modal alignment.
Recognition is performed by computing the softmax over the similarities between
the projected image and text embeddings. The proposed method is evaluated on
standard benchmarks, including COCO, ADE20K, and PASCAL VOC, achieving
state-of-the-art performance in terms of Hungarian mIoU, precision, recall, and
F1-score. These results demonstrate the effectiveness, flexibility, and
generalizability of the proposed framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multitask supervised fine-tuning approaches struggle to determine optimal training data compositions for peak performance in handling multiple mobile phone tasks simultaneously.

Method: Proposed DaMo (Data Mixture Optimizer) - a trainable network that predicts optimal data mixtures by forecasting downstream task performance for any given dataset ratio. Also introduced PhoneAgentBench, a specialized benchmark with 1235 QA pairs for multimodal mobile phone tasks.

Result: DaMo achieved 3.38% performance improvement on PhoneAgentBench compared to alternative methods, and showed superior generalization across BFCL-v3, MME-Reasoning, MME-Perception, and OCRBench benchmarks with 2.57% average improvement. When used solely for MLLM optimization on BFCL-v3, it improved metrics by 12.47%.

Conclusion: DaMo effectively addresses the data mixture optimization challenge in multitask learning for Mobile Phone Agents, demonstrating strong predictive capability, scalability across model architectures, and significant performance improvements across diverse benchmarks.

Abstract: Mobile Phone Agents (MPAs) have emerged as a promising research direction due
to their broad applicability across diverse scenarios. While Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) serve as the foundation for MPAs, their effectiveness
in handling multiple mobile phone tasks simultaneously remains limited.
Although multitask supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is widely adopted for multitask
learning, existing approaches struggle to determine optimal training data
compositions for peak performance. To address this challenge, we propose DaMo
(Data Mixture Optimizer) - a novel solution employing a trainable network that
predicts optimal data mixtures by forecasting downstream task performance for
any given dataset ratio. To support comprehensive evaluation, we introduce
PhoneAgentBench, the first specialized benchmark to evaluate MLLMs on
multimodal mobile phone tasks, comprising 1235 QA pairs spanning diverse
real-world industrial mobile application scenarios. Demonstrating strong
predictive capability (R^2=0.81) in small-scale pilot experiments, DaMo
efficiently extrapolates optimal data mixing configurations. Our results show
DaMo achieves a 3.38% performance improvement on PhoneAgentBench compared to
alternative methods. Furthermore, extensive experiments across established
benchmarks including BFCL-v3, MME-Reasoning, MME-Perception, and OCRBench
reveal DaMo's superior generalization, outperforming other approaches by 2.57%
in terms of average score. When used solely for MLLM optimization on the
BFCL-v3 task, DaMo improves the metrics by 12.47% than other methods. Notably,
DaMo maintains robust scalability, preserving its effectiveness when applied to
other model architectures. The code and dataset are available at

TL;DR: DARE is a deformable medical image registration framework that dynamically adjusts elastic regularization using gradient norms and includes folding-prevention mechanisms for physically realistic transformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning-based registration methods often overlook regularization's importance for robustness and anatomical plausibility, leading to non-physical artifacts like folding.

Method: Proposes DARE framework with dynamic elastic regularization based on deformation field gradient norms, integrating strain and shear energy terms with adaptive modulation and folding-prevention via negative Jacobian penalization.

Result: The approach mitigates non-physical artifacts, avoids over-smoothing, and improves both registration accuracy and anatomical plausibility.

Conclusion: DARE provides a robust registration framework that balances stability and flexibility while ensuring physically realistic transformations through adaptive regularization and folding prevention.

Abstract: Deformable medical image registration is a fundamental task in medical image
analysis. While deep learning-based methods have demonstrated superior accuracy
and computational efficiency compared to traditional techniques, they often
overlook the critical role of regularization in ensuring robustness and
anatomical plausibility. We propose DARE (Deformable Adaptive Regularization
Estimator), a novel registration framework that dynamically adjusts elastic
regularization based on the gradient norm of the deformation field. Our
approach integrates strain and shear energy terms, which are adaptively
modulated to balance stability and flexibility. To ensure physically realistic
transformations, DARE includes a folding-prevention mechanism that penalizes
regions with negative deformation Jacobian. This strategy mitigates
non-physical artifacts such as folding, avoids over-smoothing, and improves
both registration accuracy and anatomical plausibility

*Woo Jae Kim,Kyu Beom Han,Yoonki Cho,Youngju Na,Junsik Jung,Sooel Son,Sung-eui Yoon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AegisRF is a framework that protects Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) intellectual property by injecting adversarial perturbations while preserving rendering quality through learnable sensitivity fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Protecting NeRF intellectual property from unauthorized use is crucial as they become powerful tools for 3D scene representation, but existing methods avoid geometric perturbations due to quality degradation concerns.

Method: Proposes AegisRF with two components: Perturbation Field that injects adversarial perturbations into pre-rendering outputs, and Sensitivity Field that learns spatially varying sensitivity to constrain geometric perturbations and maintain rendering quality.

Result: Experimental evaluations show generalized applicability across diverse downstream tasks (multi-view image classification, voxel-based 3D localization) while maintaining high visual fidelity.

Conclusion: AegisRF effectively protects NeRF IP by disrupting unauthorized applications through adversarial perturbations while preserving rendering quality, overcoming limitations of previous approaches.

Abstract: As Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have emerged as a powerful tool for 3D
scene representation and novel view synthesis, protecting their intellectual
property (IP) from unauthorized use is becoming increasingly crucial. In this
work, we aim to protect the IP of NeRFs by injecting adversarial perturbations
that disrupt their unauthorized applications. However, perturbing the 3D
geometry of NeRFs can easily deform the underlying scene structure and thus
substantially degrade the rendering quality, which has led existing attempts to
avoid geometric perturbations or restrict them to explicit spaces like meshes.
To overcome this limitation, we introduce a learnable sensitivity to quantify
the spatially varying impact of geometric perturbations on rendering quality.
Building upon this, we propose AegisRF, a novel framework that consists of a
Perturbation Field, which injects adversarial perturbations into the
pre-rendering outputs (color and volume density) of NeRF models to fool an
unauthorized downstream target model, and a Sensitivity Field, which learns the
sensitivity to adaptively constrain geometric perturbations, preserving
rendering quality while disrupting unauthorized use. Our experimental
evaluations demonstrate the generalized applicability of AegisRF across diverse
downstream tasks and modalities, including multi-view image classification and
voxel-based 3D localization, while maintaining high visual fidelity. Codes are

TL;DR: MV-RoboBench is a new benchmark to evaluate VLMs' multi-view spatial reasoning for robotics, showing current models lag far behind human performance despite advances in single-view tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLM evaluations focus on single-view settings, while multi-camera setups are standard in robotics. It's unknown whether VLMs can effectively leverage multi-view inputs for robotic reasoning.

Method: Created MV-RoboBench with 1.7k manually curated QA items across 8 subtasks in spatial understanding and robotic execution categories. Evaluated diverse VLMs including open/closed-source models and CoT-enhanced versions.

Result: State-of-the-art models remain far below human performance. Found: (i) spatial intelligence and robotic execution are positively correlated in multi-view scenarios; (ii) strong single-view spatial performance doesn't translate to robotic spatial tasks.

Conclusion: VLMs face substantial challenges in multi-view robotic perception. MV-RoboBench is released as an open resource to foster progress in spatially grounded VLMs and VLAs with standardized evaluation.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are essential to Embodied AI, enabling robots
to perceive, reason, and act in complex environments. They also serve as the
foundation for the recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Yet most
evaluations of VLMs focus on single-view settings, leaving their ability to
integrate multi-view information underexplored. At the same time, multi-camera
setups are increasingly standard in robotic platforms, as they provide
complementary perspectives to mitigate occlusion and depth ambiguity. Whether
VLMs can effectively leverage such multi-view inputs for robotic reasoning
therefore remains an open question. To bridge this gap, we introduce
MV-RoboBench, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the multi-view
spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs in robotic manipulation. MV-RoboBench
consists of 1.7k manually curated QA items across eight subtasks, divided into
two primary categories: spatial understanding and robotic execution. We
evaluate a diverse set of existing VLMs, including both open-source and
closed-source models, along with enhanced versions incorporating CoT-inspired
techniques. The results show that state-of-the-art models remain far below
human performance, underscoring the substantial challenges VLMs face in
multi-view robotic perception. Additionally, our analysis uncovers two key
findings: (i) spatial intelligence and robotic task execution are positively
correlated in multi-view robotic scenarios; and (ii) strong performance on
existing general-purpose single-view spatial understanding benchmarks does not
reliably translate to success in the robotic spatial tasks assessed by our
benchmark. We release MV-RoboBench as an open resource to foster progress in
spatially grounded VLMs and VLAs, providing not only data but also a
standardized evaluation protocol for multi-view embodied reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed a multi-camera worker tracking system using 19 ceiling-mounted wide-angle cameras in logistics warehouses, with foot position-based alignment to address distortion issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving warehouse operation efficiency through digital twins requires accurate worker position tracking, but single cameras have limited field of view.

Method: Used 19 wide-angle cameras on ceiling, aligned camera coordinates with actual positions via floor surface, and employed foot position-based alignment to reduce distortion effects.

Result: Achieved over 20% improvement in tracking accuracy and validated effectiveness through comparison of multiple appearance feature utilization methods.

Conclusion: The proposed foot position-based alignment method effectively addresses wide-angle camera distortion and enables accurate multi-camera worker tracking for warehouse digital twins.

Abstract: With the spread of e-commerce, the logistics market is growing around the
world. Therefore, improving the efficiency of warehouse operations is
essential. To achieve this, various approaches have been explored, and among
them, the use of digital twins is gaining attention. To make this approach
possible, it is necessary to accurately collect the positions of workers in a
warehouse and reflect them in a virtual space. However, a single camera has
limitations in its field of view, therefore sensing with multiple cameras is
necessary. In this study, we explored a method to track workers using 19
wide-angle cameras installed on the ceiling, looking down at the floor of the
logistics warehouse. To understand the relationship between the camera
coordinates and the actual positions in the warehouse, we performed alignment
based on the floor surface. However, due to the characteristics of wide-angle
cameras, significant distortion occurs at the edges of the image, particularly
in the vertical direction. To address this, the detected worker positions from
each camera were aligned based on foot positions, reducing the effects of image
distortion, and enabling accurate position alignment across cameras. As a
result, we confirmed an improvement of over 20% in tracking accuracy.
Furthermore, we compared multiple methods for utilizing appearance features and
validated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

TL;DR: PICK is a multi-step framework using MLLMs for psychological analysis of drawings, specifically the House-Tree-Person test, through hierarchical decomposition and knowledge injection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs excel at objective multimodal tasks but lack application in subjective, emotionally nuanced domains like psychological analysis, particularly for clinical assessments like the HTP test.

Method: Hierarchical decomposition of drawings into single-object, multi-object, and whole levels; analysis with targeted focus; HTP knowledge base with feature extraction module trained via reinforcement learning; integration of multi-faceted information.

Result: PICK significantly enhances MLLMs' psychological analysis capabilities and is validated as a general framework through emotion understanding tasks.

Conclusion: The framework bridges MLLMs with specialized expert domains, offering structured, interpretable analysis of human mental states through visual expression.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated exceptional
performance across various objective multimodal perception tasks, yet their
application to subjective, emotionally nuanced domains, such as psychological
analysis, remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce PICK, a
multi-step framework designed for Psychoanalytical Image Comprehension through
hierarchical analysis and Knowledge injection with MLLMs, specifically focusing
on the House-Tree-Person (HTP) Test, a widely used psychological assessment in
clinical practice. First, we decompose drawings containing multiple instances
into semantically meaningful sub-drawings, constructing a hierarchical
representation that captures spatial structure and content across three levels:
single-object level, multi-object level, and whole level. Next, we analyze
these sub-drawings at each level with a targeted focus, extracting
psychological or emotional insights from their visual cues. We also introduce
an HTP knowledge base and design a feature extraction module, trained with
reinforcement learning, to generate a psychological profile for single-object
level analysis. This profile captures both holistic stylistic features and
dynamic object-specific features (such as those of the house, tree, or person),
correlating them with psychological states. Finally, we integrate these
multi-faceted information to produce a well-informed assessment that aligns
with expert-level reasoning. Our approach bridges the gap between MLLMs and
specialized expert domains, offering a structured and interpretable framework
for understanding human mental states through visual expression. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed PICK significantly enhances the
capability of MLLMs in psychological analysis. It is further validated as a
general framework through extensions to emotion understanding tasks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces IC-Defect-14, a highly imbalanced IC defect dataset from real production lines, and proposes ReCAME-Net to address the unique challenges of large intra-class diversity and high inter-class similarity in real-world IC defect classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world IC defect classification faces challenges due to extreme data imbalance from high yield-rate requirements and complex feature mixing of class-specific and domain-related attributes, making existing imbalanced classification methods ineffective.

Method: Proposed ReCAME-Net, a multi-expert classifier framework integrating regional channel attention module, metric learning losses, hard category mining strategy, and knowledge distillation procedure.

Result: ReCAME-Net outperforms previous state-of-the-art models on the IC-Defect-14 dataset while maintaining competitive performance on general public datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses the unique challenges of real-world IC defect classification with highly imbalanced data and complex feature characteristics.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in deep classification techniques and in-lab
automatic optical inspection models for long-tailed or highly imbalanced data,
applying these approaches to real-world IC defect classification tasks remains
challenging. This difficulty stems from two primary factors. First, real-world
conditions, such as the high yield-rate requirements in the IC industry, result
in data distributions that are far more skewed than those found in general
public imbalanced datasets. Consequently, classifiers designed for open
imbalanced datasets often fail to perform effectively in real-world scenarios.
Second, real-world samples exhibit a mix of class-specific attributes and
class-agnostic, domain-related features. This complexity adds significant
difficulty to the classification process, particularly for highly imbalanced
datasets. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the IC-Defect-14
dataset, a large, highly imbalanced IC defect image dataset sourced from AOI
systems deployed in real-world IC production lines. This dataset is
characterized by its unique "intra-class clusters" property, which presents two
major challenges: large intra-class diversity and high inter-class similarity.
These characteristics, rarely found simultaneously in existing public datasets,
significantly degrade the performance of current state-of-the-art classifiers
for highly imbalanced data. To tackle this challenge, we propose ReCAME-Net,
which follows a multi-expert classifier framework and integrates a regional
channel attention module, metric learning losses, a hard category mining
strategy, and a knowledge distillation procedure. Extensive experimental
evaluations demonstrate that ReCAME-Net outperforms previous state-of-the-art
models on the IC-Defect-14 dataset while maintaining comparable performance and
competitiveness on general public datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-conditional GAN framework generates representative pore-scale images with controlled porosity and depth parameters, addressing spatial heterogeneity and data scarcity in subsurface characterization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural spatial heterogeneity causes extracted sub-images to deviate from core-measured values, compounded by data scarcity where physical samples are only available at sparse well locations.

Method: Multi-conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) trained on thin section samples from carbonate formation, conditioning on porosity values and depth parameters within a single unified model.

Result: Achieved exceptional porosity control (R^2=0.95) with mean absolute errors of 0.0099-0.0197, preserved critical pore network characteristics, and demonstrated superior representativeness with dual-constraint errors of 1.9-11.3% compared to 36.4-578% for real sub-images.

Conclusion: The framework provides transformative tools for subsurface characterization, particularly valuable for carbon storage, geothermal energy, and groundwater management applications where representative pore morphology is critical for digital rock physics.

Abstract: Obtaining truly representative pore-scale images that match bulk formation
properties remains a fundamental challenge in subsurface characterization, as
natural spatial heterogeneity causes extracted sub-images to deviate
significantly from core-measured values. This challenge is compounded by data
scarcity, where physical samples are only available at sparse well locations.
This study presents a multi-conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN)
framework that generates representative pore-scale images with precisely
controlled properties, addressing both the representativeness challenge and
data availability constraints. The framework was trained on thin section
samples from four depths (1879.50-1943.50 m) of a carbonate formation,
simultaneously conditioning on porosity values and depth parameters within a
single unified model. This approach captures both universal pore network
principles and depth-specific geological characteristics, from grainstone
fabrics with interparticle-intercrystalline porosity to crystalline textures
with anhydrite inclusions. The model achieved exceptional porosity control
(R^2=0.95) across all formations with mean absolute errors of 0.0099-0.0197.
Morphological validation confirmed preservation of critical pore network
characteristics including average pore radius, specific surface area, and
tortuosity, with statistical differences remaining within acceptable geological
tolerances. Most significantly, generated images demonstrated superior
representativeness with dual-constraint errors of 1.9-11.3% compared to
36.4-578% for randomly extracted real sub-images. This capability provides
transformative tools for subsurface characterization, particularly valuable for
carbon storage, geothermal energy, and groundwater management applications
where knowing the representative morphology of the pore space is critical for
implementing digital rock physics.

TL;DR: A novel predictive imaging framework for accelerating MRI using generative AI to predict target contrast images as data-driven priors for reconstructing highly under-sampled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI's lengthy acquisition times limit clinical throughput, creating a need for accelerated imaging methods that go beyond traditional reconstruction approaches.

Method: Predict target contrast images using generative models conditioned on diverse data sources (other contrast images, previous scans, acquisition parameters, patient info), then use these predictions as informative priors for reconstructing under-sampled k-space data.

Result: Evaluated on 14,921 scans (1,051,904 slices) across internal and public datasets, the method significantly outperformed other approaches at high acceleration factors (4x, 8x, 12x), particularly for FLAIR reconstruction from T1w/T2w scans and T1w reconstruction from previous T1w scans.

Conclusion: The framework introduces a fundamental shift from image reconstruction to predictive imaging, demonstrating superior performance in accelerating MRI acquisition while maintaining image quality.

Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have created transformative
capabilities in image synthesis and generation, enabling diverse research
fields to innovate at revolutionary speed and spectrum. In this study, we
leverage this generative power to introduce a new paradigm for accelerating
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), introducing a shift from image reconstruction
to proactive predictive imaging. Despite being a cornerstone of modern patient
care, MRI's lengthy acquisition times limit clinical throughput. Our novel
framework addresses this challenge by first predicting a target contrast image,
which then serves as a data-driven prior for reconstructing highly
under-sampled data. This informative prior is predicted by a generative model
conditioned on diverse data sources, such as other contrast images, previously
scanned images, acquisition parameters, patient information. We demonstrate
this approach with two key applications: (1) reconstructing FLAIR images using
predictions from T1w and/or T2w scans, and (2) reconstructing T1w images using
predictions from previously acquired T1w scans. The framework was evaluated on
internal and multiple public datasets (total 14,921 scans; 1,051,904 slices),
including multi-channel k-space data, for a range of high acceleration factors
(x4, x8 and x12). The results demonstrate that our prediction-prior
reconstruction method significantly outperforms other approaches, including
those with alternative or no prior information. Through this framework we
introduce a fundamental shift from image reconstruction towards a new paradigm
of predictive imaging.

*Zhuoyang Xie,Yibo Zhao,Hui Huang,Riwei Wang,Zan Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRGCN introduces cross-sequence pattern reuse for monocular 3D human pose estimation, using a graph memory bank with pose prototypes and dual-stream architecture combining Mamba and self-attention to achieve state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video-based methods process sequences in isolation, failing to exploit structural regularities and repetitive motion patterns across sequences in human movement.

Method: Pattern Reuse Graph Convolutional Network (PRGCN) with graph memory bank storing pose prototypes, attention-based retrieval, memory-driven graph convolution with anatomical constraints, and dual-stream hybrid architecture combining Mamba state-space models and self-attention.

Result: Achieved MPJPE of 37.1mm on Human3.6M and 13.4mm on MPI-INF-3DHP benchmarks, establishing new state-of-the-art with enhanced cross-domain generalization.

Conclusion: Cross-sequence pattern reuse is pivotal for advancing monocular 3D pose estimation, shifting from per-sequence optimization to cumulative knowledge learning.

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation remains a fundamentally ill-posed inverse
problem due to the inherent depth ambiguity in 2D-to-3D lifting. While
contemporary video-based methods leverage temporal context to enhance spatial
reasoning, they operate under a critical paradigm limitation: processing each
sequence in isolation, thereby failing to exploit the strong structural
regularities and repetitive motion patterns that pervade human movement across
sequences. This work introduces the Pattern Reuse Graph Convolutional Network
(PRGCN), a novel framework that formalizes pose estimation as a problem of
pattern retrieval and adaptation. At its core, PRGCN features a graph memory
bank that learns and stores a compact set of pose prototypes, encoded as
relational graphs, which are dynamically retrieved via an attention mechanism
to provide structured priors. These priors are adaptively fused with hard-coded
anatomical constraints through a memory-driven graph convolution, ensuring
geometrical plausibility. To underpin this retrieval process with robust
spatiotemporal features, we design a dual-stream hybrid architecture that
synergistically combines the linear-complexity, local temporal modeling of
Mamba-based state-space models with the global relational capacity of
self-attention. Extensive evaluations on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP benchmarks
demonstrate that PRGCN establishes a new state-of-the-art, achieving an MPJPE
of 37.1mm and 13.4mm, respectively, while exhibiting enhanced cross-domain
generalization capability. Our work posits that the long-overlooked mechanism
of cross-sequence pattern reuse is pivotal to advancing the field, shifting the
paradigm from per-sequence optimization towards cumulative knowledge learning.

*Julia Wąsala,Joannes D. Maasakkers,Ilse Aben,Rochelle Schneider,Holger Hoos,Mitra Baratchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses representation bias in methane plume detection from satellite images caused by systematically missing pixels (MNAR). It proposes imputation and weighted resampling methods to remove spurious associations between image coverage and labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Satellite images often have missing pixels due to clouds, creating systematic missing data (MNAR). This causes representation bias where models associate image coverage with labels, leading to under-detection of plumes in low-coverage images.

Method: Evaluated multiple imputation approaches and proposed a weighted resampling scheme during training that enforces class balance in each coverage bin to remove the association between label and coverage.

Result: Both resampling and imputation significantly reduced representation bias without hurting balanced accuracy, precision, or recall. Debiased models showed higher detection rates for plumes in low-coverage images.

Conclusion: The proposed debiasing techniques effectively address representation bias in methane plume detection from satellite imagery, improving detection performance in operational scenarios with missing data.

Abstract: Most satellite images have systematically missing pixels (i.e., missing data
not at random (MNAR)) due to factors such as clouds. If not addressed, these
missing pixels can lead to representation bias in automated feature extraction
models. In this work, we show that spurious association between the label and
the number of missing values in methane plume detection can cause the model to
associate the coverage (i.e., the percentage of valid pixels in an image) with
the label, subsequently under-detecting plumes in low-coverage images. We
evaluate multiple imputation approaches to remove the dependence between the
coverage and a label. Additionally, we propose a weighted resampling scheme
during training that removes the association between the label and the coverage
by enforcing class balance in each coverage bin. Our results show that both
resampling and imputation can significantly reduce the representation bias
without hurting balanced accuracy, precision, or recall. Finally, we evaluate
the capability of the debiased models using these techniques in an operational
scenario and demonstrate that the debiased models have a higher chance of
detecting plumes in low-coverage images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cauvis method addresses spurious correlations in single-source domain generalized object detection by using cross-attention prompts and dual-branch adapters to disentangle causal and spurious features, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SDGOD approaches using data augmentation fall into spurious correlations, where models over-rely on simplistic features like color rather than essential domain-invariant representations like object contours.

Method: Proposes Cauvis method with: 1) Cross-Attention Prompts module to mitigate bias from spurious features, 2) Dual-branch adapter that disentangles causal-spurious features while achieving domain adaptation via high-frequency feature extraction.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 15.9-31.4% gains over existing domain generalization methods on SDGOD datasets, and exhibits significant robustness advantages in complex interference environments.

Conclusion: Cauvis effectively addresses the critical challenge of spurious correlations in single-source domain generalization through causal feature disentanglement and visual prompt integration.

Abstract: Single-source Domain Generalized Object Detection (SDGOD), as a cutting-edge
research topic in computer vision, aims to enhance model generalization
capability in unseen target domains through single-source domain training.
Current mainstream approaches attempt to mitigate domain discrepancies via data
augmentation techniques. However, due to domain shift and limited
domain-specific knowledge, models tend to fall into the pitfall of spurious
correlations. This manifests as the model's over-reliance on simplistic
classification features (e.g., color) rather than essential domain-invariant
representations like object contours. To address this critical challenge, we
propose the Cauvis (Causal Visual Prompts) method. First, we introduce a
Cross-Attention Prompts module that mitigates bias from spurious features by
integrating visual prompts with cross-attention. To address the inadequate
domain knowledge coverage and spurious feature entanglement in visual prompts
for single-domain generalization, we propose a dual-branch adapter that
disentangles causal-spurious features while achieving domain adaptation via
high-frequency feature extraction. Cauvis achieves state-of-the-art performance
with 15.9-31.4% gains over existing domain generalization methods on SDGOD
datasets, while exhibiting significant robustness advantages in complex
interference environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CARES is a lightweight module that predicts the minimal sufficient image resolution for VLMs, reducing compute by up to 80% while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution images in VLMs inflate visual tokens to 97-99% of total tokens, causing high compute and latency even when low-resolution images would suffice.

Method: Uses a compact VLM (350M) to extract features and predict when a target VLM's response converges to its peak ability. Trained as discrete classifier but interpolates continuous resolutions at inference.

Result: Across five multimodal benchmarks and diverse target VLMs, CARES preserves task performance while reducing compute by up to 80%.

Conclusion: CARES enables efficient resolution selection for VLMs without sacrificing performance, significantly reducing computational costs.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) commonly process images at native or high
resolution to remain effective across tasks. This inflates visual tokens ofter
to 97-99% of total tokens, resulting in high compute and latency, even when
low-resolution images would suffice. We introduce \emph{CARES}-a
\textbf{C}ontext-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{R}esolution \textbf{S}elector, a
lightweight preprocessing module that, given an image-query pair, predicts the
\emph{minimal} sufficient input resolution. CARES uses a compact VLM (350M) to
extract features and predict when a target pretrained VLM's response converges
to its peak ability to answer correctly. Though trained as a discrete
classifier over a set of optional resolutions, CARES interpolates continuous
resolutions at inference for fine-grained control. Across five multimodal
benchmarks spanning documents and natural images, as well as diverse target
VLMs, CARES preserves task performance while reducing compute by up to 80%.

*Qing Mao,Tianxin Huang,Yu Zhu,Jinqiu Sun,Yanning Zhang,Gim Hee Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PoseCrafter improves pairwise camera pose estimation for sparsely overlapping image pairs by generating clearer intermediate frames using hybrid video generation and selecting optimal frames via feature matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with image pairs having small or no overlap, and current approaches using video interpolation produce blurry frames with inefficient selection strategies.

Method: Proposes Hybrid Video Generation (HVG) combining video interpolation with pose-conditioned novel view synthesis, and Feature Matching Selector (FMS) for optimal frame selection based on feature correspondence.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple datasets show PoseCrafter significantly enhances pose estimation performance, especially for cases with small or no overlap.

Conclusion: PoseCrafter effectively addresses the challenge of camera pose estimation for sparsely overlapping image pairs through improved intermediate frame generation and selection.

Abstract: Pairwise camera pose estimation from sparsely overlapping image pairs remains
a critical and unsolved challenge in 3D vision. Most existing methods struggle
with image pairs that have small or no overlap. Recent approaches attempt to
address this by synthesizing intermediate frames using video interpolation and
selecting key frames via a self-consistency score. However, the generated
frames are often blurry due to small overlap inputs, and the selection
strategies are slow and not explicitly aligned with pose estimation. To solve
these cases, we propose Hybrid Video Generation (HVG) to synthesize clearer
intermediate frames by coupling a video interpolation model with a
pose-conditioned novel view synthesis model, where we also propose a Feature
Matching Selector (FMS) based on feature correspondence to select intermediate
frames appropriate for pose estimation from the synthesized results. Extensive
experiments on Cambridge Landmarks, ScanNet, DL3DV-10K, and NAVI demonstrate
that, compared to existing SOTA methods, PoseCrafter can obviously enhance the
pose estimation performances, especially on examples with small or no overlap.

*Simone Alghisi,Gabriel Roccabruna,Massimo Rizzoli,Seyed Mahed Mousavi,Giuseppe Riccardi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs struggle with visual reasoning tasks like object counting due to issues in mapping representations to output space, but fine-tuning just the output layer can improve accuracy by up to 21%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models have limitations in visual reasoning tasks such as identifying relations, understanding temporal sequences, and counting objects, despite their competitive performance on downstream tasks.

Method: Studied 7 state-of-the-art VLMs on counting tasks under controlled conditions, performed layer-wise analysis, and conducted targeted training by fine-tuning only the output layer.

Result: VLMs are highly sensitive to object count, type, spatial arrangement, and distractors. Errors stem from incorrect mapping of last-layer representations to output space. Fine-tuning just the output layer improved accuracy by up to 21% with consistent improvements on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Targeted fine-tuning of the output layer significantly enhances VLM performance on visual reasoning tasks, particularly object counting, by addressing the core issue of representation-to-output mapping.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently gained attention due to their
competitive performance on multiple downstream tasks, achieved by following
user-input instructions. However, VLMs still exhibit several limitations in
visual reasoning, such as difficulties in identifying relations (e.g., spatial,
temporal, and among objects), understanding temporal sequences (e.g., frames),
and counting objects. In this work, we go beyond score-level benchmark
evaluations of VLMs by investigating the underlying causes of their failures
and proposing a targeted approach to improve their reasoning capabilities. We
study the reasoning skills of seven state-of-the-art VLMs in the counting task
under controlled experimental conditions. Our experiments show that VLMs are
highly sensitive to the number and type of objects, their spatial arrangement,
and the co-occurrence of distractors. A layer-wise analysis reveals that errors
are due to incorrect mapping of the last-layer representation into the output
space. Our targeted training shows that fine-tuning just the output layer
improves accuracy by up to 21%. We corroborate these findings by achieving
consistent improvements on real-world datasets.

### [47] [The Intricate Dance of Prompt Complexity, Quality, Diversity, and Consistency in T2I Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19557)
*Xiaofeng Zhang,Aaron Courville,Michal Drozdzal,Adriana Romero-Soriano*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates how prompt complexity affects synthetic data quality, diversity, and consistency in text-to-image models, revealing that increased complexity reduces diversity and consistency while improving distribution alignment with real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically understand how prompt complexity impacts the utility of synthetic data from T2I models, as previous work has underexplored this relationship despite prompt engineering being the primary interaction method.

Method: Conducted synthetic experiments with theoretical derivations, introduced a new evaluation framework comparing real vs synthetic data utility, and performed large-scale empirical analysis across multiple datasets (CC12M, ImageNet-1k, DCI) with various inference-time interventions.

Result: Increasing prompt complexity leads to lower conditional diversity and prompt consistency but reduces synthetic-to-real distribution shift. Prompt expansion consistently achieves highest performance in both image diversity and aesthetics, even surpassing real data.

Conclusion: Generalizing to more general conditions is challenging for diffusion models, and current interventions can improve diversity at the cost of moving outside real data support, with prompt expansion emerging as the most effective method.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models offer great potential for creating virtually
limitless synthetic data, a valuable resource compared to fixed and finite real
datasets. Previous works evaluate the utility of synthetic data from T2I models
on three key desiderata: quality, diversity, and consistency. While prompt
engineering is the primary means of interacting with T2I models, the systematic
impact of prompt complexity on these critical utility axes remains
underexplored. In this paper, we first conduct synthetic experiments to
motivate the difficulty of generalization w.r.t. prompt complexity and explain
the observed difficulty with theoretical derivations. Then, we introduce a new
evaluation framework that can compare the utility of real data and synthetic
data, and present a comprehensive analysis of how prompt complexity influences
the utility of synthetic data generated by commonly used T2I models. We conduct
our study across diverse datasets, including CC12M, ImageNet-1k, and DCI, and
evaluate different inference-time intervention methods. Our synthetic
experiments show that generalizing to more general conditions is harder than
the other way round, since the former needs an estimated likelihood that is not
learned by diffusion models. Our large-scale empirical experiments reveal that
increasing prompt complexity results in lower conditional diversity and prompt
consistency, while reducing the synthetic-to-real distribution shift, which
aligns with the synthetic experiments. Moreover, current inference-time
interventions can augment the diversity of the generations at the expense of
moving outside the support of real data. Among those interventions, prompt
expansion, by deliberately using a pre-trained language model as a likelihood
estimator, consistently achieves the highest performance in both image
diversity and aesthetics, even higher than that of real data.

TL;DR: The paper investigates temporal awareness in vision-language models (VLMs), finding that temporal information forms a low-dimensional manifold in VLM embeddings, and proposes methods to extract explicit timeline representations for temporal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess VLMs' ability to understand and position visual content in time, and leverage their temporal awareness for improved temporal reasoning tasks.

Method: Created TIME10k benchmark dataset with 10k+ temporally-labeled images, evaluated 37 VLMs, discovered temporal information forms low-dimensional manifold in embeddings, and developed methods to extract explicit timeline representations.

Result: Temporal information is structured along a low-dimensional non-linear manifold in VLM embedding space. The proposed timeline approaches achieve competitive to superior accuracy compared to prompt-based baselines while being computationally efficient.

Conclusion: VLMs possess structured temporal awareness that can be explicitly modeled as timelines, enabling effective temporal reasoning with computational efficiency.

Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have gained popularity
for their generalizable and expressive multimodal representations. By
leveraging large-scale training data with diverse textual metadata, VLMs
acquire open-vocabulary capabilities, solving tasks beyond their training
scope. This paper investigates the temporal awareness of VLMs, assessing their
ability to position visual content in time. We introduce TIME10k, a benchmark
dataset of over 10,000 images with temporal ground truth, and evaluate the
time-awareness of 37 VLMs by a novel methodology. Our investigation reveals
that temporal information is structured along a low-dimensional, non-linear
manifold in the VLM embedding space. Based on this insight, we propose methods
to derive an explicit ``timeline'' representation from the embedding space.
These representations model time and its chronological progression and thereby
facilitate temporal reasoning tasks. Our timeline approaches achieve
competitive to superior accuracy compared to a prompt-based baseline while
being computationally efficient. All code and data are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HAD is a multi-modal knowledge distillation framework that addresses spatio-temporal asymmetry between RGB and event cameras to enhance object tracking in challenging conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB and event cameras have complementary strengths (texture details vs temporal resolution/HDR), but their different imaging mechanisms create spatio-temporal asymmetry that hinders effective multi-modal integration for object tracking.

Method: Proposes Hierarchical Asymmetric Distillation (HAD) with hierarchical alignment strategy to minimize information loss while maintaining computational efficiency and parameter compactness of the student network.

Result: Extensive experiments show HAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with ablation studies validating the effectiveness of each component.

Conclusion: HAD successfully addresses spatio-temporal asymmetry between RGB and event cameras, enabling improved multi-modal object tracking in challenging conditions like high-speed motion and HDR environments.

Abstract: RGB cameras excel at capturing rich texture details with high spatial
resolution, whereas event cameras offer exceptional temporal resolution and a
high dynamic range (HDR). Leveraging their complementary strengths can
substantially enhance object tracking under challenging conditions, such as
high-speed motion, HDR environments, and dynamic background interference.
However, a significant spatio-temporal asymmetry exists between these two
modalities due to their fundamentally different imaging mechanisms, hindering
effective multi-modal integration. To address this issue, we propose
{Hierarchical Asymmetric Distillation} (HAD), a multi-modal knowledge
distillation framework that explicitly models and mitigates spatio-temporal
asymmetries. Specifically, HAD proposes a hierarchical alignment strategy that
minimizes information loss while maintaining the student network's
computational efficiency and parameter compactness. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that HAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and
comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness and necessity
of each designed component. The code will be released soon.

TL;DR: α-Cloak is the first no-box adversarial attack on object detectors using the alpha channel of RGBA videos, achieving 100% attack success rate without model access or perceptible artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object detection models are increasingly deployed in cyber-physical systems like autonomous vehicles, but video domain adversarial attacks remain largely unexplored, especially in no-box settings.

Method: Exploits alpha channel to fuse malicious target video with benign video, creating fused videos that appear normal to humans but fool object detectors. No access to model architecture, parameters, or outputs required.

Result: Achieved 100% attack success rate across five state-of-the-art object detectors, a vision-language model, and Gemini-2.0-Flash multi-modal large language model.

Conclusion: Reveals previously unexplored vulnerability in video-based perception systems, highlighting urgent need for defenses accounting for alpha channel in adversarial settings.

Abstract: As object detection models are increasingly deployed in cyber-physical
systems such as autonomous vehicles (AVs) and surveillance platforms, ensuring
their security against adversarial threats is essential. While prior work has
explored adversarial attacks in the image domain, those attacks in the video
domain remain largely unexamined, especially in the no-box setting. In this
paper, we present {\alpha}-Cloak, the first no-box adversarial attack on object
detectors that operates entirely through the alpha channel of RGBA videos.
{\alpha}-Cloak exploits the alpha channel to fuse a malicious target video with
a benign video, resulting in a fused video that appears innocuous to human
viewers but consistently fools object detectors. Our attack requires no access
to model architecture, parameters, or outputs, and introduces no perceptible
artifacts. We systematically study the support for alpha channels across common
video formats and playback applications, and design a fusion algorithm that
ensures visual stealth and compatibility. We evaluate {\alpha}-Cloak on five
state-of-the-art object detectors, a vision-language model, and a multi-modal
large language model (Gemini-2.0-Flash), demonstrating a 100% attack success
rate across all scenarios. Our findings reveal a previously unexplored
vulnerability in video-based perception systems, highlighting the urgent need
for defenses that account for the alpha channel in adversarial settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to ensure geometric consistency and reconstruction quality for novel views in surround-view autonomous driving due to minimal overlap regions between views.

Method: Uses a lightweight VGGT variant to distill geometric priors, a Gaussian Head that fuses multi-scale geometry tokens to predict Gaussian parameters for novel view rendering, and integrates multi-scale features from both branches to supervise semantic refinement through feature-consistent learning.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both objective metrics and subjective quality on nuScenes dataset under various settings.

Conclusion: VGD demonstrates scalability and high-fidelity surround-view reconstruction by explicitly learning geometric information and using it to guide semantic quality optimization.

Abstract: Feed-forward surround-view autonomous driving scene reconstruction offers
fast, generalizable inference ability, which faces the core challenge of
ensuring generalization while elevating novel view quality. Due to the
surround-view with minimal overlap regions, existing methods typically fail to
ensure geometric consistency and reconstruction quality for novel views. To
tackle this tension, we claim that geometric information must be learned
explicitly, and the resulting features should be leveraged to guide the
elevating of semantic quality in novel views. In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{Visual Gaussian Driving (VGD)}, a novel feed-forward end-to-end
learning framework designed to address this challenge. To achieve generalizable
geometric estimation, we design a lightweight variant of the VGGT architecture
to efficiently distill its geometric priors from the pre-trained VGGT to the
geometry branch. Furthermore, we design a Gaussian Head that fuses multi-scale
geometry tokens to predict Gaussian parameters for novel view rendering, which
shares the same patch backbone as the geometry branch. Finally, we integrate
multi-scale features from both geometry and Gaussian head branches to jointly
supervise a semantic refinement model, optimizing rendering quality through
feature-consistent learning. Experiments on nuScenes demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both objective
metrics and subjective quality under various settings, which validates VGD's
scalability and high-fidelity surround-view reconstruction.

TL;DR: A multi-modal co-learning framework for Earth Observation that enables single-modality inference by structuring model manifolds into modality-shared and modality-specific information through contrastive and modality discriminative learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of limited sensor modality access during inference in Earth Observation, where training data is abundant but real-world constraints prevent access to all modalities at deployment time.

Method: Combines contrastive learning and modality discriminative learning to guide single-modality models to separate modality-shared and modality-specific information in the internal model manifold.

Result: Consistent predictive improvements over state-of-the-art approaches on four EO benchmarks spanning classification and regression tasks across different sensor modalities.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enables single-modality inference across diverse Earth Observation applications by leveraging multi-modal training data while requiring only one modality at deployment.

Abstract: Multi-modal co-learning is emerging as an effective paradigm in machine
learning, enabling models to collaboratively learn from different modalities to
enhance single-modality predictions. Earth Observation (EO) represents a
quintessential domain for multi-modal data analysis, wherein diverse remote
sensors collect data to sense our planet. This unprecedented volume of data
introduces novel challenges. Specifically, the access to the same sensor
modalities at both training and inference stages becomes increasingly complex
based on real-world constraints affecting remote sensing platforms. In this
context, multi-modal co-learning presents a promising strategy to leverage the
vast amount of sensor-derived data available at the training stage to improve
single-modality models for inference-time deployment. Most current research
efforts focus on designing customized solutions for either particular
downstream tasks or specific modalities available at the inference stage. To
address this, we propose a novel multi-modal co-learning framework capable of
generalizing across various tasks without targeting a specific modality for
inference. Our approach combines contrastive and modality discriminative
learning together to guide single-modality models to structure the internal
model manifold into modality-shared and modality-specific information. We
evaluate our framework on four EO benchmarks spanning classification and
regression tasks across different sensor modalities, where only one of the
modalities available during training is accessible at inference time. Our
results demonstrate consistent predictive improvements over state-of-the-art
approaches from the recent machine learning and computer vision literature, as
well as EO-specific methods. The obtained findings validate our framework in
the single-modality inference scenarios across a diverse range of EO
applications.

Motivation: There is a need for scalable uncertainty estimation methods in semantic segmentation for remote sensing applications, as most existing research focuses on scene understanding or medical imaging rather than Earth observation.

Method: Extensive evaluation using multiple models (Stochastic Segmentation Networks, ensembles) with various neural architectures and uncertainty metrics on two remote sensing datasets (PASTIS and ForTy) that differ in scale, geographic coverage, and label confidence.

Result: The study provides practical recommendations based on findings about which uncertainty estimation methods work best for identifying prediction errors and noise-corrupted regions in satellite imagery segmentation.

Conclusion: The paper establishes benchmarks and practical guidelines for uncertainty estimation in semantic segmentation specifically tailored for remote sensing and Earth observation applications.

Abstract: This paper investigates methods for estimating uncertainty in semantic
segmentation predictions derived from satellite imagery. Estimating uncertainty
for segmentation presents unique challenges compared to standard image
classification, requiring scalable methods producing per-pixel estimates. While
most research on this topic has focused on scene understanding or medical
imaging, this work benchmarks existing methods specifically for remote sensing
and Earth observation applications. Our evaluation focuses on the practical
utility of uncertainty measures, testing their ability to identify prediction
errors and noise-corrupted input image regions. Experiments are conducted on
two remote sensing datasets, PASTIS and ForTy, selected for their differences
in scale, geographic coverage, and label confidence. We perform an extensive
evaluation featuring several models, such as Stochastic Segmentation Networks
and ensembles, in combination with a number of neural architectures and
uncertainty metrics. We make a number of practical recommendations based on our
findings.

### [56] [Decomposed Attention Fusion in MLLMs for Training-Free Video Reasoning Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19592)
*Su Ho Han,Jeongseok Hyun,Pilhyeon Lee,Minho Shim,Dongyoon Wee,Seon Joo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DecAF is a training-free method that refines attention maps from multimodal LLMs for video reasoning segmentation using contrastive fusion and video-frame fusion, achieving performance comparable to training-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable video reasoning segmentation without retraining MLLMs by converting noisy attention maps into usable segmentation masks through refinement techniques.

Method: Proposes Decomposed Attention Fusion (DecAF) with two mechanisms: contrastive object-background fusion to suppress irrelevant activations, and complementary video-frame fusion to enhance object-focused cues. Also uses attention-guided SAM2 prompting for fine-grained masks.

Result: Outperforms training-free methods and achieves performance comparable to training-based methods on referring and reasoning VOS benchmarks.

Conclusion: DecAF enables effective video reasoning segmentation without requiring MLLM retraining, demonstrating that refined attention maps can be directly converted into segmentation masks.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong video
understanding by attending to visual tokens relevant to textual queries. To
directly adapt this for localization in a training-free manner, we cast video
reasoning segmentation as a video QA task and extract attention maps via
rollout mechanism. However, raw attention maps are noisy and poorly aligned
with object regions. We propose Decomposed Attention Fusion (DecAF), which
refines these maps through two mechanisms: (1) contrastive object-background
fusion and (2) complementary video-frame fusion. This method suppresses
irrelevant activations and enhances object-focused cues, enabling direct
conversion of attention maps into coarse segmentation masks. In addition, we
introduce attention-guided SAM2 prompting for obtaining fine-grained masks.
Unlike existing methods that jointly train MLLMs with SAM, our method operates
entirely without retraining. DecAF outperforms training-free methods and
achieves performance comparable to training-based methods on both referring and
reasoning VOS benchmarks. The code will be available at
https://github.com/HYUNJS/DecAF.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CBDiff introduces a Conditional Bernoulli Diffusion Model for Image Forgery Localization that generates multiple diverse localization maps using Bernoulli noise and Time-Step Cross-Attention to address uncertainty in tampered regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IFL methods produce single deterministic localization maps that lack precision and reliability for high-stakes applications like forensic analysis and security surveillance.

Method: CBDiff uses a Conditional Bernoulli Diffusion Model that incorporates Bernoulli noise to reflect binary/sparse properties of forgery masks and employs Time-Step Cross-Attention for semantic feature guidance with temporal steps.

Result: Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets show CBDiff significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: CBDiff offers enhanced credibility and comprehensive forgery representation, demonstrating strong potential for real-world deployment in image forensics.

Abstract: Image Forgery Localization (IFL) is a crucial task in image forensics, aimed
at accurately identifying manipulated or tampered regions within an image at
the pixel level. Existing methods typically generate a single deterministic
localization map, which often lacks the precision and reliability required for
high-stakes applications such as forensic analysis and security surveillance.
To enhance the credibility of predictions and mitigate the risk of errors, we
introduce an advanced Conditional Bernoulli Diffusion Model (CBDiff). Given a
forged image, CBDiff generates multiple diverse and plausible localization
maps, thereby offering a richer and more comprehensive representation of the
forgery distribution. This approach addresses the uncertainty and variability
inherent in tampered regions. Furthermore, CBDiff innovatively incorporates
Bernoulli noise into the diffusion process to more faithfully reflect the
inherent binary and sparse properties of forgery masks. Additionally, CBDiff
introduces a Time-Step Cross-Attention (TSCAttention), which is specifically
designed to leverage semantic feature guidance with temporal steps to improve
manipulation detection. Extensive experiments on eight publicly benchmark
datasets demonstrate that CBDiff significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its strong potential for real-world
deployment.

*Haozhe Luo,Shelley Zixin Shu,Ziyu Zhou,Sebastian Otalora,Mauricio Reyes*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents the first systematic benchmark (XBench) for evaluating cross-modal interpretability in chest X-rays across seven CLIP-style vision-language models, revealing limitations in reliable grounding for medical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models show strong zero-shot performance in medical image understanding, but their grounding ability (alignment between textual concepts and visual evidence) remains underexplored, which is essential for clinical interpretability and adoption.

Method: Generated visual explanations using cross-attention and similarity-based localization maps, and quantitatively assessed their alignment with radiologist-annotated regions across multiple pathologies using seven CLIP-style VLM variants.

Result: (1) VLMs demonstrate reasonable localization for large/well-defined pathologies but performance degrades for small/diffuse lesions; (2) Chest X-ray-specific pretraining improves alignment; (3) Recognition ability and grounding ability are strongly correlated.

Conclusion: Current VLMs fall short in clinically reliable grounding despite strong recognition ability, highlighting the need for targeted interpretability benchmarks before medical deployment.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently shown remarkable zero-shot
performance in medical image understanding, yet their grounding ability, the
extent to which textual concepts align with visual evidence, remains
underexplored. In the medical domain, however, reliable grounding is essential
for interpretability and clinical adoption. In this work, we present the first
systematic benchmark for evaluating cross-modal interpretability in chest
X-rays across seven CLIP-style VLM variants. We generate visual explanations
using cross-attention and similarity-based localization maps, and
quantitatively assess their alignment with radiologist-annotated regions across
multiple pathologies. Our analysis reveals that: (1) while all VLM variants
demonstrate reasonable localization for large and well-defined pathologies,
their performance substantially degrades for small or diffuse lesions; (2)
models that are pretrained on chest X-ray-specific datasets exhibit improved
alignment compared to those trained on general-domain data. (3) The overall
recognition ability and grounding ability of the model are strongly correlated.
These findings underscore that current VLMs, despite their strong recognition
ability, still fall short in clinically reliable grounding, highlighting the
need for targeted interpretability benchmarks before deployment in medical
practice. XBench code is available at

### [59] [Beyond sparse denoising in frames: minimax estimation with a scattering transform](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19612)
*Nathanaël Cuvelle--Magar,Stéphane Mallat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a denoising estimator using scattering coefficients that achieves minimax asymptotic bounds for cartoon images with unknown Lipschitz exponents α≤2, bridging harmonic analysis and deep learning approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional sparse estimators in frames (wavelets, curvelets) are suboptimal for cartoon images with unknown Lipschitz exponents α≤2, while deep neural networks achieve better results but lack mathematical understanding.

Method: Jointly minimize and maximize ℓ¹ norms of different subsets of scattering coefficients, which are computed by transforming modulus of wavelet coefficients with a second wavelet transform.

Result: Numerical experiments show the denoising estimator reaches minimax asymptotic bounds for cartoon images for all Lipschitz exponents α≤2.

Conclusion: The approach provides a harmonic analysis method for noise suppression and geometric regularity specification, creating a mathematical bridge between harmonic analysis and deep convolutional network denoising.

Abstract: A considerable amount of research in harmonic analysis has been devoted to
non-linear estimators of signals contaminated by additive Gaussian noise. They
are implemented by thresholding coefficients in a frame, which provide a sparse
signal representation, or by minimising their $\ell^1$ norm. However, sparse
estimators in frames are not sufficiently rich to adapt to complex signal
regularities. For cartoon images whose edges are piecewise $\bf C^\alpha$
curves, wavelet, curvelet and Xlet frames are suboptimal if the Lipschitz
exponent $\alpha \leq 2$ is an unknown parameter. Deep convolutional neural
networks have recently obtained much better numerical results, which reach the
minimax asymptotic bounds for all $\alpha$. Wavelet scattering coefficients
have been introduced as simplified convolutional neural network models. They
are computed by transforming the modulus of wavelet coefficients with a second
wavelet transform. We introduce a denoising estimator by jointly minimising and
maximising the $\ell^1$ norms of different subsets of scattering coefficients.
We prove that these $\ell^1$ norms capture different types of geometric image
regularity. Numerical experiments show that this denoising estimator reaches
the minimax asymptotic bound for cartoon images for all Lipschitz exponents
$\alpha \leq 2$. We state this numerical result as a mathematical conjecture.
It provides a different harmonic analysis approach to suppress noise from
signals, and to specify the geometric regularity of functions. It also opens a
mathematical bridge between harmonic analysis and denoising estimators with
deep convolutional network.

*Junfei Zhou,Penglin Dai,Quanmin Wei,Bingyi Liu,Xiao Wu,Jianping Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GenComm enables seamless perception across heterogeneous multi-agent systems through feature generation without retraining, achieving 81% reduction in computational cost and parameters when adding new agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-agent collaboration methods fail in heterogeneous settings due to domain gaps from different sensors/models, intrusive retraining that disrupts semantic consistency, and high computational costs for scalability.

Method: Uses Generative Communication with Deformable Message Extractor for spatial messages, Spatial-Aware Feature Generator with conditional diffusion model to generate aligned features, and Channel Enhancer for refinement before fusion.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on OPV2V-H, DAIR-V2X and V2X-Real datasets with 81% reduction in computational cost and parameter count when incorporating new agents.

Conclusion: GenComm provides a scalable, non-intrusive solution for heterogeneous multi-agent collaboration through generative feature communication and lightweight spatial alignment.

Abstract: Multi-agent collaboration enhances the perception capabilities of individual
agents through information sharing. However, in real-world applications,
differences in sensors and models across heterogeneous agents inevitably lead
to domain gaps during collaboration. Existing approaches based on adaptation
and reconstruction fail to support pragmatic heterogeneous collaboration due to
two key limitations: (1) Intrusive retraining of the encoder or core modules
disrupts the established semantic consistency among agents; and (2)
accommodating new agents incurs high computational costs, limiting scalability.
To address these challenges, we present a novel Generative Communication
mechanism (GenComm) that facilitates seamless perception across heterogeneous
multi-agent systems through feature generation, without altering the original
network, and employs lightweight numerical alignment of spatial information to
efficiently integrate new agents at minimal cost. Specifically, a tailored
Deformable Message Extractor is designed to extract spatial message for each
collaborator, which is then transmitted in place of intermediate features. The
Spatial-Aware Feature Generator, utilizing a conditional diffusion model,
generates features aligned with the ego agent's semantic space while preserving
the spatial information of the collaborators. These generated features are
further refined by a Channel Enhancer before fusion. Experiments conducted on
the OPV2V-H, DAIR-V2X and V2X-Real datasets demonstrate that GenComm
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving an 81\% reduction in
both computational cost and parameter count when incorporating new agents. Our
code is available at https://github.com/jeffreychou777/GenComm.

*Zhengxuan Wei,Jiajin Tang,Sibei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AMR is a zero-external-dependency framework that addresses moment retrieval bottlenecks including data scarcity, boundary ambiguity, and fine-grained semantic discrimination through a two-stage training approach with cold-start curriculum learning and distillation adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome three critical bottlenecks in existing moment retrieval methods: data scarcity leading to shallow keyword associations, boundary ambiguity in transition regions, and insufficient discrimination of fine-grained semantics.

Method: Two-stage training framework: (1) Cold-start stage with curriculum learning on augmented data to build boundary/semantic awareness; (2) Distillation stage with dual query sets (Original Queries for DETR-based localization and Active Queries for dynamic adaptation) and cross-stage distillation loss.

Result: AMR achieves improved performance over prior state-of-the-art approaches on multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed AMR framework effectively resolves boundary ambiguity and semantic confusion without additional data, preserves discriminative capabilities while generalizing to real-world scenarios, and demonstrates superior performance through its two-stage training approach.

Abstract: Existing Moment Retrieval methods face three critical bottlenecks: (1) data
scarcity forces models into shallow keyword-feature associations; (2) boundary
ambiguity in transition regions between adjacent events; (3) insufficient
discrimination of fine-grained semantics (e.g., distinguishing ``kicking" vs.
``throwing" a ball). In this paper, we propose a zero-external-dependency
Augmented Moment Retrieval framework, AMR, designed to overcome local optima
caused by insufficient data annotations and the lack of robust boundary and
semantic discrimination capabilities. AMR is built upon two key insights: (1)
it resolves ambiguous boundary information and semantic confusion in existing
annotations without additional data (avoiding costly manual labeling), and (2)
it preserves boundary and semantic discriminative capabilities enhanced by
training while generalizing to real-world scenarios, significantly improving
performance. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage training framework with
cold-start and distillation adaptation. The cold-start stage employs curriculum
learning on augmented data to build foundational boundary/semantic awareness.
The distillation stage introduces dual query sets: Original Queries maintain
DETR-based localization using frozen Base Queries from the cold-start model,
while Active Queries dynamically adapt to real-data distributions. A
cross-stage distillation loss enforces consistency between Original and Base
Queries, preventing knowledge forgetting while enabling real-world
generalization. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that AMR achieves
improved performance over prior state-of-the-art approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedReason-R1 is a medical vision-language model that addresses limitations in medical imaging diagnosis by incorporating explicit reasoning processes and a novel zoom-in strategy for disease regions, achieving state-of-the-art performance in CT disease diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose VLMs perform poorly in medical domains due to lack of specialized medical imaging datasets and neglect of the diagnostic process that progresses from coarse to fine-grained.

Method: Constructed CT-RATE-VQA dataset with 84K QA pairs; developed MedReason-R1 with explicit reasoning process and zoom-in disease region embedding; introduced GRPO reinforcement learning framework for effective reasoning without manual annotations.

Result: MedReason-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance in CT disease diagnosis while retaining generalization capabilities, outperforming recent general-purpose and medical VLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses key limitations in medical VLM performance through specialized dataset construction, explicit reasoning processes, and innovative zoom-in strategies for disease diagnosis.

Abstract: General-purpose large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong
capabilities in generating detailed descriptions for natural images. However,
their performance in the medical domain remains suboptimal, even for relatively
straightforward tasks, primarily due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality,
specialized medical imaging datasets and the neglect of the diagnostic process
that progresses from coarse to fine-grained. To address the first issue, we
construct the CT-RATE-VQA dataset, which has 84K QA pairs. For the second
issue, we propose MedReason-R1, a medical VLM with explicit reasoning process
for disease diagnosis. MedReason-R1 incorporates a novel strategy that embeds
zoom-in disease region-of-interest areas into the image, highlighting the
crucial role of both global localization and disease-specific details in
enhancing the model's diagnostic performance. Furthermore, we introduce the
GRPO reinforcement learning framework to MedReason-R1, which enables effective
reasoning without relying on costly manual annotations. Compared to recent
general-purpose and medical VLMs, MedReason-R1 achieves state-of-the-art
performance in CT disease diagnosis while retaining generalization. The code,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReAct-GS addresses over-reconstruction artifacts in 3D Gaussian Splatting by introducing an importance-aware densification criterion and a re-activation mechanism to revitalize frozen primitives, achieving state-of-the-art performance while preserving geometric details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting struggles with complex scenes due to over-reconstruction artifacts like local blurring and needle-shape distortions, caused by gradient magnitude dilution and primitive frozen phenomenon where essential Gaussian densification is inhibited.

Method: Introduces ReAct-GS with two key components: (1) importance-aware densification criterion using α-blending weights from multiple viewpoints to re-activate stalled primitive growth, and (2) re-activation mechanism that revitalizes frozen primitives through adaptive parameter perturbations.

Result: Comprehensive experiments show ReAct-GS effectively eliminates over-reconstruction artifacts and achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard novel view synthesis metrics while preserving intricate geometric details. The method also improves other 3D-GS variants like Pixel-GS.

Conclusion: ReAct-GS successfully addresses fundamental limitations in 3D Gaussian Splatting through re-activation principles, demonstrating broad applicability and consistent improvements across various 3D-GS variants.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) achieves real-time photorealistic novel view
synthesis, yet struggles with complex scenes due to over-reconstruction
artifacts, manifesting as local blurring and needle-shape distortions. While
recent approaches attribute these issues to insufficient splitting of
large-scale Gaussians, we identify two fundamental limitations: gradient
magnitude dilution during densification and the primitive frozen phenomenon,
where essential Gaussian densification is inhibited in complex regions while
suboptimally scaled Gaussians become trapped in local optima. To address these
challenges, we introduce ReAct-GS, a method founded on the principle of
re-activation. Our approach features: (1) an importance-aware densification
criterion incorporating $\alpha$-blending weights from multiple viewpoints to
re-activate stalled primitive growth in complex regions, and (2) a
re-activation mechanism that revitalizes frozen primitives through adaptive
parameter perturbations. Comprehensive experiments across diverse real-world
datasets demonstrate that ReAct-GS effectively eliminates over-reconstruction
artifacts and achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard novel view
synthesis metrics while preserving intricate geometric details. Additionally,
our re-activation mechanism yields consistent improvements when integrated with
other 3D-GS variants such as Pixel-GS, demonstrating its broad applicability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Policy World Model (PWM) integrates world modeling and trajectory planning in autonomous driving, using action-free future state forecasting and collaborative state-action prediction to improve planning performance with only front camera input.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current driving world models are mostly decoupled from planning, and the synergistic relationship between world modeling and planning needs further exploration to enhance autonomous driving systems.

Method: PWM uses action-free future state forecasting, collaborative state-action prediction, dynamically enhanced parallel token generation, context-guided tokenizer, and adaptive dynamic focal loss for efficient video forecasting.

Result: The method matches or exceeds state-of-the-art approaches that use multi-view and multi-modal inputs, despite using only front camera input.

Conclusion: PWM demonstrates effective integration of world modeling and planning, enabling human-like anticipatory perception and reliable planning performance in autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in driving world models, their potential for
autonomous systems remains largely untapped: the world models are mostly
learned for world simulation and decoupled from trajectory planning. While
recent efforts aim to unify world modeling and planning in a single framework,
the synergistic facilitation mechanism of world modeling for planning still
requires further exploration. In this work, we introduce a new driving paradigm
named Policy World Model (PWM), which not only integrates world modeling and
trajectory planning within a unified architecture, but is also able to benefit
planning using the learned world knowledge through the proposed action-free
future state forecasting scheme. Through collaborative state-action prediction,
PWM can mimic the human-like anticipatory perception, yielding more reliable
planning performance. To facilitate the efficiency of video forecasting, we
further introduce a dynamically enhanced parallel token generation mechanism,
equipped with a context-guided tokenizer and an adaptive dynamic focal loss.
Despite utilizing only front camera input, our method matches or exceeds
state-of-the-art approaches that rely on multi-view and multi-modal inputs.

TL;DR: This paper adapts visual search paradigms from cognitive psychology to test whether multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit human-like "pop-out" effects and capacity limits in visual processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the underlying mechanisms of MLLMs' visual processing, which remains opaque despite strong task performance, by using cognitively grounded diagnostic tools.

Method: Used controlled visual search experiments targeting color, size and lighting features, adapting classic cognitive psychology paradigms to test pop-out effects and capacity limits in MLLMs.

Result: Advanced MLLMs exhibit human-like pop-out effects in color/size-based disjunctive search and capacity limits for conjunctive search. They also incorporate natural scene priors like lighting direction into object representations.

Conclusion: Visual search serves as a valuable cognitively grounded diagnostic tool for evaluating perceptual capabilities in MLLMs, revealing human-like visual processing mechanisms.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on
vision-language tasks, yet their visual processing is opaque. Most black-box
evaluations measure task accuracy, but reveal little about underlying
mechanisms. Drawing on cognitive psychology, we adapt classic visual search
paradigms -- originally developed to study human perception -- to test whether
MLLMs exhibit the ``pop-out'' effect, where salient visual features are
detected independently of distractor set size. Using controlled experiments
targeting colour, size and lighting features, we find that advanced MLLMs
exhibit human-like pop-out effects in colour or size-based disjunctive (single
feature) search, as well as capacity limits for conjunctive (multiple feature)
search. We also find evidence to suggest that MLLMs, like humans, incorporate
natural scene priors such as lighting direction into object representations. We
reinforce our findings using targeted fine-tuning and mechanistic
interpretability analyses. Our work shows how visual search can serve as a
cognitively grounded diagnostic tool for evaluating perceptual capabilities in
MLLMs.

TL;DR: CST is a framework that preserves fine curvilinear structures in unpaired medical image translation by integrating structure consistency and topological supervision into existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unpaired image translation methods often distort fine curvilinear structures like microvasculature, which is critical for diagnostic reliability in medical imaging domains like ophthalmology and vascular imaging.

Method: CST augments baseline models with a curvilinear extraction module for topological supervision, integrating structure consistency into training. It can be seamlessly incorporated into existing methods like CycleGAN and UNSB.

Result: Comprehensive evaluation across three imaging modalities (OCT angiography, color fundus, and X-ray coronary angiography) shows CST improves translation fidelity and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: CST establishes a principled pathway toward curvilinear structure-aware cross-domain translation in medical imaging by reinforcing geometric integrity in learned mappings.

Abstract: Unpaired image-to-image translation has emerged as a crucial technique in
medical imaging, enabling cross-modality synthesis, domain adaptation, and data
augmentation without costly paired datasets. Yet, existing approaches often
distort fine curvilinear structures, such as microvasculature, undermining both
diagnostic reliability and quantitative analysis. This limitation is
consequential in ophthalmic and vascular imaging, where subtle morphological
changes carry significant clinical meaning. We propose Curvilinear
Structure-preserving Translation (CST), a general framework that explicitly
preserves fine curvilinear structures during unpaired translation by
integrating structure consistency into the training. Specifically, CST augments
baseline models with a curvilinear extraction module for topological
supervision. It can be seamlessly incorporated into existing methods. We
integrate it into CycleGAN and UNSB as two representative backbones.
Comprehensive evaluation across three imaging modalities: optical coherence
tomography angiography, color fundus and X-ray coronary angiography
demonstrates that CST improves translation fidelity and achieves
state-of-the-art performance. By reinforcing geometric integrity in learned
mappings, CST establishes a principled pathway toward curvilinear
structure-aware cross-domain translation in medical imaging.

TL;DR: Proposes Ensemble-CAM, a novel technique for providing visual explanations of deep learning-based face presentation attack detection systems to improve transparency and trustworthiness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Presentation attacks using fake biometric data pose security threats, and while DL-based PAD systems are effective, they function as black boxes with opaque decisions. Explainability techniques are needed to understand model behavior and identify key regions that influence decisions.

Method: Developed Ensemble-CAM, a technique for generating visual explanations that highlight the key regions in biometric images that lead DL-based face PAD systems to classify them as real or fake.

Result: The proposed Ensemble-CAM technique provides visual explanations that help understand the decisions of DL-based face PAD systems, identifying the specific image regions that influence classification outcomes.

Conclusion: Ensemble-CAM enhances the transparency and trustworthiness of DL-based face PAD systems by providing visual explanations that make model decisions more interpretable and understandable to users.

Abstract: Presentation attacks represent a critical security threat where adversaries
use fake biometric data, such as face, fingerprint, or iris images, to gain
unauthorized access to protected systems. Various presentation attack detection
(PAD) systems have been designed leveraging deep learning (DL) models to
mitigate this type of threat. Despite their effectiveness, most of the DL
models function as black boxes - their decisions are opaque to their users. The
purpose of explainability techniques is to provide detailed information about
the reason behind the behavior or decision of DL models. In particular, visual
explanation is necessary to better understand the decisions or predictions of
DL-based PAD systems and determine the key regions due to which a biometric
image is considered real or fake by the system. In this work, a novel
technique, Ensemble-CAM, is proposed for providing visual explanations for the
decisions made by deep learning-based face PAD systems. Our goal is to improve
DL-based face PAD systems by providing a better understanding of their
behavior. Our provided visual explanations will enhance the transparency and
trustworthiness of DL-based face PAD systems.

TL;DR: LyTimeT is a two-phase framework that extracts interpretable dynamical variables from videos by combining spatio-temporal attention with stability constraints, achieving robust latent representations and accurate long-horizon predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extracting true dynamical variables from high-dimensional video is challenging due to distracting visual factors like background motion, occlusions, and texture changes.

Method: Two-phase approach: Phase 1 uses TimeSformer-based autoencoder with global attention for distraction-robust latent learning; Phase 2 selects meaningful dimensions via linear correlation and refines dynamics with Lyapunov-based stability regularizer.

Result: Achieves best mutual information and intrinsic dimension estimates, remains invariant under background perturbations, and delivers lowest analytical mean squared error compared to CNN-based and transformer-only baselines on synthetic and real-world systems.

Conclusion: Combining spatio-temporal attention with stability constraints yields predictive models that are both accurate and physically interpretable.

Abstract: Extracting the true dynamical variables of a system from high-dimensional
video is challenging due to distracting visual factors such as background
motion, occlusions, and texture changes. We propose LyTimeT, a two-phase
framework for interpretable variable extraction that learns robust and stable
latent representations of dynamical systems. In Phase 1, LyTimeT employs a
spatio-temporal TimeSformer-based autoencoder that uses global attention to
focus on dynamically relevant regions while suppressing nuisance variation,
enabling distraction-robust latent state learning and accurate long-horizon
video prediction. In Phase 2, we probe the learned latent space, select the
most physically meaningful dimensions using linear correlation analysis, and
refine the transition dynamics with a Lyapunov-based stability regularizer to
enforce contraction and reduce error accumulation during roll-outs. Experiments
on five synthetic benchmarks and four real-world dynamical systems, including
chaotic phenomena, show that LyTimeT achieves mutual information and intrinsic
dimension estimates closest to ground truth, remains invariant under background
perturbations, and delivers the lowest analytical mean squared error among
CNN-based (TIDE) and transformer-only baselines. Our results demonstrate that
combining spatio-temporal attention with stability constraints yields
predictive models that are not only accurate but also physically interpretable.

*Shaohang Jia,Zhiyong Huang,Zhi Yu,Mingyang Hou,Shuai Miao,Han Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ADQ is a mixed-precision quantization framework that addresses non-uniform activation distributions and static weight codebooks through adaptive weight quantization with quantile-based initialization, EMA-based codebook adaptation, and sensitivity-informed bit allocation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing quantization methods face challenges with highly non-uniform activation distributions and static, mismatched codebooks in weight quantization, limiting deployment on resource-constrained devices.

Method: Proposes Adaptive Distribution-aware Quantization (ADQ) with three key innovations: quantile-based initialization for codebook alignment, EMA-based online codebook adaptation to track distribution shifts, and sensitivity-informed mixed-precision allocation. Also includes hardware-friendly non-uniform-to-uniform mapping for activations.

Result: On ImageNet, ADQ achieves 71.512% Top-1 accuracy for ResNet-18 with average bit-width of only 2.81 bits, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies on CIFAR-10 validate individual component contributions.

Conclusion: ADQ effectively addresses key quantization challenges through adaptive distribution-aware techniques, enabling high-performance neural network deployment on resource-constrained devices with significantly reduced bit-widths.

Abstract: Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) is a critical technique for deploying deep
neural networks on resource-constrained devices. However, existing methods
often face two major challenges: the highly non-uniform distribution of
activations and the static, mismatched codebooks used in weight quantization.
To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Distribution-aware
Quantization (ADQ), a mixed-precision quantization framework that employs a
differentiated strategy. The core of ADQ is a novel adaptive weight
quantization scheme comprising three key innovations: (1) a quantile-based
initialization method that constructs a codebook closely aligned with the
initial weight distribution; (2) an online codebook adaptation mechanism based
on Exponential Moving Average (EMA) to dynamically track distributional shifts;
and (3) a sensitivity-informed strategy for mixed-precision allocation. For
activations, we integrate a hardware-friendly non-uniform-to-uniform mapping
scheme. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method. On
ImageNet, ADQ enables a ResNet-18 to achieve 71.512% Top-1 accuracy with an
average bit-width of only 2.81 bits, outperforming state-of-the-art methods
under comparable conditions. Furthermore, detailed ablation studies on CIFAR-10
systematically demonstrate the individual contributions of each innovative
component, validating the rationale and effectiveness of our design.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniMotion-X is a unified multimodal framework for whole-body human motion generation using autoregressive diffusion transformer, supporting diverse tasks like text-to-motion, music-to-dance, and speech-to-gesture with enhanced consistency through reference motion conditioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for versatile and consistent whole-body human motion generation across multiple modalities and tasks, overcoming multimodal conflicts and enabling realistic, coherent animations.

Method: Uses autoregressive diffusion transformer in sequence-to-sequence manner; introduces reference motion conditioning for consistency; employs progressive weak-to-strong mixed-condition training; constructs OmniMoCap-X dataset with 28 MoCap sources standardized to SMPL-X format; uses GPT-4o for automated hierarchical captioning.

Result: Significantly surpasses existing methods with state-of-the-art performance across multiple multimodal tasks; enables interactive generation of realistic, coherent, and controllable long-duration motions.

Conclusion: OmniMotion-X provides a comprehensive solution for versatile multimodal human motion generation with superior performance and enhanced consistency through novel conditioning and training strategies.

Abstract: This paper introduces OmniMotion-X, a versatile multimodal framework for
whole-body human motion generation, leveraging an autoregressive diffusion
transformer in a unified sequence-to-sequence manner. OmniMotion-X efficiently
supports diverse multimodal tasks, including text-to-motion, music-to-dance,
speech-to-gesture, and global spatial-temporal control scenarios (e.g., motion
prediction, in-betweening, completion, and joint/trajectory-guided synthesis),
as well as flexible combinations of these tasks. Specifically, we propose the
use of reference motion as a novel conditioning signal, substantially enhancing
the consistency of generated content, style, and temporal dynamics crucial for
realistic animations. To handle multimodal conflicts, we introduce a
progressive weak-to-strong mixed-condition training strategy. To enable
high-quality multimodal training, we construct OmniMoCap-X, the largest unified
multimodal motion dataset to date, integrating 28 publicly available MoCap
sources across 10 distinct tasks, standardized to the SMPL-X format at 30 fps.
To ensure detailed and consistent annotations, we render sequences into videos
and use GPT-4o to automatically generate structured and hierarchical captions,
capturing both low-level actions and high-level semantics. Extensive
experimental evaluations confirm that OmniMotion-X significantly surpasses
existing methods, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across multiple
multimodal tasks and enabling the interactive generation of realistic,
coherent, and controllable long-duration motions.

*Xiaozhen Qiao,Jingkai Zhao,Yuqiu Jiang,Xianda Guo,Zhe Sun,Hongyuan Zhang,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CPL-NC is a lightweight test-time adaptation framework for vision-language models that addresses prototype degradation and class confusion through class-aware prototype caching and negative contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve VLM generalization under distribution shifts by tackling prototype degradation in long-tailed distributions and confusion between semantically similar classes during test-time adaptation.

Method: Uses Class-Aware Prototype Cache Module with dynamic per-class capacity adjustment and rejuvenation mechanism, plus Negative Contrastive Learning Mechanism to constrain hard negatives. Employs asymmetric optimization refining only textual prototypes while anchoring on stable visual features.

Result: Outperforms prior TTA methods across 15 benchmarks with both ResNet-50 and ViT-B/16 backbones.

Conclusion: CPL-NC effectively enhances VLM generalization under distribution shifts through its lightweight test-time adaptation framework.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive zero-shot generalization
through large-scale image-text pretraining, yet their performance can drop once
the deployment distribution diverges from the training distribution. To address
this, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods update models using unlabeled target
data. However, existing approaches often ignore two key challenges: prototype
degradation in long-tailed distributions and confusion between semantically
similar classes. To tackle these issues, we propose \textbf{C}lass-Aware
\textbf{P}rototype \textbf{L}earning with \textbf{N}egative
\textbf{C}ontrast(\textbf{CPL-NC}), a lightweight TTA framework designed
specifically for VLMs to enhance generalization under distribution shifts.
CPL-NC introduces a \textit{Class-Aware Prototype Cache} Module that
dynamically adjusts per-class capacity based on test-time frequency and
activation history, with a rejuvenation mechanism for inactive classes to
retain rare-category knowledge. Additionally, a \textit{Negative Contrastive
Learning} Mechanism identifies and constrains hard visual-textual negatives to
improve class separability. The framework employs asymmetric optimization,
refining only textual prototypes while anchoring on stable visual features.
Experiments on 15 benchmarks show that CPL-NC consistently outperforms prior
TTA methods across both ResNet-50 and ViT-B/16 backbones.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal models have demonstrated remarkable text-guided
image editing capabilities, with systems like GPT-4o and Nano-Banana setting
new benchmarks. However, the research community's progress remains constrained
by the absence of large-scale, high-quality, and openly accessible datasets
built from real images. We introduce Pico-Banana-400K, a comprehensive
400K-image dataset for instruction-based image editing. Our dataset is
constructed by leveraging Nano-Banana to generate diverse edit pairs from real
photographs in the OpenImages collection. What distinguishes Pico-Banana-400K
from previous synthetic datasets is our systematic approach to quality and
diversity. We employ a fine-grained image editing taxonomy to ensure
comprehensive coverage of edit types while maintaining precise content
preservation and instruction faithfulness through MLLM-based quality scoring
and careful curation. Beyond single turn editing, Pico-Banana-400K enables
research into complex editing scenarios. The dataset includes three specialized
subsets: (1) a 72K-example multi-turn collection for studying sequential
editing, reasoning, and planning across consecutive modifications; (2) a
56K-example preference subset for alignment research and reward model training;
and (3) paired long-short editing instructions for developing instruction
rewriting and summarization capabilities. By providing this large-scale,
high-quality, and task-rich resource, Pico-Banana-400K establishes a robust
foundation for training and benchmarking the next generation of text-guided

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper analyzes evaluation metrics for monocular depth estimation, revealing their limitations and proposing new metrics and visualization tools for better human alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of standardization in evaluating monocular depth estimation, with many metrics whose behaviors and trade-offs are not well understood. The paper aims to quantitatively analyze existing metrics and their sensitivity to ground truth perturbations.

Method: The authors conducted a quantitative analysis of existing metrics by testing their sensitivity to various types of ground truth perturbations, with emphasis on comparison to human judgment. They introduced a new metric based on relative surface normals and developed new depth visualization tools and a principled method to create composite metrics.

Result: The analysis revealed that existing metrics are severely under-sensitive to curvature perturbations (like making flat surfaces wavy). The proposed new metric and composite metrics showed better alignment with human judgment.

Conclusion: Current evaluation metrics for monocular depth estimation have significant limitations, particularly in detecting curvature errors. The paper provides improved metrics and tools that better align with human perception for more reliable depth estimation evaluation.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation is an important task with rapid progress, but how
to evaluate it remains an open question, as evidenced by a lack of
standardization in existing literature and a large selection of evaluation
metrics whose trade-offs and behaviors are not well understood. This paper
contributes a novel, quantitative analysis of existing metrics in terms of
their sensitivity to various types of perturbations of ground truth,
emphasizing comparison to human judgment. Our analysis reveals that existing
metrics are severely under-sensitive to curvature perturbation such as making
flat surfaces wavy. To remedy this, we introduce a new metric based on relative
surface normals, along with new depth visualization tools and a principled
method to create composite metrics with better human alignment. Code and data
