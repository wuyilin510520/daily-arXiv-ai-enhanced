### [1] [Pathological Truth Bias in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22674)
*Yash Thube*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MATS is a behavioral audit that measures how well vision-language models reject visually contradicted statements, revealing systematic failures in instruction-tuned generative VLMs while contrastive encoders show better robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard benchmarks can hide systematic failures in Vision Language Models (VLMs) that reduce real-world trust, so there's a need for better evaluation methods that uncover these issues.

Method: Introduces MATS (Multimodal Audit for Truthful Spatialization) with two metrics: Spatial Consistency Score (SCS) and Incorrect Agreement Rate (IAR), plus activation patching to localize failure points in models.

Result: Instruction-tuned generative VLMs (LLaVA 1.5, QwenVLchat) show very low SCS and high IAR, while contrastive encoders (CLIP, SigLIP) are far more robust. Activation patching identifies failure loci in cross-attention layers for generative models and pooled projection components for contrastive models.

Conclusion: The audit reveals systematic weaknesses in current VLMs and suggests concrete repair paths through identified failure loci, enabling targeted improvements to model reliability.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are improving quickly, but standard benchmarks
can hide systematic failures that reduce real world trust. We introduce MATS
(Multimodal Audit for Truthful Spatialization), a compact behavioral audit that
measures whether models reject visually contradicted statements, and two
metrics Spatial Consistency Score (SCS) and Incorrect Agreement Rate (IAR).
Instruction tuned generative VLMs (LLaVA 1.5, QwenVLchat) exhibit very low SCS
and high IAR, while contrastive encoders (CLIP, SigLIP) are far more robust.
Activation patching causally localizes failure loci (mid to late cross
attention for generative models, pooled projection components for contrastive
models) and suggests concrete repair paths.

### [2] [Scale and Rotation Estimation of Similarity-Transformed Images via Cross-Correlation Maximization Based on Auxiliary Function Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22686)
*Shinji Yamashita,Yuma Kinoshita,Hitoshi Kiya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel algorithm for joint scale and rotation estimation between images with sub-pixel precision using Fourier transform in log-polar coordinates and cross-correlation maximization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional phase-correlation methods work well for translational shifts but fail to handle scale and rotation changes that occur from camera zooming or rotational movements.

Method: Integrates scale and rotation estimation using Fourier transform in log-polar coordinates with cross-correlation maximization strategy, leveraging auxiliary function method and sub-pixel-level cross-correlation.

Result: Experimental results show lower mean estimation errors for both scale and rotation compared to conventional Fourier transform-based methods using discrete cross-correlation.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides more precise joint estimation of scale and rotation with sub-pixel accuracy, outperforming existing Fourier-based techniques.

Abstract: This paper introduces a highly efficient algorithm capable of jointly
estimating scale and rotation between two images with sub-pixel precision.
Image alignment serves as a critical process for spatially registering images
captured from different viewpoints, and finds extensive use in domains such as
medical imaging and computer vision. Traditional phase-correlation techniques
are effective in determining translational shifts; however, they are inadequate
when addressing scale and rotation changes, which often arise due to camera
zooming or rotational movements. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm
that integrates scale and rotation estimation based on the Fourier transform in
log-polar coordinates with a cross-correlation maximization strategy,
leveraging the auxiliary function method. By incorporating sub-pixel-level
cross-correlation our method enables precise estimation of both scale and
rotation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
lower mean estimation errors for scale and rotation than conventional Fourier
transform-based techniques that rely on discrete cross-correlation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal Large Language Models struggle with structured perception tasks requiring precise localization and robustness, particularly in autonomous driving scenarios.

Method: Proposes a reinforcement learning framework that augments GRPO with curriculum-based data scheduling and difficulty-aware filtering to stabilize optimization under sparse, noisy rewards.

Result: Substantial improvements in detection accuracy and robustness on autonomous driving benchmarks, with ablation studies confirming the importance of reward design, KL regularization, and curriculum pacing.

Conclusion: Reinforcement-driven optimization with structured data curricula provides a scalable path toward robust and interpretable multimodal detection.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language reasoning
but often struggle with structured perception tasks requiring precise
localization and robustness. We propose a reinforcement learning framework that
augments Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with curriculum-based data
scheduling and difficulty-aware filtering. This approach stabilizes
optimization under sparse, noisy rewards and enables progressive adaptation to
complex samples. Evaluations on autonomous driving benchmarks demonstrate
substantial improvements in detection accuracy and robustness. Ablation studies
confirm the importance of reward design, KL regularization, and curriculum
pacing for convergence stability and generalization. Our findings highlight
reinforcement-driven optimization with structured data curricula as a scalable
path toward robust and interpretable multimodal detection.

### [4] [Graph-Theoretic Consistency for Robust and Topology-Aware Semi-Supervised Histopathology Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22689)
*Ha-Hieu Pham,Minh Le,Han Huynh,Nguyen Quoc Khanh Le,Huy-Hieu Pham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TGC is a semi-supervised semantic segmentation framework that uses graph-theoretic constraints to enforce global topology, improving segmentation accuracy in computational pathology with limited supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semi-supervised methods rely on pixel-level consistency, which propagates noisy pseudo-labels and produces fragmented or topologically invalid masks in computational pathology where dense annotations are costly.

Method: Proposes Topology Graph Consistency (TGC) framework that integrates graph-theoretic constraints by aligning Laplacian spectra, component counts, and adjacency statistics between prediction graphs and references.

Result: TGC achieves state-of-the-art performance under 5-10% supervision on GlaS and CRAG datasets, significantly narrowing the gap to full supervision.

Conclusion: The proposed TGC framework effectively enforces global topology in semi-supervised semantic segmentation, demonstrating superior performance in computational pathology with limited labeled data.

Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS) is vital in computational
pathology, where dense annotations are costly and limited. Existing methods
often rely on pixel-level consistency, which propagates noisy pseudo-labels and
produces fragmented or topologically invalid masks. We propose Topology Graph
Consistency (TGC), a framework that integrates graph-theoretic constraints by
aligning Laplacian spectra, component counts, and adjacency statistics between
prediction graphs and references. This enforces global topology and improves
segmentation accuracy. Experiments on GlaS and CRAG demonstrate that TGC
achieves state-of-the-art performance under 5-10% supervision and significantly
narrows the gap to full supervision. Code is available at

### [5] [A review of Recent Techniques for Person Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22690)
*Andrea Asperti,Salvatore Fiorilla,Simone Nardi,Lorenzo Orsini*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This survey paper reviews both supervised and unsupervised person re-identification methods, highlighting that supervised approaches have limited room for improvement while unsupervised techniques are rapidly advancing and narrowing the performance gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised person Re-ID requires extensive annotated data which poses scalability challenges, while unsupervised methods can leverage abundant unlabeled data, making them more practical for real-world applications.

Method: The survey categorizes and reviews significant publications in both supervised and unsupervised person re-identification, with particular focus on recent unsupervised advancements from the past three years.

Result: The analysis shows that supervised approaches have reached near-optimal performance with little room for improvement, while unsupervised techniques are showing promising developments and narrowing the performance gap with supervised methods.

Conclusion: Unsupervised person re-identification is emerging as a viable alternative to supervised methods, with the potential for performance convergence between the two paradigms, making it a promising direction for future research and practical applications.

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReId), a crucial task in surveillance, involves
matching individuals across different camera views. The advent of Deep
Learning, especially supervised techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks
and Attention Mechanisms, has significantly enhanced person Re-ID. However, the
success of supervised approaches hinges on vast amounts of annotated data,
posing scalability challenges in data labeling and computational costs. To
address these limitations, recent research has shifted towards unsupervised
person re-identification. Leveraging abundant unlabeled data, unsupervised
methods aim to overcome the need for pairwise labelled data. Although
traditionally trailing behind supervised approaches, unsupervised techniques
have shown promising developments in recent years, signalling a narrowing
performance gap. Motivated by this evolving landscape, our survey pursues two
primary objectives. First, we review and categorize significant publications in
supervised person re-identification, providing an in-depth overview of the
current state-of-the-art and emphasizing little room for further improvement in
this domain. Second, we explore the latest advancements in unsupervised person
re-identification over the past three years, offering insights into emerging
trends and shedding light on the potential convergence of performance between
supervised and unsupervised paradigms. This dual-focus survey aims to
contribute to the evolving narrative of person re-identification, capturing
both the mature landscape of supervised techniques and the promising outcomes
in the realm of unsupervised learning.

### [6] [Sequential Token Merging: Revisiting Hidden States](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22691)
*Yan Wen,Peng Ye,Lin Zhang,Baopu Li,Jiakang Yuan,Yaoxin Yang,Tao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision Mambas (ViMs) have sub-quadratic complexity but suffer from quadratic token scaling. The paper proposes Sequential Token Merging (STM) to address Limited Directional Sequential Dependence and leverage Mamba's selective scan for efficient token reduction with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ViMs achieve remarkable success but their efficiency is constrained by quadratic token scaling with image resolution. Existing methods overlook ViMs' intrinsic Limited Directional Sequential Dependence (LDSD) - a critical information flow mechanism.

Method: Proposed Sequential Token Merging (STM) with: 1) Bidirectional nearest neighbor merging to preserve sequential dependencies through symmetric spatial aggregation, and 2) Hidden states protection to stabilize hidden states around the class token. STM leverages Mamba's layer-wise loss convergence to convert temporal forgetfulness into stability.

Result: STM achieves superior performance: 1.0% accuracy drop for ViM-Ti at 20% token reduction, and only 1.4% degradation for ViM-S at 40% reduction. The method achieves state-of-the-art efficiency with minimal complexity.

Conclusion: STM provides an effective solution for token reduction in Vision Mambas while maintaining performance, and offers new insights into state-space model dynamics through its analysis of sequential dependencies and hidden state protection mechanisms.

Abstract: Vision Mambas (ViMs) achieve remarkable success with sub-quadratic
complexity, but their efficiency remains constrained by quadratic token scaling
with image resolution. While existing methods address token redundancy, they
overlook ViMs' intrinsic Limited Directional Sequential Dependence (LDSD) - a
critical information flow mechanism revealed in our analysis. We further
identify Mamba's selective scan enables gradual information aggregation in
hidden states. Based on these insights, we propose Sequential Token Merging
(STM), featuring: 1) Bidirectional nearest neighbor merging to preserve
sequential dependencies through symmetric spatial aggregation, and 2) Hidden
states protection to stabilize the hidden states around the class token. STM
strategically leverages Mamba's layer-wise loss convergence to convert temporal
forgetfulness into stability. Experiments demonstrate STM's superiority: 1.0%
accuracy drop for ViM-Ti at 20% token reduction, and only 1.4% degradation for
ViM-S at 40% reduction. Our method achieves state-of-the-art efficiency with
minimal complexity, while providing new insights into state-space model
dynamics. Codes will be released soon.

### [7] [Deep Learning Empowered Super-Resolution: A Comprehensive Survey and Future Prospects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22692)
*Le Zhang,Ao Li,Qibin Hou,Ce Zhu,Yonina C. Eldar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper provides a comprehensive survey of super-resolution methods across multiple domains including single image, video, stereo, and light field super-resolution, analyzing over 250 methods and creating a taxonomy based on backbone structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing super-resolution surveys focus on specific domains, lacking a comprehensive overview of the entire field despite significant advances in deep learning techniques and growing demand for high-quality visual applications.

Method: The authors conducted an in-depth review of diverse SR methods, extensively covering over 150 SISR methods, nearly 70 VSR approaches, and approximately 30 techniques for SSR and LFSR.

Conclusion: This work serves as a valuable resource and offers guidance to researchers in the super-resolution domain, addressing the gap in comprehensive surveys and exploring under-studied open issues in the field.

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) has garnered significant attention within the computer
vision community, driven by advances in deep learning (DL) techniques and the
growing demand for high-quality visual applications. With the expansion of this
field, numerous surveys have emerged. Most existing surveys focus on specific
domains, lacking a comprehensive overview of this field. Here, we present an
in-depth review of diverse SR methods, encompassing single image
super-resolution (SISR), video super-resolution (VSR), stereo super-resolution
(SSR), and light field super-resolution (LFSR). We extensively cover over 150
SISR methods, nearly 70 VSR approaches, and approximately 30 techniques for SSR
and LFSR. We analyze methodologies, datasets, evaluation protocols, empirical
results, and complexity. In addition, we conducted a taxonomy based on each
backbone structure according to the diverse purposes. We also explore valuable
yet under-studied open issues in the field. We believe that this work will
serve as a valuable resource and offer guidance to researchers in this domain.
To facilitate access to related work, we created a dedicated repository

### [8] [Learning Hyperspectral Images with Curated Text Prompts for Efficient Multimodal Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22697)
*Abhiroop Chatterjee,Susmita Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A parameter-efficient Vision-Language Model for hyperspectral image understanding using CLIP-style contrastive learning with minimal parameter updates (0.07% of total parameters).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral images have high-dimensional 3D voxel structures that are underexplored for cross-modal alignment with language models, unlike natural images and text.

Method: CLIP-style contrastive training framework that maps HSI voxel embeddings to frozen large embedding model's latent space using trainable probe, with hard/semi-hard negatives and descriptive prompts for alignment.

Result: State-of-the-art performance: +0.92 OA and +1.60 Kappa on Indian Pines, +0.69 OA and +0.90 Kappa on Pavia University, with 50-90x fewer parameters than baselines.

Conclusion: Parameter-efficient VLM for hyperspectral scene understanding achieves superior performance with minimal parameter updates, demonstrating effective cross-modal alignment in the hyperspectral domain.

Abstract: As data requirements continue to grow, efficient learning increasingly
depends on the curation and distillation of high-value data rather than
brute-force scaling of model sizes. In the case of a hyperspectral image (HSI),
the challenge is amplified by the high-dimensional 3D voxel structure, where
each spatial location is associated with hundreds of contiguous spectral
channels. While vision and language models have been optimized effectively for
natural image or text tasks, their cross-modal alignment in the hyperspectral
domain remains an open and underexplored problem. In this article, we make an
attempt to optimize a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for hyperspectral scene
understanding by exploiting a CLIP-style contrastive training framework. Our
framework maps voxel-level embeddings from a vision backbone onto the latent
space of a frozen large embedding model (LEM), where a trainable probe aligns
vision features with the model's textual token representations. The two
modalities are aligned via a contrastive loss restricted to a curated set of
hard (closest wrong classes) and semi-hard (random distractors) negatives,
along with positive pairs. To further enhance alignment, descriptive prompts
that encode class semantics are introduced and act as structured anchors for
the HSI embeddings. It is seen that the proposed method updates only 0.07
percent of the total parameters, yet yields state-of-the-art performance. For
example, on Indian Pines (IP) the model produces better results over unimodal
and multimodal baselines by +0.92 Overall Accuracy (OA) and +1.60 Kappa
($\kappa$), while on Pavia University (PU) data it provides gains of +0.69 OA
and +0.90 $\kappa$. Moreover, this is achieved with the set of parameters,
nearly 50$\times$ smaller than DCTN and 90$\times$ smaller than SS-TMNet.

### [9] [Global Prompt Refinement with Non-Interfering Attention Masking for One-Shot Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22700)
*Zhuang Qi,Pan Yu,Lei Meng,Sijin Zhou,Han Yu,Xiaoxiao Li,Xiangxu Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPR-NIAM is a one-shot federated prompt learning method that uses attention masking to restrict interaction between original text and prompt embeddings, enabling better cross-task generalization without multi-round communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated prompt learning methods require multi-round communication and lack cross-task generalization, while one-shot methods focus only on seen tasks without generalization capabilities.

Method: Uses attention isolation module to suppress prompt-to-text attention and reweight text-to-prompt attention, plus cross-silo collaborative refinement to integrate decentralized visual knowledge and align multi-source cross-modal knowledge.

Result: Outperforms eight state-of-the-art methods on ten benchmark datasets in both class-level and domain-level generalization under two tasks.

Conclusion: GPR-NIAM effectively addresses the limitations of existing FPL methods by enabling one-shot learning with strong cross-task generalization through non-interfering attention masking and collaborative refinement.

Abstract: Federated Prompt Learning (FPL) enables communication-efficient adaptation by
tuning lightweight prompts on top of frozen pre-trained models. Existing FPL
methods typically rely on global information, which is only available after the
second training round, to facilitate collaboration among client models.
Therefore, they are inherently dependent on multi-round communication to fully
exhibit their strengths. Moreover, existing one-shot federated learning methods
typically focus on fitting seen tasks, but lack cross-task generalization. To
bridge this gap, we propose the Global Prompt Refinement with Non-Interfering
Attention Masking (GPR-NIAM) method for one-shot FPL. The core idea is to
design a masking mechanism that restricts excessive interaction between the
original text embeddings and the learnable prompt embeddings. GPR-NIAM achieves
this through the collaboration of two key modules. Firstly, the attention
isolation module suppresses attention from the learnable prompt tokens to the
original text tokens, and reweights the reverse attention which preserves
generalization across tasks. Secondly, the cross-silo collaborative refinement
module integrates decentralized visual knowledge into a unified base and
calibrates the global prompt through multi-source cross-modal knowledge
alignment, further mitigating the inconsistency caused by data heterogeneity.
Extensive experiments conducted on ten benchmark datasets under two tasks show
that GPR-NIAM outperforms eight state-of-the-art methods in both class-level
and domain-level generalization.

*Ahed Alboody*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GZSL-MoE, a Generative Zero-Shot Learning model that integrates Mixture-of-Experts layers to generate realistic features for unseen classes in 3D point cloud semantic segmentation, applied to HRC environments using the COVERED dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of 3D point cloud semantic segmentation when comprehensive training data for all object classes is unavailable, particularly in Human-Robot Collaboration environments.

Method: Integrates Mixture-of-Experts layers into Generator and Discriminator components of GZSL model, using KPConv for feature extraction and generating fake features that resemble real features from seen classes.

Result: The GZSL-MoE model enhances performance on both seen and unseen classes in 3D point cloud semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: GZSL-MoE provides a promising solution for understanding complex 3D environments when complete training data is unavailable, demonstrating improved performance in zero-shot learning scenarios.

Abstract: Generative Zero-Shot Learning approach (GZSL) has demonstrated significant
potential in 3D point cloud semantic segmentation tasks. GZSL leverages
generative models like GANs or VAEs to synthesize realistic features (real
features) of unseen classes. This allows the model to label unseen classes
during testing, despite being trained only on seen classes. In this context, we
introduce the Generalized Zero-Shot Learning based-upon Mixture-of-Experts
(GZSL-MoE) model. This model incorporates Mixture-of-Experts layers (MoE) to
generate fake features that closely resemble real features extracted using a
pre-trained KPConv (Kernel Point Convolution) model on seen classes. The main
contribution of this paper is the integration of Mixture-of-Experts into the
Generator and Discriminator components of the Generative Zero-Shot Learning
model for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation, applied to the COVERED dataset
(CollabOratiVE Robot Environment Dataset) for Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC)
environments. By combining the Generative Zero-Shot Learning model with
Mixture-of- Experts, GZSL-MoE for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation provides
a promising solution for understanding complex 3D environments, especially when
comprehensive training data for all object classes is unavailable. The
performance evaluation of the GZSL-MoE model highlights its ability to enhance
performance on both seen and unseen classes. Keywords Generalized Zero-Shot

### [11] [IBiT: Utilizing Inductive Biases to Create a More Data Efficient Attention Mechanism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22719)
*Adithya Giri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introducing inductive biases through learned masks allows Vision Transformers to learn effectively on small datasets without Knowledge Distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers lack the inductive biases of CNNs, which limits their performance on small datasets despite their explainability and scalability advantages.

Method: Developed Inductively Biased Image Transformers (IBiT) that introduce inductive biases through learned masks.

Result: IBiT transformers are significantly more accurate on small datasets while maintaining the explainability of Transformers.

Conclusion: Learned masks can effectively introduce inductive biases to Vision Transformers, enabling better performance on small datasets without sacrificing explainability.

Abstract: In recent years, Transformer-based architectures have become the dominant
method for Computer Vision applications. While Transformers are explainable and
scale well with dataset size, they lack the inductive biases of Convolutional
Neural Networks. While these biases may be learned on large datasets, we show
that introducing these inductive biases through learned masks allow Vision
Transformers to learn on much smaller datasets without Knowledge Distillation.
These Transformers, which we call Inductively Biased Image Transformers (IBiT),
are significantly more accurate on small datasets, while retaining the
explainability Transformers.

### [12] [LayoutAgent: A Vision-Language Agent Guided Compositional Diffusion for Spatial Layout Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22720)
*Zezhong Fan,Xiaohan Li,Luyi Ma,Kai Zhao,Liang Peng,Topojoy Biswas,Evren Korpeoglu,Kaushiki Nag,Kannan Achan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LayoutAgent is an agentic framework that combines vision-language reasoning with compositional diffusion to generate realistic multi-object scene layouts that respect semantic relations and physical plausibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models lack explicit spatial reasoning for realistic object layouts, while traditional spatial planning methods in robotics fail to capture semantic richness in visual scenes.

Method: The framework uses visual-language models for preprocessing (segmentation, object size estimation, scene graph construction, prompt rewriting), compositional diffusion for bounding box synthesis respecting object relations, and foreground-conditioned image generation for scene composition.

Result: LayoutAgent outperforms state-of-the-art layout generation models in layout coherence, spatial realism and aesthetic alignment.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully bridges the gap between semantic richness and spatial reasoning for realistic multi-object scene generation.

Abstract: Designing realistic multi-object scenes requires not only generating images,
but also planning spatial layouts that respect semantic relations and physical
plausibility. On one hand, while recent advances in diffusion models have
enabled high-quality image generation, they lack explicit spatial reasoning,
leading to unrealistic object layouts. On the other hand, traditional spatial
planning methods in robotics emphasize geometric and relational consistency,
but they struggle to capture semantic richness in visual scenes. To bridge this
gap, in this paper, we propose LayoutAgent, an agentic framework that unifies
vision-language reasoning with compositional diffusion for layout generation.
Given multiple input images with target objects in them, our method first
employs visual-language model to preprocess the inputs through segmentation,
object size estimation, scene graph construction, and prompt rewriting. Then we
leverage compositional diffusion-a method traditionally used in robotics-to
synthesize bounding boxes that respect object relations encoded in the scene
graph for spatial layouts. In the end, a foreground-conditioned image generator
composes the complete scene by rendering the objects into the planned layout
guided by designed prompts. Experiments demonstrate that LayoutAgent
outperforms other state-of-the-art layout generation models in layout
coherence, spatial realism and aesthetic alignment.

### [13] [CompareBench: A Benchmark for Visual Comparison Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22737)
*Jie Cai,Kangning Yang,Lan Fu,Jiaming Ding,Jinlong Li,Huiming Sun,Daitao Xing,Jinglin Shen,Zibo Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CompareBench is a new benchmark for evaluating visual comparison reasoning in VLMs, revealing systematic limitations in temporal ordering, spatial relations, counting, and geometric comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual comparison reasoning is a fundamental but understudied skill in vision-language models that needs better evaluation methods.

Method: Created CompareBench with 1000 QA pairs across four tasks (quantity, temporal, geometric, spatial) derived from auxiliary datasets TallyBench and HistCaps, then evaluated both closed-source and open-source VLMs.

Result: Models show scaling trends but consistently fail at temporal ordering and spatial relations, and make mistakes in basic counting and geometric comparisons that are trivial for humans.

Conclusion: Visual comparison remains a systematic blind spot for current VLMs, and CompareBench provides a foundation for advancing more reliable multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: We introduce CompareBench, a benchmark for evaluating visual comparison
reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs), a fundamental yet understudied
skill. CompareBench consists of 1000 QA pairs across four tasks: quantity
(600), temporal (100), geometric (200), and spatial (100). It is derived from
two auxiliary datasets that we constructed: TallyBench (2000 counting images
with QA) and HistCaps (515 historical images with bilingual captions). We
evaluate both closed-source APIs (OpenAI, Gemini, Claude) and open-source
models (Qwen2.5-VL and Qwen3-VL series). Results show clear scaling trends but
also reveal critical limitations: even the strongest models consistently fail
at temporal ordering and spatial relations, and they often make mistakes in
basic counting and geometric comparisons that are trivial for humans. These
findings demonstrate that visual comparison remains a systematic blind spot for
current VLMs. By providing controlled, diverse, and diagnostic evaluation,
CompareBench establishes a foundation for advancing more reliable multimodal
reasoning.

### [14] [MILR: Improving Multimodal Image Generation via Test-Time Latent Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22761)
*Yapeng Mi,Hengli Li,Yanpeng Zhao,Chenxi Li,Huimin Wu,Xiaojian Ma,Song-Chun Zhu,Ying Nian Wu,Qing Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MILR is a test-time reasoning method that jointly reasons over image and text in a unified latent space using policy gradient optimization guided by an image quality critic, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reasoning-based image generation methods are limited to single modalities or require high-quality reasoning data for fine-tuning, which restricts their effectiveness and applicability.

Method: MILR performs joint reasoning over image and text in a unified latent vector space by searching through discrete token representations using policy gradient method guided by an image quality critic, operating entirely at test time within the MUG framework.

Result: MILR achieves state-of-the-art results on GenEval, T2I-CompBench, and WISE benchmarks, with an 80% improvement over baseline on knowledge-intensive WISE (overall score 0.63), and demonstrates strong temporal and cultural reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: Joint reasoning in a unified latent space is key to MILR's strong performance, enabling effective cross-modal reasoning without requiring fine-tuning data and demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Reasoning-augmented machine learning systems have shown improved performance
in various domains, including image generation. However, existing
reasoning-based methods for image generation either restrict reasoning to a
single modality (image or text) or rely on high-quality reasoning data for
fine-tuning. To tackle these limitations, we propose MILR, a test-time method
that jointly reasons over image and text in a unified latent vector space.
Reasoning in MILR is performed by searching through vector representations of
discrete image and text tokens. Practically, this is implemented via the policy
gradient method, guided by an image quality critic. We instantiate MILR within
the unified multimodal understanding and generation (MUG) framework that
natively supports language reasoning before image synthesis and thus
facilitates cross-modal reasoning. The intermediate model outputs, which are to
be optimized, serve as the unified latent space, enabling MILR to operate
entirely at test time. We evaluate MILR on GenEval, T2I-CompBench, and WISE,
achieving state-of-the-art results on all benchmarks. Notably, on
knowledge-intensive WISE, MILR attains an overall score of 0.63, improving over
the baseline by 80%. Our further analysis indicates that joint reasoning in the
unified latent space is the key to its strong performance. Moreover, our
qualitative studies reveal MILR's non-trivial ability in temporal and cultural
reasoning, highlighting the efficacy of our reasoning method.

*Tangqi Shi,Pietro Lio*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UESA-Net is a U-shaped network with multidirectional shrinkage attention that improves ultrasound lesion segmentation by bridging global context and local details, achieving state-of-the-art performance on breast and thyroid cancer datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of existing networks in reconciling high-level semantics with low-level spatial details in noisy ultrasound images, which suffer from speckle noise, overlapping structures, and weak global-local feature interactions.

Method: Proposed UESA-Net with encoder-decoder architecture using multidirectional shrinkage attention. Encoder blocks use attention along horizontal, vertical, and depth directions with shrinkage strategy, while decoder applies pairwise shrinkage mechanism combining prior knowledge with encoder features.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on TN3K (3493 images) with IoU 0.8487 and BUSI (780 images) with IoU 0.6495.

Conclusion: UESA-Net effectively aggregates multidirectional spatial information and prior knowledge to improve robustness and accuracy in ultrasound segmentation, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Background: Breast and thyroid cancers pose an increasing public-health
burden. Ultrasound imaging is a cost-effective, real-time modality for lesion
detection and segmentation, yet suffers from speckle noise, overlapping
structures, and weak global-local feature interactions. Existing networks
struggle to reconcile high-level semantics with low-level spatial details. We
aim to develop a segmentation framework that bridges the semantic gap between
global context and local detail in noisy ultrasound images.
  Methods: We propose UESA-Net, a U-shaped network with multidirectional
shrinkage attention. The encoder-decoder architecture captures long-range
dependencies and fine-grained structures of lesions. Within each encoding
block, attention modules operate along horizontal, vertical, and depth
directions to exploit spatial details, while a shrinkage (threshold) strategy
integrates prior knowledge and local features. The decoder mirrors the encoder
but applies a pairwise shrinkage mechanism, combining prior low-level physical
cues with corresponding encoder features to enhance context modeling.
  Results: On two public datasets - TN3K (3493 images) and BUSI (780 images) -
UESA-Net achieved state-of-the-art performance with intersection-over-union
(IoU) scores of 0.8487 and 0.6495, respectively.
  Conclusions: UESA-Net effectively aggregates multidirectional spatial
information and prior knowledge to improve robustness and accuracy in breast
and thyroid ultrasound segmentation, demonstrating superior performance to
existing methods on multiple benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GCD methods rely primarily on semantic labels and global image representations, overlooking detailed part-level cues that are crucial for distinguishing closely related categories.

Method: Introduces PartCo (Part-Level Correspondence Prior), a framework that leverages part-level visual feature correspondences to capture finer-grained semantic structures and better understand category relationships.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that PartCo significantly improves the performance of current GCD approaches and achieves state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: PartCo bridges the gap between semantic labels and part-level visual compositions, setting new benchmarks for Generalized Category Discovery by providing more nuanced category understanding through part-level relationships.

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to identify both known and novel
categories within unlabeled data by leveraging a set of labeled examples from
known categories. Existing GCD methods primarily depend on semantic labels and
global image representations, often overlooking the detailed part-level cues
that are crucial for distinguishing closely related categories. In this paper,
we introduce PartCo, short for Part-Level Correspondence Prior, a novel
framework that enhances category discovery by incorporating part-level visual
feature correspondences. By leveraging part-level relationships, PartCo
captures finer-grained semantic structures, enabling a more nuanced
understanding of category relationships. Importantly, PartCo seamlessly
integrates with existing GCD methods without requiring significant
modifications. Our extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that PartCo significantly improves the performance of current GCD
approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results by bridging the gap between
semantic labels and part-level visual compositions, thereby setting new

*Komal Kumar,Rao Muhammad Anwer,Fahad Shahbaz Khan,Salman Khan,Ivan Laptev,Hisham Cholakkal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DEFT is an efficient fine-tuning framework for Text-to-Image models that decomposes weight updates into two trainable low-rank matrices for better task adaptation while maintaining editability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of balancing target distribution alignment, novel concept learning from limited data, and maintaining instruction ability across multiple tasks while preserving editability in efficient fine-tuning of T2I models.

Method: Decompositional Efficient Fine-Tuning (DEFT) adapts pre-trained weights by decomposing updates into: (1) projection onto complement of low-rank subspace, and (2) low-rank update within that subspace using two trainable low-rank matrices.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on Dreambooth, Dreambench Plus (personalization), InsDet (object/scene adaptation), and VisualCloze (universal image generation) datasets with both Stable Diffusion and unified models.

Conclusion: DEFT demonstrates superior performance in efficient fine-tuning with emergent properties, providing an effective framework for adapting T2I models while maintaining flexibility across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained Text-to-Image (T2I) models involves
adjusting the model to suit a particular task or dataset while minimizing
computational resources and limiting the number of trainable parameters.
However, it often faces challenges in striking a trade-off between aligning
with the target distribution: learning a novel concept from a limited image for
personalization and retaining the instruction ability needed for unifying
multiple tasks, all while maintaining editability (aligning with a variety of
prompts or in-context generation). In this work, we introduce DEFT,
Decompositional Efficient Fine-Tuning, an efficient fine-tuning framework that
adapts a pre-trained weight matrix by decomposing its update into two
components with two trainable matrices: (1) a projection onto the complement of
a low-rank subspace spanned by a low-rank matrix, and (2) a low-rank update.
The single trainable low-rank matrix defines the subspace, while the other
trainable low-rank matrix enables flexible parameter adaptation within that
subspace. We conducted extensive experiments on the Dreambooth and Dreambench
Plus datasets for personalization, the InsDet dataset for object and scene
adaptation, and the VisualCloze dataset for a universal image generation
framework through visual in-context learning with both Stable Diffusion and a
unified model. Our results demonstrated state-of-the-art performance,
highlighting the emergent properties of efficient fine-tuning. Our code is

TL;DR: VideoScore2 is a multi-dimensional video evaluation framework that assesses visual quality, text-video alignment, and physical consistency with interpretable rationales, trained on human-annotated data and achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video evaluators provide limited single scores without interpretability or comprehensive analysis, failing to capture the multi-faceted nature of video quality assessment.

Method: Two-stage training pipeline: supervised fine-tuning on VideoFeedback2 dataset (27,168 human-annotated videos) followed by reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance analytical robustness.

Result: Achieves 44.35 (+5.94) accuracy on VideoScore-Bench-v2 and 50.37 (+4.32) average performance across four out-of-domain benchmarks, providing interpretable assessments for controllable generation through reward modeling.

Conclusion: VideoScore2 bridges the gap between evaluation and controllable generation by offering multi-dimensional, interpretable video assessment that outperforms existing methods while enabling effective reward modeling.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video generation have produced increasingly
realistic and diverse content, yet evaluating such videos remains a fundamental
challenge due to their multi-faceted nature encompassing visual quality,
semantic alignment, and physical consistency. Existing evaluators and reward
models are limited to single opaque scores, lack interpretability, or provide
only coarse analysis, making them insufficient for capturing the comprehensive
nature of video quality assessment. We present VideoScore2, a
multi-dimensional, interpretable, and human-aligned framework that explicitly
evaluates visual quality, text-to-video alignment, and physical/common-sense
consistency while producing detailed chain-of-thought rationales. Our model is
trained on a large-scale dataset VideoFeedback2 containing 27,168
human-annotated videos with both scores and reasoning traces across three
dimensions, using a two-stage pipeline of supervised fine-tuning followed by
reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to
enhance analytical robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
VideoScore2 achieves superior performance with 44.35 (+5.94) accuracy on our
in-domain benchmark VideoScore-Bench-v2 and 50.37 (+4.32) average performance
across four out-of-domain benchmarks (VideoGenReward-Bench, VideoPhy2, etc),
while providing interpretable assessments that bridge the gap between

TL;DR: TRUST is a test-time adaptation method for State Space Models that uses uncertainty-guided traversal permutations to improve robustness against distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State Space Models like VMamba show degraded performance under distribution shifts, requiring adaptation methods that leverage their unique architectural properties.

Method: Generates multiple causal perspectives of input images through diverse traversal permutations, uses model predictions as pseudo-labels to update Mamba-specific parameters, and averages adapted weights across traversal scans.

Result: Experiments on seven benchmarks show consistent improvements in robustness and outperformance of existing TTA methods.

Conclusion: TRUST is the first approach to explicitly leverage SSM architectural properties for adaptation, effectively enhancing model robustness against distribution shifts.

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as efficient alternatives to Vision
Transformers (ViTs), with VMamba standing out as a pioneering architecture
designed for vision tasks. However, their generalization performance degrades
significantly under distribution shifts. To address this limitation, we propose
TRUST (Test-Time Refinement using Uncertainty-Guided SSM Traverses), a novel
test-time adaptation (TTA) method that leverages diverse traversal permutations
to generate multiple causal perspectives of the input image. Model predictions
serve as pseudo-labels to guide updates of the Mamba-specific parameters, and
the adapted weights are averaged to integrate the learned information across
traversal scans. Altogether, TRUST is the first approach that explicitly
leverages the unique architectural properties of SSMs for adaptation.
Experiments on seven benchmarks show that TRUST consistently improves
robustness and outperforms existing TTA methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMPB is the first extensive benchmark for evaluating Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on personalization, comprising 10k image-query pairs across 111 concepts. Most VLMs struggle with personalization tasks, especially in dialogue consistency, preference handling, and visual adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual personalization is crucial for user-facing AI systems like smart homes and healthcare, but current VLMs remain underexplored in their ability to adapt to individual users. There is a need for systematic evaluation of VLM personalization capabilities.

Method: Created MMPB benchmark with 10k image-query pairs across 111 concepts in four categories. Evaluated 23 VLMs using three-stage protocol: concept injection, multi-turn dialogue, and personalized querying. Structured personalization into three task types highlighting different VLM properties.

Result: Most VLMs (including closed-source models) struggle with personalization, particularly in maintaining dialogue consistency, handling user preferences, and adapting to visual cues. Identified challenges like refusal behaviors and long-context forgetting.

Conclusion: MMPB reveals substantial room for improvement in VLM personalization and provides a scalable benchmark for future research toward truly personalized multi-modal AI systems.

Abstract: Visual personalization is essential in user-facing AI systems such as smart
homes and healthcare, where aligning model behavior with user-centric concepts
is critical. However, recent large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), despite their
broad applicability, remain underexplored in their ability to adapt to
individual users. In this paper, we introduce MMPB, the first extensive
benchmark for evaluating VLMs on personalization. MMPB comprises 10k
image-query pairs and includes 111 personalizable concepts across four
categories: humans, animals, objects, and characters, with the human category
enriched with preference-grounded queries. We structure personalization into
three main task types, each highlighting a different key property of VLMs.
Using 23 widely used VLMs including both open- and closed-source models, we
evaluate personalization performance via a three-stage protocol: concept
injection, multi-turn dialogue, and personalized querying. Our findings
indicate that most VLMs (including some closed-source models) struggle with
personalization, particularly in maintaining consistency over dialogue,
handling user preferences, and adapting to visual cues. Our analysis reveals
that the challenges in VLM personalization (such as refusal behaviors and
long-context forgetting) highlight substantial room for improvement. By
identifying these limitations and offering a scalable benchmark, MMPB offers
valuable insights and a solid foundation for future research toward truly
personalized multi-modal AI. Project Page: aidaslab.github.io/MMPB

*Roie Kazoom,Alon Goldberg,Hodaya Cohen,Ofer Hadar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework for fully controllable adversarial patch generation that allows attackers to choose both input image and target class, achieving state-of-the-art attack success rates while maintaining visual realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial patch attacks rely on unrealistic white-box assumptions, untargeted objectives, or produce visually conspicuous patches that limit real-world applicability.

Method: Combines generative U-Net design with Grad-CAM-guided patch placement for semantic-aware localization that maximizes attack effectiveness while preserving visual realism.

Result: Achieves attack success rates and target-class success consistently exceeding 99% across convolutional networks and vision transformers, outperforming prior white-box attacks and untargeted baselines.

Conclusion: Establishes a new benchmark for adversarial robustness research by simultaneously ensuring realism, targeted control, and black-box applicability - the three most challenging dimensions of patch-based attacks.

Abstract: Adversarial patch attacks pose a severe threat to deep neural networks, yet
most existing approaches rely on unrealistic white-box assumptions, untargeted
objectives, or produce visually conspicuous patches that limit real-world
applicability. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for fully
controllable adversarial patch generation, where the attacker can freely choose
both the input image x and the target class y target, thereby dictating the
exact misclassification outcome. Our method combines a generative U-Net design
with Grad-CAM-guided patch placement, enabling semantic-aware localization that
maximizes attack effectiveness while preserving visual realism. Extensive
experiments across convolutional networks (DenseNet-121, ResNet-50) and vision
transformers (ViT-B/16, Swin-B/16, among others) demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance across all settings, with attack success
rates (ASR) and target-class success (TCS) consistently exceeding 99%.
  Importantly, we show that our method not only outperforms prior white-box
attacks and untargeted baselines, but also surpasses existing non-realistic
approaches that produce detectable artifacts. By simultaneously ensuring
realism, targeted control, and black-box applicability-the three most
challenging dimensions of patch-based attacks-our framework establishes a new
benchmark for adversarial robustness research, bridging the gap between
theoretical attack strength and practical stealthiness.

TL;DR: CrossScaleNet is a novel architecture combining patch-based cross-attention with multi-scale processing for time series forecasting, achieving both high performance and enhanced temporal explainability without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional post-hoc methods for temporal saliency detection are computationally expensive and challenging, while existing explainable models often fail to maintain strong performance on standard benchmarks.

Method: Uses patch-based cross-attention mechanism with multi-scale processing, embedding attention mechanisms into training to provide intrinsic explainability for temporal saliency.

Result: Outperforms most transformer-based models on real-world forecasting tasks, demonstrates superior performance in both temporal saliency detection and forecasting accuracy, and maintains strong performance across datasets of varying complexity.

Conclusion: CrossScaleNet addresses the gap between explainability and performance, offering a balanced approach that effectively captures temporal saliency while delivering state-of-the-art forecasting performance.

Abstract: Explainability in time series forecasting is essential for improving model
transparency and supporting informed decision-making. In this work, we present
CrossScaleNet, an innovative architecture that combines a patch-based
cross-attention mechanism with multi-scale processing to achieve both high
performance and enhanced temporal explainability. By embedding attention
mechanisms into the training process, our model provides intrinsic
explainability for temporal saliency, making its decision-making process more
transparent. Traditional post-hoc methods for temporal saliency detection are
computationally expensive, particularly when compared to feature importance
detection. While ablation techniques may suffice for datasets with fewer
features, identifying temporal saliency poses greater challenges due to its
complexity. We validate CrossScaleNet on synthetic datasets with known saliency
ground truth and on established public benchmarks, demonstrating the robustness
of our method in identifying temporal saliency. Experiments on real-world
datasets for forecasting task show that our approach consistently outperforms
most transformer-based models, offering better explainability without
sacrificing predictive accuracy. Our evaluations demonstrate superior
performance in both temporal saliency detection and forecasting accuracy.
Moreover, we highlight that existing models claiming explainability often fail
to maintain strong performance on standard benchmarks. CrossScaleNet addresses
this gap, offering a balanced approach that captures temporal saliency
effectively while delivering state-of-the-art forecasting performance across
datasets of varying complexity.

TL;DR: A transfer learning-based approach using multimodal interactive perception network with MAMBA and slice interaction module (SIM) for improved internal gross tumor volume (IGTV) segmentation in lung cancer PET/CT imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths globally, and accurate IGTV delineation is crucial for radiation therapy but is challenged by limited annotated datasets and weak PET signal intensity at tumor boundaries.

Method: Pre-trained multimodal interactive perception network with MAMBA on extensive GTV datasets, fine-tuned on private IGTV cohort from LUCID dataset, with 2.5D segmentation framework incorporating slice interaction module (SIM) using channel and spatial attention branches with depthwise convolutions.

Result: Achieved Dice score of 0.609 on private IGTV dataset, significantly outperforming conventional baseline score of 0.385.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates the potential of transfer learning combined with multimodal techniques and SIM to enhance IGTV segmentation reliability for lung cancer radiation therapy planning.

Abstract: Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancerrelated deaths globally.
Accurate delineation of internal gross tumor volume (IGTV) in PET/CT imaging is
pivotal for optimal radiation therapy in mobile tumors such as lung cancer to
account for tumor motion, yet is hindered by the limited availability of
annotated IGTV datasets and attenuated PET signal intensity at tumor
boundaries. In this study, we present a transfer learningbased methodology
utilizing a multimodal interactive perception network with MAMBA, pre-trained
on extensive gross tumor volume (GTV) datasets and subsequently fine-tuned on a
private IGTV cohort. This cohort constitutes the PET/CT subset of the
Lung-cancer Unified Cross-modal Imaging Dataset (LUCID). To further address the
challenge of weak PET intensities in IGTV peripheral slices, we introduce a
slice interaction module (SIM) within a 2.5D segmentation framework to
effectively model inter-slice relationships. Our proposed module integrates
channel and spatial attention branches with depthwise convolutions, enabling
more robust learning of slice-to-slice dependencies and thereby improving
overall segmentation performance. A comprehensive experimental evaluation
demonstrates that our approach achieves a Dice of 0.609 on the private IGTV
dataset, substantially surpassing the conventional baseline score of 0.385.
This work highlights the potential of transfer learning, coupled with advanced
multimodal techniques and a SIM to enhance the reliability and clinical
relevance of IGTV segmentation for lung cancer radiation therapy planning.

Motivation: Event cameras have bio-inspired properties but obtaining large-scale labeled ground-truth data for event-based vision tasks is challenging and costly.

Method: Leverage diffusion prior from foundation models like Stable Diffusion to synthesize event data guided by diverse control signals (class text labels, 2D skeletons, 3D body poses) with minimal fine-tuning and limited labeled data.

Result: Synthesized event data enhances model performance in visual recognition, 2D skeleton estimation, and 3D body pose estimation tasks, and can generate events based on unseen text labels during training.

Conclusion: The approach streamlines event data generation, reduces labeling costs, and demonstrates powerful text-based generation capabilities inherited from foundation models.

Abstract: In recent years, event cameras have gained significant attention due to their

diffusion prior from foundation models, such as Stable Diffusion, enabling
high-quality event data generation with minimal fine-tuning and limited labeled
data. Our method streamlines the data generation process and significantly
reduces the cost of producing labeled event datasets. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach by synthesizing event data for visual
recognition, 2D skeleton estimation, and 3D body pose estimation. Our
experiments show that the synthesized labeled event data enhances model
performance in all tasks. Additionally, our approach can generate events based
on unseen text labels during training, illustrating the powerful text-based

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KAN-IDIR and RandKAN-IDIR integrate Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) into deformable image registration using implicit neural representations, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with reduced computational costs through randomized basis sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning-based DIR methods require large datasets and struggle with precision, while implicit neural representations need instance-specific optimization with computational efficiency and stability challenges.

Method: Proposed KAN-IDIR and RandKAN-IDIR using KANs with implicit neural representations, featuring randomized basis sampling to reduce basis functions while maintaining quality.

Result: Achieved highest accuracy among INR-based methods across lung CT, brain MRI, and cardiac MRI datasets, with minimal computational overhead and superior learning stability across random seeds.

Conclusion: RandKAN-IDIR with randomized basis sampling slightly outperforms learnable basis models while eliminating training-time complexity, offering an efficient and stable DIR solution.

Abstract: Deformable image registration (DIR) is a cornerstone of medical image
analysis, enabling spatial alignment for tasks like comparative studies and
multi-modal fusion. While learning-based methods (e.g., CNNs, transformers)
offer fast inference, they often require large training datasets and struggle
to match the precision of classical iterative approaches on some organ types
and imaging modalities. Implicit neural representations (INRs) have emerged as
a promising alternative, parameterizing deformations as continuous mappings
from coordinates to displacement vectors. However, this comes at the cost of
requiring instance-specific optimization, making computational efficiency and
seed-dependent learning stability critical factors for these methods. In this
work, we propose KAN-IDIR and RandKAN-IDIR, the first integration of
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) into deformable image registration with
implicit neural representations (INRs). Our proposed randomized basis sampling
strategy reduces the required number of basis functions in KAN while
maintaining registration quality, thereby significantly lowering computational
costs. We evaluated our approach on three diverse datasets (lung CT, brain MRI,
cardiac MRI) and compared it with competing instance-specific learning-based
approaches, dataset-trained deep learning models, and classical registration
approaches. KAN-IDIR and RandKAN-IDIR achieved the highest accuracy among
INR-based methods across all evaluated modalities and anatomies, with minimal
computational overhead and superior learning stability across multiple random
seeds. Additionally, we discovered that our RandKAN-IDIR model with randomized
basis sampling slightly outperforms the model with learnable basis function
indices, while eliminating its additional training-time complexity.

*Federico Chinello,Giacomo Boracchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Convolutional Set Transformer (CST) is a new neural architecture that processes image sets of any size, combining feature extraction and contextual modeling directly on 3D image tensors for superior performance in set-based tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing set-input networks like Deep Sets and Set Transformer can only handle vector inputs, requiring cascading with CNN feature extractors, which prevents synergies between feature extraction and inter-image relationship modeling.

Method: CST operates directly on 3D image tensors, performing simultaneous feature extraction and contextual modeling through a novel architecture that combines convolutional processing with set transformer principles.

Result: CST achieves superior performance in Set Classification and Set Anomaly Detection tasks, provides native compatibility with CNN explainability methods like Grad-CAM, and can be pre-trained on large datasets and adapted to new domains.

Conclusion: CST offers an effective solution for processing visually heterogeneous image sets with shared semantics, enabling better performance, interpretability, and transfer learning capabilities compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: We introduce the Convolutional Set Transformer (CST), a novel neural
architecture designed to process image sets of arbitrary cardinality that are
visually heterogeneous yet share high-level semantics - such as a common
category, scene, or concept. Existing set-input networks, e.g., Deep Sets and
Set Transformer, are limited to vector inputs and cannot directly handle 3D
image tensors. As a result, they must be cascaded with a feature extractor,
typically a CNN, which encodes images into embeddings before the set-input
network can model inter-image relationships. In contrast, CST operates directly
on 3D image tensors, performing feature extraction and contextual modeling
simultaneously, thereby enabling synergies between the two processes. This
design yields superior performance in tasks such as Set Classification and Set
Anomaly Detection and further provides native compatibility with CNN
explainability methods such as Grad-CAM, unlike competing approaches that
remain opaque. Finally, we show that CSTs can be pre-trained on large-scale
datasets and subsequently adapted to new domains and tasks through standard
Transfer Learning schemes. To support further research, we release CST-15, a
CST backbone pre-trained on ImageNet
(https://github.com/chinefed/convolutional-set-transformer).

Conclusion: TY-RIST effectively addresses key challenges in infrared small target detection with optimized architecture, achieving superior accuracy and real-time performance while maintaining strong generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) is critical for defense and
surveillance but remains challenging due to (1) target loss from minimal

from low saliency, and (4) high computational costs. To address these issues,
we propose TY-RIST, an optimized YOLOv12n architecture that integrates (1) a
stride-aware backbone with fine-grained receptive fields, (2) a high-resolution

pruning strategy that reduces computational cost by about 25.5% while
marginally improving accuracy and enabling real-time inference. We also
incorporate the Normalized Gaussian Wasserstein Distance (NWD) to enhance
regression stability. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks and across 20

*Yuelin Xin,Yuheng Liu,Xiaohui Xie,Xinke Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a continuous submanifold field-based embedding representation for 3D Gaussian Splatting to address the challenges of learning from raw Gaussian parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Raw Gaussian parameters in 3DGS are non-unique and heterogeneous, making them difficult to learn as features in neural networks and resulting in highly data-dependent models.

Method: Developed an embedding representation based on continuous submanifold fields that encapsulate intrinsic information of Gaussian primitives while enforcing unique mapping and channel homogeneity.

Result: The proposed representation preserves underlying color and geometric structure of 3D Gaussian Splatting while making it more suitable for neural network learning.

Conclusion: The continuous submanifold field embedding provides a more principled approach to represent 3DGS in neural networks, benefiting the learning process.

Abstract: A well-designed vectorized representation is crucial for the learning systems
natively based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. While 3DGS enables efficient and
explicit 3D reconstruction, its parameter-based representation remains hard to
learn as features, especially for neural-network-based models. Directly feeding
raw Gaussian parameters into learning frameworks fails to address the
non-unique and heterogeneous nature of the Gaussian parameterization, yielding
highly data-dependent models. This challenge motivates us to explore a more
principled approach to represent 3D Gaussian Splatting in neural networks that
preserves the underlying color and geometric structure while enforcing unique
mapping and channel homogeneity. In this paper, we propose an embedding
representation of 3DGS based on continuous submanifold fields that encapsulate
the intrinsic information of Gaussian primitives, thereby benefiting the
learning of 3DGS.

*Yuanzhi Zhu,Xi Wang,Stéphane Lathuilière,Vicky Kalogeiton*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Soft-Di[M]O introduces soft embeddings to make one-step generators from masked diffusion models fully differentiable, enabling post-distillation refinements like GAN training, reward fine-tuning, and test-time optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: One-step generators from masked diffusion models suffer from inherited modeling bias and discrete token outputs that block gradient flow, preventing post-distillation refinements.

Method: Replace discrete tokens with expected embeddings under the generator's output distribution (soft embeddings), integrated into Di[M]O distillation framework to create Soft-Di[M]O.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art one-step results: improved class-to-image performance, 1.56 FID on ImageNet-256 with GAN refinement, higher GenEval and HPS scores on text-to-image with reward fine-tuning, and gains from TTEO.

Conclusion: Soft embeddings enable end-to-end trainable one-step generators compatible with various refinement techniques, achieving superior performance across multiple masked diffusion model teachers.

Abstract: One-step generators distilled from Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) compress
multiple sampling steps into a single forward pass, enabling efficient text and
image synthesis. However, they suffer two key limitations: they inherit
modeling bias from the teacher, and their discrete token outputs block gradient
flow, preventing post-distillation refinements such as adversarial training,
reward-based fine-tuning, and Test-Time Embedding Optimization (TTEO). In this
work, we introduce soft embeddings, a simple relaxation that replaces discrete
tokens with the expected embeddings under the generator's output distribution.
Soft embeddings preserve representation fidelity for one-step discrete
generator while providing a fully differentiable continuous surrogate that is
compatible with teacher backbones and tokenizer decoders. Integrating soft
embeddings into the Di[M]O distillation framework (denoted Soft-Di[M]O) makes
one-step generators end-to-end trainable and enables straightforward
application of GAN-based refinement, differentiable reward fine-tuning, and
TTEO. Empirically, across multiple MDM teachers (e.g., MaskBit, MaskGen),
Soft-Di[M]O achieves state-of-the-art one-step results: improved class-to-image
performance, a one-step FID of 1.56 on ImageNet-256 with GAN-based refinement,
along with higher GenEval and HPS scores on text-to-image with reward
fine-tuning, and further gains from TTEO.

*Chenghan Yang,Peng Zhou,Dong-Sheng Zhang,Yueyun Wang,Hong-Bin Shen,Xiaoyong Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FishAI 2.0 is an intelligent marine fish recognition framework that combines multimodal few-shot deep learning with image generation for data augmentation, achieving high accuracy in marine fish identification even with limited training data for rare species.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional marine biological image recognition faces challenges of incomplete datasets and unsatisfactory model accuracy, particularly for few-shot conditions of rare species where data scarcity significantly hampers performance.

Method: Uses hierarchical marine fish benchmark dataset, employs DeepSeek LLM to generate textual descriptions, inputs them into Stable Diffusion 2 for image augmentation via hierarchical diffusion strategy, and uses CLIP-based model for robust few-shot image recognition.

Result: Achieves Top-1 accuracy of 91.67% and Top-5 accuracy of 97.97% at family level, outperforming baseline CLIP and ViT models. At genus and species levels, achieves 87.58% and 85.42% Top-1 accuracy respectively, demonstrating practical utility for minority classes with fewer than 10 training samples.

Conclusion: FishAI 2.0 improves efficiency and accuracy of marine fish identification, provides scalable technical solution for marine ecological monitoring and conservation, and demonstrates both scientific value and practical applicability.

Abstract: Traditional marine biological image recognition faces challenges of
incomplete datasets and unsatisfactory model accuracy, particularly for
few-shot conditions of rare species where data scarcity significantly hampers
the performance. To address these issues, this study proposes an intelligent
marine fish recognition framework, FishAI 2.0, integrating multimodal few-shot
deep learning techniques with image generation for data augmentation. First, a
hierarchical marine fish benchmark dataset, which provides a comprehensive data
foundation for subsequent model training, is utilized to train the FishAI 2.0
model. To address the data scarcity of rare classes, the large language model
DeepSeek was employed to generate high-quality textual descriptions, which are
input into Stable Diffusion 2 for image augmentation through a hierarchical
diffusion strategy that extracts latent encoding to construct a multimodal
feature space. The enhanced visual-textual datasets were then fed into a
Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) based model, enabling robust
few-shot image recognition. Experimental results demonstrate that FishAI 2.0
achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 91.67 percent and Top-5 accuracy of 97.97 percent
at the family level, outperforming baseline CLIP and ViT models with a
substantial margin for the minority classes with fewer than 10 training
samples. To better apply FishAI 2.0 to real-world scenarios, at the genus and
species level, FishAI 2.0 respectively achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 87.58
percent and 85.42 percent, demonstrating practical utility. In summary, FishAI
2.0 improves the efficiency and accuracy of marine fish identification and
provides a scalable technical solution for marine ecological monitoring and
conservation, highlighting its scientific value and practical applicability.

*Ahta-Shamul Hoque Emran,Hafija Akter,Abdullah Al Shiam,Abu Saleh Musa Miah,Anichur Rahman,Fahmid Al Farid,Hezerul Abdul Karim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an automatic deep-learning framework for brain tumor detection from MRI scans using ResNet50 feature extraction and a novel Dense-Dropout sequence, with a new balanced dataset (MMCBT).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Timely detection of brain tumors is critical for patient outcomes, and there's a lack of reliable brain tumor MRI resources for research.

Method: Uses pre-trained ResNet50 for feature extraction, Global Average Pooling, linear projection, and a novel Dense-Dropout sequence to enhance feature learning and reduce overfitting.

Result: Created the MMCBT dataset with 209 subjects (3671 tumor and 13273 non-tumor images), clinically verified and balanced through augmentation.

Conclusion: The framework provides an efficient automatic detection system with improved robustness and addresses dataset limitations in brain tumor research.

Abstract: Brain tumors are abnormal cell growths in the central nervous system (CNS),
and their timely detection is critical for improving patient outcomes. This
paper proposes an automatic and efficient deep-learning framework for brain
tumor detection from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The framework
employs a pre-trained ResNet50 model for feature extraction, followed by Global
Average Pooling (GAP) and linear projection to obtain compact, high-level image
representations. These features are then processed by a novel Dense-Dropout
sequence, a core contribution of this work, which enhances non-linear feature
learning, reduces overfitting, and improves robustness through diverse feature
transformations. Another major contribution is the creation of the Mymensingh
Medical College Brain Tumor (MMCBT) dataset, designed to address the lack of
reliable brain tumor MRI resources. The dataset comprises MRI scans from 209
subjects (ages 9 to 65), including 3671 tumor and 13273 non-tumor images, all
clinically verified under expert supervision. To overcome class imbalance, the
tumor class was augmented, resulting in a balanced dataset well-suited for deep
learning research.

TL;DR: Hemorica is a publicly available dataset of 372 head CT scans with comprehensive annotations for five ICH subtypes, enabling robust AI development for intracranial hemorrhage diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fragmented public data problem hindering AI development for timely intracranial hemorrhage diagnosis on CT scans.

Method: Created Hemorica dataset with 372 head CT exams (2012-2024) annotated for five ICH subtypes using double-reading workflow with neurosurgeon adjudication. Established baselines using fine-tuned convolutional and transformer models for classification and segmentation tasks.

Result: Lightweight models achieved 87.8% F1 score for binary classification and 85.5% Dice score for lesion segmentation, validating annotation quality and sufficient sample size.

Conclusion: Hemorica provides a unified benchmark supporting multi-task learning, transfer learning, and AI assistant development for ICH detection and quantification.

Abstract: Timely diagnosis of Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) on Computed Tomography (CT)
scans remains a clinical priority, yet the development of robust Artificial
Intelligence (AI) solutions is still hindered by fragmented public data. To
close this gap, we introduce Hemorica, a publicly available collection of 372
head CT examinations acquired between 2012 and 2024. Each scan has been
exhaustively annotated for five ICH subtypes-epidural (EPH), subdural (SDH),
subarachnoid (SAH), intraparenchymal (IPH), and intraventricular (IVH)-yielding
patient-wise and slice-wise classification labels, subtype-specific bounding
boxes, two-dimensional pixel masks and three-dimensional voxel masks. A
double-reading workflow, preceded by a pilot consensus phase and supported by
neurosurgeon adjudication, maintained low inter-rater variability.
Comprehensive statistical analysis confirms the clinical realism of the
dataset. To establish reference baselines, standard convolutional and
transformer architectures were fine-tuned for binary slice classification and
hemorrhage segmentation. With only minimal fine-tuning, lightweight models such
as MobileViT-XS achieved an F1 score of 87.8% in binary classification, whereas
a U-Net with a DenseNet161 encoder reached a Dice score of 85.5% for binary
lesion segmentation that validate both the quality of the annotations and the
sufficiency of the sample size. Hemorica therefore offers a unified,
fine-grained benchmark that supports multi-task and curriculum learning,
facilitates transfer to larger but weakly labelled cohorts, and facilitates the
process of designing an AI-based assistant for ICH detection and quantification
systems.

*Wenbin Teng,Gonglin Chen,Haiwei Chen,Yajie Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ARSS is an autoregressive framework for novel view generation from single images using GPT-style models, outperforming diffusion models in consistency and causal generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models have limitations for world modeling tasks like novel view generation due to non-causal generation causing inconsistencies across views, while autoregressive models offer causal generation that better adapts to new queries.

Method: Uses GPT-style decoder-only AR model with video tokenizer for discrete token mapping, camera encoder for 3D positional guidance, and autoregressive transformer with spatial permutation while maintaining temporal order.

Result: Extensive experiments show ARSS performs comparably or better than state-of-the-art diffusion-based view synthesis approaches on public datasets.

Conclusion: ARSS demonstrates that autoregressive models can effectively handle novel view generation tasks while maintaining causal consistency, offering a promising alternative to diffusion models for world modeling applications.

Abstract: Despite their exceptional generative quality, diffusion models have limited
applicability to world modeling tasks, such as novel view generation from
sparse inputs. This limitation arises because diffusion models generate outputs
in a non-causal manner, often leading to distortions or inconsistencies across
views, and making it difficult to incrementally adapt accumulated knowledge to
new queries. In contrast, autoregressive (AR) models operate in a causal
fashion, generating each token based on all previously generated tokens. In
this work, we introduce \textbf{ARSS}, a novel framework that leverages a
GPT-style decoder-only AR model to generate novel views from a single image,
conditioned on a predefined camera trajectory. We employ a video tokenizer to
map continuous image sequences into discrete tokens and propose a camera
encoder that converts camera trajectories into 3D positional guidance. Then to
enhance generation quality while preserving the autoregressive structure, we
propose a autoregressive transformer module that randomly permutes the spatial
order of tokens while maintaining their temporal order. Extensive qualitative
and quantitative experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our method
performs comparably to, or better than, state-of-the-art view synthesis
approaches based on diffusion models. Our code will be released upon paper
acceptance.

TL;DR: Proposes a method to reduce static bias in action recognition by separating temporal dynamic information from static scene information using statistical independence loss and scene prediction loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Action recognition models excessively rely on static cues rather than dynamic human motion (static bias), leading to poor performance in real-world applications and zero-shot action recognition.

Method: Separates temporal dynamic information from static scene information using a statistical independence loss between biased and unbiased streams, combined with a scene prediction loss.

Result: The method effectively reduces static bias and experiments confirm the importance of scene prediction loss.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully mitigates static bias in action recognition models through temporal-spatial separation and statistical independence constraints.

Abstract: Action recognition models rely excessively on static cues rather than dynamic
human motion, which is known as static bias. This bias leads to poor
performance in real-world applications and zero-shot action recognition. In
this paper, we propose a method to reduce static bias by separating temporal
dynamic information from static scene information. Our approach uses a
statistical independence loss between biased and unbiased streams, combined
with a scene prediction loss. Our experiments demonstrate that this method
effectively reduces static bias and confirm the importance of scene prediction
loss.

### [35] [Desensitizing for Improving Corruption Robustness in Point Cloud Classification through Adversarial Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23010)
*Zhiqiang Tian,Weigang Li,Chunhua Deng,Junwei Hu,Yongqiang Wang,Wenping Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Desensitized Adversarial Training (DesenAT) to address DNNs' over-reliance on point cloud features, which makes them vulnerable to corrupted data. The method uses feature desensitization and self-distillation to improve robustness without sacrificing clean data performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point cloud corruption is inevitable due to scene complexity, sensor inaccuracies, and processing imprecision. DNNs' over-reliance on input features makes them vulnerable, and it's unclear if this issue exists in 3D tasks and whether reducing feature dependence can enhance robustness to corrupted point clouds.

Method: Proposed Desensitized Adversarial Training (DesenAT): 1) Quantified feature sensitivity using Shapley values, 2) Generated adversarial samples by eliminating high-contribution data points and using spatial transformation to simulate corruption, 3) Used self-distillation to transfer knowledge from clean samples to adversarial samples within a distillation framework.

Result: Extensive experiments on ModelNet-C and PointCloud-C show that DesenAT effectively improves model robustness to corrupted point clouds without reducing performance on clean datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed DesenAT method successfully addresses DNNs' over-reliance on point cloud features by smoothing sensitivity through adversarial training and self-distillation, significantly improving robustness to corrupted data while maintaining clean data performance.

Abstract: Due to scene complexity, sensor inaccuracies, and processing imprecision,
point cloud corruption is inevitable. Over-reliance on input features is the
root cause of DNN vulnerabilities. It remains unclear whether this issue exists
in 3D tasks involving point clouds and whether reducing dependence on these
features can enhance the model's robustness to corrupted point clouds. This
study attempts to answer these questions. Specifically, we quantified the
sensitivity of the DNN to point cloud features using Shapley values and found
that models trained using traditional methods exhibited high sensitivity values
for certain features. Furthermore, under an equal pruning ratio, prioritizing
the pruning of highly sensitive features causes more severe damage to model
performance than random pruning. We propose `Desensitized Adversarial Training'
(DesenAT), generating adversarial samples using feature desensitization and
conducting training within a self-distillation framework, which aims to
alleviate DNN's over-reliance on point clouds features by smoothing
sensitivity. First, data points with high contribution components are
eliminated, and spatial transformation is used to simulate corruption scenes,
generate adversarial samples, and conduct adversarial training on the model.
Next, to compensate for information loss in adversarial samples, we use the
self-distillation method to transfer knowledge from clean samples to
adversarial samples, and perform adversarial training in a distillation
manner.Extensive experiments on ModelNet-C and PointCloud-C demonstrate show
that the propose method can effectively improve the robustness of the model
without reducing the performance of clean data sets. This code is publicly

*Zetian Wu,Tianshuo Zhou,Stefan Lee,Liang Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel text-to-sign language translation method that incorporates anatomical constraints and joint relationships to generate more natural and biomechanically plausible body poses and movements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of generating accurate and natural body poses in sign language translation, as prior methods often produce rigid or biomechanically implausible outputs by neglecting anatomical constraints and skeletal coordination patterns.

Method: Proposes explicit modeling of skeletal joint relationships with geometric constraints on joint positions, bone lengths, and movement dynamics. Uses parent-relative reweighting for finger flexibility, bone-pose losses, and bone-length constraints to enforce anatomical consistency.

Result: Reduces performance gap between previous best and ground-truth oracle by 56.51%, decreases bone length discrepancies by 18.76%, and reduces movement variance by 5.48%, demonstrating significant improvements in anatomical realism and motion naturalness.

Conclusion: The proposed method significantly enhances the quality of sign language translation by incorporating anatomical constraints, resulting in more natural and biomechanically plausible motion generation.

Abstract: Sign language translation from text to video plays a crucial role in enabling
effective communication for Deaf and hard--of--hearing individuals. A major
challenge lies in generating accurate and natural body poses and movements that
faithfully convey intended meanings. Prior methods often neglect the anatomical
constraints and coordination patterns of human skeletal motion, resulting in
rigid or biomechanically implausible outputs. To address this, we propose a
novel approach that explicitly models the relationships among skeletal
joints--including shoulders, arms, and hands--by incorporating geometric
constraints on joint positions, bone lengths, and movement dynamics. During
training, we introduce a parent-relative reweighting mechanism to enhance
finger flexibility and reduce motion stiffness. Additionally, bone-pose losses
and bone-length constraints enforce anatomically consistent structures. Our
method narrows the performance gap between the previous best and the
ground-truth oracle by 56.51%, and further reduces discrepancies in bone length
and movement variance by 18.76% and 5.48%, respectively, demonstrating
significant gains in anatomical realism and motion naturalness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Uni-Plan is a planning framework using unified multimodal models (UMMs) that enables visual reasoning for decision-making, with self-discriminated filtering to prevent hallucinations in dynamics predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM/VLM-based decision-making approaches rely solely on language reasoning, limiting their reasoning capabilities. UMMs that support multimodal inputs/outputs have greater potential for decision-making through visual reasoning.

Method: Built on UMMs where a single model serves as policy, dynamics model, and value function. Uses self-discriminated filtering where the generative model acts as self-discriminator to filter invalid dynamics predictions.

Result: Experiments on long-horizon planning tasks show Uni-Plan substantially improves success rates compared to VLM-based methods, with strong data scalability requiring no expert demonstrations and achieving better performance with same training data size.

Conclusion: This work lays foundation for future research in reasoning and decision-making with UMMs, demonstrating the potential of multimodal reasoning for improved planning capabilities.

Abstract: With the powerful reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs), many recent works have explored using them for
decision-making. However, most of these approaches rely solely on
language-based reasoning, which limits their ability to reason and make
informed decisions. Recently, a promising new direction has emerged with
unified multimodal models (UMMs), which support both multimodal inputs and
outputs. We believe such models have greater potential for decision-making by
enabling reasoning through generated visual content. To this end, we propose
Uni-Plan, a planning framework built on UMMs. Within this framework, a single
model simultaneously serves as the policy, dynamics model, and value function.
In addition, to avoid hallucinations in dynamics predictions, we present a
novel approach self-discriminated filtering, where the generative model serves
as a self-discriminator to filter out invalid dynamics predictions. Experiments
on long-horizon planning tasks show that Uni-Plan substantially improves
success rates compared to VLM-based methods, while also showing strong data
scalability, requiring no expert demonstrations and achieving better
performance under the same training-data size. This work lays a foundation for
future research in reasoning and decision-making with UMMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes D-Plus-Minus (DPM), a novel framework for detecting copyright infringement in text-to-image diffusion models by formalizing the problem through Differential Privacy concepts and using conditional sensitivity metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address legal and ethical concerns about large vision models memorizing and reproducing copyrighted content, and overcome limitations of existing detection approaches that lack robustness and theoretical foundations.

Method: Introduces conditional sensitivity metric based on Differential Privacy, proposes DPM framework that simulates inclusion/exclusion by fine-tuning models in learning/unlearning directions, and computes confidence scores over orthogonal prompt distributions using statistical metrics.

Result: DPM reliably detects infringement content without requiring access to original training dataset or text prompts, and the authors also construct CIDD dataset for standardized benchmarking.

Conclusion: DPM offers an interpretable and practical solution for safeguarding intellectual property in generative AI, providing a robust theoretical framework for copyright infringement detection.

Abstract: The widespread deployment of large vision models such as Stable Diffusion
raises significant legal and ethical concerns, as these models can memorize and
reproduce copyrighted content without authorization. Existing detection
approaches often lack robustness and fail to provide rigorous theoretical
underpinnings. To address these gaps, we formalize the concept of copyright
infringement and its detection from the perspective of Differential Privacy
(DP), and introduce the conditional sensitivity metric, a concept analogous to
sensitivity in DP, that quantifies the deviation in a diffusion model's output
caused by the inclusion or exclusion of a specific training data point. To
operationalize this metric, we propose D-Plus-Minus (DPM), a novel post-hoc
detection framework that identifies copyright infringement in text-to-image
diffusion models. Specifically, DPM simulates inclusion and exclusion processes
by fine-tuning models in two opposing directions: learning or unlearning.
Besides, to disentangle concept-specific influence from the global parameter
shifts induced by fine-tuning, DPM computes confidence scores over orthogonal
prompt distributions using statistical metrics. Moreover, to facilitate
standardized benchmarking, we also construct the Copyright Infringement
Detection Dataset (CIDD), a comprehensive resource for evaluating detection
across diverse categories. Our results demonstrate that DPM reliably detects
infringement content without requiring access to the original training dataset
or text prompts, offering an interpretable and practical solution for
safeguarding intellectual property in the era of generative AI.

*Gabriel A. Viana,Luis F. Alves Pereira,Tsang Ing Ren,George D. C. Cavalcanti,Jan Sijbers*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a principled framework to optimize perceptual loss design for LDCT denoising, showing that better loss configurations significantly improve noise reduction and structural fidelity without changing network architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Perceptual losses are effective for LDCT enhancement but their design involves underexplored critical decisions like feature representation level, pretraining dataset, and loss weighting, which impact training performance.

Method: Proposed perceptual influence metric to quantify perceptual loss contribution, and developed a systematic framework to assess impact of loss design choices through systematic experimentation.

Result: Widely used perceptual loss configurations underperform compared to better-designed alternatives. Better designs lead to significant improvements in noise reduction and structural fidelity of reconstructed CT images.

Conclusion: Provides objective guidelines for effective use of perceptual losses in LDCT denoising, supported by statistical analysis, enabling better performance without architectural changes.

Abstract: Perceptual losses have emerged as powerful tools for training networks to
enhance Low-Dose Computed Tomography (LDCT) images, offering an alternative to
traditional pixel-wise losses such as Mean Squared Error, which often lead to
over-smoothed reconstructions and loss of clinically relevant details in LDCT
images. The perceptual losses operate in a latent feature space defined by a
pretrained encoder and aim to preserve semantic content by comparing high-level
features rather than raw pixel values. However, the design of perceptual losses
involves critical yet underexplored decisions, including the feature
representation level, the dataset used to pretrain the encoder, and the
relative importance assigned to the perceptual component during optimization.
In this work, we introduce the concept of perceptual influence (a metric that
quantifies the relative contribution of the perceptual loss term to the total
loss) and propose a principled framework to assess the impact of the loss
design choices on the model training performance. Through systematic
experimentation, we show that the widely used configurations in the literature
to set up a perceptual loss underperform compared to better-designed
alternatives. Our findings show that better perceptual loss designs lead to
significant improvements in noise reduction and structural fidelity of
reconstructed CT images, without requiring any changes to the network
architecture. We also provide objective guidelines, supported by statistical
analysis, to inform the effective use of perceptual losses in LDCT denoising.

*Tomohiro Tanaka,Narumasa Tsutsumida*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight sensor-flexible flood detection method using fine-tuned Presto transformer that works with SAR-only, MS-only, or combined SAR+MS data, achieving superior performance with only 0.4M parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address operational challenges in flood mapping: single-sensor approaches face weather-dependent data availability and limited revisit periods, while multi-sensor fusion requires substantial computational resources and large labeled datasets.

Method: Fine-tuned Presto, a lightweight multi-modal pre-trained transformer (0.4M parameters) that processes both SAR and multispectral data at pixel level, enabling flood mapping with flexible sensor inputs through single model architecture.

Result: Achieved F1 score of 0.896 and mIoU of 0.886 in optimal sensor-fusion scenario, outperforming Prithvi-100M baseline. Maintained robust performance in MS-only (F1: 0.893) and functional capabilities in SAR-only (F1: 0.718) scenarios.

Conclusion: Parameter-efficient, sensor-flexible approach provides accessible and robust solution for real-world disaster scenarios requiring immediate flood extent assessment regardless of sensor availability constraints.

Abstract: Floods are increasingly frequent natural disasters causing extensive human
and economic damage, highlighting the critical need for rapid and accurate
flood inundation mapping. While remote sensing technologies have advanced flood
monitoring capabilities, operational challenges persist: single-sensor
approaches face weather-dependent data availability and limited revisit
periods, while multi-sensor fusion methods require substantial computational
resources and large-scale labeled datasets. To address these limitations, this
study introduces a novel sensor-flexible flood detection methodology by
fine-tuning Presto, a lightweight ($\sim$0.4M parameters) multi-modal
pre-trained transformer that processes both Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and
multispectral (MS) data at the pixel level. Our approach uniquely enables flood
mapping using SAR-only, MS-only, or combined SAR+MS inputs through a single
model architecture, addressing the critical operational need for rapid response
with whatever sensor data becomes available first during disasters. We
evaluated our method on the Sen1Floods11 dataset against the large-scale
Prithvi-100M baseline ($\sim$100M parameters) across three realistic data
availability scenarios. The proposed model achieved superior performance with
an F1 score of 0.896 and mIoU of 0.886 in the optimal sensor-fusion scenario,
outperforming the established baseline. Crucially, the model demonstrated
robustness by maintaining effective performance in MS-only scenarios (F1:
0.893) and functional capabilities in challenging SAR-only conditions (F1:
0.718), confirming the advantage of multi-modal pre-training for operational
flood mapping. Our parameter-efficient, sensor-flexible approach offers an
accessible and robust solution for real-world disaster scenarios requiring
immediate flood extent assessment regardless of sensor availability
constraints.

*Jingxing Li,Yongjae Lee,Deliang Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeLoc3r enhances pose regression methods through Geometric Consistency Regularization (GCR), achieving both fast inference speed and high accuracy by teaching geometric consistency during training rather than enforcing it at inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior ReLoc3R achieves fast inference but has subtle geometric inconsistencies that prevent reaching the precision ceiling of correspondence-based methods like MASt3R. The goal is to overcome the speed-accuracy dilemma in relative camera pose estimation.

Method: GeLoc3r uses Geometric Consistency Regularization (GCR) during training: leverages ground-truth depth to generate dense 3D-2D correspondences, weights them using a FusionTransformer, computes geometrically-consistent poses via weighted RANSAC, and creates a consistency loss to transfer geometric knowledge into the regression network.

Result: Significant improvements over ReLoc3R: 40.45% vs. 34.85% AUC@5° on CO3Dv2 (16% relative improvement), 68.66% vs. 66.70% AUC@5° on RealEstate10K, and 50.45% vs. 49.60% on MegaDepth1500.

Conclusion: GeLoc3r represents a paradigm shift by teaching geometric consistency during training rather than enforcing it at inference, achieving both the speed of regression methods and the geometric understanding of correspondence methods.

Abstract: Prior ReLoc3R achieves breakthrough performance with fast 25ms inference and
state-of-the-art regression accuracy, yet our analysis reveals subtle geometric
inconsistencies in its internal representations that prevent reaching the
precision ceiling of correspondence-based methods like MASt3R (which require
300ms per pair). In this work, we present GeLoc3r, a novel approach to relative
camera pose estimation that enhances pose regression methods through Geometric
Consistency Regularization (GCR). GeLoc3r overcomes the speed-accuracy dilemma
by training regression networks to produce geometrically consistent poses
without inference-time geometric computation. During training, GeLoc3r
leverages ground-truth depth to generate dense 3D-2D correspondences, weights
them using a FusionTransformer that learns correspondence importance, and
computes geometrically-consistent poses via weighted RANSAC. This creates a
consistency loss that transfers geometric knowledge into the regression
network. Unlike FAR method which requires both regression and geometric solving
at inference, GeLoc3r only uses the enhanced regression head at test time,
maintaining ReLoc3R's fast speed and approaching MASt3R's high accuracy. On
challenging benchmarks, GeLoc3r consistently outperforms ReLoc3R, achieving
significant improvements including 40.45% vs. 34.85% AUC@5{\deg} on the CO3Dv2
dataset (16% relative improvement), 68.66% vs. 66.70% AUC@5{\deg} on
RealEstate10K, and 50.45% vs. 49.60% on MegaDepth1500. By teaching geometric
consistency during training rather than enforcing it at inference, GeLoc3r
represents a paradigm shift in how neural networks learn camera geometry,
achieving both the speed of regression and the geometric understanding of
correspondence methods.

*Ye-eun Kim,Suhyeon Lim,Andrew J. Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a multimodal deep learning system for recognizing upper limb Activities of Daily Living (ADL) in stroke patients using IMU sensors and RGB-D camera, addressing the gap in existing HAR research that primarily focuses on non-disabled individuals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the shortage of rehabilitation therapy for stroke patients by developing remote monitoring systems that reduce medical staff burden, specifically focusing on stroke patients' action recognition which is not well-covered by existing HAR research.

Method: Designed a monitoring system using IMU sensors and RGB-D camera, collected a dataset directly from stroke patients, investigated appropriate preprocessing, and proposed a deep learning model suitable for processing multimodal data.

Result: Found that stroke patients' action data is less clustering than non-disabled individuals, and the proposed model learns similar tendencies for each label in data with features that are difficult to cluster.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential for expanding deep learning models that learn stroke patients' action features beyond simple recognition to include assessment feedback for domiciliary rehabilitation.

Abstract: Rehabilitation therapy for stroke patients faces a supply shortage despite
the increasing demand. To address this issue, remote monitoring systems that
reduce the burden on medical staff are emerging as a viable alternative. A key
component of these remote monitoring systems is Human Action Recognition (HAR)
technology, which classifies actions. However, existing HAR studies have
primarily focused on non-disable individuals, making them unsuitable for
recognizing the actions of stroke patients. HAR research for stroke has largely
concentrated on classifying relatively simple actions using machine learning
rather than deep learning. In this study, we designed a system to monitor the
actions of stroke patients, focusing on domiciliary upper limb Activities of
Daily Living (ADL). Our system utilizes IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensors
and an RGB-D camera, which are the most common modalities in HAR. We directly
collected a dataset through this system, investigated an appropriate preprocess
and proposed a deep learning model suitable for processing multimodal data. We
analyzed the collected dataset and found that the action data of stroke
patients is less clustering than that of non-disabled individuals.
Simultaneously, we found that the proposed model learns similar tendencies for
each label in data with features that are difficult to clustering. This study
suggests the possibility of expanding the deep learning model, which has
learned the action features of stroke patients, to not only simple action
recognition but also feedback such as assessment contributing to domiciliary
rehabilitation in future research. The code presented in this study is
available at https://github.com/ye-Kim/MMeViT.

### [43] [Activation Matching for Explanation Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23051)
*Pirzada Suhail,Aditya Anand,Amit Sethi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An activation-matching approach to generate minimal, faithful explanations for classifier decisions by training an autoencoder to produce binary masks that preserve both model predictions and intermediate activations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide minimal and faithful explanations for classifier decisions on images, ensuring the explanations preserve both the model's prediction and internal activations while being human-interpretable.

Method: Train a lightweight autoencoder to output binary masks that combine multi-layer activation matching (KL divergence and cross-entropy), mask priors (L1 area, binarization penalty, total variation), and abductive constraints for faithfulness.

Result: The method produces small, human-interpretable masks that retain classifier behavior while discarding irrelevant input regions, providing practical and faithful minimalist explanations.

Conclusion: The proposed activation-matching approach successfully generates minimal, faithful explanations that preserve model decision-making while being interpretable and compact.

Abstract: In this paper we introduce an activation-matching--based approach to generate
minimal, faithful explanations for the decision-making of a pretrained
classifier on any given image. Given an input image \(x\) and a frozen model
\(f\), we train a lightweight autoencoder to output a binary mask \(m\) such
that the explanation \(e = m \odot x\) preserves both the model's prediction
and the intermediate activations of \(x\). Our objective combines: (i)
multi-layer activation matching with KL divergence to align distributions and
cross-entropy to retain the top-1 label for both the image and the explanation;
(ii) mask priors -- L1 area for minimality, a binarization penalty for crisp
0/1 masks, and total variation for compactness; and (iii) abductive constraints
for faithfulness and necessity. Together, these objectives yield small,
human-interpretable masks that retain classifier behavior while discarding
irrelevant input regions, providing practical and faithful minimalist
explanations for the decision making of the underlying model.

*Ruilang Wang,Shuotong Xu,Bowen Liu,Runlin Huang,Donglong Chen,Weifeng Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mask What Matters is a text-guided masking framework for self-supervised medical image analysis that uses vision-language models to selectively mask diagnostically relevant regions, improving efficiency and semantic alignment compared to random high-ratio masking approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of data scarcity in medical imaging by improving self-supervised masked image modeling, which suffers from inefficiency and poor semantic alignment due to random masking, and limited adaptability of region-aware variants.

Method: Leverages vision-language models for prompt-based region localization to apply differentiated masking that emphasizes diagnostically relevant regions while reducing redundancy in background areas, enabling controllable text-guided masking.

Result: Outperforms existing MIM methods across multiple medical imaging modalities (brain MRI, chest CT, lung X-ray) with gains of up to +3.1 percentage points in classification accuracy, +1.3 in BoxAP, and +1.1 in MaskAP for detection, while using substantially lower masking ratios (40% vs 70%).

Conclusion: Controllable, text-driven masking enables semantically aligned self-supervised learning and advances robust vision models for medical image analysis by improving representation learning and cross-task generalizability.

Abstract: The scarcity of annotated data in specialized domains such as medical imaging
presents significant challenges to training robust vision models. While
self-supervised masked image modeling (MIM) offers a promising solution,
existing approaches largely rely on random high-ratio masking, leading to
inefficiency and poor semantic alignment. Moreover, region-aware variants
typically depend on reconstruction heuristics or supervised signals, limiting
their adaptability across tasks and modalities. We propose Mask What Matters, a
controllable text-guided masking framework for self-supervised medical image
analysis. By leveraging vision-language models for prompt-based region
localization, our method flexibly applies differentiated masking to emphasize
diagnostically relevant regions while reducing redundancy in background areas.
This controllable design enables better semantic alignment, improved
representation learning, and stronger cross-task generalizability.
Comprehensive evaluation across multiple medical imaging modalities, including
brain MRI, chest CT, and lung X-ray, shows that Mask What Matters consistently
outperforms existing MIM methods (e.g., SparK), achieving gains of up to +3.1
percentage points in classification accuracy, +1.3 in box average precision
(BoxAP), and +1.1 in mask average precision (MaskAP) for detection. Notably, it
achieves these improvements with substantially lower overall masking ratios
(e.g., 40\% vs. 70\%). This work demonstrates that controllable, text-driven
masking can enable semantically aligned self-supervised learning, advancing the
development of robust vision models for medical image analysis.

*Ben Liang,Yuan Liu,Bingwen Qiu,Yihong Wang,Xiubao Sui,Qian Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FMC-DETR is a novel aerial-view object detection framework that uses frequency-decoupled fusion to address tiny object detection challenges in high-resolution imagery, achieving state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aerial-view object detection faces challenges in detecting tiny objects due to limited visual cues and difficulty modeling global context. Existing methods suffer from delayed contextual fusion and inadequate non-linear modeling, creating performance bottlenecks.

Method: Proposes FMC-DETR with three key components: 1) WeKat backbone using cascaded wavelet transforms for global low-frequency context and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks for non-linear modeling; 2) Cross-stage Partial Fusion module for efficient multi-scale feature interaction; 3) Multi-Domain Feature Coordination module unifying spatial, frequency, and structural priors.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets. On VisDrone dataset, improves by 6.5% AP and 8.2% AP50 over baseline with fewer parameters.

Conclusion: FMC-DETR effectively addresses tiny object detection challenges in aerial imagery through frequency-decoupled fusion, demonstrating superior performance in balancing detail preservation and global enhancement.

Abstract: Aerial-view object detection is a critical technology for real-world
applications such as natural resource monitoring, traffic management, and
UAV-based search and rescue. Detecting tiny objects in high-resolution aerial
imagery presents a long-standing challenge due to their limited visual cues and
the difficulty of modeling global context in complex scenes. Existing methods
are often hampered by delayed contextual fusion and inadequate non-linear
modeling, failing to effectively use global information to refine shallow
features and thus encountering a performance bottleneck. To address these
challenges, we propose FMC-DETR, a novel framework with frequency-decoupled
fusion for aerial-view object detection. First, we introduce the Wavelet
Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (WeKat) backbone, which applies cascaded wavelet
transforms to enhance global low-frequency context perception in shallow
features while preserving fine-grained details, and employs Kolmogorov-Arnold
networks to achieve adaptive non-linear modeling of multi-scale dependencies.
Next, a lightweight Cross-stage Partial Fusion (CPF) module reduces redundancy
and improves multi-scale feature interaction. Finally, we introduce the
Multi-Domain Feature Coordination (MDFC) module, which unifies spatial,
frequency, and structural priors to to balance detail preservation and global
enhancement. Extensive experiments on benchmark aerial-view datasets
demonstrate that FMC-DETR achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer
parameters. On the challenging VisDrone dataset, our model achieves
improvements of 6.5% AP and 8.2% AP50 over the baseline, highlighting its
effectiveness in tiny object detection. The code can be accessed at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper revisits fundamental problems in image inpainting preference alignment using direct preference optimization and public reward models, finding that ensemble methods mitigate biases and significantly outperform prior models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate fundamental problems in achieving preference alignment for image inpainting rather than introducing novel methods, focusing on understanding and improving alignment training.

Method: Leverages direct preference optimization for alignment training, uses public reward models to construct preference datasets, and employs ensemble methods across nine reward models, two benchmarks, and two baseline models.

Result: Most reward models provide valid scores for preference data construction, preference data shows robust scaling trends, reward models have observable biases causing reward hacking, and ensemble methods yield robust results by mitigating biases.

Conclusion: The alignment models significantly outperform prior models across standard metrics, GPT-4 assessments, and human evaluations without structural changes or new datasets, establishing a simple yet solid baseline for image inpainting preference alignment.

Abstract: This paper investigates image inpainting with preference alignment. Instead
of introducing a novel method, we go back to basics and revisit fundamental
problems in achieving such alignment. We leverage the prominent direct
preference optimization approach for alignment training and employ public
reward models to construct preference training datasets. Experiments are
conducted across nine reward models, two benchmarks, and two baseline models
with varying structures and generative algorithms. Our key findings are as
follows: (1) Most reward models deliver valid reward scores for constructing
preference data, even if some of them are not reliable evaluators. (2)
Preference data demonstrates robust trends in both candidate scaling and sample
scaling across models and benchmarks. (3) Observable biases in reward models,
particularly in brightness, composition, and color scheme, render them
susceptible to cause reward hacking. (4) A simple ensemble of these models
yields robust and generalizable results by mitigating such biases. Built upon
these observations, our alignment models significantly outperform prior models
across standard metrics, GPT-4 assessments, and human evaluations, without any
changes to model structures or the use of new datasets. We hope our work can
set a simple yet solid baseline, pushing this promising frontier. Our code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XMAG is a lightweight foundation model for computational pathology that uses cross-magnification distillation to transfer knowledge from 20x to 5x magnification, achieving near-state-of-the-art performance with 30x faster processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models in computational pathology are computationally prohibitive for clinical deployment due to massive parameter counts and high-magnification processing requirements, limiting real-time integration in resource-constrained environments.

Method: Cross-magnification distillation framework that transfers knowledge from state-of-the-art 20x magnification teacher to efficient 5x magnification student architecture, using dual-level knowledge transfer (global image representations and local spatial token mapping) and trained on 3.49 million images from public datasets.

Result: XMAG achieved diagnostic accuracy within 1% of substantially larger foundation models while delivering 30-fold processing acceleration (8.8 WSIs per minute), requiring 11.3 times fewer patches per whole slide image compared to existing approaches, with robust generalization across multiple cancer types.

Conclusion: Cross-magnification distillation is a viable approach for deploying foundation model capabilities in resource-constrained clinical environments, potentially enabling real-time pathology AI integration with near-state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Foundation models (FM) have transformed computational pathology but remain
computationally prohibitive for clinical deployment due to their massive
parameter counts and high-magnification processing requirements. Here, we
introduce XMAG, a lightweight FM developed through corss-magnification
distillation that transfers knowledge from state-of-the-art 20x magnification
teacher to an efficient 5x magnification student architecture. XMAG employs a
compact backbone and operates entirely at 5x, requiring 11.3 times fewer
patches per whole slide image (WSI) compared to existing approaches. Our Novel
distillation framework incorporates dual-level knowledge transfer, aligning
both global image representations and local spatial token mapping. We trained
XMAG on 3.49 million images curated from publicly available datasets and
evaluated performance across six clinically relevant histopathology analysis
tasks spanning multiple cancer types. XMAG achieved diagnostic accuracy within
1% of substantially larger foundation models while delivering 30-fold
processing acceleration, reaching 8.8 WSIs per minute processing speed. Our
cross-institutional validation confirmed robust generalization. Further, we
developed an end-to-end training strategy to further boost our model's
performance to approach the larger FMs' performance. These results establish
cross-magnification distillation as a viable approach for deploying FM
capabilities in resource-constrained clinical environments, potentially
enabling real-time pathology AI integration.

*Na Min An,Inha Kang,Minhyun Lee,Hyunjung Shim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoPatch is a zero-shot referring image segmentation framework that enhances spatial representations in VLMs by constructing hybrid text features with spatial context tokens and extracting patch-level image features from intermediate layers, achieving significant improvements without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs like CLIP struggle with spatial relationships - they focus on primary noun phrases in text and generate similar features for different spatial layouts in images, limiting spatial grounding capability for RIS tasks.

Method: CoPatch enhances spatial representations by: 1) Constructing hybrid text features incorporating context tokens with spatial cues, 2) Extracting patch-level image features from intermediate layers where spatial structure is better preserved, 3) Fusing enhanced features into clustered image-text similarity map (CoMap) for mask selection.

Result: Significant improvements in zero-shot RIS across RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, and PhraseCut datasets (+2-7 mIoU) without requiring any additional training.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the importance of recovering and leveraging untapped spatial knowledge inherently embedded in VLMs, paving the way for opportunities in zero-shot referring image segmentation.

Abstract: Spatial grounding is crucial for referring image segmentation (RIS), where
the goal of the task is to localize an object described by language. Current
foundational vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, excel at aligning
images and text but struggle with understanding spatial relationships. Within
the language stream, most existing methods often focus on the primary noun
phrase when extracting local text features, undermining contextual tokens.
Within the vision stream, CLIP generates similar features for images with
different spatial layouts, resulting in limited sensitivity to spatial
structure. To address these limitations, we propose \textsc{CoPatch}, a
zero-shot RIS framework that leverages internal model components to enhance
spatial representations in both text and image modalities. For language,
\textsc{CoPatch} constructs hybrid text features by incorporating context
tokens carrying spatial cues. For vision, it extracts patch-level image
features using our novel path discovered from intermediate layers, where
spatial structure is better preserved. These enhanced features are fused into a
clustered image-text similarity map, \texttt{CoMap}, enabling precise mask
selection. As a result, \textsc{CoPatch} significantly improves spatial
grounding in zero-shot RIS across RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, and PhraseCut (+
2--7 mIoU) without requiring any additional training. Our findings underscore
the importance of recovering and leveraging the untapped spatial knowledge
inherently embedded in VLMs, thereby paving the way for opportunities in
zero-shot RIS.

TL;DR: HTMA-Net combines Hadamard Transform with multiplication-avoiding in-memory computing to reduce multiplication costs in neural networks while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reducing multiplication costs is critical for efficient deep neural network deployment in energy-constrained edge devices.

Method: Selectively replaces intermediate convolutions with Hybrid Hadamard-based transform layers whose internal convolutions are implemented via multiplication-avoiding in-memory operations using SRAM-based in-memory computing.

Result: Eliminates up to 52% of multiplications compared to baseline ResNet models while achieving comparable accuracy on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet datasets, with significant reduction in computational complexity and parameters.

Conclusion: Combining structured Hadamard transform layers with SRAM-based in-memory computing multiplication-avoiding operators is a promising path towards efficient deep learning architectures.

Abstract: Reducing the cost of multiplications is critical for efficient deep neural
network deployment, especially in energy-constrained edge devices. In this
work, we introduce HTMA-Net, a novel framework that integrates the Hadamard
Transform (HT) with multiplication-avoiding (MA) SRAM-based in-memory computing
to reduce arithmetic complexity while maintaining accuracy. Unlike prior
methods that only target multiplications in convolutional layers or focus
solely on in-memory acceleration, HTMA-Net selectively replaces intermediate
convolutions with Hybrid Hadamard-based transform layers whose internal
convolutions are implemented via multiplication-avoiding in-memory operations.
We evaluate HTMA-Net on ResNet-18 using CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet,
and provide a detailed comparison against regular, MF-only, and HT-only
variants. Results show that HTMA-Net eliminates up to 52\% of multiplications
compared to baseline ResNet-18, ResNet-20, and ResNet-50 models, while
achieving comparable accuracy in evaluation and significantly reducing
computational complexity and the number of parameters. Our results demonstrate
that combining structured Hadamard transform layers with SRAM-based in-memory
computing multiplication-avoiding operators is a promising path towards
efficient deep learning architectures.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ChangeIMTI, a large-scale multi-task dataset for remote sensing change understanding, and proposes ChangeVG, a vision-guided vision-language model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on change captioning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing remote sensing change understanding datasets lack deep understanding and interactions across diverse tasks like change captioning, counting, and localization.

Method: Constructed ChangeIMTI dataset with four complementary tasks, and designed ChangeVG model with vision-guided dual-branch architecture combining fine-grained spatial features with high-level semantics to guide large VLMs during instruction tuning.

Result: Outperforms strongest baseline Semantic-CC by 1.39 points on S*m metric for change captioning, demonstrating superiority across four tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses gaps in remote sensing change understanding through comprehensive dataset construction and hierarchical cross-modal learning architecture.

Abstract: Remote sensing change understanding (RSCU) is essential for analyzing remote
sensing images and understanding how human activities affect the environment.
However, existing datasets lack deep understanding and interactions in the
diverse change captioning, counting, and localization tasks. To tackle these
gaps, we construct ChangeIMTI, a new large-scale interactive multi-task
instruction dataset that encompasses four complementary tasks including change
captioning, binary change classification, change counting, and change
localization. Building upon this new dataset, we further design a novel
vision-guided vision-language model (ChangeVG) with dual-granularity awareness
for bi-temporal remote sensing images (i.e., two remote sensing images of the
same area at different times). The introduced vision-guided module is a
dual-branch architecture that synergistically combines fine-grained spatial
feature extraction with high-level semantic summarization. These enriched
representations further serve as the auxiliary prompts to guide large
vision-language models (VLMs) (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-7B) during instruction tuning,
thereby facilitating the hierarchical cross-modal learning. We extensively
conduct experiments across four tasks to demonstrate the superiority of our
approach. Remarkably, on the change captioning task, our method outperforms the
strongest method Semantic-CC by 1.39 points on the comprehensive S*m metric,
which integrates the semantic similarity and descriptive accuracy to provide an
overall evaluation of change caption. Moreover, we also perform a series of
ablation studies to examine the critical components of our method.

TL;DR: A unified multistage generative framework using Conditional Dependent Coupling that decomposes generation into interpolant trajectories, enabling accurate distribution learning and end-to-end optimization through a single Diffusion Transformer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in existing image generation models: VAE-based models suffer from information loss and lack end-to-end training, pixel-space models have prohibitive computational costs, and cascade models have stage-wise separation issues preventing effective optimization.

Method: Proposed Conditional Dependent Coupling strategy that decomposes generative process into interpolant trajectories at multiple stages, implemented as a single unified Diffusion Transformer for end-to-end optimization and knowledge sharing.

Result: Achieves both high fidelity and efficiency across multiple resolutions, outperforming existing approaches in the trade-off between computation and fidelity.

Conclusion: The unified multistage framework successfully addresses the computation-fidelity trade-off in image generation by enabling accurate distribution learning and end-to-end optimization through a single model architecture.

Abstract: Existing image generation models face critical challenges regarding the
trade-off between computation and fidelity. Specifically, models relying on a
pretrained Variational Autoencoder (VAE) suffer from information loss, limited
detail, and the inability to support end-to-end training. In contrast, models
operating directly in the pixel space incur prohibitive computational cost.
Although cascade models can mitigate computational cost, stage-wise separation
prevents effective end-to-end optimization, hampers knowledge sharing, and
often results in inaccurate distribution learning within each stage. To address
these challenges, we introduce a unified multistage generative framework based
on our proposed Conditional Dependent Coupling strategy. It decomposes the
generative process into interpolant trajectories at multiple stages, ensuring
accurate distribution learning while enabling end-to-end optimization.
Importantly, the entire process is modeled as a single unified Diffusion
Transformer, eliminating the need for disjoint modules and also enabling
knowledge sharing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
both high fidelity and efficiency across multiple resolutions.

Conclusion: Earth-Agent establishes a new paradigm for EO analysis, advancing the field toward scientifically grounded, next-generation LLM applications in Earth observation.

Abstract: Earth observation (EO) is essential for understanding the evolving states of
the Earth system. Although recent MLLMs have advanced EO research, they still
lack the capability to tackle complex tasks that require multi-step reasoning
and the use of domain-specific tools. Agent-based methods offer a promising
direction, but current attempts remain in their infancy, confined to RGB
perception, shallow reasoning, and lacking systematic evaluation protocols. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce Earth-Agent, the first agentic
framework that unifies RGB and spectral EO data within an MCP-based tool
ecosystem, enabling cross-modal, multi-step, and quantitative spatiotemporal
reasoning beyond pretrained MLLMs. Earth-Agent supports complex scientific
tasks such as geophysical parameter retrieval and quantitative spatiotemporal
analysis by dynamically invoking expert tools and models across modalities. To
support comprehensive evaluation, we further propose Earth-Bench, a benchmark
of 248 expert-curated tasks with 13,729 images, spanning spectrum, products and
RGB modalities, and equipped with a dual-level evaluation protocol that
assesses both reasoning trajectories and final outcomes. We conduct
comprehensive experiments varying different LLM backbones, comparisons with
general agent frameworks, and comparisons with MLLMs on remote sensing
benchmarks, demonstrating both the effectiveness and potential of Earth-Agent.
Earth-Agent establishes a new paradigm for EO analysis, moving the field toward
scientifically grounded, next-generation applications of LLMs in Earth
observation. Our code and dataset will be publicly released.

*Wenxuan Fang,Jiangwei Weng,Jianjun Qian,Jian Yang,Jun Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WeatherCycle is a unified unpaired framework for multi-weather image restoration that uses bidirectional degradation-content translation with degradation-aware curriculum regularization, achieving state-of-the-art performance in unsupervised approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on task-specific physical priors which limit scalability and generalization to diverse real-world weather scenarios, creating a need for a more unified approach to multi-weather image restoration.

Method: Uses lumina-chroma decomposition to decouple degradation from content, a Lumina Degradation Guidance Module (LDGM) for learning luminance degradation priors via frequency-domain amplitude modulation, and Difficulty-Aware Contrastive Regularization (DACR) for semantic consistency.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple weather datasets with strong generalization to complex weather degradations in unsupervised settings.

Conclusion: WeatherCycle provides an effective unified framework for multi-weather image restoration that overcomes limitations of task-specific approaches and demonstrates robust performance across diverse weather conditions.

Abstract: Unsupervised image restoration under multi-weather conditions remains a
fundamental yet underexplored challenge. While existing methods often rely on
task-specific physical priors, their narrow focus limits scalability and
generalization to diverse real-world weather scenarios. In this work, we
propose \textbf{WeatherCycle}, a unified unpaired framework that reformulates
weather restoration as a bidirectional degradation-content translation cycle,
guided by degradation-aware curriculum regularization. At its core,
WeatherCycle employs a \textit{lumina-chroma decomposition} strategy to
decouple degradation from content without modeling complex weather, enabling
domain conversion between degraded and clean images. To model diverse and
complex degradations, we propose a \textit{Lumina Degradation Guidance Module}
(LDGM), which learns luminance degradation priors from a degraded image pool
and injects them into clean images via frequency-domain amplitude modulation,
enabling controllable and realistic degradation modeling. Additionally, we
incorporate a \textit{Difficulty-Aware Contrastive Regularization (DACR)}
module that identifies hard samples via a CLIP-based classifier and enforces
contrastive alignment between hard samples and restored features to enhance
semantic consistency and robustness. Extensive experiments across serve
multi-weather datasets, demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance among unsupervised approaches, with strong generalization to
complex weather degradations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sparse2Dense is a keypoint-driven generative framework that uses extremely sparse 3D keypoints for ultra-low bitrate human video compression and accurate vertex prediction, achieving competitive compression performance while enabling precise geometry applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of simultaneously achieving ultra-low bitrate human video compression and accurate vertex prediction for bandwidth-constrained multimedia applications, which requires harmonizing dynamic motion modeling, detailed appearance synthesis, and geometric consistency.

Method: A multi-task learning-based and keypoint-aware deep generative model that encodes complex human motion via compact 3D keypoints, uses these sparse keypoints to estimate dense motion for video synthesis with temporal coherence and realistic textures, and integrates a vertex predictor for joint optimization with video generation.

Result: Extensive experiments show competitive compression performance over traditional/generative video codecs for human video, while enabling precise human vertex prediction for downstream geometry applications.

Conclusion: Sparse2Dense facilitates bandwidth-efficient human-centric media transmission for applications like real-time motion analysis, virtual human animation, and immersive entertainment.

Abstract: For bandwidth-constrained multimedia applications, simultaneously achieving
ultra-low bitrate human video compression and accurate vertex prediction
remains a critical challenge, as it demands the harmonization of dynamic motion
modeling, detailed appearance synthesis, and geometric consistency. To address
this challenge, we propose Sparse2Dense, a keypoint-driven generative framework
that leverages extremely sparse 3D keypoints as compact transmitted symbols to
enable ultra-low bitrate human video compression and precise human vertex
prediction. The key innovation is the multi-task learning-based and
keypoint-aware deep generative model, which could encode complex human motion
via compact 3D keypoints and leverage these sparse keypoints to estimate dense
motion for video synthesis with temporal coherence and realistic textures.
Additionally, a vertex predictor is integrated to learn human vertex geometry
through joint optimization with video generation, ensuring alignment between
visual content and geometric structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
the proposed Sparse2Dense framework achieves competitive compression
performance for human video over traditional/generative video codecs, whilst
enabling precise human vertex prediction for downstream geometry applications.
As such, Sparse2Dense is expected to facilitate bandwidth-efficient
human-centric media transmission, such as real-time motion analysis, virtual
human animation, and immersive entertainment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An end-to-end video-based pipeline for vehicle axle counting using YOLO-OBB for vehicle detection/categorization and YOLO for tire detection, with a novel TRAX algorithm to handle occlusions and improve accuracy for long vehicles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate vehicle axle counting is essential for traffic control, toll collection, and infrastructure development, but previous methods have limitations in dense environments with occlusions and long vehicles.

Method: Combines YOLO-OBB for vehicle detection/categorization and YOLO for tire detection, with intelligent tire-vehicle association and a novel TRAX (Tire and Axle Tracking) Algorithm to handle occlusions and track axle features between frames.

Result: Significantly reduces false positives and improves axle-counting accuracy for long vehicles, demonstrating strong robustness in real-world traffic videos.

Conclusion: Represents a significant step toward scalable, AI-driven axle counting systems that can replace legacy roadside infrastructure.

Abstract: Accurate counting of vehicle axles is essential for traffic control, toll
collection, and infrastructure development. We present an end-to-end,
video-based pipeline for axle counting that tackles limitations of previous
works in dense environments. Our system leverages a combination of YOLO-OBB to
detect and categorize vehicles, and YOLO to detect tires. Detected tires are
intelligently associated to their respective parent vehicles, enabling accurate
axle prediction even in complex scenarios. However, there are a few challenges
in detection when it comes to scenarios with longer and occluded vehicles. We
mitigate vehicular occlusions and partial detections for longer vehicles by
proposing a novel TRAX (Tire and Axle Tracking) Algorithm to successfully track
axle-related features between frames. Our method stands out by significantly
reducing false positives and improving the accuracy of axle-counting for long
vehicles, demonstrating strong robustness in real-world traffic videos. This
work represents a significant step toward scalable, AI-driven axle counting
systems, paving the way for machine vision to replace legacy roadside

### [58] [Confidence-Calibrating Regularization for Robust Brain MRI Segmentation Under Domain Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23176)
*Behraj Khan,Tahir Qasim Syed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CalSAM is a lightweight adaptation framework that improves SAM's performance on medical volumes by reducing domain shift sensitivity and penalizing overconfident errors, achieving better accuracy and calibration while keeping SAM's encoders frozen.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM performs well on natural images but suffers from domain shift and overconfidence when applied to medical volumes like brain MRI, requiring domain adaptation.

Method: Uses Feature Fisher Information Penalty (FIP) to reduce encoder sensitivity to domain shift on 3D feature maps, and Confidence Misalignment Penalty (CMP) to penalize overconfident voxel-wise errors. Only fine-tunes the mask decoder while keeping SAM's encoders frozen.

Result: Substantial improvements on cross-center and scanner-shift evaluations: +7.4% DSC improvement, -26.9% HD95 reduction, -39.5% ECE reduction on BraTS scanner split; +5.3% DSC improvement, -32.6% ECE reduction on ATLAS-C motion corruptions.

Conclusion: CalSAM delivers improved domain generalization and better-calibrated uncertainty estimates for brain MRI segmentation while maintaining computational efficiency by freezing SAM's encoder.

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) exhibits strong zero-shot performance on
natural images but suffers from domain shift and overconfidence when applied to
medical volumes. We propose \textbf{CalSAM}, a lightweight adaptation framework
that (i) reduces encoder sensitivity to domain shift via a \emph{Feature Fisher
Information Penalty} (FIP) computed on 3D feature maps and (ii) penalizes
overconfident voxel-wise errors through a \emph{Confidence Misalignment
Penalty} (CMP). The combined loss, \(\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{CalSAM}}\) fine-tunes
only the mask decoder while keeping SAM's encoders frozen. On cross-center and
scanner-shift evaluations, CalSAM substantially improves accuracy and
calibration: e.g., on the BraTS scanner split (Siemens$\to$GE) CalSAM shows a
$+7.4\%$ relative improvement in $\mathrm{DSC}$ (80.1\% vs.\ 74.6\%), a
$-26.9\%$ reduction in $\mathrm{HD95}$ (4.6 mm vs.\ 6.3 mm), and a $-39.5\%$
reduction in $\mathrm{ECE}$ (5.2\% vs.\ 8.6\%). On ATLAS-C (motion
corruptions), CalSAM achieves a $+5.3\%$ relative improvement in $\mathrm{DSC}$
(75.9\%) and a $-32.6\%$ reduction in $\mathrm{ECE}$ (5.8\%). Ablations show
FIP and CMP contribute complementary gains ($p<0.01$), and the Fisher penalty
incurs a modest $\sim$15\% training-time overhead. CalSAM therefore delivers
improved domain generalization and better-calibrated uncertainty estimates for
brain MRI segmentation, while retaining the computational benefits of freezing
SAM's encoder.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unsupervised 3D instance segmentation methods like UNIT have limitations including limited training diversity, rigid temporal sampling, and heavy dependence on noisy pseudo-labels, which hinder consistent object identity tracking across LiDAR scans.

Method: Proposes synthetic point cloud sequence generation for diverse training data, flexible temporal sampling using both adjacent and non-adjacent frames to capture long-range dependencies, and dynamic-weighting loss that emphasizes confident samples for robust representations.

Result: Outperforms UNIT and other unsupervised baselines on SemanticKITTI, nuScenes, and PandaSet datasets, achieving higher segmentation accuracy and more robust temporal associations.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses limitations of existing methods through synthetic data generation, flexible temporal modeling, and adaptive loss weighting, demonstrating superior performance in unsupervised online 3D instance segmentation.

Abstract: Unsupervised online 3D instance segmentation is a fundamental yet challenging
task, as it requires maintaining consistent object identities across LiDAR
scans without relying on annotated training data. Existing methods, such as
UNIT, have made progress in this direction but remain constrained by limited
training diversity, rigid temporal sampling, and heavy dependence on noisy
pseudo-labels. We propose a new framework that enriches the training
distribution through synthetic point cloud sequence generation, enabling
greater diversity without relying on manual labels or simulation engines. To
better capture temporal dynamics, our method incorporates a flexible sampling
strategy that leverages both adjacent and non-adjacent frames, allowing the
model to learn from long-range dependencies as well as short-term variations.
In addition, a dynamic-weighting loss emphasizes confident and informative
samples, guiding the network toward more robust representations. Through
extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI, nuScenes, and PandaSet, our method
consistently outperforms UNIT and other unsupervised baselines, achieving
higher segmentation accuracy and more robust temporal associations. The code
will be publicly available at github.com/Eaphan/SFT3D.

TL;DR: GaP (Gaussian Patch) is a black-box adversarial attack method that creates a universal, physically transferable forehead patch using a query-efficient greedy algorithm with Gaussian blobs, achieving high attack success rates against face recognition systems with only ~10,000 queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adversarial attacks on face recognition systems pose significant security threats, but most existing attacks are limited to digital domains or require white-box access. There is a need for practical attacks that work in strict black-box settings and can transfer physically.

Method: Uses a query-efficient, zero-order greedy algorithm to iteratively construct a symmetric, grayscale forehead patch by successively adding Gaussian blobs. The optimization is guided only by cosine similarity scores from a surrogate FR model to degrade identity recognition.

Result: With approximately 10,000 queries to a black-box ArcFace model, GaP achieves high attack success rates in both digital and real-world physical tests. The attack shows strong transferability, successfully deceiving an entirely unseen FaceNet model.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates a practical and severe vulnerability in face recognition systems, proving that robust, transferable attacks can be crafted with limited knowledge of the target system, highlighting security risks in real-world deployments.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on face recognition (FR) systems pose a significant
security threat, yet most are confined to the digital domain or require
white-box access. We introduce GaP (Gaussian Patch), a novel method to generate
a universal, physically transferable adversarial patch under a strict black-box
setting. Our approach uses a query-efficient, zero-order greedy algorithm to
iteratively construct a symmetric, grayscale pattern for the forehead. The
patch is optimized by successively adding Gaussian blobs, guided only by the
cosine similarity scores from a surrogate FR model to maximally degrade
identity recognition. We demonstrate that with approximately 10,000 queries to
a black-box ArcFace model, the resulting GaP achieves a high attack success
rate in both digital and real-world physical tests. Critically, the attack
shows strong transferability, successfully deceiving an entirely unseen FaceNet

Method: Proposes UltraUNet with domain-specific innovations: lightweight Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks, Group Normalization for small-batch stability, summation-based skip connections, and ultrasound-specific augmentations like denoising and blur simulation.

Result: Achieves 250 frames per second with single-dataset Dice = 0.855 and MSD = 0.993px, and cross-dataset Dice averaging 0.734 and 0.761 across 8 datasets.

Conclusion: UltraUNet provides a fast, accurate solution for speech research, clinical diagnostics, and analysis of speech motor disorders through efficient real-time tongue contour segmentation.

Abstract: Ultrasound tongue imaging (UTI) is a non-invasive and cost-effective tool for

### [62] [Patch Rebirth: Toward Fast and Transferable Model Inversion of Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23235)
*Seongsoo Heo,Dong-Wan Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRI is a novel model inversion method for Vision Transformers that progressively detaches important patches while letting others continue evolving, achieving 10x speedup over dense inversion and 2x over sparse inversion while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard model inversion for Vision Transformers is computationally expensive due to self-attention mechanisms. Existing sparse methods discard patches prematurely, which suppresses both class-agnostic and class-specific features needed for knowledge transfer.

Method: Patch Rebirth Inversion (PRI) incrementally detaches the most important patches during inversion to create sparse synthetic images, while allowing remaining patches to continue evolving for future selection. This enables less informative patches to gradually accumulate class-relevant knowledge.

Result: PRI achieves up to 10x faster inversion than Dense Model Inversion and 2x faster than Sparse Model Inversion, while consistently outperforming SMI in accuracy and matching DMI performance.

Conclusion: PRI effectively balances efficiency and knowledge extraction by enabling the "Re-Birth effect" where initially less informative patches gradually accumulate transferable knowledge, making it superior to existing sparse inversion methods.

Abstract: Model inversion is a widely adopted technique in data-free learning that
reconstructs synthetic inputs from a pretrained model through iterative
optimization, without access to original training data. Unfortunately, its
application to state-of-the-art Vision Transformers (ViTs) poses a major
computational challenge, due to their expensive self-attention mechanisms. To
address this, Sparse Model Inversion (SMI) was proposed to improve efficiency
by pruning and discarding seemingly unimportant patches, which were even
claimed to be obstacles to knowledge transfer. However, our empirical findings
suggest the opposite: even randomly selected patches can eventually acquire
transferable knowledge through continued inversion. This reveals that
discarding any prematurely inverted patches is inefficient, as it suppresses
the extraction of class-agnostic features essential for knowledge transfer,
along with class-specific features. In this paper, we propose Patch Rebirth
Inversion (PRI), a novel approach that incrementally detaches the most
important patches during the inversion process to construct sparse synthetic
images, while allowing the remaining patches to continue evolving for future
selection. This progressive strategy not only improves efficiency, but also
encourages initially less informative patches to gradually accumulate more
class-relevant knowledge, a phenomenon we refer to as the Re-Birth effect,
thereby effectively balancing class-agnostic and class-specific knowledge.
Experimental results show that PRI achieves up to 10x faster inversion than
standard Dense Model Inversion (DMI) and 2x faster than SMI, while consistently
outperforming SMI in accuracy and matching the performance of DMI.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-consistency framework that uses short binary answers to evaluate and rank long model responses, automatically generating preference pairs to reduce hallucinations without human annotations or external supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models often hallucinate details, compromising reliability. Existing methods require extensive human annotations or external supervision from more powerful models, which limits scalability.

Method: Leverages model's self-consistency between long responses and short binary answers. Uses short reliable binary responses to query and rank generated responses, creating a self-reflection pipeline that automatically curates training data from inconsistency signals.

Result: Significant improvements in factual grounding and reliability on multiple benchmarks (AMBER, MultiObject-Hal, Object HalBench, MMHal-Bench). Maintains robust instruction-following ability with enhanced performance on LLaVA-Bench and MMBench.

Conclusion: The self-consistency approach offers a scalable and efficient solution that effectively reduces hallucinations using unlabeled data, eliminating the need for human annotations or external model supervision.

Abstract: Vision-language models often hallucinate details, generating non-existent
objects or inaccurate attributes that compromise output reliability. Existing
methods typically address these issues via extensive human annotations or
external supervision from more powerful models. In this work, we present a
novel framework that leverages the model's self-consistency between long
responses and short answers to generate preference pairs for training. We
observe that short binary questions tend to yield highly reliable responses,
which can be used to query the target model to evaluate and rank its generated
responses. Specifically, we design a self-reflection pipeline where detailed
model responses are compared against concise binary answers, and inconsistency
signals are utilized to automatically curate high-quality training data without
human annotations or external model-based supervision. By relying solely on
self-consistency rather than external supervision, our method offers a scalable
and efficient solution that effectively reduces hallucinations using unlabeled
data. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, i.e., AMBER,
MultiObject-Hal (ROPE), Object HalBench, and MMHal-Bench, demonstrate
significant improvements in factual grounding and reliability. Moreover, our
approach maintains robust instruction-following ability, as evidenced by
enhanced performance on LLaVA-Bench and MMBench.

TL;DR: TATTOO is a training-free aesthetic-aware outfit recommendation approach that uses MLLMs to generate item descriptions and aesthetic profiles, achieving state-of-the-art performance without task-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional fashion outfit-completion methods require expensive task-specific training on large labeled data and lack explicit human aesthetic guidance, which MLLMs can address through a training-free paradigm.

Method: Uses MLLMs to generate target-item descriptions and aesthetic chain-of-thought to distill images into structured aesthetic profiles (color, style, occasion, season, material, balance), then fuses visual summaries with textual descriptions using dynamic entropy-gated mechanism for ranking.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Aesthetic-100 dataset and demonstrates advanced zero-shot retrieval capability on Polyvore dataset compared to training-based methods.

Conclusion: TATTOO successfully streamlines outfit recommendation to a training-free paradigm with better recommendation scores and enhanced aesthetic awareness using MLLMs.

Abstract: The global fashion e-commerce market relies significantly on intelligent and
aesthetic-aware outfit-completion tools to promote sales. While previous
studies have approached the problem of fashion outfit-completion and
compatible-item retrieval, most of them require expensive, task-specific
training on large-scale labeled data, and no effort is made to guide outfit
recommendation with explicit human aesthetics. In the era of Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs), we show that the conventional training-based pipeline
could be streamlined to a training-free paradigm, with better recommendation
scores and enhanced aesthetic awareness. We achieve this with TATTOO, a
Training-free AesTheTic-aware Outfit recommendation approach. It first
generates a target-item description using MLLMs, followed by an aesthetic
chain-of-thought used to distill the images into a structured aesthetic profile
including color, style, occasion, season, material, and balance. By fusing the
visual summary of the outfit with the textual description and aesthetics
vectors using a dynamic entropy-gated mechanism, candidate items can be
represented in a shared embedding space and be ranked accordingly. Experiments
on a real-world evaluation set Aesthetic-100 show that TATTOO achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared with existing training-based methods.
Another standard Polyvore dataset is also used to measure the advanced
zero-shot retrieval capability of our training-free method.

TL;DR: Proposes CoAdaIN for RGB-to-thermal image translation in ADAS, enabling one-to-many mappings with component-aware style adaptation for more realistic thermal images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Thermal imaging improves ADAS safety in low-light/weather but faces dataset limitations; existing RGB-to-thermal methods only support one-to-one mappings.

Method: Multi-modal translation framework with Component-aware Adaptive Instance Normalization (CoAdaIN) that adapts styles to different image components individually.

Result: Produces more realistic and diverse thermal image translations compared to global style adaptation methods.

Conclusion: CoAdaIN enables effective one-to-many RGB-to-thermal mapping, addressing dataset scarcity for thermal imaging in ADAS applications.

Abstract: Thermal imaging in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) improves road
safety with superior perception in low-light and harsh weather conditions
compared to traditional RGB cameras. However, research in this area faces
challenges due to limited dataset availability and poor representation in
driving simulators. RGB-to-thermal image translation offers a potential
solution, but existing methods focus on one-to-one mappings. We propose a
one-to-many mapping using a multi-modal translation framework enhanced with our
Component-aware Adaptive Instance Normalization (CoAdaIN). Unlike the original
AdaIN, which applies styles globally, CoAdaIN adapts styles to different image
components individually. The result, as we show, is more realistic and diverse
thermal image translations. This is the accepted author manuscript of the paper

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a privacy-preserving alternative to cameras for human activity recognition that is robust to illumination changes, using LiDAR point clouds instead of visual data.

Method: Convert LiDAR frames to epsilon-graphs, compute Laplacian spectrum, use eigenvalues and eigenvector statistics as pose descriptors, apply temporal statistics over sliding windows, and classify with SVM and random forests.

Result: Achieved 94.4% accuracy on 13-class rehabilitation activities and 90.3% on all 27 activities in MM-Fi dataset with 40 subjects under strict subject-independent protocol, outperforming skeleton-based baselines.

Conclusion: The method provides a compact, interpretable feature set directly from point cloud geometry that offers an accurate and efficient alternative to end-to-end deep learning for human activity recognition.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition supports applications in healthcare,
manufacturing, and human-machine interaction. LiDAR point clouds offer a
privacy-preserving alternative to cameras and are robust to illumination. We
propose a HAR method based on graph spectral analysis. Each LiDAR frame is
mapped to a proximity graph (epsilon-graph) and the Laplacian spectrum is
computed. Eigenvalues and statistics of eigenvectors form pose descriptors, and
temporal statistics over sliding windows yield fixed vectors for classification
with support vector machines and random forests. On the MM-Fi dataset with 40
subjects and 27 activities, under a strict subject-independent protocol, the
method reaches 94.4% accuracy on a 13-class rehabilitation set and 90.3% on all
27 activities. It also surpasses the skeleton-based baselines reported for
MM-Fi. The contribution is a compact and interpretable feature set derived
directly from point cloud geometry that provides an accurate and efficient
alternative to end-to-end deep learning.

*Atakan Topaloglu,Kunyi Li,Michael Niemeyer,Nassir Navab,A. Murat Tekalp,Federico Tombari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OracleGS is a framework that combines generative completeness with regressive fidelity for sparse-view novel view synthesis using a "propose-and-validate" approach with 3D-aware diffusion and multi-view stereo models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the trade-off between geometrically faithful but incomplete regressive models and structurally inconsistent but complete generative models in sparse-view novel view synthesis.

Method: Uses a pre-trained 3D-aware diffusion model to propose complete scenes, then employs a multi-view stereo model as an oracle to validate 3D uncertainties, guiding Gaussian Splatting optimization with uncertainty-weighted loss.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on Mip-NeRF 360 and NeRF Synthetic datasets by filtering hallucinatory artifacts while preserving plausible completions.

Conclusion: OracleGS successfully reconciles generative completeness with regressive fidelity by conditioning generative priors on multi-view geometric evidence.

Abstract: Sparse-view novel view synthesis is fundamentally ill-posed due to severe
geometric ambiguity. Current methods are caught in a trade-off: regressive
models are geometrically faithful but incomplete, whereas generative models can
complete scenes but often introduce structural inconsistencies. We propose
OracleGS, a novel framework that reconciles generative completeness with
regressive fidelity for sparse view Gaussian Splatting. Instead of using
generative models to patch incomplete reconstructions, our
"propose-and-validate" framework first leverages a pre-trained 3D-aware
diffusion model to synthesize novel views to propose a complete scene. We then
repurpose a multi-view stereo (MVS) model as a 3D-aware oracle to validate the
3D uncertainties of generated views, using its attention maps to reveal regions
where the generated views are well-supported by multi-view evidence versus
where they fall into regions of high uncertainty due to occlusion, lack of
texture, or direct inconsistency. This uncertainty signal directly guides the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate monsoon rainfall prediction is crucial for India's agriculture and water management, but challenging due to sparse ground observations and complex regional variability.

Method: Uses attention-guided U-Net architecture with focal and dice loss functions on a new 1 km resolution dataset integrating seven geospatial modalities (temperature, vegetation, soil moisture, humidity, wind, elevation, land use).

Result: The multimodal framework consistently outperforms unimodal baselines and existing deep learning methods, especially for extreme rainfall categories.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable framework, benchmark dataset, and state-of-the-art results for regional monsoon forecasting and climate resilience applications in India.

Abstract: Accurate monsoon rainfall prediction is vital for India's agriculture, water
management, and climate risk planning, yet remains challenging due to sparse
ground observations and complex regional variability. We present a multimodal
deep learning framework for high-resolution precipitation classification that
leverages satellite and Earth observation data. Unlike previous rainfall
prediction models based on coarse 5-50 km grids, we curate a new 1 km
resolution dataset for five Indian states, integrating seven key geospatial
modalities: land surface temperature, vegetation (NDVI), soil moisture,
relative humidity, wind speed, elevation, and land use, covering the
June-September 2024 monsoon season. Our approach uses an attention-guided U-Net
architecture to capture spatial patterns and temporal dependencies across
modalities, combined with focal and dice loss functions to handle rainfall
class imbalance defined by the India Meteorological Department (IMD).
Experiments demonstrate that our multimodal framework consistently outperforms
unimodal baselines and existing deep learning methods, especially in extreme
rainfall categories. This work contributes a scalable framework, benchmark
dataset, and state-of-the-art results for regional monsoon forecasting, climate
resilience, and geospatial AI applications in India.

*Yihao Ding,Soyeon Caren Han,Yanbei Jiang,Yan Li,Zechuan Li,Yifan Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SynDoc is a framework combining discriminative and generative models for domain-specific document understanding, using synthetic data generation and adaptive instruction tuning to overcome limitations of existing LLMs/MLLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Large (Multimodal) Language Models face limitations like hallucinations, inadequate domain adaptation, and reliance on extensive fine-tuning datasets for domain-specific Visually Rich Document Understanding in sensitive fields like medicine, finance, and material science.

Method: SynDoc employs a synthetic data generation workflow with structural information extraction and domain-specific query generation, uses adaptive instruction tuning to improve discriminative models, and implements recursive inferencing to iteratively refine outputs from both models.

Result: The framework demonstrates scalable, efficient, and precise document understanding, bridging the gap between domain-specific adaptation and general world knowledge for document key information extraction tasks.

Conclusion: SynDoc provides a novel solution that combines discriminative and generative models with synthetic data generation and recursive inferencing to achieve stable and accurate predictions for domain-specific document understanding challenges.

Abstract: Domain-specific Visually Rich Document Understanding (VRDU) presents
significant challenges due to the complexity and sensitivity of documents in
fields such as medicine, finance, and material science. Existing Large
(Multimodal) Language Models (LLMs/MLLMs) achieve promising results but face
limitations such as hallucinations, inadequate domain adaptation, and reliance
on extensive fine-tuning datasets. This paper introduces SynDoc, a novel
framework that combines discriminative and generative models to address these
challenges. SynDoc employs a robust synthetic data generation workflow, using
structural information extraction and domain-specific query generation to
produce high-quality annotations. Through adaptive instruction tuning, SynDoc
improves the discriminative model's ability to extract domain-specific
knowledge. At the same time, a recursive inferencing mechanism iteratively
refines the output of both models for stable and accurate predictions. This
framework demonstrates scalable, efficient, and precise document understanding
and bridges the gap between domain-specific adaptation and general world
knowledge for document key information extraction tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vid-Freeze is an adversarial attack that adds perturbations to images to block motion synthesis in I2V models while preserving image semantics, preventing malicious video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address security risks from image-to-video generation models that enable deceptive content creation, by developing proactive defenses that block motion synthesis.

Method: An attention-suppressing adversarial attack that adds carefully crafted perturbations to images, explicitly targeting the attention mechanism of I2V models.

Result: The method completely disrupts motion synthesis while preserving semantic fidelity, generating stand-still or near-static videos from immunized images.

Conclusion: Attention attacks are a promising direction for robust and proactive defenses against misuse of I2V generation models.

Abstract: The rapid progress of image-to-video (I2V) generation models has introduced
significant risks, enabling video synthesis from static images and facilitating
deceptive or malicious content creation. While prior defenses such as I2VGuard
attempt to immunize images, effective and principled protection to block motion
remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce Vid-Freeze - a novel
attention-suppressing adversarial attack that adds carefully crafted
adversarial perturbations to images. Our method explicitly targets the
attention mechanism of I2V models, completely disrupting motion synthesis while
preserving semantic fidelity of the input image. The resulting immunized images
generate stand-still or near-static videos, effectively blocking malicious
content creation. Our experiments demonstrate the impressive protection
provided by the proposed approach, highlighting the importance of attention
attacks as a promising direction for robust and proactive defenses against
misuse of I2V generation models.

### [71] [Seeing Through the Blur: Unlocking Defocus Maps for Deepfake Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23289)
*Minsun Jeon,Simon S. Woo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using defocus blur as a physically interpretable forensic signal for deepfake detection, leveraging the fact that synthetic images often lack realistic depth-of-field characteristics compared to camera-captured images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid advancement of generative AI has enabled mass production of photorealistic synthetic images, threatening the integrity of visual media and making it increasingly difficult to distinguish authentic from fabricated content.

Method: Construct defocus blur maps from images and use them as discriminative features for detection, since defocus blur is a depth-dependent optical phenomenon that naturally occurs in camera-captured images but is often missing or unrealistic in synthetic content.

Result: Experimental results confirm that defocus blur provides a reliable and interpretable cue for identifying synthetic images, with the approach supported by three in-depth feature analyses.

Conclusion: Defocus blur serves as an effective forensic signal for deepfake detection due to its universal origin from optical imaging principles and physical scene structure encoding, making it robust and generalizable.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI has enabled the mass production of
photorealistic synthetic images, blurring the boundary between authentic and
fabricated visual content. This challenge is particularly evident in deepfake
scenarios involving facial manipulation, but also extends to broader
AI-generated content (AIGC) cases involving fully synthesized scenes. As such
content becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish from reality, the
integrity of visual media is under threat. To address this issue, we propose a
physically interpretable deepfake detection framework and demonstrate that
defocus blur can serve as an effective forensic signal. Defocus blur is a
depth-dependent optical phenomenon that naturally occurs in camera-captured
images due to lens focus and scene geometry. In contrast, synthetic images
often lack realistic depth-of-field (DoF) characteristics. To capture these
discrepancies, we construct a defocus blur map and use it as a discriminative
feature for detecting manipulated content. Unlike RGB textures or
frequency-domain signals, defocus blur arises universally from optical imaging
principles and encodes physical scene structure. This makes it a robust and
generalizable forensic cue. Our approach is supported by three in-depth feature
analyses, and experimental results confirm that defocus blur provides a
reliable and interpretable cue for identifying synthetic images. We aim for our
defocus-based detection pipeline and interpretability tools to contribute
meaningfully to ongoing research in media forensics. The implementation is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diff-SPK is the first diffusion-based reconstruction method for spike camera data, using ControlNet with enhanced texture conditioning to handle low-light high-speed scenarios where traditional methods struggle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spike cameras produce unique asynchronous spike streams that require reconstruction for human perception, but existing methods fail in low-light high-speed conditions due to severe noise and sparse information.

Method: Uses ETFI (Enhanced Texture from Inter-spike Interval) to aggregate sparse information, then employs ControlNet with ETFI conditioning and feature fusion modules to generate high-speed scenes.

Result: Establishes the first comprehensive benchmark for low-light spike stream reconstruction and demonstrates superior performance on real low-light spike streams compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Diff-SPK effectively leverages generative priors to overcome limitations in low-light spike stream reconstruction, providing a robust solution for high-speed visual tasks in challenging lighting conditions.

Abstract: Spike camera, a type of neuromorphic sensor with high-temporal resolution,
shows great promise for high-speed visual tasks. Unlike traditional cameras,
spike camera continuously accumulates photons and fires asynchronous spike
streams. Due to unique data modality, spike streams require reconstruction
methods to become perceptible to the human eye.
  However, lots of methods struggle to handle spike streams in low-light
high-speed scenarios due to severe noise and sparse information. In this work,
we propose Diff-SPK, the first diffusion-based reconstruction method for spike
camera. Diff-SPK effectively leverages generative priors to supplement texture
information in low-light conditions. Specifically, it first employs an
\textbf{E}nhanced \textbf{T}exture \textbf{f}rom Inter-spike \textbf{I}nterval
(ETFI) to aggregate sparse information from low-light spike streams. Then, ETFI
serves as a conditioning input for ControlNet to generate the high-speed
scenes. To improve the quality of results, we introduce an ETFI-based feature
fusion module during the generation process.
  Moreover, we establish the first bona fide benchmark for the low-light spike
stream reconstruction task. It significantly surpasses existing reconstruction
datasets in scale and provides quantitative illumination information. The
performance on real low-light spike streams demonstrates the superiority of
Diff-SPK.

TL;DR: Proposes BDGF framework using multimodal diffusion features to guide multi-branch networks for land-cover classification, addressing modality imbalance in DDPMs through adaptive masking and hierarchical feature guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address modality imbalance in pre-training multimodal DDPMs and effectively leverage diffusion features to guide complementary diversity feature extraction for remote sensing data analysis.

Method: Uses adaptive modality masking strategy for balanced DDPM training, hierarchically guides feature extraction across CNN, Mamba, and transformer networks with fusion mechanisms, and employs mutual learning strategy for inter-branch collaboration.

Result: Achieves superior classification performance on four multimodal remote sensing datasets, demonstrating effectiveness of the proposed balanced diffusion-guided fusion approach.

Conclusion: The BDGF framework successfully addresses modality imbalance in multimodal DDPMs and effectively leverages diffusion features to improve land-cover classification performance in remote sensing applications.

Abstract: Deep learning-based techniques for the analysis of multimodal remote sensing
data have become popular due to their ability to effectively integrate
complementary spatial, spectral, and structural information from different
sensors. Recently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have
attracted attention in the remote sensing community due to their powerful
ability to capture robust and complex spatial-spectral distributions. However,
pre-training multimodal DDPMs may result in modality imbalance, and effectively
leveraging diffusion features to guide complementary diversity feature
extraction remains an open question. To address these issues, this paper
proposes a balanced diffusion-guided fusion (BDGF) framework that leverages
multimodal diffusion features to guide a multi-branch network for land-cover
classification. Specifically, we propose an adaptive modality masking strategy
to encourage the DDPMs to obtain a modality-balanced rather than spectral
image-dominated data distribution. Subsequently, these diffusion features
hierarchically guide feature extraction among CNN, Mamba, and transformer
networks by integrating feature fusion, group channel attention, and
cross-attention mechanisms. Finally, a mutual learning strategy is developed to
enhance inter-branch collaboration by aligning the probability entropy and
feature similarity of individual subnetworks. Extensive experiments on four
multimodal remote sensing datasets demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves superior classification performance. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs exhibit superficial cultural understanding through pattern matching rather than genuine reasoning, showing systematic biases in identifying fire-themed cultural imagery across different contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To diagnose whether VLMs have genuine cultural understanding or merely rely on superficial pattern matching, particularly for fire-themed cultural imagery across diverse cultural contexts.

Method: Developed a diagnostic framework testing multiple VLMs on fire-themed cultural imagery through classification and explanation analysis across three categories: Western festivals, non-Western traditions, and emergency scenes.

Result: Models showed systematic biases - correctly identifying prominent Western festivals but struggling with underrepresented cultural events, often providing vague labels or dangerously misclassifying emergencies as celebrations.

Conclusion: VLMs' reliance on symbolic shortcuts poses risks, highlighting the need for cultural evaluation beyond accuracy metrics to ensure interpretable and fair multimodal systems.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often appear culturally competent but rely on
superficial pattern matching rather than genuine cultural understanding. We
introduce a diagnostic framework to probe VLM reasoning on fire-themed cultural
imagery through both classification and explanation analysis. Testing multiple
models on Western festivals, non-Western traditions, and emergency scenes
reveals systematic biases: models correctly identify prominent Western
festivals but struggle with underrepresented cultural events, frequently
offering vague labels or dangerously misclassifying emergencies as
celebrations. These failures expose the risks of symbolic shortcuts and
highlight the need for cultural evaluation beyond accuracy metrics to ensure
interpretable and fair multimodal systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: C3-OWD is a curriculum cross-modal contrastive learning framework that unifies robustness and generalization in object detection by combining RGBT pretraining for robustness and vision-language alignment for open-world diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between robustness (handling adverse conditions) and diversity (generalizing to unseen categories) in object detection, which prior methods handle separately but not simultaneously.

Method: Two-stage curriculum learning: Stage 1 uses RGBT data for robustness, Stage 2 uses vision-language alignment for generalization, with EMA mechanism to prevent catastrophic forgetting between stages.

Result: Achieves 80.1 AP50 on FLIR, 48.6 AP50_Novel on OV-COCO, and 35.7 mAP_r on OV-LVIS, demonstrating competitive performance across both robustness and diversity metrics.

Conclusion: C3-OWD successfully unifies robustness and generalization in object detection through curriculum cross-modal contrastive learning, establishing state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Object detection has advanced significantly in the closed-set setting, but
real-world deployment remains limited by two challenges: poor generalization to
unseen categories and insufficient robustness under adverse conditions. Prior
research has explored these issues separately: visible-infrared detection
improves robustness but lacks generalization, while open-world detection
leverages vision-language alignment strategy for category diversity but
struggles under extreme environments. This trade-off leaves robustness and
diversity difficult to achieve simultaneously. To mitigate these issues, we
propose \textbf{C3-OWD}, a curriculum cross-modal contrastive learning
framework that unifies both strengths. Stage~1 enhances robustness by
pretraining with RGBT data, while Stage~2 improves generalization via
vision-language alignment. To prevent catastrophic forgetting between two
stages, we introduce an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) mechanism that
theoretically guarantees preservation of pre-stage performance with bounded
parameter lag and function consistency. Experiments on FLIR, OV-COCO, and
OV-LVIS demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach: C3-OWD achieves $80.1$
AP$^{50}$ on FLIR, $48.6$ AP$^{50}_{\text{Novel}}$ on OV-COCO, and $35.7$
mAP$_r$ on OV-LVIS, establishing competitive performance across both robustness
and diversity evaluations. Code available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes S2BNet, a binary neural network for remote sensing pansharpening that addresses spectral distortion and spatial feature degradation through customized spatial-spectral binarized convolution (S2B-Conv).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for pansharpening have high computational complexity, limiting their use on resource-limited devices. Binary neural networks offer efficiency but face spectral distortion and spatial feature degradation issues when applied to pansharpening.

Method: Designed S2B-Conv with two components: Spectral-Redistribution Mechanism (SRM) using affine transformation with dynamic parameters, and Gabor Spatial Feature Amplifier (GSFA) that handles multi-scale and directional features through random frequency/angle selection.

Result: Extensive experiments show the high-efficiency binarized pansharpening method achieves promising performance in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Conclusion: S2BNet successfully applies binary neural networks to pansharpening by overcoming spectral distortion and spatial degradation issues, providing an efficient solution for resource-limited devices.

Abstract: Remote sensing pansharpening aims to reconstruct spatial-spectral properties
during the fusion of panchromatic (PAN) images and low-resolution
multi-spectral (LR-MS) images, finally generating the high-resolution
multi-spectral (HR-MS) images. Although deep learning-based models have
achieved excellent performance, they often come with high computational
complexity, which hinder their applications on resource-limited devices. In
this paper, we explore the feasibility of applying the binary neural network
(BNN) to pan-sharpening. Nevertheless, there are two main issues with
binarizing pan-sharpening models: (i) the binarization will cause serious
spectral distortion due to the inconsistent spectral distribution of the
PAN/LR-MS images; (ii) the common binary convolution kernel is difficult to
adapt to the multi-scale and anisotropic spatial features of remote sensing
objects, resulting in serious degradation of contours. To address the above
issues, we design the customized spatial-spectral binarized convolution
(S2B-Conv), which is composed of the Spectral-Redistribution Mechanism (SRM)
and Gabor Spatial Feature Amplifier (GSFA). Specifically, SRM employs an affine
transformation, generating its scaling and bias parameters through a dynamic
learning process. GSFA, which randomly selects different frequencies and angles
within a preset range, enables to better handle multi-scale and-directional
spatial features. A series of S2B-Conv form a brand-new binary network for
pan-sharpening, dubbed as S2BNet. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
experiments have shown our high-efficiency binarized pan-sharpening method can
attain a promising performance.

*Hongrui Jia,Chaoya Jiang,Shikun Zhang,Wei Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free visual-reasoning pipeline that decouples reasoning and perception, using an LLM to orchestrate reasoning while querying an LMM for specific visual information to prevent visual grounding loss in extended reasoning chains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) lose visual grounding as reasoning chains extend, relying increasingly on textual logic and diverging from actual image content, leading to erroneous conclusions.

Method: Decouple reasoning and perception: use a powerful LLM for high-level reasoning that strategically interrogates an LMM (acting as visual question-answering engine) to extract specific visual information needed for logical chains.

Result: Significant reduction in visually-unfounded reasoning steps and substantial improvement in reasoning fidelity, validated through comprehensive evaluations.

Conclusion: The proposed lightweight, plug-and-play approach effectively governs visual reasoning without requiring additional training or architectural changes, maintaining visual grounding throughout extended reasoning processes.

Abstract: Significant advancements in the reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs) are now driven by test-time scaling laws, particularly those
leveraging extended Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. Inspired by these
breakthroughs, researchers have extended these paradigms to Large Multimodal
Models (LMMs). However, a critical limitation emerges: as their reasoning
chains extend, LMMs increasingly rely on textual logic, progressively losing
grounding in the underlying visual information. This leads to reasoning paths
that diverge from the image content, culminating in erroneous conclusions. To
address this, we introduce a strikingly simple yet effective training-free
visual-reasoning pipeline. The core concept is to decouple the reasoning and
perception processes. A powerful LLM orchestrates the high-level reasoning,
strategically interrogating a LMM to extract specific visual information
required for its logical chain. The LMM, in turn, functions exclusively as a
visual question-answering engine, supplying the necessary perceptual details on
demand. This lightweight, plug-and-play approach requires no additional
training or architectural changes. Comprehensive evaluations validate that our
framework effectively governs the visual reasoning process, leading to a
significant reduction in visually-unfounded reasoning steps and a substantial
improvement in reasoning fidelity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dual-Decoupled Prompting (DDP) is a replay-free framework for multi-label class-incremental learning that addresses semantic confusion and partial labeling issues through class-specific prompts and progressive confidence decoupling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt-based methods work well for single-label incremental learning but perform poorly in multi-label scenarios due to semantic confusion from co-occurring categories and true-negative-false-positive confusion from partial labeling.

Method: DDP uses class-specific positive-negative prompts to disentangle semantics and Progressive Confidence Decoupling (PCD) to suppress false positives. It freezes past prompts as knowledge anchors and employs interlayer prompting for efficiency.

Result: On MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC, DDP consistently outperforms prior methods and is the first replay-free MLCIL approach to exceed 80% mAP and 70% F1 under the standard MS-COCO B40-C10 benchmark.

Conclusion: DDP effectively addresses the core challenges of multi-label class-incremental learning through dual decoupling strategies, achieving state-of-the-art performance without requiring replay mechanisms.

Abstract: Prompt-based methods have shown strong effectiveness in single-label
class-incremental learning, but their direct extension to multi-label
class-incremental learning (MLCIL) performs poorly due to two intrinsic
challenges: semantic confusion from co-occurring categories and
true-negative-false-positive confusion caused by partial labeling. We propose
Dual-Decoupled Prompting (DDP), a replay-free and parameter-efficient framework
that explicitly addresses both issues. DDP assigns class-specific
positive-negative prompts to disentangle semantics and introduces Progressive
Confidence Decoupling (PCD), a curriculum-inspired decoupling strategy that
suppresses false positives. Past prompts are frozen as knowledge anchors, and
interlayer prompting enhances efficiency. On MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC, DDP
consistently outperforms prior methods and is the first replay-free MLCIL
approach to exceed 80% mAP and 70% F1 under the standard MS-COCO B40-C10

TL;DR: LRPO is the first online RL framework for Blind Face Restoration that uses likelihood regularization and composite rewards to address solution space challenges and improve restoration quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Blind Face Restoration faces challenges with large solution spaces causing artifacts like missing details and identity ambiguity in restored images.

Method: Likelihood-Regularized Policy Optimization (LRPO) framework using online RL with composite reward function, ground-truth guided likelihood regularization, and noise-level advantage assignment.

Result: LRPO significantly improves face restoration quality over baseline methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The proposed LRPO framework effectively addresses BFR challenges and demonstrates superior restoration performance through RL-based optimization with proper regularization strategies.

Abstract: Blind Face Restoration (BFR) encounters inherent challenges in exploring its
large solution space, leading to common artifacts like missing details and
identity ambiguity in the restored images. To tackle these challenges, we
propose a Likelihood-Regularized Policy Optimization (LRPO) framework, the
first to apply online reinforcement learning (RL) to the BFR task. LRPO
leverages rewards from sampled candidates to refine the policy network,
increasing the likelihood of high-quality outputs while improving restoration
performance on low-quality inputs. However, directly applying RL to BFR creates
incompatibility issues, producing restoration results that deviate
significantly from the ground truth. To balance perceptual quality and
fidelity, we propose three key strategies: 1) a composite reward function
tailored for face restoration assessment, 2) ground-truth guided likelihood
regularization, and 3) noise-level advantage assignment. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our proposed LRPO significantly improves the face restoration
quality over baseline methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: DentVLM establishes itself as a robust clinical decision support tool that can enhance primary dental care, mitigate provider-patient imbalances, and democratize access to specialized dental expertise.

Abstract: Diagnosing and managing oral diseases necessitate advanced visual
interpretation across diverse imaging modalities and integrated information
synthesis. While current AI models excel at isolated tasks, they often fall
short in addressing the complex, multimodal requirements of comprehensive
clinical dental practice. Here we introduce DentVLM, a multimodal
vision-language model engineered for expert-level oral disease diagnosis.
DentVLM was developed using a comprehensive, large-scale, bilingual dataset of
110,447 images and 2.46 million visual question-answering (VQA) pairs. The
model is capable of interpreting seven 2D oral imaging modalities across 36
diagnostic tasks, significantly outperforming leading proprietary and
open-source models by 19.6% higher accuracy for oral diseases and 27.9% for
malocclusions. In a clinical study involving 25 dentists, evaluating 1,946
patients and encompassing 3,105 QA pairs, DentVLM surpassed the diagnostic
performance of 13 junior dentists on 21 of 36 tasks and exceeded that of 12
senior dentists on 12 of 36 tasks. When integrated into a collaborative
workflow, DentVLM elevated junior dentists' performance to senior levels and
reduced diagnostic time for all practitioners by 15-22%. Furthermore, DentVLM
exhibited promising performance across three practical utility scenarios,
including home-based dental health management, hospital-based intelligent
diagnosis and multi-agent collaborative interaction. These findings establish
DentVLM as a robust clinical decision support tool, poised to enhance primary

Motivation: Existing RL methods for text-to-image generation suffer from exhaustive exploration and inefficient sampling due to slight variations in sampling groups, limiting their practical deployment.

Method: Proposes Dynamic-TreeRPO with tree-structured search using dynamic noise intensities, GRPO-guided optimization, constrained SDE sampling, and LayerTuning-RL that integrates SFT with RL via weighted Progress Reward Model.

Conclusion: The tree-structured sampling and LayerTuning-RL paradigm enable dynamic exploration of diverse search spaces, achieving superior semantic consistency, visual fidelity, and human preference alignment.

Abstract: The integration of Reinforcement Learning (RL) into flow matching models for
text-to-image (T2I) generation has driven substantial advances in generation
quality. However, these gains often come at the cost of exhaustive exploration
and inefficient sampling strategies due to slight variation in the sampling
group. Building on this insight, we propose Dynamic-TreeRPO, which implements
the sliding-window sampling strategy as a tree-structured search with dynamic
noise intensities along depth. We perform GRPO-guided optimization and
constrained Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) sampling within this tree
structure. By sharing prefix paths of the tree, our design effectively
amortizes the computational overhead of trajectory search. With well-designed
noise intensities for each tree layer, Dynamic-TreeRPO can enhance the
variation of exploration without any extra computational cost. Furthermore, we
seamlessly integrate Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and RL paradigm within
Dynamic-TreeRPO to construct our proposed LayerTuning-RL, reformulating the
loss function of SFT as a dynamically weighted Progress Reward Model (PRM)
rather than a separate pretraining method. By associating this weighted PRM
with dynamic-adaptive clipping bounds, the disruption of exploration process in
Dynamic-TreeRPO is avoided. Benefiting from the tree-structured sampling and
the LayerTuning-RL paradigm, our model dynamically explores a diverse search
space along effective directions. Compared to existing baselines, our approach
demonstrates significant superiority in terms of semantic consistency, visual
fidelity, and human preference alignment on established benchmarks, including
HPS-v2.1, PickScore, and ImageReward. In particular, our model outperforms SoTA
by $4.9\%$, $5.91\%$, and $8.66\%$ on those benchmarks, respectively, while
improving the training efficiency by nearly $50\%$.

### [82] [Test-time Uncertainty Estimation for Medical Image Registration via Transformation Equivariance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23355)
*Lin Tian,Xiaoling Hu,Juan Eugenio Iglesias*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A test-time uncertainty estimation framework for image registration that works with any pretrained network, using transformation equivariance and spatial perturbations to generate uncertainty maps that correlate with registration errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep registration networks lack reliability indicators, and existing uncertainty methods require architectural changes or retraining, limiting their applicability to pretrained networks.

Method: Leverages transformation equivariance property by analyzing variance of network predictions under spatial perturbations, decomposing uncertainty into intrinsic spread (epistemic noise) and bias jitter (systematic error drift).

Result: Across four anatomical structures and multiple registration models, uncertainty maps consistently correlate with registration errors and highlight regions requiring caution.

Conclusion: The framework turns any pretrained registration network into a risk-aware tool, advancing medical image registration toward safe clinical and research deployment.

Abstract: Accurate image registration is essential for downstream applications, yet
current deep registration networks provide limited indications of whether and
when their predictions are reliable. Existing uncertainty estimation
strategies, such as Bayesian methods, ensembles, or MC dropout, require
architectural changes or retraining, limiting their applicability to pretrained
registration networks. Instead, we propose a test-time uncertainty estimation
framework that is compatible with any pretrained networks. Our framework is
grounded in the transformation equivariance property of registration, which
states that the true mapping between two images should remain consistent under
spatial perturbations of the input. By analyzing the variance of network
predictions under such perturbations, we derive a theoretical decomposition of
perturbation-based uncertainty in registration. This decomposition separates
into two terms: (i) an intrinsic spread, reflecting epistemic noise, and (ii) a
bias jitter, capturing how systematic error drifts under perturbations. Across
four anatomical structures (brain, cardiac, abdominal, and lung) and multiple
registration models (uniGradICON, SynthMorph), the uncertainty maps correlate
consistently with registration errors and highlight regions requiring caution.
Our framework turns any pretrained registration network into a risk-aware tool
at test time, placing medical image registration one step closer to safe
deployment in clinical and large-scale research settings.

### [83] [GRAPE: Let GPRO Supervise Query Rewriting by Ranking for Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23370)
*Zhaohua Zhang,Jianhuan Zhuo,Muxi Chen,Chenchen Zhao,Wenyu Jiang,Tianwen Jiang,Mingyang Chen,Yu Tang,Qiuyong Xiao,Jihong Zhang,Zhixun Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRAPE is a plug-and-play enhancement that uses ranking-aware policy optimization to improve CLIP retrieval performance under distribution shifts like multilingual, long-form, and multimodal differences, achieving 4.9% average improvement in Recall@10.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP struggles with tasks where input distributions diverge from its training corpus, and existing query-rewriting methods with LLMs lack supervision signals to generate optimal queries that fit the training distribution.

Method: GRAPE incorporates ranking signals into retrieval-guided query rewriting with LLMs using Grouped Ranking-Aware Policy Optimization (GRPO), addressing score inflation through corpus-relative ranking-based rewards.

Result: Extensive experiments show GRAPE improves retrieval performance under distributional shifts (multilingual, length, and modality differences) with 4.9% average improvement in Recall@10 across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: GRAPE effectively bridges distributional gaps in CLIP retrieval by optimizing query rewriting with ranking-aware rewards, providing a practical solution for distribution shift challenges without costly retraining.

Abstract: The CLIP model has become a cornerstone of large-scale retrieval systems by
aligning text and image data in a unified embedding space. Despite its
simplicity and efficiency, CLIP struggles when applied to tasks whose input
distributions diverge from its training corpus, such as queries with
multilingual, long-form, or multimodal differences. To avoid costly retraining,
existing methods mainly adopt query-rewriting strategies with large language
models (LLMs), aiming to mitigate distribution gaps at the query level.
However, due to the lack of supervision signals, LLMs fail to generate the
optimal one that fits the training distribution. We address this challenge with
GRAPE (Grouped Ranking-Aware Policy Optimization Enhancement), a plug-and-play
enhancement approach that incorporates ranking signals into retrieval-guided
query rewriting with LLMs. Intuitively, GRAPE proposes to leverage GRPO to
bridge distributional differences -- including length, multilingual, and
modality shifts -- by transforming queries into forms better aligned with the
retriever's training distribution. However, our preliminary experiment finds
that naively finetuning LLM with similarity scores can lead to score inflation,
where nearly all candidates are assigned unexpectedly high scores regardless of
their true relevance. To address score inflation, we propose a corpus-relative
ranking-based reward, which explicitly aligns optimization with ranking metrics
while suppressing spurious score inflation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that GRAPE consistently improves retrieval performance under distributional
shifts -- including multilingual differences (Flickr30k-CN, CVLUE, XM3600),
length differences (Wikipedia), and multimodal differences (CIRR) -- achieving
an average improvement of 4.9\% in Recall\@10. The code is available at

*Yifan Yang,Yuxiang Yan,Boda Liu,Jian Pu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CasPoinTr is a point cloud completion framework using cascaded networks and knowledge distillation to address incomplete point clouds from real-world environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point clouds from real-world environments are often incomplete due to limited sensor resolution, single viewpoints, occlusions, and noise, making completion essential for various applications.

Method: Uses cascaded networks with two stages: Shape Reconstruction (generates auxiliary information) and Fused Completion (leverages information with knowledge distillation). A teacher model trained on denser point clouds transfers knowledge to the student model.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on ShapeNet-55 under different difficulty settings, demonstrating superior shape recovery and detail preservation.

Conclusion: The cascaded structure and distillation strategy effectively bridge the gap between incomplete inputs and complete targets, enhancing global shape context capture and local detail refinement.

Abstract: Point clouds collected from real-world environments are often incomplete due
to factors such as limited sensor resolution, single viewpoints, occlusions,
and noise. These challenges make point cloud completion essential for various
applications. A key difficulty in this task is predicting the overall shape and
reconstructing missing regions from highly incomplete point clouds. To address
this, we introduce CasPoinTr, a novel point cloud completion framework using
cascaded networks and knowledge distillation. CasPoinTr decomposes the
completion task into two synergistic stages: Shape Reconstruction, which
generates auxiliary information, and Fused Completion, which leverages this
information alongside knowledge distillation to generate the final output.
Through knowledge distillation, a teacher model trained on denser point clouds
transfers incomplete-complete associative knowledge to the student model,
enhancing its ability to estimate the overall shape and predict missing
regions. Together, the cascaded networks and knowledge distillation enhance the
model's ability to capture global shape context while refining local details,
effectively bridging the gap between incomplete inputs and complete targets.
Experiments on ShapeNet-55 under different difficulty settings demonstrate that
CasPoinTr outperforms existing methods in shape recovery and detail
preservation, highlighting the effectiveness of our cascaded structure and
distillation strategy.

*Jinghong Zheng,Changlong Jiang,Jiaqi Li,Haohong Kuang,Hang Xu,Tingbing Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniPose is a unified cross-modality method for weakly supervised 3D human pose estimation using unannotated RGB-D sequences, transferring 2D pose annotations to 3D domain without requiring 3D keypoint labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between 2D and 3D pose estimation without needing labor-intensive 3D annotations, avoiding issues with multi-view camera calibration and synthetic-to-real data shifts.

Method: Uses self-supervised learning on RGB-D sequences with off-the-shelf 2D pose estimations as weak supervision. Incorporates spatial-temporal constraints, 2D-to-3D back-projection loss, and cross-modality interaction. Employs anchor-to-joint prediction for 3D lifting on RGB and depth networks.

Result: Achieves comparable performance to fully supervised methods on CMU Panoptic and ITOP datasets. Performance improves with large-scale unlabeled data (NTU RGB+D 60) under challenging conditions. 3D lifting method achieves state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: UniPose demonstrates effective weakly supervised 3D pose estimation by leveraging 2D annotations and cross-modality learning, showing practical potential for real-world applications.

Abstract: In this paper, we present UniPose, a unified cross-modality pose prior
propagation method for weakly supervised 3D human pose estimation (HPE) using
unannotated single-view RGB-D sequences (RGB, depth, and point cloud data).
UniPose transfers 2D HPE annotations from large-scale RGB datasets (e.g., MS
COCO) to the 3D domain via self-supervised learning on easily acquired RGB-D
sequences, eliminating the need for labor-intensive 3D keypoint annotations.
This approach bridges the gap between 2D and 3D domains without suffering from
issues related to multi-view camera calibration or synthetic-to-real data
shifts. During training, UniPose leverages off-the-shelf 2D pose estimations as
weak supervision for point cloud networks, incorporating spatial-temporal
constraints like body symmetry and joint motion. The 2D-to-3D back-projection
loss and cross-modality interaction further enhance this process. By treating
the point cloud network's 3D HPE results as pseudo ground truth, our
anchor-to-joint prediction method performs 3D lifting on RGB and depth
networks, making it more robust against inaccuracies in 2D HPE results compared
to state-of-the-art methods. Experiments on CMU Panoptic and ITOP datasets show
that UniPose achieves comparable performance to fully supervised methods.
Incorporating large-scale unlabeled data (e.g., NTU RGB+D 60) enhances its
performance under challenging conditions, demonstrating its potential for
practical applications. Our proposed 3D lifting method also achieves
state-of-the-art results.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Goliath-SC, the first extensive self-contact dataset with precise body shape registration, and proposes a generative model for self-contact poses conditioned on body shapes, improving single-view pose estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing self-contact datasets lack variety and precise body shapes, limiting analysis between self-contact poses and shapes. Body shape significantly affects self-contact (e.g., hand-belly contact differs for low vs high BMI individuals).

Method: Created Goliath-SC dataset with 383K self-contact poses across 130 subjects. Proposed body-part-wise latent diffusion with self-attention for generative modeling of self-contact prior conditioned by body shape parameters. Incorporated this prior into single-view pose estimation with contact refinement.

Result: Shape conditioning proved vital for successful modeling of self-contact pose distribution. The approach improved single-view pose estimation accuracy in self-contact scenarios.

Conclusion: Body shape conditioning is essential for accurate self-contact modeling, and the proposed method effectively enhances single-view human pose estimation in self-contact situations.

Abstract: One can hardly model self-contact of human poses without considering
underlying body shapes. For example, the pose of rubbing a belly for a person
with a low BMI leads to penetration of the hand into the belly for a person
with a high BMI. Despite its relevance, existing self-contact datasets lack the
variety of self-contact poses and precise body shapes, limiting conclusive
analysis between self-contact poses and shapes. To address this, we begin by
introducing the first extensive self-contact dataset with precise body shape
registration, Goliath-SC, consisting of 383K self-contact poses across 130
subjects. Using this dataset, we propose generative modeling of self-contact
prior conditioned by body shape parameters, based on a body-part-wise latent
diffusion with self-attention. We further incorporate this prior into
single-view human pose estimation while refining estimated poses to be in
contact. Our experiments suggest that shape conditioning is vital to the
successful modeling of self-contact pose distribution, hence improving
single-view pose estimation in self-contact.

TL;DR: WorldSplat is a feed-forward framework for 4D driving-scene generation that bridges the gap between scene generation and reconstruction, enabling high-quality novel-view synthesis of driving scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods either focus on generating diverse driving videos but lack 3D consistency and novel-view synthesis capabilities, or focus on 3D/4D reconstruction but lack generative capabilities. WorldSplat aims to overcome this dilemma.

Method: Uses a 4D-aware latent diffusion model with multi-modal information to generate pixel-aligned 4D Gaussians, followed by refinement of novel view videos using an enhanced video diffusion model.

Result: Extensive experiments show WorldSplat effectively generates high-fidelity, temporally and spatially consistent multi-track novel view driving videos.

Conclusion: WorldSplat successfully bridges the gap between scene generation and reconstruction, providing a scalable and controllable framework for generating realistic driving scenes with high-quality novel-view synthesis.

Abstract: Recent advances in driving-scene generation and reconstruction have
demonstrated significant potential for enhancing autonomous driving systems by
producing scalable and controllable training data. Existing generation methods
primarily focus on synthesizing diverse and high-fidelity driving videos;
however, due to limited 3D consistency and sparse viewpoint coverage, they
struggle to support convenient and high-quality novel-view synthesis (NVS).
Conversely, recent 3D/4D reconstruction approaches have significantly improved
NVS for real-world driving scenes, yet inherently lack generative capabilities.
To overcome this dilemma between scene generation and reconstruction, we
propose \textbf{WorldSplat}, a novel feed-forward framework for 4D
driving-scene generation. Our approach effectively generates consistent
multi-track videos through two key steps: ((i)) We introduce a 4D-aware latent
diffusion model integrating multi-modal information to produce pixel-aligned 4D
Gaussians in a feed-forward manner. ((ii)) Subsequently, we refine the novel
view videos rendered from these Gaussians using a enhanced video diffusion
model. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
\textbf{WorldSplat} effectively generates high-fidelity, temporally and
spatially consistent multi-track novel view driving videos.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate fracture detection is essential for clinical diagnostic efficiency, but existing methods struggle with detecting subtle and morphologically diverse fractures due to variable imaging angles and suboptimal image quality.

Method: FracDetNet integrates Dual-Focus Attention (DFA) to capture detailed local features and comprehensive global context through combined global and local attention mechanisms, and Multi-scale Calibration (MC) to adaptively refine feature representations.

Conclusion: FracDetNet demonstrates superior fracture detection performance through its innovative attention and calibration mechanisms, significantly advancing medical imaging diagnostics for fracture detection.

Abstract: In this paper, an advanced fracture detection framework, FracDetNet, is
proposed to address challenges in medical imaging, as accurate fracture
detection is essential for enhancing diagnostic efficiency in clinical

*Sahithya Ravi,Aditya Chinchure,Raymond T. Ng,Leonid Sigal,Vered Shwartz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPIKE is an inference-time framework that uses Bayesian Surprise to identify memorable moments in videos, enabling better frame sampling for Video-LLMs by focusing on surprising events rather than uniform sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most Video-LLMs process videos through uniform frame sampling, which often misses critical narrative-defining moments where surprising events occur, leading to suboptimal video understanding.

Method: SPIKE quantifies Bayesian Surprise as belief updates triggered by new visual evidence. SPIKE-RL extends this by using GRPO to optimize belief hypotheses based on reward signals from video captions, enabling surprise-weighted frame sampling.

Result: SPIKE effectively localizes surprise in videos, correlating strongly with human judgments on FunQA and Oops! benchmarks. The surprise-weighted sampling strategy achieves consistent performance gains on five downstream benchmarks compared to uniform sampling.

Conclusion: By enabling Video-LLMs to track beliefs and register surprise, this work paves the way for more robust models that can revise their understanding in response to new information, improving video comprehension.

Abstract: Real-world videos often show routine activities punctuated by memorable,
surprising events. However, most Video-LLMs process videos by sampling frames
uniformly, likely missing critical moments that define a video's narrative. We
introduce SPIKE, an inference-time framework that quantifies Bayesian Surprise
as the belief update triggered by new visual evidence in the video stream,
identifying moments where new visual evidence conflicts with prior beliefs.
SPIKE effectively localizes surprise in videos, strongly correlated with humans
on positive (FunQA) and negative (Oops!) surprise benchmarks. Since the beliefs
of zero-shot Video-LLMs are often suboptimal, we develop SPIKE-RL, which
leverages GRPO to optimize belief hypotheses based on a reward signal from the
video caption. SPIKE and SPIKE-RL guide query-agnostic surprise-weighted frame
sampling, which allocates more frames to interesting moments in the video. With
this strategy, we achieve consistent performance gains on five downstream
benchmarks over uniform sampling. By enabling Video-LLMs to track beliefs and
register surprise, our work paves the way for more robust models that can
revise their understanding in response to new information.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing periodic activation-based INR networks suffer from hidden feature redundancy due to fixed frequency multipliers, limiting MLP expressive capacity.

Method: Propose FM-SIREN and FM-FINER with Nyquist-informed, neuron-specific frequency multipliers for periodic activations, introducing frequency diversity without hyperparameter tuning or additional depth.

Result: Reduces feature redundancy by nearly 50%, consistently improves signal reconstruction in 1D audio, 2D image, 3D shape fitting, and NeRF synthesis, outperforming baselines while maintaining efficiency.

Conclusion: The simple yet principled modification of neuron-specific frequency multipliers effectively reduces feature redundancy and enhances INR performance across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Existing periodic activation-based implicit neural representation (INR)
networks, such as SIREN and FINER, suffer from hidden feature redundancy, where
neurons within a layer capture overlapping frequency components due to the use
of a fixed frequency multiplier. This redundancy limits the expressive capacity
of multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). Drawing inspiration from classical signal
processing methods such as the Discrete Sine Transform (DST), we propose
FM-SIREN and FM-FINER, which assign Nyquist-informed, neuron-specific frequency
multipliers to periodic activations. Unlike existing approaches, our design
introduces frequency diversity without requiring hyperparameter tuning or
additional network depth. This simple yet principled modification reduces the
redundancy of features by nearly 50% and consistently improves signal
reconstruction across diverse INR tasks, including fitting 1D audio, 2D image
and 3D shape, and synthesis of neural radiance fields (NeRF), outperforming
their baseline counterparts while maintaining efficiency.

TL;DR: FoR-SALE is a framework that integrates Frame of Reference (FoR) concepts into text-to-image generation to improve spatial understanding from different perspectives, using LLM-controlled diffusion editing with vision modules and latent-space operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current state-of-the-art text-to-image models struggle with spatial descriptions from perspectives other than the camera view, creating a performance gap in spatial reasoning that humans naturally handle through Frame of Reference concepts.

Method: Extends SLD framework with FoR-SALE, which evaluates text-image alignment using vision modules to extract spatial configurations and map spatial expressions to camera perspectives. When misaligned, it generates and applies latent-space operations to adjust facing direction and depth.

Result: Improves performance of state-of-the-art T2I models by up to 5.3% on FoR spatial understanding benchmarks using only a single correction round.

Conclusion: Integrating Frame of Reference concepts into multimodal language models significantly enhances spatial reasoning capabilities in text-to-image generation, addressing a fundamental limitation in current models.

Abstract: Frame of Reference (FoR) is a fundamental concept in spatial reasoning that
humans utilize to comprehend and describe space. With the rapid progress in
Multimodal Language models, the moment has come to integrate this
long-overlooked dimension into these models. In particular, in text-to-image
(T2I) generation, even state-of-the-art models exhibit a significant
performance gap when spatial descriptions are provided from perspectives other
than the camera. To address this limitation, we propose Frame of
Reference-guided Spatial Adjustment in LLM-based Diffusion Editing (FoR-SALE),
an extension of the Self-correcting LLM-controlled Diffusion (SLD) framework
for T2I. For-Sale evaluates the alignment between a given text and an initially
generated image, and refines the image based on the Frame of Reference
specified in the spatial expressions. It employs vision modules to extract the
spatial configuration of the image, while simultaneously mapping the spatial
expression to a corresponding camera perspective. This unified perspective
enables direct evaluation of alignment between language and vision. When
misalignment is detected, the required editing operations are generated and
applied. FoR-SALE applies novel latent-space operations to adjust the facing
direction and depth of the generated images. We evaluate FoR-SALE on two
benchmarks specifically designed to assess spatial understanding with FoR. Our
framework improves the performance of state-of-the-art T2I models by up to 5.3%
using only a single round of correction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3DPCNet is a compact module that converts view-dependent 3D poses into consistent body-centered canonical frames using a hybrid encoder with graph convolutions and transformers, achieving significant error reduction in pose alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular 3D pose estimators produce camera-centered skeletons with view-dependent signals that complicate comparative analysis in applications like health and sports science, requiring consistent pose representations.

Method: Uses a hybrid encoder combining graph convolutional networks for local skeletal features and transformers for global context via gated cross-attention, predicting 6D rotation mapped to SO(3) matrix for pose alignment. Trained self-supervised on MM-Fi dataset with synthetic rotations using composite loss.

Result: Reduces mean rotation error from over 20° to 3.4° and Mean Per Joint Position Error from ~64 mm to 47 mm on MM-Fi benchmark. Qualitative evaluation on TotalCapture shows acceleration signals from video correspond well with ground-truth IMU data.

Conclusion: 3DPCNet effectively removes viewpoint variability to enable physically plausible motion analysis by producing consistent body-centered canonical poses from view-dependent inputs.

Abstract: Monocular 3D pose estimators produce camera-centered skeletons, creating
view-dependent kinematic signals that complicate comparative analysis in
applications such as health and sports science. We present 3DPCNet, a compact,
estimator-agnostic module that operates directly on 3D joint coordinates to
rectify any input pose into a consistent, body-centered canonical frame. Its
hybrid encoder fuses local skeletal features from a graph convolutional network
with global context from a transformer via a gated cross-attention mechanism.
From this representation, the model predicts a continuous 6D rotation that is
mapped to an $SO(3)$ matrix to align the pose. We train the model in a
self-supervised manner on the MM-Fi dataset using synthetically rotated poses,
guided by a composite loss ensuring both accurate rotation and pose
reconstruction. On the MM-Fi benchmark, 3DPCNet reduces the mean rotation error
from over 20$^{\circ}$ to 3.4$^{\circ}$ and the Mean Per Joint Position Error
from ~64 mm to 47 mm compared to a geometric baseline. Qualitative evaluations
on the TotalCapture dataset further demonstrate that our method produces
acceleration signals from video that show strong visual correspondence to
ground-truth IMU sensor data, confirming that our module removes viewpoint
variability to enable physically plausible motion analysis.

TL;DR: A fine-grained test-time optimization framework that improves compositional faithfulness in text-to-image generation by decomposing prompts into semantic concepts and using concept-level alignment feedback to iteratively refine prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models often fail to faithfully render all elements of complex prompts, frequently omitting or misrepresenting specific objects and attributes. Test-time optimization shows promise but existing approaches rely only on global image/text similarity scores.

Method: Decomposes input prompts into semantic concepts and evaluates alignment at both global and concept levels using a fine-grained CLIP variant. Produces detailed feedback on missing/inaccurate concepts and feeds this into an iterative prompt refinement loop using large language models.

Result: Experiments on DrawBench and CompBench prompts show significant improvements in concept coverage and human-judged faithfulness over both standard test-time optimization and base T2I models.

Conclusion: The proposed fine-grained test-time optimization framework effectively enhances compositional faithfulness in text-to-image generation by addressing concept-level misalignments through iterative prompt refinement.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models, they often fail to
faithfully render all elements of complex prompts, frequently omitting or
misrepresenting specific objects and attributes. Test-time optimization has
emerged as a promising approach to address this limitation by refining
generation without the need for retraining. In this paper, we propose a
fine-grained test-time optimization framework that enhances compositional
faithfulness in T2I generation. Unlike most of prior approaches that rely
solely on a global image/text similarity score, our method decomposes the input
prompt into semantic concepts and evaluates alignment at both the global and
concept levels. A fine-grained variant of CLIP is used to compute concept-level
correspondence, producing detailed feedback on missing or inaccurate concepts.
This feedback is fed into an iterative prompt refinement loop, enabling the
large language model to propose improved prompts. Experiments on DrawBench and
CompBench prompts demonstrate that our method significantly improves concept
coverage and human-judged faithfulness over both standard test-time
optimization and the base T2I model. Code is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MFAS-DANet addresses domain adaptation challenges in multi-modal face anti-spoofing by handling missing modalities, reducing noisy pseudo labels, and preventing model degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-modal FAS models fail to detect unseen attacks from new domains, and domain adaptation remains unexplored in multi-modal FAS despite being addressed in single-modal approaches.

Method: Proposes three solutions: 1) Extract complementary features from other modalities to handle missing modalities, 2) Use prediction uncertainty across modalities to derive reliable pseudo labels, 3) Implement adaptive loss weighting to prevent model degradation during unstable adaptations.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and effectiveness of MFAS-DANet in multi-modal face anti-spoofing under domain adaptation scenarios.

Conclusion: MFAS-DANet successfully addresses the three major challenges in multi-modal FAS domain adaptation and achieves superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Recent multi-modal face anti-spoofing (FAS) methods have investigated the
potential of leveraging multiple modalities to distinguish live and spoof
faces. However, pre-adapted multi-modal FAS models often fail to detect unseen
attacks from new target domains. Although a more realistic domain adaptation
(DA) scenario has been proposed for single-modal FAS to learn specific spoof
attacks during inference, DA remains unexplored in multi-modal FAS methods. In
this paper, we propose a novel framework, MFAS-DANet, to address three major
challenges in multi-modal FAS under the DA scenario: missing modalities, noisy
pseudo labels, and model degradation. First, to tackle the issue of missing
modalities, we propose extracting complementary features from other modalities
to substitute missing modality features or enhance existing ones. Next, to
reduce the impact of noisy pseudo labels during model adaptation, we propose
deriving reliable pseudo labels by leveraging prediction uncertainty across
different modalities. Finally, to prevent model degradation, we design an
adaptive mechanism that decreases the loss weight during unstable adaptations
and increasing it during stable ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance of our proposed MFAS-DANet.

*Shourya Verma,Mengbo Wang,Nadia Atallah Lanman,Ananth Grama*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RestoRect is a novel Latent Rectified Flow Feature Distillation method that addresses the speed-quality trade-off in image restoration by using rectified flow to enable students to synthesize teacher-quality features through learnable latent trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image restoration approaches face a critical trade-off where high-performance models are too slow for practical use, while fast models produce poor results. Existing static feature matching methods cannot capture how modern transformer architectures dynamically generate features.

Method: Proposes RestoRect using rectified flow to reformulate feature distillation as a generative process where students learn to synthesize teacher-quality features through learnable trajectories in latent space. Combines Retinex theory for physics-based decomposition with learnable anisotropic diffusion constraints and trigonometric color space polarization. Introduces Feature Layer Extraction loss for robust knowledge transfer between different architectures through cross-normalized transformer feature alignment with percentile-based outlier detection.

Result: RestoRect achieves better training stability, faster convergence and inference while preserving restoration quality. Demonstrates superior results across 15 image restoration datasets covering 4 tasks on 8 metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed RestoRect framework effectively addresses the speed-quality trade-off in image restoration through novel latent rectified flow feature distillation, enabling fast yet high-quality restoration performance across multiple tasks and datasets.

Abstract: Current approaches for restoration of degraded images face a critical
trade-off: high-performance models are too slow for practical use, while fast
models produce poor results. Knowledge distillation transfers teacher knowledge
to students, but existing static feature matching methods cannot capture how
modern transformer architectures dynamically generate features. We propose
'RestoRect', a novel Latent Rectified Flow Feature Distillation method for
restoring degraded images. We apply rectified flow to reformulate feature
distillation as a generative process where students learn to synthesize
teacher-quality features through learnable trajectories in latent space. Our
framework combines Retinex theory for physics-based decomposition with
learnable anisotropic diffusion constraints, and trigonometric color space
polarization. We introduce a Feature Layer Extraction loss for robust knowledge

*Junyi Wu,Jiachen Tao,Haoxuan Wang,Gaowen Liu,Ramana Rao Kompella,Yan Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Orientation-anchored Gaussian Splatting (OriGS) is a novel framework for high-quality 4D reconstruction from monocular videos that uses scene orientation as a stable anchor to model complex dynamic deformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods that extend 3D Gaussian Splatting to dynamic scenes rely on low-rank assumptions and struggle with complex, region-specific deformations in unconstrained dynamic scenes.

Method: OriGS introduces a Global Orientation Field to propagate principal forward directions across space and time, and proposes Orientation-aware Hyper-Gaussian that embeds time, space, geometry, and orientation into a unified probabilistic state for inferring region-specific deformations.

Result: Experiments show OriGS achieves superior reconstruction fidelity over mainstream methods in challenging real-world dynamic scenes.

Conclusion: OriGS effectively models complex dynamic deformations by leveraging scene orientation as a stable structural guidance, enabling high-quality 4D reconstruction from casually captured monocular videos.

Abstract: We present Orientation-anchored Gaussian Splatting (OriGS), a novel framework
for high-quality 4D reconstruction from casually captured monocular videos.
While recent advances extend 3D Gaussian Splatting to dynamic scenes via
various motion anchors, such as graph nodes or spline control points, they
often rely on low-rank assumptions and fall short in modeling complex,
region-specific deformations inherent to unconstrained dynamics. OriGS
addresses this by introducing a hyperdimensional representation grounded in
scene orientation. We first estimate a Global Orientation Field that propagates
principal forward directions across space and time, serving as stable
structural guidance for dynamic modeling. Built upon this, we propose
Orientation-aware Hyper-Gaussian, a unified formulation that embeds time,
space, geometry, and orientation into a coherent probabilistic state. This
enables inferring region-specific deformation through principled conditioned
slicing, adaptively capturing diverse local dynamics in alignment with global
motion intent. Experiments demonstrate the superior reconstruction fidelity of
OriGS over mainstream methods in challenging real-world dynamic scenes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a large-scale empirical study analyzing intra-modality and inter-modality dependencies in 23 VQA benchmarks using MLLMs, revealing that many benchmarks intended to reduce text bias have instead amplified image-only dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the interplay between intra-modality dependencies (individual modality contributions) and inter-modality dependencies (relationships between modalities and target task) in multi-modal learning, as current benchmark evaluations poorly characterize these interactions.

Method: Conducted large-scale empirical study across 23 visual question-answering benchmarks using multi-modal large language models (MLLMs), covering domains including general/expert knowledge reasoning, OCR, and document understanding.

Result: Found significant variation in reliance on vision, text, and their interaction across and within benchmarks. Discovered many benchmarks intended to mitigate text-only biases have instead amplified image-only dependencies. This pattern persists across model sizes, with larger models using intra-modality dependencies to achieve high performance that masks lack of true multi-modal reasoning.

Conclusion: Provides quantitative characterization of multi-modal datasets, enabling principled approach to multi-modal benchmark design and evaluation by revealing how current benchmarks may fail to assess true multi-modal reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Understanding the interplay between intra-modality dependencies (the
contribution of an individual modality to a target task) and inter-modality
dependencies (the relationships between modalities and the target task) is
fundamental to advancing multi-modal learning. However, the nature of and
interaction between these dependencies within current benchmark evaluations
remains poorly characterized. In this work, we present a large-scale empirical
study to quantify these dependencies across 23 visual question-answering
benchmarks using multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) covering domains
such as general and expert knowledge reasoning, optical character recognition,
and document understanding. Our findings show that the reliance on vision,
question (text), and their interaction varies significantly, both across and
within benchmarks. We discover that numerous benchmarks intended to mitigate
text-only biases have inadvertently amplified image-only dependencies. This
characterization persists across model sizes, as larger models often use these
intra-modality dependencies to achieve high performance that mask an underlying
lack of multi-modal reasoning. We provide a quantitative characterization of
multi-modal datasets, enabling a principled approach to multi-modal benchmark
design and evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Polyp segmentation is challenging due to diverse shapes, sizes, and low contrast boundaries in medical imaging, requiring improved accuracy and efficiency for colorectal cancer detection.

Method: Integrates Dynamic Kernel mechanism initialized by global context vector from Encoder Attention module, with Unified Channel Adaptation in decoder to standardize feature dimensions across stages.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on KvasirSEG and CVC ClinicDB datasets with superior Dice and IoU scores, while reducing computational costs without compromising accuracy.

Conclusion: Provides a robust and adaptable solution for polyp segmentation with promising applications in clinical and automated diagnostic systems.

Abstract: Polyp segmentation is a critical step in colorectal cancer detection, yet it
remains challenging due to the diverse shapes, sizes, and low contrast
boundaries of polyps in medical imaging. In this work, we propose a novel
framework that improves segmentation accuracy and efficiency by integrating a
Dynamic Kernel (DK) mechanism with a global Encoder Attention module. The DK
mechanism, initialized by a global context vector from the EA module,
iteratively refines segmentation predictions across decoding stages, enabling
the model to focus on and accurately delineate complex polyp boundaries. The EA
module enhances the network's ability to capture critical lesion features by
aggregating multi scale information from all encoder layers. In addition, we
employ Unified Channel Adaptation (UCA) in the decoder to standardize feature
dimensions across stages, ensuring consistent and computationally efficient
information fusion. Our approach extends the lesion-aware kernel framework by
introducing a more flexible, attention driven kernel initialization and a
unified decoder design. Extensive experiments on the KvasirSEG and CVC ClinicDB
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms several state of the
art segmentation methods, achieving superior Dice and Intersection over Union
scores. Moreover, UCA simplifies the decoder structure, reducing computational
cost without compromising accuracy. Overall, the proposed method provides a
robust and adaptable solution for polyp segmentation, with promising
applications in clinical and automated diagnostic systems.

TL;DR: ActPLD is the first benchmark to evaluate action processing in MLLMs from human point-light displays, revealing consistently low performance across models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test the constraints of action understanding in MLLMs using point-light displays, which isolate body motion as the sole source of meaning and represent key stimuli for action understanding.

Method: Created ActPLD benchmark with single-actor and socially interacting point-light displays, testing state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source MLLMs.

Result: Models showed consistently low performance, revealing fundamental gaps in action and spatiotemporal understanding.

Conclusion: Current MLLMs struggle with extracting semantic information from minimal visual cues like point-light displays, unlike humans who can do this naturally.

Abstract: Humans can extract rich semantic information from minimal visual cues, as
demonstrated by point-light displays (PLDs), which consist of sparse sets of
dots localized to key joints of the human body. This ability emerges early in
development and is largely attributed to human embodied experience. Since PLDs
isolate body motion as the sole source of meaning, they represent key stimuli
for testing the constraints of action understanding in these systems. Here we
introduce ActPLD, the first benchmark to evaluate action processing in MLLMs
from human PLDs. Tested models include state-of-the-art proprietary and
open-source systems on single-actor and socially interacting PLDs. Our results
reveal consistently low performance across models, introducing fundamental gaps
in action and spatiotemporal understanding.

TL;DR: This study developed a deep learning framework using chest CT scans to predict mortality in systemic sclerosis patients with interstitial lung disease, achieving AUCs of 0.769-0.801 for 1-3 year predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the role of chest CT in predicting disease progression and mortality in systemic sclerosis patients with interstitial lung disease, which is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality.

Method: Used a large-scale longitudinal chest CT analysis framework with radiomics and deep learning (ResNet-18, DenseNet-121, Swin Transformer) on 2,125 CT scans from SSc patients, with mortality analysis at 1, 3, and 5 years.

Result: Models achieved AUCs of 0.769, 0.801, and 0.709 for predicting mortality within 1, 3, and 5 years respectively, using pre-trained models fine-tuned on SSc patient images.

Conclusion: Both radiomics and deep learning methods show potential for improving early detection and risk assessment of SSc-related interstitial lung disease, representing a significant advancement in the field.

Abstract: Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality
in systemic sclerosis (SSc). Chest computed tomography (CT) is the primary
imaging modality for diagnosing and monitoring lung complications in SSc
patients. However, its role in disease progression and mortality prediction has
not yet been fully clarified. This study introduces a novel, large-scale
longitudinal chest CT analysis framework that utilizes radiomics and deep
learning to predict mortality associated with lung complications of SSc. We
collected and analyzed 2,125 CT scans from SSc patients enrolled in the
Northwestern Scleroderma Registry, conducting mortality analyses at one, three,
and five years using advanced imaging analysis techniques. Death labels were
assigned based on recorded deaths over the one-, three-, and five-year
intervals, confirmed by expert physicians. In our dataset, 181, 326, and 428 of
the 2,125 CT scans were from patients who died within one, three, and five
years, respectively. Using ResNet-18, DenseNet-121, and Swin Transformer we use
pre-trained models, and fine-tuned on 2,125 images of SSc patients. Models
achieved an AUC of 0.769, 0.801, 0.709 for predicting mortality within one-,
three-, and five-years, respectively. Our findings highlight the potential of
both radiomics and deep learning computational methods to improve early
detection and risk assessment of SSc-related interstitial lung disease, marking

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an adaptive super-resolution framework for driver monitoring systems that optimizes for model calibration and safety-critical metrics, achieving state-of-the-art performance in calibration and precision-recall for drowsiness and phone use detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Driver monitoring systems require reliable, well-calibrated confidence scores for safety-critical deployment, as direct low-resolution training yields poorly calibrated predictions that can be dangerous.

Method: Resource-aware adaptive super-resolution framework with a lightweight artifact detector (0.3M parameters, 5.2ms overhead) to filter super-resolution-induced hallucinations.

Result: Achieved best calibration (ECE 5.8% vs 6.2% baseline), highest AUPR for drowsiness detection (0.78 vs 0.74), and superior precision-recall for phone use detection (0.74 vs 0.71).

Conclusion: While low-resolution trained models serve as strong general-purpose baselines, the adaptive framework represents state-of-the-art for safety-critical applications where reliability is paramount.

Abstract: Driver monitoring systems require not just high accuracy but reliable,
well-calibrated confidence scores for safety-critical deployment. While direct
low-resolution training yields high overall accuracy, it produces poorly
calibrated predictions that can be dangerous in safety-critical scenarios. We
propose a resource-aware adaptive super-resolution framework that optimizes for
model calibration and high precision-recall on critical events. Our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance on safety-centric metrics: best
calibration (ECE of 5.8\% vs 6.2\% for LR-trained baselines), highest AUPR for
drowsiness detection (0.78 vs 0.74), and superior precision-recall for phone
use detection (0.74 vs 0.71). A lightweight artifact detector (0.3M parameters,
5.2ms overhead) provides additional safety by filtering SR-induced
hallucinations. While LR-trained video models serve as strong general-purpose
baselines, our adaptive framework represents the state-of-the-art solution for
safety-critical applications where reliability is paramount.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OVSeg3R is a training scheme that learns open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation from 2D perception models using 3D reconstruction, achieving significant performance improvements on ScanNet200 benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation without costly manual annotation by leveraging existing 2D perception models and 3D reconstruction from videos.

Method: Projects 2D instance masks from open-vocabulary 2D models onto 3D scenes using reconstruction correspondences, uses View-wise Instance Partition to handle partial annotations, and employs 2D Instance Boundary-aware Superpoint clustering to preserve object boundaries.

Result: +2.3 mAP overall improvement on ScanNet200 benchmark, +7.1 mAP improvement on novel classes under open-vocabulary setting compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: OVSeg3R effectively bridges 2D and 3D perception, enabling open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation with substantial performance gains, particularly for tail and novel classes.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a training scheme called OVSeg3R to learn
open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation from well-studied 2D perception models
with the aid of 3D reconstruction. OVSeg3R directly adopts reconstructed scenes
from 2D videos as input, avoiding costly manual adjustment while aligning input
with real-world applications. By exploiting the 2D to 3D correspondences
provided by 3D reconstruction models, OVSeg3R projects each view's 2D instance
mask predictions, obtained from an open-vocabulary 2D model, onto 3D to
generate annotations for the view's corresponding sub-scene. To avoid
incorrectly introduced false positives as supervision due to partial
annotations from 2D to 3D, we propose a View-wise Instance Partition algorithm,
which partitions predictions to their respective views for supervision,
stabilizing the training process. Furthermore, since 3D reconstruction models
tend to over-smooth geometric details, clustering reconstructed points into
representative super-points based solely on geometry, as commonly done in
mainstream 3D segmentation methods, may overlook geometrically non-salient
objects. We therefore introduce 2D Instance Boundary-aware Superpoint, which
leverages 2D masks to constrain the superpoint clustering, preventing
superpoints from violating instance boundaries. With these designs, OVSeg3R not
only extends a state-of-the-art closed-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation
model to open-vocabulary, but also substantially narrows the performance gap
between tail and head classes, ultimately leading to an overall improvement of
+2.3 mAP on the ScanNet200 benchmark. Furthermore, under the standard
open-vocabulary setting, OVSeg3R surpasses previous methods by about +7.1 mAP
on the novel classes, further validating its effectiveness.

TL;DR: This survey examines how 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is displacing Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) across various domains including SLAM, telepresence, robotics, and 3D content generation due to its advantages in photorealism, geometric fidelity, and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why 3DGS is increasingly replacing NeRF-based approaches and to examine its adoption across different application domains that share common goals of photorealistic rendering, meaningful 3D structure, and accurate downstream tasks.

Method: The survey organizes the review around unified research questions comparing domain-specific pipelines, examining technical advantages, adaptation to different input modalities, and remaining limitations of 3DGS.

Result: The analysis shows that 3DGS effectively balances photorealism, geometric fidelity, and computational efficiency, making it suitable for various applications beyond image synthesis including perception, interaction, and content creation.

Conclusion: 3DGS offers a roadmap for leveraging neural rendering across real and virtual environments, demonstrating its superiority over NeRF in balancing multiple performance metrics while supporting diverse applications.

Abstract: Neural scene representations such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have transformed how 3D environments are modeled,
rendered, and interpreted. NeRF introduced view-consistent photorealism via
volumetric rendering; 3DGS has rapidly emerged as an explicit, efficient
alternative that supports high-quality rendering, faster optimization, and
integration into hybrid pipelines for enhanced photorealism and task-driven
scene understanding. This survey examines how 3DGS is being adopted across
SLAM, telepresence and teleoperation, robotic manipulation, and 3D content
generation. Despite their differences, these domains share common goals:
photorealistic rendering, meaningful 3D structure, and accurate downstream
tasks. We organize the review around unified research questions that explain
why 3DGS is increasingly displacing NeRF-based approaches: What technical
advantages drive its adoption? How does it adapt to different input modalities
and domain-specific constraints? What limitations remain? By systematically
comparing domain-specific pipelines, we show that 3DGS balances photorealism,
geometric fidelity, and computational efficiency. The survey offers a roadmap
for leveraging neural rendering not only for image synthesis but also for
perception, interaction, and content creation across real and virtual
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pancreatic diseases show regional heterogeneity (cancers in head, chronic pancreatitis in tail), requiring accurate part segmentation for diagnosis and treatment planning. Challenges include variable morphology, poor soft-tissue contrast in MRI, and data scarcity.

Method: Privacy-preserving FL framework with evaluation of three segmentation architectures (U-Net, Attention U-Net, Swin UNETR) paired with two FL algorithms (FedAvg, FedProx), plus novel anatomically-informed loss function for region-specific texture contrasts.

Result: Attention U-Net with FedAvg identified as optimal for pancreatic heterogeneity. Approach achieves clinically viable performance despite distributed, heterogeneous datasets.

Conclusion: Successfully addresses pancreas part segmentation challenges in MRI through federated learning, enabling collaborative training without data sharing while handling anatomical variations and regional heterogeneity.

Abstract: We present the first federated learning (FL) approach for pancreas part(head,
body and tail) segmentation in MRI, addressing a critical clinical challenge as
a significant innovation. Pancreatic diseases exhibit marked regional
heterogeneity cancers predominantly occur in the head region while chronic
pancreatitis causes tissue loss in the tail, making accurate segmentation of
the organ into head, body, and tail regions essential for precise diagnosis and
treatment planning. This segmentation task remains exceptionally challenging in
MRI due to variable morphology, poor soft-tissue contrast, and anatomical
variations across patients. Our novel contribution tackles two fundamental
challenges: first, the technical complexity of pancreas part delineation in
MRI, and second the data scarcity problem that has hindered prior approaches.
We introduce a privacy-preserving FL framework that enables collaborative model
training across seven medical institutions without direct data sharing,
leveraging a diverse dataset of 711 T1W and 726 T2W MRI scans. Our key
innovations include: (1) a systematic evaluation of three state-of-the-art
segmentation architectures (U-Net, Attention U-Net,Swin UNETR) paired with two
FL algorithms (FedAvg, FedProx), revealing Attention U-Net with FedAvg as
optimal for pancreatic heterogeneity, which was never been done before; (2) a
novel anatomically-informed loss function prioritizing region-specific texture
contrasts in MRI. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that our approach
achieves clinically viable performance despite training on distributed,
heterogeneous datasets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current brain decoding methods use intermediate image/text features, which mask the contributions of different brain areas. There's a need for more transparent methods that directly link brain signals to image generation.

Method: Proposes NeuroAdapter framework that directly conditions latent diffusion models on brain representations. Uses Image-Brain BI-directional interpretability (IBBI) to analyze cross-attention mechanisms across diffusion denoising steps.

Result: Achieves competitive visual reconstruction quality on fMRI datasets compared to prior work, while providing greater transparency into how brain signals shape the generation process.

Conclusion: Demonstrates potential of end-to-end brain-to-image decoding and establishes path for interpreting diffusion models through visual neuroscience lens.

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that complex visual stimuli can be decoded from
human brain activity using deep generative models, helping brain science
researchers interpret how the brain represents real-world scenes. However, most
current approaches leverage mapping brain signals into intermediate image or
text feature spaces before guiding the generative process, masking the effect
of contributions from different brain areas on the final reconstruction output.
In this work, we propose NeuroAdapter, a visual decoding framework that
directly conditions a latent diffusion model on brain representations,
bypassing the need for intermediate feature spaces. Our method demonstrates
competitive visual reconstruction quality on public fMRI datasets compared to
prior work, while providing greater transparency into how brain signals shape
the generation process. To this end, we contribute an Image-Brain
BI-directional interpretability framework (IBBI) which investigates
cross-attention mechanisms across diffusion denoising steps to reveal how
different cortical areas influence the unfolding generative trajectory. Our
results highlight the potential of end-to-end brain-to-image decoding and
establish a path toward interpreting diffusion models through the lens of
visual neuroscience.

TL;DR: RobuQ is a systematic QAT framework that enables stable sub-4-bit quantization of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) for image generation, achieving state-of-the-art performance with average 2-bit activations on ImageNet-1K.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DiTs show superior performance for image generation but face practical deployment challenges due to high computational and memory costs. Activation quantization is identified as the primary bottleneck for low-bit quantization of DiTs.

Method: Proposes RobuQ framework with: 1) Strong ternary weight baseline (W1.58A4), 2) RobustQuantizer using Hadamard transform to normalize activation distributions, 3) AMPN pipeline applying ternary weights network-wide with layer-specific activation precisions to eliminate bottlenecks.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art DiT quantization performance in sub-4-bit configurations. First to achieve stable and competitive image generation on ImageNet-1K with average 2-bit activations.

Conclusion: RobuQ successfully addresses activation quantization challenges in DiTs, enabling practical deployment of high-performance diffusion models with significantly reduced computational and memory requirements.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently emerged as a powerful backbone
for image generation, demonstrating superior scalability and performance over
U-Net architectures. However, their practical deployment is hindered by
substantial computational and memory costs. While Quantization-Aware Training
(QAT) has shown promise for U-Nets, its application to DiTs faces unique
challenges, primarily due to the sensitivity and distributional complexity of
activations. In this work, we identify activation quantization as the primary
bottleneck for pushing DiTs to extremely low-bit settings. To address this, we
propose a systematic QAT framework for DiTs, named RobuQ. We start by
establishing a strong ternary weight (W1.58A4) DiT baseline. Building upon
this, we propose RobustQuantizer to achieve robust activation quantization. Our
theoretical analyses show that the Hadamard transform can convert unknown
per-token distributions into per-token normal distributions, providing a strong
foundation for this method. Furthermore, we propose AMPN, the first

*Shulian Zhang,Yong Guo,Long Peng,Ziyang Wang,Ye Chen,Wenbo Li,Xiao Zhang,Yulun Zhang,Jian Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VividFace is an efficient one-step diffusion framework for video face enhancement that addresses challenges in facial texture modeling, model generalization, and inference efficiency through flow matching, joint latent-pixel training, and automated data curation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video face enhancement methods face three fundamental challenges: difficulty in modeling intricate facial textures while maintaining temporal consistency, limited model generalization due to lack of high-quality training data, and low efficiency from repeated denoising steps during inference.

Method: Built on pretrained WANX video generation model, VividFace uses single-step flow matching for direct mapping from degraded inputs to high-quality outputs. It employs Joint Latent-Pixel Face-Focused Training with stochastic switching between facial region optimization and global reconstruction, plus an MLLM-driven data curation pipeline for automated dataset selection.

Result: Extensive experiments show VividFace achieves state-of-the-art results in perceptual quality, identity preservation, and temporal stability, while significantly reducing inference time compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: VividFace provides an efficient solution for video face enhancement that overcomes key limitations of existing approaches and offers practical resources for the research community.

Abstract: Video Face Enhancement (VFE) seeks to reconstruct high-quality facial regions
from degraded video sequences, a capability that underpins numerous
applications including video conferencing, film restoration, and surveillance.
Despite substantial progress in the field, current methods that primarily rely
on video super-resolution and generative frameworks continue to face three
fundamental challenges: (1) faithfully modeling intricate facial textures while
preserving temporal consistency; (2) restricted model generalization due to the
lack of high-quality face video training data; and (3) low efficiency caused by
repeated denoising steps during inference. To address these challenges, we
propose VividFace, a novel and efficient one-step diffusion framework for video
face enhancement. Built upon the pretrained WANX video generation model, our
method leverages powerful spatiotemporal priors through a single-step flow
matching paradigm, enabling direct mapping from degraded inputs to high-quality
outputs with significantly reduced inference time. To further boost efficiency,
we propose a Joint Latent-Pixel Face-Focused Training strategy that employs
stochastic switching between facial region optimization and global
reconstruction, providing explicit supervision in both latent and pixel spaces
through a progressive two-stage training process. Additionally, we introduce an
MLLM-driven data curation pipeline for automated selection of high-quality
video face datasets, enhancing model generalization. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that VividFace achieves state-of-the-art results in perceptual
quality, identity preservation, and temporal stability, while offering
practical resources for the research community.

*Chenxi Zhao,Daochang Wang,Siqian Zhang,Gangyao Kuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A simulated data-assisted SAR target recognition method that uses forward scattering center model (FSCM) data instead of simulated images to transfer purer target knowledge through multi-level heterogeneous knowledge transfer network.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the problem of limited samples in SAR target recognition by migrating purer and more relevant target knowledge, avoiding the irrelevant information (background, noise) in traditional simulated images that affects migration quality.

Method: Proposed MHKT network with three modules: task-associated information selector (TAIS) for feature-level migration, target generic knowledge transfer (TGKT) with MDD metric for distribution alignment, and category relation knowledge transfer (CRKT) for category-level consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments on two new datasets combining FSCM data and measured SAR images demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The stepwise knowledge selection and migration approach using FSCM data effectively transfers purer target knowledge and achieves better SAR target recognition performance while maintaining physical meaning and interpretability.

Abstract: Simulated data-assisted SAR target recognition methods are the research
hotspot currently, devoted to solving the problem of limited samples. Existing
works revolve around simulated images, but the large amount of irrelevant
information embedded in the images, such as background, noise, etc., seriously
affects the quality of the migrated information. Our work explores a new
simulated data to migrate purer and key target knowledge, i.e., forward
scattering center model (FSCM) which models the actual local structure of the
target with strong physical meaning and interpretability. To achieve this
purpose, multi-level heterogeneous knowledge transfer (MHKT) network is
proposed, which fully migrates FSCM knowledge from the feature, distribution
and category levels, respectively. Specifically, we permit the more suitable
feature representations for the heterogeneous data and separate non-informative
knowledge by task-associated information selector (TAIS), to complete purer
target feature migration. In the distribution alignment, the new metric
function maximum discrimination divergence (MDD) in target generic knowledge
transfer (TGKT) module perceives transferable knowledge efficiently while
preserving discriminative structure about classes. Moreover, category relation
knowledge transfer (CRKT) module leverages the category relation consistency
constraint to break the dilemma of optimization bias towards simulation data
due to imbalance between simulated and measured data. Such stepwise knowledge
selection and migration will ensure the integrity of the migrated FSCM
knowledge. Notably, extensive experiments on two new datasets formed by FSCM
data and measured SAR images demonstrate the superior performance of our
method.

TL;DR: VAMamba is a Visual Adaptive Mamba framework that overcomes limitations of fixed scanning patterns and inefficient feature utilization in Mamba-based image restoration through two innovations: QCLAM for dynamic feature reuse and GPS-SS2D for adaptive scanning paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent Mamba-based image restoration methods are limited by fixed scanning patterns that cannot adapt to diverse degradations, constraining both restoration performance and computational efficiency.

Method: Proposes VAMamba with two key components: 1) QCLAM (Queue-based Cache Low-rank Adaptive Memory) that uses a FIFO cache to store historical representations and enables intelligent feature fusion, 2) GPS-SS2D (Greedy Path Scan SS2D) that uses a Vision Transformer to generate score maps for pixel importance and employs greedy strategy for optimal scanning paths.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse restoration tasks demonstrate that VAMamba consistently outperforms existing approaches in both restoration quality and efficiency, establishing new benchmarks for adaptive image restoration.

Conclusion: VAMamba successfully addresses the limitations of conventional Mamba architectures by enabling adaptive feature utilization and scanning patterns, achieving superior performance in image restoration tasks while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Recent Mamba-based image restoration methods have achieved promising results
but remain
  limited by fixed scanning patterns and inefficient feature utilization.
Conventional Mamba
  architectures rely on predetermined paths that cannot adapt to diverse
degradations, constraining
  both restoration performance and computational efficiency. To overcome these
limitations, we
  propose VAMamba, a Visual Adaptive Mamba framework with two key innovations.
First,
  QCLAM(Queue-basedCacheLow-rankAdaptiveMemory)enhancesfeaturelearningthrougha
  FIFO cache that stores historical representations. Similarity between current
LoRA-adapted and
  cached features guides intelligent fusion, enabling dynamic reuse while
effectively controlling
  memorygrowth.Second, GPS-SS2D(GreedyPathScanSS2D)introducesadaptive scanning.
A
  Vision Transformer generates score maps to estimate pixel importance, and a
greedy strategy de termines optimal forward and backward scanning paths. These
learned trajectories replace rigid
  patterns, enabling SS2D to perform targeted feature extraction. The
integration of QCLAM and
  GPS-SS2D allows VAMamba to adaptively focus on degraded regions while
maintaining high
  computational efficiency. Extensive experiments across diverse restoration
tasks demonstrate
  that VAMamba consistently outperforms existing approaches in both restoration
quality and
  efficiency, establishing new benchmarks for adaptive image restoration. Our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in current deep hierarchical clustering methods that tie structure to class numbers and underutilize prototype information at intermediate hierarchical levels, inspired by human ability to organize knowledge into hierarchical taxonomies with prototypes.

Method: Optimizes a large latent taxonomic hierarchy using complete binary tree structured mixture-of-Gaussian prior within variational inference framework to automatically discover taxonomic structures and prototype clusters from unlabeled data.

Result: Empirically demonstrates strong hierarchical clustering performance, outperforming baselines across diverse image classification datasets using novel evaluation mechanism that leverages prototype clusters at all hierarchical levels.

Conclusion: Deep taxonomic networks discover rich and interpretable hierarchical taxonomies capturing both coarse-grained semantic categories and fine-grained visual distinctions, with analytical proof that ELBO optimization encourages discovery of hierarchical relationships among prototypes.

Abstract: Inspired by the human ability to learn and organize knowledge into
hierarchical taxonomies with prototypes, this paper addresses key limitations
in current deep hierarchical clustering methods. Existing methods often tie the
structure to the number of classes and underutilize the rich prototype
information available at intermediate hierarchical levels. We introduce deep
taxonomic networks, a novel deep latent variable approach designed to bridge
these gaps. Our method optimizes a large latent taxonomic hierarchy,
specifically a complete binary tree structured mixture-of-Gaussian prior within
a variational inference framework, to automatically discover taxonomic
structures and associated prototype clusters directly from unlabeled data
without assuming true label sizes. We analytically show that optimizing the
ELBO of our method encourages the discovery of hierarchical relationships among
prototypes. Empirically, our learned models demonstrate strong hierarchical
clustering performance, outperforming baselines across diverse image
classification datasets using our novel evaluation mechanism that leverages
prototype clusters discovered at all hierarchical levels. Qualitative results
further reveal that deep taxonomic networks discover rich and interpretable
hierarchical taxonomies, capturing both coarse-grained semantic categories and
fine-grained visual distinctions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models provide high-quality LDCT denoising but have extreme computational costs that prevent clinical adoption, with inference times often exceeding thousands of seconds per scan.

Method: Uses a latent diffusion approach with a perceptually-optimized autoencoder to operate in compressed latent space, enabling fast deterministic conditional denoising with an attention-based conditional U-Net.

Result: Achieves superior perceptual quality surpassing CNN/GAN methods and rivals reconstruction fidelity of heavy diffusion models like DDPM and Dn-Dp, while being 60x faster than pixel-space diffusion denoisers and remaining competitive on PSNR/SSIM scores.

Conclusion: Bridges the gap between high fidelity and clinical viability, demonstrating a practical path forward for advanced generative models in medical imaging.

Abstract: While diffusion models have set a new benchmark for quality in Low-Dose
Computed Tomography (LDCT) denoising, their clinical adoption is critically
hindered by extreme computational costs, with inference times often exceeding
thousands of seconds per scan. To overcome this barrier, we introduce MAN, a
Latent Diffusion Enhanced Multistage Anti-Noise Network for Efficient and
High-Quality Low-Dose CT Image Denoising task. Our method operates in a
compressed latent space via a perceptually-optimized autoencoder, enabling an
attention-based conditional U-Net to perform the fast, deterministic
conditional denoising diffusion process with drastically reduced overhead. On
the LDCT and Projection dataset, our model achieves superior perceptual
quality, surpassing CNN/GAN-based methods while rivaling the reconstruction
fidelity of computationally heavy diffusion models like DDPM and Dn-Dp. Most
critically, in the inference stage, our model is over 60x faster than
representative pixel space diffusion denoisers, while remaining competitive on
PSNR/SSIM scores. By bridging the gap between high fidelity and clinical
viability, our work demonstrates a practical path forward for advanced

TL;DR: VMDiff is a diffusion-based framework that fuses two input images into a single coherent object by combining hybrid sampling and adaptive adjustment to overcome coexistent generation and semantic bias issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the underexplored problem of fusing visual cues from multiple sources for image generation, particularly overcoming coexistent generation (simple juxtaposition) and bias generation (one object dominating) in existing methods.

Method: Proposes Visual Mixing Diffusion (VMDiff) with: (1) hybrid sampling combining guided denoising, inversion, and spherical interpolation for structure-aware fusion; (2) adaptive adjustment module with similarity-based score to automatically find optimal parameters.

Result: Experiments on 780 concept pairs show VMDiff outperforms baselines in visual quality, semantic consistency, and human-rated creativity.

Conclusion: VMDiff effectively addresses coexistent and bias generation challenges in multi-source image fusion through its hybrid sampling and adaptive parameter adjustment approach.

Abstract: Creating novel images by fusing visual cues from multiple sources is a
fundamental yet underexplored problem in image-to-image generation, with broad
applications in artistic creation, virtual reality and visual media. Existing
methods often face two key challenges: coexistent generation, where multiple
objects are simply juxtaposed without true integration, and bias generation,
where one object dominates the output due to semantic imbalance. To address
these issues, we propose Visual Mixing Diffusion (VMDiff), a simple yet
effective diffusion-based framework that synthesizes a single, coherent object
by integrating two input images at both noise and latent levels. Our approach
comprises: (1) a hybrid sampling process that combines guided denoising,
inversion, and spherical interpolation with adjustable parameters to achieve
structure-aware fusion, mitigating coexistent generation; and (2) an efficient
adaptive adjustment module, which introduces a novel similarity-based score to
automatically and adaptively search for optimal parameters, countering semantic
bias. Experiments on a curated benchmark of 780 concept pairs demonstrate that
our method outperforms strong baselines in visual quality, semantic
consistency, and human-rated creativity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlowLUT is an end-to-end image enhancement model that combines the efficiency of 3D LUTs with flow matching to address the trade-off between computational efficiency and representational capacity in deep learning-based image enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the fundamental trade-off between computational efficiency and representational capacity in deep learning-based image enhancement methods, where conventional 3D LUTs lack representational flexibility and depend solely on fixed priors.

Method: Integrates differentiable 3D LUTs with different priors, uses lightweight content-aware fusion prediction for scene-adaptive color correction with O(1) complexity, and employs iterative flow matching to restore local structural details and eliminate artifacts.

Result: Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method on three benchmarks, achieving both computational efficiency and enhanced representational capacity.

Conclusion: FlowLUT successfully addresses the efficiency-representation trade-off in image enhancement by combining the strengths of LUTs with flow matching, enabling real-time processing while maintaining high-quality enhancement capabilities.

Abstract: Deep learning-based image enhancement methods face a fundamental trade-off
between computational efficiency and representational capacity. For example,
although a conventional three-dimensional Look-Up Table (3D LUT) can process a
degraded image in real time, it lacks representational flexibility and depends
solely on a fixed prior. To address this problem, we introduce FlowLUT, a novel
end-to-end model that integrates the efficiency of LUTs, multiple priors, and
the parameter-independent characteristic of flow-matched reconstructed images.
Specifically, firstly, the input image is transformed in color space by a
collection of differentiable 3D LUTs (containing a large number of 3D LUTs with
different priors). Subsequently, a lightweight content-aware dynamically
predicts fusion weights, enabling scene-adaptive color correction with
$\mathcal{O}(1)$ complexity. Next, a lightweight fusion prediction network runs
on multiple 3D LUTs, with $\mathcal{O}(1)$ complexity for scene-adaptive color
correction.Furthermore, to address the inherent representation limitations of
LUTs, we design an innovative iterative flow matching method to restore local
structural details and eliminate artifacts. Finally, the entire model is
jointly optimized under a composite loss function enforcing perceptual and
structural fidelity. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on three benchmarks.

*Xinhao Cai,Minghang Zheng,Xin Jin,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel pipeline for text-controlled human-object interaction generation in 3D scenes with movable objects, addressing challenges of object identification, diverse interaction patterns, and collision avoidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing human-scene interaction datasets have limited interaction categories and only consider static objects. Collecting datasets with movable objects is difficult and costly, creating a need for automated generation methods.

Method: Three-stage pipeline: 1) 3D visual grounding to identify interaction objects, 2) hand-object joint affordance learning for contact region prediction, 3) optimization with local-scene modeling and collision avoidance constraints.

Result: The method generates physically plausible, text-compliant interactions and outperforms existing approaches in comprehensive experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses the challenging task of movable human-object interaction generation in 3D scenes, enabling accurate object manipulation while avoiding collisions.

Abstract: We propose a novel task of text-controlled human object interaction
generation in 3D scenes with movable objects. Existing human-scene interaction
datasets suffer from insufficient interaction categories and typically only
consider interactions with static objects (do not change object positions), and
the collection of such datasets with movable objects is difficult and costly.
To address this problem, we construct the InteractMove dataset for Movable
Human-Object Interaction in 3D Scenes by aligning existing human object
interaction data with scene contexts, featuring three key characteristics: 1)
scenes containing multiple movable objects with text-controlled interaction
specifications (including same-category distractors requiring spatial and 3D
scene context understanding), 2) diverse object types and sizes with varied
interaction patterns (one-hand, two-hand, etc.), and 3) physically plausible
object manipulation trajectories. With the introduction of various movable
objects, this task becomes more challenging, as the model needs to identify
objects to be interacted with accurately, learn to interact with objects of
different sizes and categories, and avoid collisions between movable objects
and the scene. To tackle such challenges, we propose a novel pipeline solution.
We first use 3D visual grounding models to identify the interaction object.
Then, we propose a hand-object joint affordance learning to predict contact
regions for different hand joints and object parts, enabling accurate grasping
and manipulation of diverse objects. Finally, we optimize interactions with
local-scene modeling and collision avoidance constraints, ensuring physically
plausible motions and avoiding collisions between objects and the scene.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate our method's superiority in generating
physically plausible, text-compliant interactions compared to existing
approaches.

Motivation: Current vessel segmentation approaches rely on supervised learning and extensive manual annotations, which are costly, error-prone, and difficult to obtain in optical coherence tomography angiography.

Method: Unsupervised generative framework that integrates vessel biostatistics with adversarial refinement and a radius-guided segmentation strategy, directly modeling vascular structures with biostatistical coherence.

Result: Achieves near-perfect segmentation accuracy across RetinaMix and existing datasets, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art supervised and semi-supervised methods.

Conclusion: BioVessel-Net and RetinaMix provide a label-free, computationally efficient, and clinically interpretable solution for retinal vessel analysis, with broad potential for glaucoma monitoring, blood flow modeling, and progression prediction.

Abstract: Structural changes in retinal blood vessels are critical biomarkers for the
onset and progression of glaucoma and other ocular diseases. However, current
vessel segmentation approaches largely rely on supervised learning and
extensive manual annotations, which are costly, error-prone, and difficult to
obtain in optical coherence tomography angiography. Here we present
BioVessel-Net, an unsupervised generative framework that integrates vessel
biostatistics with adversarial refinement and a radius-guided segmentation
strategy. Unlike pixel-based methods, BioVessel-Net directly models vascular
structures with biostatistical coherence, achieving accurate and explainable
vessel extraction without labeled data or high-performance computing. To
support training and evaluation, we introduce RetinaMix, a new benchmark
dataset of 2D and 3D OCTA images with high-resolution vessel details from
diverse populations. Experimental results demonstrate that BioVessel-Net
achieves near-perfect segmentation accuracy across RetinaMix and existing
datasets, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art supervised and
semi-supervised methods. Together, BioVessel-Net and RetinaMix provide a

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffInk is a latent diffusion Transformer framework for full-line handwriting generation that outperforms existing methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-online handwriting generation methods focus on character- or word-level generation, leading to inefficiency and lack of holistic structural modeling for full text lines.

Method: Proposes DiffInk with two main components: InkVAE (sequential variational autoencoder with OCR-based and style-classification losses) and InkDiT (latent diffusion Transformer that integrates text and style references).

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both glyph accuracy and style fidelity while significantly improving generation efficiency.

Conclusion: DiffInk successfully addresses full-line handwriting generation with better disentanglement of character content and writing styles.

Abstract: Deep generative models have advanced text-to-online handwriting generation
(TOHG), which aims to synthesize realistic pen trajectories conditioned on
textual input and style references. However, most existing methods still
primarily focus on character- or word-level generation, resulting in
inefficiency and a lack of holistic structural modeling when applied to full
text lines. To address these issues, we propose DiffInk, the first latent
diffusion Transformer framework for full-line handwriting generation. We first
introduce InkVAE, a novel sequential variational autoencoder enhanced with two
complementary latent-space regularization losses: (1) an OCR-based loss
enforcing glyph-level accuracy, and (2) a style-classification loss preserving
writing style. This dual regularization yields a semantically structured latent
space where character content and writer styles are effectively disentangled.
We then introduce InkDiT, a novel latent diffusion Transformer that integrates
target text and reference styles to generate coherent pen trajectories.
Experimental results demonstrate that DiffInk outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods in both glyph accuracy and style fidelity, while
significantly improving generation efficiency. Code will be made publicly
available.

TL;DR: RIV introduces self-correction capability to Mask Diffusion-based Vision Language Models through Introspection Training and Recursive Inference, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MDVLMs lack self-correction ability and cannot correct errors in generated tokens, limiting their reliability and accuracy.

Method: Two novel mechanisms: 1) Introspection Training with an Introspection Model to identify grammatical, spelling, and logical errors; 2) Recursive Inference with alternating unmask→introspection→remask process until reliable results are obtained.

Result: Experimental results on multiple benchmarks show RIV achieves state-of-the-art performance and outperforms most existing MDVLMs.

Conclusion: RIV successfully equips MDVLMs with self-correction capability through recursive introspection, significantly improving model reliability and performance.

Abstract: Mask Diffusion-based Vision Language Models (MDVLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in multimodal understanding tasks. However, these models are unable to
correct errors in generated tokens, meaning they lack self-correction
capability. In this paper, we propose Recursive Introspection Mask Diffusion
Vision Language Model (RIV), which equips the model with self-correction
ability through two novel mechanisms. The first is Introspection Training,
where an Introspection Model is introduced to identify errors within generated
sequences. Introspection Training enables the model to detect not only
grammatical and spelling mistakes, but more importantly, logical errors. The
second is Recursive Inference. Beginning with the standard unmasking step, the
learned Introspection Model helps to identify errors in the output sequence and
remask them. This alternating
($\text{unmask}\rightarrow\text{introspection}\rightarrow\text{remask}$)
process is repeated recursively until reliable results are obtained.
Experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed RIV
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming most existing MDVLMs.

Motivation: Multi-task dense prediction suffers from domain shift in robotics applications, and existing multi-task UDA methods relying on adversarial learning are less effective than recent self-training techniques.

Method: Leverages Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) as teachers in a self-training paradigm to generate high-quality pseudo-labels for target domains, distilling their capabilities into a single efficient student network.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic-to-real UDA benchmarks and day-to-night adaptation tasks, with lightweight variants being 10x smaller than foundation models while maintaining SOTA accuracy.

Conclusion: FAMDA enables training of highly efficient, domain-adaptive models suitable for resource-constrained robotics applications by effectively bridging the gap in multi-task UDA through foundation model distillation.

Abstract: Multi-task dense prediction, which aims to jointly solve tasks like semantic
segmentation and depth estimation, is crucial for robotics applications but
suffers from domain shift when deploying models in new environments. While
unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) addresses this challenge for single tasks,
existing multi-task UDA methods primarily rely on adversarial learning
approaches that are less effective than recent self-training techniques. In
this paper, we introduce FAMDA, a simple yet effective UDA framework that
bridges this gap by leveraging Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) as powerful
teachers. Our approach integrates Segmentation and Depth foundation models into
a self-training paradigm to generate high-quality pseudo-labels for the target
domain, effectively distilling their robust generalization capabilities into a
single, efficient student network. Extensive experiments show that FAMDA
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on standard synthetic-to-real UDA
multi-task learning (MTL) benchmarks and a challenging new day-to-night
adaptation task. Our framework enables the training of highly efficient models;
a lightweight variant achieves SOTA accuracy while being more than 10$\times$
smaller than foundation models, highlighting FAMDA's suitability for creating
domain-adaptive and efficient models for resource-constrained robotics
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a comprehensive framework that leverages LLMs' capabilities for human motion tasks across different scenarios while addressing challenges in motion representation, computational efficiency, and modality interference.

Method: Uses motion tokenizer with residual quantization to convert motion sequences into multi-stream discrete tokens, implements Delay Parallel Modeling for staggered encoding of token streams, and employs dual-tower architecture with modality-specific parameters.

Result: The framework demonstrates superior performance across various motion-relevant tasks, with comprehensive ablation studies validating the effectiveness of each component.

Conclusion: MotionVerse successfully integrates LLMs for comprehensive motion understanding and generation, with its components effectively addressing key challenges in motion representation and modality integration.

Abstract: This paper proposes MotionVerse, a unified framework that harnesses the
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to comprehend, generate, and edit
human motion in both single-person and multi-person scenarios. To efficiently
represent motion data, we employ a motion tokenizer with residual quantization,
which converts continuous motion sequences into multi-stream discrete tokens.
Furthermore, we introduce a \textit{Delay Parallel} Modeling strategy, which
temporally staggers the encoding of residual token streams. This design enables
LLMs to effectively capture inter-stream dependencies while maintaining
computational efficiency comparable to single-stream modeling. Moreover, to
alleviate modality interference between motion and language, we design a
\textit{dual-tower architecture} with modality-specific parameters, ensuring
stable integration of motion information for both comprehension and generation
tasks. Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of each
component in MotionVerse, and extensive experiments showcase its superior
performance across a wide range of motion-relevant tasks.

*Boyu Han,Qianqian Xu,Shilong Bao,Zhiyong Yang,Kangli Zi,Qingming Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LightFair is a lightweight approach that improves fairness in text-to-image diffusion models by fine-tuning text embeddings with distance-constrained debiasing and two-stage sampling, achieving state-of-the-art results with minimal training and sampling overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for fair T2I DMs either require full-parameter training or use auxiliary networks, which are computationally expensive and perform poorly. Since the text encoder is the most fine-tunable front-end module, this paper aims to mitigate bias by focusing on text embeddings.

Method: Proposes collaborative distance-constrained debiasing strategy to balance embedding distances for fairness, and a two-stage text-guided sampling strategy to limit debiased text encoder intervention while maintaining generation quality.

Result: Extensive experiments show LightFair is effective and efficient, achieving SOTA debiasing on Stable Diffusion v1.5 with only 1/4 of the training burden and virtually no increase in sampling burden.

Conclusion: LightFair provides a lightweight yet powerful solution for fair text-to-image generation by addressing text encoder bias through embedding fine-tuning and strategic sampling, offering superior performance with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: This paper explores a novel lightweight approach LightFair to achieve fair
text-to-image diffusion models (T2I DMs) by addressing the adverse effects of
the text encoder. Most existing methods either couple different parts of the
diffusion model for full-parameter training or rely on auxiliary networks for
correction. They incur heavy training or sampling burden and unsatisfactory
performance. Since T2I DMs consist of multiple components, with the text
encoder being the most fine-tunable and front-end module, this paper focuses on
mitigating bias by fine-tuning text embeddings. To validate feasibility, we
observe that the text encoder's neutral embedding output shows substantial
skewness across image embeddings of various attributes in the CLIP space. More
importantly, the noise prediction network further amplifies this imbalance. To
finetune the text embedding, we propose a collaborative distance-constrained
debiasing strategy that balances embedding distances to improve fairness
without auxiliary references. However, mitigating bias can compromise the
original generation quality. To address this, we introduce a two-stage
text-guided sampling strategy to limit when the debiased text encoder
intervenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LightFair is effective and
efficient. Notably, on Stable Diffusion v1.5, our method achieves SOTA
debiasing at just $1/4$ of the training burden, with virtually no increase in
sampling burden. The code is available at https://github.com/boyuh/LightFair.

*Chengying She,Ben Wang,Xinran Zhang,Dongjie Fan,Jialu Zhang,Chengwei Chen,Lizhuang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EfficientMIL is a linear-complexity multiple instance learning approach for whole slide image classification that replaces quadratic self-attention with efficient sequence models (GRU, LSTM, Mamba) and includes an Adaptive Patch Selector, achieving SOTA performance with significantly reduced computational requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SOTA MIL methods for WSI classification rely on attention mechanisms with quadratic complexity, creating computational bottlenecks when processing hundreds of thousands of patches, which limits practical deployment.

Method: Proposed EfficientMIL framework with Adaptive Patch Selector (APS) for patch selection, replacing Transformer self-attention with linear-complexity sequence models including GRU, LSTM, and SSM Mamba.

Result: Achieved AUC of 0.976/accuracy 0.933 on TCGA-Lung with EfficientMIL-Mamba, and AUC 0.990/accuracy 0.975 on CAMELYON16 with EfficientMIL-GRU, outperforming previous SOTA methods while significantly improving computational efficiency.

Conclusion: EfficientMIL demonstrates that linear-complexity sequence models can effectively replace quadratic attention mechanisms in MIL for WSI classification, achieving superior performance with dramatically reduced computational requirements.

Abstract: Whole slide images (WSIs) classification represents a fundamental challenge
in computational pathology, where multiple instance learning (MIL) has emerged
as the dominant paradigm. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) MIL methods rely on
attention mechanisms, achieving good performance but requiring substantial
computational resources due to quadratic complexity when processing hundreds of
thousands of patches. To address this computational bottleneck, we introduce
EfficientMIL, a novel linear-complexity MIL approach for WSIs classification
with the patches selection module Adaptive Patch Selector (APS) that we
designed, replacing the quadratic-complexity self-attention mechanisms in
Transformer-based MIL methods with efficient sequence models including
RNN-based GRU, LSTM, and State Space Model (SSM) Mamba. EfficientMIL achieves
significant computational efficiency improvements while outperforming other MIL
methods across multiple histopathology datasets. On TCGA-Lung dataset,
EfficientMIL-Mamba achieved AUC of 0.976 and accuracy of 0.933, while on
CAMELYON16 dataset, EfficientMIL-GRU achieved AUC of 0.990 and accuracy of
0.975, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that APS is also more effective for patches selection than
conventional selection strategies.

*Yixiao Chen,Ruining Yang,Xin Chen,Jia He,Dongliang Xu,Yue Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Survey of topology-aware perception in autonomous driving, covering vectorized map construction, topological structure modeling, prior knowledge fusion, and language model-based perception, highlighting a shift from static maps to dynamic sensor-driven approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional static maps are costly, hard to update in real-time, and lack generalization across regions, limiting scalability for autonomous driving systems.

Method: Systematic review of four core research directions: vectorized map construction, topological structure modeling, prior knowledge fusion, and language model-based perception.

Result: Identified a unifying trend of paradigm shift from static pre-built maps to dynamic sensor-driven perception that enables real-time map construction and topology reasoning.

Conclusion: These approaches collectively enable more adaptive, scalable, and explainable autonomous driving systems through compact spatial modeling, semantic relational reasoning, robust domain knowledge integration, and multimodal scene understanding.

Abstract: The key to achieving autonomous driving lies in topology-aware perception,
the structured understanding of the driving environment with an emphasis on
lane topology and road semantics. This survey systematically reviews four core
research directions under this theme: vectorized map construction, topological
structure modeling, prior knowledge fusion, and language model-based
perception. Across these directions, we observe a unifying trend: a paradigm
shift from static, pre-built maps to dynamic, sensor-driven perception.
Specifically, traditional static maps have provided semantic context for
autonomous systems. However, they are costly to construct, difficult to update
in real time, and lack generalization across regions, limiting their
scalability. In contrast, dynamic representations leverage on-board sensor data
for real-time map construction and topology reasoning. Each of the four
research directions contributes to this shift through compact spatial modeling,
semantic relational reasoning, robust domain knowledge integration, and
multimodal scene understanding powered by pre-trained language models.
Together, they pave the way for more adaptive, scalable, and explainable
autonomous driving systems.

*Aryan Mikaeili,Amirhossein Alimohammadi,Negar Hassanpour,Ali Mahdavi-Amiri,Andrea Tagliasacchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free method for multi-image layout control that uses images instead of text to specify content placement, enabling precise object and part-level composition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image models provide realistic images but lack precise control over content placement. More explicit guidance is needed for defining both content and its exact positioning within images.

Method: Training-free approach that uses single images as references for content specification and provides explicit control over object placement and part-level composition without requiring model retraining.

Result: The method effectively handles various image composition tasks, demonstrating successful multi-image layout control with precise placement guidance.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enables finer control over image generation by using visual references for content specification and explicit placement guidance, overcoming limitations of text-only control.

Abstract: Text-to-image models have achieved a level of realism that enables the
generation of highly convincing images. However, text-based control can be a
limiting factor when more explicit guidance is needed. Defining both the
content and its precise placement within an image is crucial for achieving
finer control. In this work, we address the challenge of multi-image layout
control, where the desired content is specified through images rather than
text, and the model is guided on where to place each element. Our approach is
training-free, requires a single image per reference, and provides explicit and
simple control for object and part-level composition. We demonstrate its
effectiveness across various image composition tasks.

*Lu Xiao,Jiale Zhang,Yang Liu,Taicheng Huang,Xin Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sparse-Up is a memory-efficient 3D texture modeling framework that preserves high-frequency details using sparse voxels, surface anchoring, and view-domain partitioning to overcome resolution constraints while maintaining multi-view consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D asset creation methods face a trade-off between cross-view consistency and high-frequency detail preservation, often resulting in torn textures or limited by voxel resolution constraints.

Method: Uses sparse voxels for texture reconstruction with surface anchoring (learnable upsampling to eliminate redundant voxels) and view-domain partitioning (image patch-guided voxel partitioning with local gradient supervision).

Result: Eliminates over 70% of redundant voxels, significantly reduces memory consumption during high-resolution training, and preserves high-frequency texture details while maintaining geometric consistency.

Conclusion: Sparse-Up provides an effective solution for high-fidelity 3D texture modeling that breaks through traditional resolution limitations while being memory-efficient.

Abstract: The creation of high-fidelity 3D assets is often hindered by a 'pixel-level
pain point': the loss of high-frequency details. Existing methods often trade
off one aspect for another: either sacrificing cross-view consistency,
resulting in torn or drifting textures, or remaining trapped by the resolution
ceiling of explicit voxels, forfeiting fine texture detail. In this work, we
propose Sparse-Up, a memory-efficient, high-fidelity texture modeling framework
that effectively preserves high-frequency details. We use sparse voxels to
guide texture reconstruction and ensure multi-view consistency, while
leveraging surface anchoring and view-domain partitioning to break through
resolution constraints. Surface anchoring employs a learnable upsampling
strategy to constrain voxels to the mesh surface, eliminating over 70% of
redundant voxels present in traditional voxel upsampling. View-domain
partitioning introduces an image patch-guided voxel partitioning scheme,
supervising and back-propagating gradients only on visible local patches.
Through these two strategies, we can significantly reduce memory consumption
during high-resolution voxel training without sacrificing geometric
consistency, while preserving high-frequency details in textures.

TL;DR: A unified framework for robust 6D pose estimation that combines initial pose estimation with fast motion-based tracking using shared lighting-invariant color-pair features, designed for efficient edge device execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of robust 6D pose estimation under challenging illumination conditions while maintaining the trade-off between accurate initial pose estimation and efficient real-time tracking, particularly for edge devices.

Method: Uses a shared lighting-invariant color-pair feature representation that serves both initial pose estimation (via robust registration between RGB-D view and 3D mesh) and tracking (via temporal correspondence validation with lightweight motion regression).

Result: Extensive experiments show the integrated approach is effective and robust, providing competitive pose estimation accuracy while maintaining high-fidelity tracking even through abrupt pose changes.

Conclusion: The unified framework successfully addresses the 6D pose estimation challenge by leveraging shared lighting-invariant features for both initial estimation and tracking, enabling efficient performance on edge devices with robust handling of illumination variations and abrupt pose changes.

Abstract: Robust 6D pose estimation of novel objects under challenging illumination
remains a significant challenge, often requiring a trade-off between accurate
initial pose estimation and efficient real-time tracking. We present a unified
framework explicitly designed for efficient execution on edge devices, which
synergizes a robust initial estimation module with a fast motion-based tracker.
The key to our approach is a shared, lighting-invariant color-pair feature
representation that forms a consistent foundation for both stages. For initial
estimation, this feature facilitates robust registration between the live RGB-D
view and the object's 3D mesh. For tracking, the same feature logic validates
temporal correspondences, enabling a lightweight model to reliably regress the
object's motion. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
our integrated approach is both effective and robust, providing competitive
pose estimation accuracy while maintaining high-fidelity tracking even through
abrupt pose changes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReWatch addresses the video reasoning gap in LVLMs by creating a large-scale dataset with multi-stage synthesis and a Multi-Agent ReAct framework for CoT generation, leading to state-of-the-art performance on video reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR methods are underdeveloped for complex video reasoning due to data bottlenecks - lack of challenging multi-hop questions and high-quality video-grounded Chain-of-Thought data.

Method: Introduced ReWatch dataset with multi-stage synthesis pipeline (ReWatch-Caption, ReWatch-QA, ReWatch-CoT) using Multi-Agent ReAct framework for CoT synthesis. Developed ReWatch-R1 model with SFT and RLVR framework featuring novel Observation & Reasoning reward mechanism.

Result: ReWatch-R1 achieves state-of-the-art average performance on five challenging video reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed dataset and framework successfully bridge the video reasoning gap in LVLMs by addressing data limitations and incorporating effective reward mechanisms against hallucination.

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) significantly
advances image reasoning in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), its
application to complex video reasoning remains underdeveloped. This gap stems
primarily from a critical data bottleneck: existing datasets lack the
challenging, multi-hop questions and high-quality, video-grounded
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data necessary to effectively bootstrap RLVR. To address
this, we introduce ReWatch, a large-scale dataset built to foster advanced
video reasoning. We propose a novel multi-stage synthesis pipeline to
synthesize its three components: ReWatch-Caption, ReWatch-QA, and ReWatch-CoT.
A core innovation is our Multi-Agent ReAct framework for CoT synthesis, which
simulates a human-like "re-watching" process to generate video-grounded
reasoning traces by explicitly modeling information retrieval and verification.
Building on this dataset, we develop ReWatch-R1 by post-training a strong
baseline LVLM with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and our RLVR framework. This
framework incorporates a novel Observation \& Reasoning (O\&R) reward mechanism
that evaluates both the final answer's correctness and the reasoning's
alignment with video content, directly penalizing hallucination. Our
experiments show that ReWatch-R1 achieves state-of-the-art average performance
on five challenging video reasoning benchmarks.

*Jingqi Xu,Jingxi Lu,Chenghao Li,Sreetama Sarkar,Peter A. Beerel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HIVTP is a training-free hierarchical visual token pruning method that improves Vision-Language Models efficiency by using middle-layer attention maps to identify and retain important visual tokens, reducing inference time without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models suffer from inefficient inference due to the large number of visual tokens output by vision encoders, many of which are unnecessary and can be pruned to improve efficiency.

Method: Uses middle-layer attention maps from vision encoder to estimate token importance, then applies hierarchical pruning: global stage retains important tokens per region, local stage retains most important token per window in 2D spatial layout.

Result: Reduces TTFT by up to 50.0% for LLaVA-v1.5-7B and 55.1% for LLaVA-Next-7B, improves token generation throughput by up to 60.9% and 47.3%, maintains or improves accuracy on benchmarks.

Conclusion: HIVTP achieves superior accuracy and higher inference efficiency compared to prior works, demonstrating effective training-free visual token pruning for VLMs.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong capabilities on diverse
multimodal tasks. However, the large number of visual tokens output by the
vision encoder severely hinders inference efficiency, and prior studies have
shown that many of these tokens are not important and can therefore be safely
pruned. In this work, we propose HIVTP, a training-free method to improve VLMs
efficiency via hierarchical visual token pruning using a novel
middle-layer-based importance score. Specifically, we utilize attention maps
extracted from the middle layers of the vision encoder, which better reflect
fine-grained and object-level attention, to estimate visual token importance.
Based on this, we propose a hierarchical visual token pruning method to retain
both globally and locally important visual tokens. Specifically, we reshape the
1-D visual token sequence output by the vision encoder into a 2-D spatial
layout. In the global retaining stage, we divide the image into regions and
retain tokens with higher importance scores in each region; in the local
retaining stage, we then divide the image into small windows and retain the
most important token in each local window. Experimental results show that our
proposed method, HIVTP, can reduce the time-to-first-token (TTFT) of
LLaVA-v1.5-7B and LLaVA-Next-7B by up to 50.0% and 55.1%, respectively, and
improve the token generation throughput by up to 60.9% and 47.3%, without
sacrificing accuracy, and even achieving improvements on certain benchmarks.
Compared with prior works, HIVTP achieves better accuracy while offering higher
inference efficiency.

TL;DR: STIM-TM is a spatiotemporal token merging method for surgical video understanding that reduces computational costs by independently merging redundant tokens along temporal and spatial dimensions while preserving critical surgical information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision Transformer methods for surgical video understanding suffer from high computational costs due to processing massive spatiotemporal tokens, and existing token merging approaches fail to consider video structure and heterogeneous information distribution.

Method: STIM-TM uses a decoupled strategy: temporal component merges spatially corresponding tokens from consecutive frames using saliency weighting, while spatial component prioritizes merging static tokens through temporal stability analysis to protect dynamic surgical regions.

Result: Achieves over 65% GFLOPs reduction while maintaining competitive accuracy across surgical video tasks, and enables efficient training of long-sequence surgical videos.

Conclusion: STIM-TM provides an effective training-free solution for computational efficiency in surgical video understanding by preserving critical spatiotemporal information while significantly reducing token redundancy.

Abstract: Vision Transformer models have shown impressive effectiveness in the surgical
video understanding tasks through long-range dependency modeling. However,
current methods suffer from prohibitive computational costs due to processing
massive spatiotemporal tokens across video frames. While prior work on token
merging has advanced model efficiency, they fail to adequately consider the
inherent spatiotemporal structure of video data and overlook the heterogeneous
nature of information distribution, leading to suboptimal performance. In this
paper, we propose a spatiotemporal information mining token merging (STIM-TM)
method, representing the first dedicated approach for surgical video
understanding. STIM-TM introduces a decoupled strategy that reduces token
redundancy along temporal and spatial dimensions independently. Specifically,
the temporal component merges spatially corresponding tokens from consecutive
frames using saliency weighting, preserving critical sequential information and
maintaining continuity. Meanwhile, the spatial component prioritizes merging
static tokens through temporal stability analysis, protecting dynamic regions
containing essential surgical information. Operating in a training-free manner,
STIM-TM achieves significant efficiency gains with over $65\%$ GFLOPs reduction
while preserving competitive accuracy across comprehensive surgical video
tasks. Our method also supports efficient training of long-sequence surgical
videos, addressing computational bottlenecks in surgical applications.

assess genuine global reasoning or allow success via localized visual cues.
Existing evaluation methods do not explicitly measure this distinction,
hindering effective dataset curation and real-world focused model development.
  We introduce Region Comprehension Index (RCI), the first model-based score to

understanding or can be solved with partial or localized visual cues.
  When applying RCI to 13 widely used multimodal benchmarks, we observed that
most of them favor localized reasoning and exhibit significant spatial biases,
indicating potential risks in real-world applications. RCI equips researchers &

TL;DR: MSD-KMamba is a 3D multi-modal image segmentation framework that combines bidirectional spatial perception with multi-scale self-distillation to achieve high segmentation accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CNN-Transformer hybrid models suffer from high computational complexity due to global attention mechanisms, making it challenging to balance performance with efficiency for complex segmentation tasks.

Method: The framework integrates a bidirectional spatial aware branch to capture long-range spatial context dependencies and a multi-scale self-distilled fusion strategy to strengthen hierarchical feature representations across different resolution levels.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that MSD-KMamba consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in segmentation accuracy, robustness, and generalization while maintaining high computational efficiency.

Conclusion: MSD-KMamba effectively addresses the computational complexity bottleneck in volumetric segmentation while overcoming limitations of insufficient global perception, achieving superior performance with favorable scalability.

Abstract: Numerous CNN-Transformer hybrid models rely on high-complexity global
attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies, which introduces
non-linear computational complexity and leads to significant resource
consumption. Although knowledge distillation and sparse attention mechanisms
can improve efficiency, they often fall short of delivering the high
segmentation accuracy necessary for complex tasks. Balancing model performance
with computational efficiency remains a critical challenge. In this work, we
propose a novel 3D multi-modal image segmentation framework, termed MSD-KMamba,
which integrates bidirectional spatial perception with multi-scale
self-distillation. The bidirectional spatial aware branch effectively captures
long-range spatial context dependencies across brain regions, while also
incorporating a powerful nonlinear feature extraction mechanism that further
enhances the model's ability to learn complex and heterogeneous patterns. In
addition, the proposed multi-scale self-distilled fusion strategy strengthens
hierarchical feature representations and improves the transfer of semantic
information at different resolution levels. By jointly leveraging the
bidirectional spatial perception branch and the multi-scale self-distilled
fusion strategy, our framework effectively mitigates the bottleneck of
quadratic computational complexity in volumetric segmentation, while
simultaneously addressing the limitation of insufficient global perception.
Extensive experiments on multiple standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that
MSD-KMamba consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in segmentation
accuracy, robustness, and generalization, while maintaining high computational
efficiency and favorable scalability. The source code of MSD-KMamba is publicly

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QuantSparse is a unified framework that combines model quantization and attention sparsification for efficient video diffusion transformers, achieving significant performance improvements and efficiency gains over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion transformers have excellent video generation capabilities but suffer from high computational and memory costs that limit practical deployment. Individual compression methods like quantization or sparsification alone cause severe performance degradation under aggressive compression.

Method: QuantSparse integrates model quantization with attention sparsification using two key techniques: Multi-Scale Salient Attention Distillation (providing global structural and local salient supervision) and Second-Order Sparse Attention Reparameterization (exploiting temporal stability of second-order residuals to recover lost information).

Result: On HunyuanVideo-13B, QuantSparse achieves 20.88 PSNR, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art quantization baseline Q-VDiT (16.85 PSNR), while reducing storage by 3.68× and accelerating end-to-end inference by 1.88×.

Conclusion: QuantSparse successfully combines quantization and sparsification to achieve substantial efficiency improvements in video diffusion transformers without compromising performance, enabling practical deployment of these models.

Abstract: Diffusion transformers exhibit remarkable video generation capability, yet
their prohibitive computational and memory costs hinder practical deployment.
Model quantization and attention sparsification are two promising directions
for compression, but each alone suffers severe performance degradation under
aggressive compression. Combining them promises compounded efficiency gains,
but naive integration is ineffective. The sparsity-induced information loss
exacerbates quantization noise, leading to amplified attention shifts. To
address this, we propose \textbf{QuantSparse}, a unified framework that
integrates model quantization with attention sparsification. Specifically, we
introduce \textit{Multi-Scale Salient Attention Distillation}, which leverages
both global structural guidance and local salient supervision to mitigate
quantization-induced bias. In addition, we develop \textit{Second-Order Sparse
Attention Reparameterization}, which exploits the temporal stability of
second-order residuals to efficiently recover information lost under sparsity.
Experiments on HunyuanVideo-13B demonstrate that QuantSparse achieves 20.88
PSNR, substantially outperforming the state-of-the-art quantization baseline
Q-VDiT (16.85 PSNR), while simultaneously delivering a \textbf{3.68$\times$}
reduction in storage and \textbf{1.88$\times$} acceleration in end-to-end
inference. Our code will be released in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks oversimplify safety inspection tasks by using textual descriptions instead of visual information and restrict agents with single static viewpoints, preventing accurate evaluation of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and causing omission of occluded hazards.

Method: Proposed HomeSafeBench with 12,900 data points covering five common home safety hazards (fire, electric shock, falling object, trips, child safety), providing dynamic first-person perspective images from simulated environments that allow free exploration and multiple viewpoints.

Result: Evaluation of mainstream VLMs on HomeSafeBench shows poor performance, with the best model achieving only 10.23% F1-score, indicating significant limitations in current VLMs for identifying safety hazards and selecting exploration strategies.

Conclusion: HomeSafeBench reveals substantial gaps in current VLM capabilities for home safety inspection and provides a valuable benchmark for future research, with the dataset and code to be publicly released.

Abstract: Embodied agents can identify and report safety hazards in the home
environments. Accurately evaluating their capabilities in home safety
inspection tasks is curcial, but existing benchmarks suffer from two key
limitations. First, they oversimplify safety inspection tasks by using textual
descriptions of the environment instead of direct visual information, which
hinders the accurate evaluation of embodied agents based on Vision-Language
Models (VLMs). Second, they use a single, static viewpoint for environmental
observation, which restricts the agents' free exploration and cause the
omission of certain safety hazards, especially those that are occluded from a
fixed viewpoint. To alleviate these issues, we propose HomeSafeBench, a
benchmark with 12,900 data points covering five common home safety hazards:
fire, electric shock, falling object, trips, and child safety. HomeSafeBench
provides dynamic first-person perspective images from simulated home
environments, enabling the evaluation of VLM capabilities for home safety
inspection. By allowing the embodied agents to freely explore the room,
HomeSafeBench provides multiple dynamic perspectives in complex environments
for a more thorough inspection. Our comprehensive evaluation of mainstream VLMs
on HomeSafeBench reveals that even the best-performing model achieves an
F1-score of only 10.23%, demonstrating significant limitations in current VLMs.
The models particularly struggle with identifying safety hazards and selecting
effective exploration strategies. We hope HomeSafeBench will provide valuable
reference and support for future research related to home security inspections.
Our dataset and code will be publicly available soon.

### [135] [Confidence Aware SSD Ensemble with Weighted Boxes Fusion for Weapon Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23697)
*Atharva Jadhav,Arush Karekar,Manas Divekar,Shachi Natu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ensemble of SSD models with diverse backbones using Weighted Boxes Fusion improves weapon detection robustness in surveillance systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Public safety requires robust surveillance systems for weapon detection, but single models struggle with challenges like occlusion, lighting variations, and cluttered backgrounds.

Method: Trained multiple SSD models with different backbone networks (VGG16, ResNet50, EfficientNet, MobileNetV3) and fused their predictions using Weighted Boxes Fusion with max confidence scoring strategy.

Result: The ensemble achieved mAP of 0.838, representing 2.948% improvement over the best single model, and consistently outperformed other fusion methods.

Conclusion: Confidence-aware fusion is critical for ensemble performance, providing a robust approach for real-time weapon detection in surveillance applications.

Abstract: The safety and security of public spaces is of vital importance, driving the
need for sophisticated surveillance systems capable of accurately detecting
weapons, which are often hampered by issues like partial occlusion, varying
lighting, and cluttered backgrounds. While single-model detectors are advanced,
they often lack robustness in these challenging conditions. This paper presents
the hypothesis that ensemble of Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) models with
diverse feature extraction backbones can significantly enhance detection
robustness. To leverage diverse feature representations, individual SSD models
were trained using a selection of backbone networks: VGG16, ResNet50,
EfficientNet, and MobileNetV3. The study is conducted on a dataset consisting
of images of three distinct weapon classes: guns, heavy weapons and knives. The
predictions from these models are combined using the Weighted Boxes Fusion
(WBF) method, an ensemble technique designed to optimize bounding box accuracy.
Our key finding is that the fusion strategy is as critical as the ensemble's
diversity, a WBF approach using a 'max' confidence scoring strategy achieved a
mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.838. This represents a 2.948% relative
improvement over the best-performing single model and consistently outperforms
other fusion heuristics. This research offers a robust approach to enhancing
real-time weapon detection capabilities in surveillance applications by
demonstrating that confidence-aware fusion is a key mechanism for improving
accuracy metrics of ensembles.

*Yunjiang Xu,Lingzhi Li,Jin Wang,Yupeng Ouyang,Benyuan Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: INSTINCT is a novel collaborative perception framework that improves multi-agent LiDAR detection accuracy while significantly reducing communication bandwidth requirements through instance-level interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collaborative perception systems face bandwidth constraints due to frequent cooperative interactions and real-time requirements. While query-based instance-level interaction reduces bandwidth demands, LiDAR-focused implementations remain underdeveloped and trail state-of-the-art approaches.

Method: INSTINCT features three core components: 1) quality-aware filtering for high-quality instance feature selection, 2) dual-branch detection routing to decouple collaboration-irrelevant and collaboration-relevant instances, and 3) Cross Agent Local Instance Fusion module to aggregate local hybrid instance features. Enhanced ground truth sampling facilitates training with diverse hybrid instance features.

Result: INSTINCT achieves superior performance with 13.23% improvement in DAIR-V2X and 33.08% improvement in V2V4Real datasets, while reducing communication bandwidth to 1/281 and 1/264 compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed INSTINCT framework effectively bridges the gap in LiDAR-focused collaborative perception, achieving both high accuracy and significant bandwidth reduction through innovative instance-level interaction mechanisms.

Abstract: Collaborative perception systems overcome single-vehicle limitations in
long-range detection and occlusion scenarios by integrating multi-agent sensory
data, improving accuracy and safety. However, frequent cooperative interactions
and real-time requirements impose stringent bandwidth constraints. Previous
works proves that query-based instance-level interaction reduces bandwidth
demands and manual priors, however, LiDAR-focused implementations in
collaborative perception remain underdeveloped, with performance still trailing
state-of-the-art approaches. To bridge this gap, we propose INSTINCT
(INSTance-level INteraCtion ArchiTecture), a novel collaborative perception
framework featuring three core components: 1) a quality-aware filtering
mechanism for high-quality instance feature selection; 2) a dual-branch
detection routing scheme to decouple collaboration-irrelevant and
collaboration-relevant instances; and 3) a Cross Agent Local Instance Fusion
module to aggregate local hybrid instance features. Additionally, we enhance
the ground truth (GT) sampling technique to facilitate training with diverse
hybrid instance features. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets
demonstrate that INSTINCT achieves superior performance. Specifically, our
method achieves an improvement in accuracy 13.23%/33.08% in DAIR-V2X and
V2V4Real while reducing the communication bandwidth to 1/281 and 1/264 compared
to state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at

*Boseong Jeon,Junghyuk Lee,Jimin Park,Kwanyoung Kim,Jingi Jung,Sangwon Lee,Hyunbo Shim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CrimEdit is a unified diffusion model that jointly handles object removal, insertion, and movement using classifier-free guidance and task embeddings, enabling efficient composite editing without separate training stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unexplored impact of classifier-free guidance on handling object effects in unified removal/insertion models and improve efficiency in composite editing tasks.

Method: Jointly trains task embeddings for removal and insertion in a single model, leverages them in classifier-free guidance scheme, and extends task prompts to spatially distinct regions for object movement in single denoising step.

Result: Achieves superior object removal, controllable effect insertion, and efficient object movement without requiring additional training or separate removal/insertion stages.

Conclusion: CrimEdit demonstrates that unified training with classifier-free guidance enables efficient and high-quality composite editing including removal, insertion, and movement in a single model.

Abstract: Recent works on object removal and insertion have enhanced their performance
by handling object effects such as shadows and reflections, using diffusion
models trained on counterfactual datasets. However, the performance impact of
applying classifier-free guidance to handle object effects across removal and
insertion tasks within a unified model remains largely unexplored. To address
this gap and improve efficiency in composite editing, we propose CrimEdit,
which jointly trains the task embeddings for removal and insertion within a
single model and leverages them in a classifier-free guidance scheme --
enhancing the removal of both objects and their effects, and enabling
controllable synthesis of object effects during insertion. CrimEdit also
extends these two task prompts to be applied to spatially distinct regions,
enabling object movement (repositioning) within a single denoising step. By
employing both guidance techniques, extensive experiments show that CrimEdit
achieves superior object removal, controllable effect insertion, and efficient
object movement without requiring additional training or separate removal and
insertion stages.

*Shuai Shao,Shu Jiang,Shiyuan Zhao,Di Yang,Yan Wang,Yutong Bai,Jianguo Zhang,Jiangtao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PD-Diag-Net is an end-to-end automated diagnostic method for Parkinson's disease that uses MRI scans with clinical prior knowledge about brain regions and aging patterns to achieve high accuracy in diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Parkinson's disease diagnostic workflows are complex, rely heavily on neurologist expertise, and often result in delayed detection and missed early intervention opportunities.

Method: The framework includes MRI preprocessing to reduce variability, then incorporates two clinical priors: Brain-Region-Relevance-Prior (PD-associated regions) and Brain-Region-Aging-Prior (accelerated aging patterns). It uses these priors in two modules: Relevance-Prior Guided Feature Aggregation and Age-Prior Guided Diagnosis.

Result: PD-Diag-Net achieves 86% accuracy on external hospital tests and over 96% accuracy in early-stage diagnosis, outperforming existing methods by more than 20%.

Conclusion: The proposed automated diagnostic method effectively addresses current limitations in PD diagnosis by leveraging clinical prior knowledge and achieves superior performance, particularly in early-stage detection.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder that severely
diminishes patients' quality of life. Its global prevalence has increased
markedly in recent decades. Current diagnostic workflows are complex and
heavily reliant on neurologists' expertise, often resulting in delays in early
detection and missed opportunities for timely intervention. To address these
issues, we propose an end-to-end automated diagnostic method for PD, termed
PD-Diag-Net, which performs risk assessment and auxiliary diagnosis directly
from raw MRI scans. This framework first introduces an MRI Pre-processing
Module (MRI-Processor) to mitigate inter-subject and inter-scanner variability
by flexibly integrating established medical imaging preprocessing tools. It
then incorporates two forms of clinical prior knowledge: (1)
Brain-Region-Relevance-Prior (Relevance-Prior), which specifies brain regions
strongly associated with PD; and (2) Brain-Region-Aging-Prior (Aging-Prior),
which reflects the accelerated aging typically observed in PD-associated
regions. Building on these priors, we design two dedicated modules: the
Relevance-Prior Guided Feature Aggregation Module (Aggregator), which guides
the model to focus on PD-associated regions at the inter-subject level, and the
Age-Prior Guided Diagnosis Module (Diagnoser), which leverages brain age gaps
as auxiliary constraints at the intra-subject level to enhance diagnostic
accuracy and clinical interpretability. Furthermore, we collected external test
data from our collaborating hospital. Experimental results show that
PD-Diag-Net achieves 86\% accuracy on external tests and over 96% accuracy in
early-stage diagnosis, outperforming existing advanced methods by more than
20%.

*Zijun Li,Hongyu Yan,Shijie Li,Kunming Luo,Li Lu,Xulei Yang,Weisi Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffPCN is a diffusion-based coarse-to-fine framework for point cloud completion that uses depth image projection and denoising to achieve high-quality results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Latent diffusion models have strong generative capabilities but remain underexplored for point cloud completion due to the unstructured and irregular nature of point clouds.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Project partial point clouds to depth images, use DepthLDM to generate completed depth images for coarse point clouds; 2) Point Denoising Network removes artifacts and Association-Aware Point Upsampler refines with local association features.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in geometric accuracy and shape completeness, significantly improving robustness and consistency of point cloud completion.

Conclusion: DiffPCN effectively leverages diffusion models for point cloud completion through structured depth image projection and refinement stages, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Latent diffusion models (LDMs) have demonstrated remarkable generative
capabilities across various low-level vision tasks. However, their potential
for point cloud completion remains underexplored due to the unstructured and
irregular nature of point clouds. In this work, we propose DiffPCN, a novel
diffusion-based coarse-to-fine framework for point cloud completion. Our
approach comprises two stages: an initial stage for generating coarse point
clouds, and a refinement stage that improves their quality through point
denoising and upsampling. Specifically, we first project the unordered and
irregular partial point cloud into structured depth images, which serve as
conditions for a well-designed DepthLDM to synthesize completed multi-view
depth images that are used to form coarse point clouds. In this way, our
DiffPCN can yield high-quality and high-completeness coarse point clouds by
leveraging LDM' s powerful generation and comprehension capabilities. Then,
since LDMs inevitably introduce outliers into the generated depth maps, we
design a Point Denoising Network to remove artifacts from the coarse point
cloud by predicting a per-point distance score. Finally, we devise an
Association-Aware Point Upsampler, which guides the upsampling process by
leveraging local association features between the input point cloud and the
corresponding coarse points, further yielding a dense and high-fidelity output.
Experimental results demonstrate that our DiffPCN achieves state-of-the-art
performance in geometric accuracy and shape completeness, significantly
improving the robustness and consistency of point cloud completion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel visual prompting strategy that combines multiple video frames into single panel images to improve long-video understanding in Video-Language Models without additional training or parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Video-Language Models perform well on images and short videos but lag in long-video understanding. Instead of fine-tuning with limited data, the authors aim to maximize existing model performance through efficient prompting.

Method: Training-free, parameter-free visual prompting that trades spatial details for temporal resolution by combining multiple frames into one panel image. The approach is model-agnostic and can be integrated into existing VLMs.

Result: Extensive experiments on 5 benchmarks show consistent improvements across various model architectures, sizes, and context windows. On TimeScope (Long) dataset, video QA accuracy improved by up to 19.4%.

Conclusion: The proposed visual prompting strategy effectively enhances long-video understanding in VLMs without additional complexity, setting a new benchmark for the field.

Abstract: Recent Video-Language Models (VLMs) achieve promising results on long-video
understanding, but their performance still lags behind that achieved on tasks
involving images or short videos. This has led to great interest in improving
the long context modeling of VLMs by introducing novel modules and additional
complexity. % additional training time. In this paper, we take a different
approach: rather than fine-tuning VLMs with the limited data available, we
attempt to maximize the performance of existing models. To this end, we propose
a novel visual prompting strategy specifically designed for long-video
understanding. By combining multiple frames as panels into one image, we
effectively trade off spatial details for temporal resolution. Our approach is
training-free, parameter-free, and model-agnostic, and can be seamlessly
integrated into existing VLMs. Extensive experiments on five established
benchmarks across a wide range of model architectures, sizes, and context
windows confirm the consistency of our approach. For the TimeScope (Long)
dataset, which has the longest videos, the accuracy for video question
answering is improved by up to 19.4\%. Overall, our method raises the bar for
long video understanding models. We will make our code available upon
acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M3DLayout is a large-scale multi-source dataset for 3D indoor layout generation that addresses limitations of existing datasets by providing 15,080 layouts with detailed text annotations from three sources: real-world scans, CAD designs, and procedural generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D indoor layout generation models are constrained by limited scale, diversity, and annotation quality in existing datasets, which hinders learning complex spatial and semantic patterns for text-driven 3D scene generation.

Method: Created M3DLayout dataset with 15,080 layouts from three sources (real-world scans, CAD designs, procedural generation), each paired with structured text descriptions covering global scene summaries, relational placements, and fine-grained arrangements. Established benchmark using text-conditioned diffusion model.

Result: Experimental results show M3DLayout provides solid foundation for training layout generation models. Multi-source composition enhances diversity, especially Inf3DLayout subset enables generation of more complex and detailed scenes with rich small-object information.

Conclusion: M3DLayout serves as a valuable resource for advancing text-driven 3D scene synthesis research by providing diverse, richly annotated data that enables learning of complex spatial and semantic patterns across various indoor environments.

Abstract: In text-driven 3D scene generation, object layout serves as a crucial
intermediate representation that bridges high-level language instructions with
detailed geometric output. It not only provides a structural blueprint for
ensuring physical plausibility but also supports semantic controllability and
interactive editing. However, the learning capabilities of current 3D indoor
layout generation models are constrained by the limited scale, diversity, and
annotation quality of existing datasets. To address this, we introduce
M3DLayout, a large-scale, multi-source dataset for 3D indoor layout generation.
M3DLayout comprises 15,080 layouts and over 258k object instances, integrating
three distinct sources: real-world scans, professional CAD designs, and
procedurally generated scenes. Each layout is paired with detailed structured
text describing global scene summaries, relational placements of large
furniture, and fine-grained arrangements of smaller items. This diverse and
richly annotated resource enables models to learn complex spatial and semantic
patterns across a wide variety of indoor environments. To assess the potential
of M3DLayout, we establish a benchmark using a text-conditioned diffusion
model. Experimental results demonstrate that our dataset provides a solid
foundation for training layout generation models. Its multi-source composition
enhances diversity, notably through the Inf3DLayout subset which provides rich
small-object information, enabling the generation of more complex and detailed
scenes. We hope that M3DLayout can serve as a valuable resource for advancing
research in text-driven 3D scene synthesis.

*Shubhang Bhatnagar,Andy Xu,Kar-Han Tan,Narendra Ahuja*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LUQ: Layerwise Ultra-Low Bit Quantization for multimodal LLMs that selectively applies ultra-low bit quantization to resilient layers, reducing memory usage by 31-40% vs 4-bit models with <10% performance degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal LLMs require huge memory and computational resources, but ultra-low bit quantization (<4-bit) for MLLMs remains unexplored despite success in language models.

Method: Proposed LUQ strategy that analyzes layer activation distributions and selectively applies ultra-low bit quantization to layers with lower entropy distributions that are more resilient. Also uses mixed multimodal tokens for PTQ.

Result: LUQ reduces memory usage by 40% for LLaVA-1.5 and 31% for Qwen-2.5-VL compared to 4-bit models, with less than 10% performance degradation on MME benchmark across 9 VQA benchmarks.

Conclusion: Layerwise selective ultra-low bit quantization is effective for MLLMs, achieving significant memory reduction while maintaining acceptable performance by leveraging layer-specific activation characteristics.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with multimodal capabilities have revolutionized
vision-language tasks, but their deployment often requires huge memory and
computational resources. While post-training quantization (PTQ) has
successfully compressed language models to as low as 1-bit precision without
significant performance loss, its effectiveness for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs)
remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we present the first study on
ultra-low bit (<4-bit) quantization for multimodal LLMs. Our analysis reveals
that multimodal tokens and intermediate layer activations produced by them
exhibit significantly higher statistical variance and entropy compared to text
tokens, making them less tolerant to ultra-low bit quantization. However, the
activation distributions of multimodal tokens varies significantly over
different layers, with some layers having lower entropy activation
distributions. We empirically show that such layers in these models can better
tolerate ultra-low bit quantization. Building on these insights, we propose a
novel strategy for MLLM quantization, LUQ: Layerwise Ultra-Low Bit
Quantization, which selectively applies ultra-low bit quantization to layers
that are more resilient to it. Additionally, we also show that using a mix of
multimodal tokens (image and text) for PTQ boosts VQA performance in the
ultra-low bit regime. We evaluate our method on LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen-2.5-VL
across 9 popular VQA benchmarks. The resulting LUQ models use 40% and 31% less
memory than their 4-bit counterparts, respectively, while exhibiting a
performance degradation of less than 10% on the MME benchmark.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HieraTok is a multi-scale Vision Transformer tokenizer that uses multi-scale downsampling and scale-causal attention to improve image reconstruction and generation by enabling progressive information flow from global semantics to structural details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitation of single-scale representations in existing Vision Transformer tokenizers, which fail to capture both global semantic features and high-resolution structural details effectively.

Method: Uses multi-scale downsampling on token maps to produce multi-scale tokens, combined with a scale-causal attention mechanism that progressively flows information from low-resolution to high-resolution features.

Result: Achieved 27.2% improvement in rFID (1.47 → 1.07), 1.38× faster convergence rate, and 18.9% boost in gFID (16.4 → 13.3) compared to single-scale tokenizers. With scaled training, reached state-of-the-art rFID of 0.45 and gFID of 1.82.

Conclusion: HieraTok is the first multi-scale ViT-based tokenizer that significantly advances visual generation tasks through its multi-scale architecture and attention mechanism, creating smoother latent spaces and better performance.

Abstract: In this work, we present HieraTok, a novel multi-scale Vision Transformer
(ViT)-based tokenizer that overcomes the inherent limitation of modeling
single-scale representations. This is realized through two key designs: (1)
multi-scale downsampling applied to the token map generated by the tokenizer
encoder, producing a sequence of multi-scale tokens, and (2) a scale-causal
attention mechanism that enables the progressive flow of information from
low-resolution global semantic features to high-resolution structural details.
Coupling these designs, HieraTok achieves significant improvements in both
image reconstruction and generation tasks. Under identical settings, the
multi-scale visual tokenizer outperforms its single-scale counterpart by a
27.2\% improvement in rFID ($1.47 \rightarrow 1.07$). When integrated into
downstream generation frameworks, it achieves a $1.38\times$ faster convergence
rate and an 18.9\% boost in gFID ($16.4 \rightarrow 13.3$), which may be
attributed to the smoother and more uniformly distributed latent space.
Furthermore, by scaling up the tokenizer's training, we demonstrate its
potential by a sota rFID of 0.45 and a gFID of 1.82 among ViT tokenizers. To
the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce multi-scale ViT-based
tokenizer in image reconstruction and image generation. We hope our findings
and designs advance the ViT-based tokenizers in visual generation tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRS-SLAM3R is an end-to-end SLAM framework that improves dense scene reconstruction by incorporating spatial memory and global consistency, outperforming existing DUSt3R-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DUSt3R-based SLAM methods only use image pairs for pointmap estimation, ignoring spatial memory and global consistency, leading to suboptimal reconstruction quality.

Method: Uses sequential input with transformer-based gated update module for spatial memory, partitions scene into submaps with local alignment, and registers all submaps into global coordinate frame.

Result: Achieves superior reconstruction accuracy while maintaining real-time performance across various datasets.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses limitations of previous methods by incorporating spatial memory and global consistency, demonstrating improved dense scene reconstruction capabilities.

Abstract: DUSt3R-based end-to-end scene reconstruction has recently shown promising
results in dense visual SLAM. However, most existing methods only use image
pairs to estimate pointmaps, overlooking spatial memory and global
consistency.To this end, we introduce GRS-SLAM3R, an end-to-end SLAM framework
for dense scene reconstruction and pose estimation from RGB images without any
prior knowledge of the scene or camera parameters. Unlike existing DUSt3R-based
frameworks, which operate on all image pairs and predict per-pair point maps in
local coordinate frames, our method supports sequentialized input and
incrementally estimates metric-scale point clouds in the global coordinate. In
order to improve consistent spatial correlation, we use a latent state for
spatial memory and design a transformer-based gated update module to reset and
update the spatial memory that continuously aggregates and tracks relevant 3D
information across frames. Furthermore, we partition the scene into submaps,
apply local alignment within each submap, and register all submaps into a
common world frame using relative constraints, producing a globally consistent
map. Experiments on various datasets show that our framework achieves superior
reconstruction accuracy while maintaining real-time performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes ResAD++ for class-agnostic anomaly detection, using residual features and feature hypersphere constraints to achieve feature decorrelation and handle new classes without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AD methods perform poorly on new classes due to class-related feature correlation. Need a model that generalizes across diverse domains without target data retraining.

Method: Uses residual features by subtracting normal reference features, feature hypersphere constraints for scale consistency, logbarrier bidirectional contraction OCC loss, and vector quantization for feature distribution matching.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on eight real-world datasets when directly applied to new classes without retraining.

Conclusion: ResAD++ effectively addresses feature correlation issues in class-agnostic AD and achieves superior generalization to new classes.

Abstract: This paper explores the problem of class-agnostic anomaly detection (AD),
where the objective is to train one class-agnostic AD model that can generalize
to detect anomalies in diverse new classes from different domains without any
retraining or fine-tuning on the target data. When applied for new classes, the
performance of current single- and multi-class AD methods is still
unsatisfactory. One fundamental reason is that representation learning in
existing methods is still class-related, namely, feature correlation. To
address this issue, we propose residual features and construct a simple but
effective framework, termed ResAD. Our core insight is to learn the residual
feature distribution rather than the initial feature distribution. Residual
features are formed by matching and then subtracting normal reference features.
In this way, we can effectively realize feature decorrelation. Even in new
classes, the distribution of normal residual features would not remarkably
shift from the learned distribution. In addition, we think that residual
features still have one issue: scale correlation. To this end, we propose a
feature hypersphere constraining approach, which learns to constrain initial
normal residual features into a spatial hypersphere for enabling the feature
scales of different classes as consistent as possible. Furthermore, we propose
a novel logbarrier bidirectional contraction OCC loss and vector quantization
based feature distribution matching module to enhance ResAD, leading to the
improved version of ResAD (ResAD++). Comprehensive experiments on eight
real-world AD datasets demonstrate that our ResAD++ can achieve remarkable AD
results when directly used in new classes, outperforming state-of-the-art
competing methods and also surpassing ResAD. The code is available at

Motivation: Current VLMs perform poorly on visual pointing tasks compared to humans because they are required to complete pointing in a single step, similar to asking humans to point without seeing their own fingers.

Method: Proposed Point, Visualize, then Refine (Poivre) procedure using reinforcement learning with a designed process reward to enable iterative coordinate refinement.

Result: Poivre-7B achieves new state-of-the-art on Point-Bench, outperforming proprietary models like Gemini-2.5-Pro and large open-source models like Molmo-72B by over 3%.

Conclusion: The self-refining procedure with RL training effectively improves visual pointing performance in VLMs, and the code, dataset, and model checkpoint are released for future research.

Abstract: Visual pointing, which aims to localize a target by predicting its
coordinates on an image, has emerged as an important problem in the realm of
vision-language models (VLMs). Despite its broad applicability, recent
benchmarks show that current VLMs still fall far behind human performance on
this task. A key limitation is that VLMs are typically required to complete the
pointing task in a single step, akin to asking humans to point at an object
without seeing their own fingers. To address this issue, we propose a simple
yet effective self-refining procedure: Point, Visualize, then Refine (Poivre).
This procedure enables a VLM to first mark its estimated point, then
iteratively refine the coordinates if necessary. Inspired by advances of
reasoning models in the natural language domain, we employ reinforcement
learning (RL) to incentivize this self-refining ability. For the RL training,
we design a neat process reward that is not only empirically effective but also
grounded in appealing properties. Our trained model, Poivre-7B, sets a new
state of the art on Point-Bench, outperforming both proprietary models such as
Gemini-2.5-Pro and large open-source models such as Molmo-72B by over 3%. To
support future research, we release our training and inference code, dataset,
and the Poivre-7B checkpoint.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer ranks among the most common and deadly cancers, emphasizing
the need for effective early detection and treatment. To address the
limitations of traditional colonoscopy, including high miss rates due to polyp
variability, we introduce the Pyramid Vision Transformer Adapter Residual
Network (PVTAdpNet). This model integrates a U-Net-style encoder-decoder
structure with a Pyramid Vision Transformer backbone, novel residual blocks,
and adapter-based skip connections. The design enhances feature extraction,
dense prediction, and gradient flow, supported by squeeze-and-excitation
attention for improved channel-wise feature refinement. PVTAdpNet achieves
real-time, accurate polyp segmentation, demonstrating superior performance on
benchmark datasets with high mDice and mIoU scores, making it highly suitable
for clinical applications. PVTAdpNet obtains a high Dice coefficient of 0.8851
and a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.8167 on out-of-distribution
polyp datasets. Evaluation of the PolypGen dataset demonstrates PVTAdpNet's
capability for real-time, accurate performance within familiar distributions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniAlignment is a unified multimodal generation framework using a single diffusion transformer with dual-stream training for better cross-modal consistency and instruction-following.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for multimodal tasks rely on fragmented architectures using VLMs or modular designs, leading to computational inefficiency and lack of unified semantic comprehension.

Method: Proposes UniAlignment framework with dual-stream diffusion training strategy incorporating both intrinsic-modal and cross-modal semantic alignment within a single diffusion transformer.

Result: Extensive experiments show UniAlignment outperforms existing baselines across multiple tasks and benchmarks, demonstrating superior multimodal semantic consistency.

Conclusion: UniAlignment shows significant potential of diffusion models in unified multimodal generation, achieving better cross-modal consistency and instruction-following robustness.

Abstract: The remarkable success of diffusion models in text-to-image generation has
sparked growing interest in expanding their capabilities to a variety of
multi-modal tasks, including image understanding, manipulation, and perception.
These tasks require advanced semantic comprehension across both visual and
textual modalities, especially in scenarios involving complex semantic
instructions. However, existing approaches often rely heavily on
vision-language models (VLMs) or modular designs for semantic guidance, leading
to fragmented architectures and computational inefficiency. To address these
challenges, we propose UniAlignment, a unified multimodal generation framework
within a single diffusion transformer. UniAlignment introduces a dual-stream
diffusion training strategy that incorporates both intrinsic-modal semantic
alignment and cross-modal semantic alignment, thereby enhancing the model's
cross-modal consistency and instruction-following robustness. Additionally, we
present SemGen-Bench, a new benchmark specifically designed to evaluate
multimodal semantic consistency under complex textual instructions. Extensive
experiments across multiple tasks and benchmarks demonstrate that UniAlignment
outperforms existing baselines, underscoring the significant potential of
diffusion models in unified multimodal generation.

*Xiaojie Li,Bei Wang,Jianlong Wu,Yue Yu,Liqiang Nie,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GenView++ improves contrastive learning by generating diverse, semantically coherent views through multi-source adaptive generation and implementing quality-driven learning that prioritizes high-quality pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current contrastive learning methods face limitations in both view construction (limited diversity and semantic corruption) and learning (lack of quality assessment leading to equal treatment of all pairs).

Method: Introduces multi-source adaptive view generation with image-conditioned, text-conditioned, and image-text-conditioned strategies, plus quality-driven contrastive learning that assesses semantic alignment and diversity to dynamically reweight pair contributions.

Result: Improves MoCov2 by +2.5% on ImageNet linear classification, raises zero-shot classification accuracy by +12.31% over CLIP and +5.31% over SLIP across ten datasets, and improves Flickr30k text retrieval R@5 by +3.2%.

Conclusion: GenView++ effectively addresses both construction and learning challenges in contrastive learning, demonstrating significant improvements across vision and vision-language tasks.

Abstract: The success of contrastive learning depends on the construction and
utilization of high-quality positive pairs. However, current methods face
critical limitations on two fronts: on the construction side, both handcrafted
and generative augmentations often suffer from limited diversity and risk
semantic corruption; on the learning side, the absence of a quality assessment
mechanism leads to suboptimal supervision where all pairs are treated equally.
To tackle these challenges, we propose GenView++, a unified framework that
addresses both fronts by introducing two synergistic innovations. To improve
pair construction, GenView++ introduces a multi-source adaptive view generation
mechanism to synthesize diverse yet semantically coherent views by dynamically
modulating generative parameters across image-conditioned, text-conditioned,
and image-text-conditioned strategies. Second, a quality-driven contrastive
learning mechanism assesses each pair's semantic alignment and diversity to
dynamically reweight their training contribution, prioritizing high-quality
pairs while suppressing redundant or misaligned pairs. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of GenView++ across both vision and
vision-language tasks. For vision representation learning, it improves MoCov2
by +2.5% on ImageNet linear classification. For vision-language learning, it
raises the average zero-shot classification accuracy by +12.31% over CLIP and
+5.31% over SLIP across ten datasets, and further improves Flickr30k text
retrieval R@5 by +3.2%. The code is available at

### [151] [A Modality-Tailored Graph Modeling Framework for Urban Region Representation via Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23772)
*Yaya Zhao,Kaiqi Zhao,Zixuan Tang,Zhiyuan Liu,Xiaoling Lu,Yalei Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MTGRR is a modality-tailored graph framework for urban region representation that addresses limitations in existing approaches by using specialized GNN architectures for different modality types and spatially-aware multimodal fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph-based models for urban data use identical architectures across all modalities and ignore spatial heterogeneity in fusion, leading to suboptimal region representations.

Method: Categorizes modalities into aggregated-level and point-level groups, uses MoE GNN for aggregated modalities and dual-level GNN for point-level modality, implements spatially-aware multimodal fusion with dynamic region-specific weights, and employs joint contrastive learning.

Result: Experiments on two real-world datasets with six modalities and three tasks show MTGRR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: MTGRR effectively addresses modality-specific characteristics and spatial heterogeneity in urban region representation learning, demonstrating superior performance across multiple tasks.

Abstract: Graph-based models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for modeling
multimodal urban data and learning region representations for various
downstream tasks. However, existing approaches face two major limitations. (1)
They typically employ identical graph neural network architectures across all
modalities, failing to capture modality-specific structures and
characteristics. (2) During the fusion stage, they often neglect spatial
heterogeneity by assuming that the aggregation weights of different modalities
remain invariant across regions, resulting in suboptimal representations. To
address these issues, we propose MTGRR, a modality-tailored graph modeling
framework for urban region representation, built upon a multimodal dataset
comprising point of interest (POI), taxi mobility, land use, road element,
remote sensing, and street view images. (1) MTGRR categorizes modalities into
two groups based on spatial density and data characteristics: aggregated-level
and point-level modalities. For aggregated-level modalities, MTGRR employs a
mixture-of-experts (MoE) graph architecture, where each modality is processed
by a dedicated expert GNN to capture distinct modality-specific
characteristics. For the point-level modality, a dual-level GNN is constructed
to extract fine-grained visual semantic features. (2) To obtain effective
region representations under spatial heterogeneity, a spatially-aware
multimodal fusion mechanism is designed to dynamically infer region-specific
modality fusion weights. Building on this graph modeling framework, MTGRR
further employs a joint contrastive learning strategy that integrates region
aggregated-level, point-level, and fusion-level objectives to optimize region
representations. Experiments on two real-world datasets across six modalities
and three tasks demonstrate that MTGRR consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, validating its effectiveness.

*Qifan Li,Jiale Zou,Jinhua Zhang,Wei Long,Xinyu Zhou,Shuhang Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Texture Vector-Quantization and Reconstruction Aware Prediction strategies to address quantization errors and sub-optimal training in VQ-based super-resolution models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VQ-based methods suffer from large quantization errors due to rich visual signals and train predictors with code-level supervision that ignores final reconstruction errors.

Method: Texture Vector-Quantization strategy encodes only missing textures using codebook, and Reconstruction Aware Prediction uses straight-through estimator to train index predictor with image-level supervision.

Result: The proposed TVQ&RAP model delivers photo-realistic super-resolution results with small computational cost.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses quantization and supervision issues in VQ-based visual prior modeling for super-resolution.

Abstract: Vector-quantized based models have recently demonstrated strong potential for
visual prior modeling. However, existing VQ-based methods simply encode visual
features with nearest codebook items and train index predictor with code-level
supervision. Due to the richness of visual signal, VQ encoding often leads to
large quantization error. Furthermore, training predictor with code-level
supervision can not take the final reconstruction errors into consideration,
result in sub-optimal prior modeling accuracy. In this paper we address the
above two issues and propose a Texture Vector-Quantization and a Reconstruction
Aware Prediction strategy. The texture vector-quantization strategy leverages
the task character of super-resolution and only introduce codebook to model the
prior of missing textures. While the reconstruction aware prediction strategy
makes use of the straight-through estimator to directly train index predictor
with image-level supervision. Our proposed generative SR model (TVQ&RAP) is
able to deliver photo-realistic SR results with small computational cost.

*Nayeong Kim,Seong Joon Oh,Suha Kwak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GroupCoOp is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that uses group-specific text prompts to address spurious correlations in vision-language models caused by subgroup imbalance in training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuned vision-language models are vulnerable to spurious correlations from subgroup imbalance in datasets, leading to poor performance on minority groups.

Method: Proposes Group Context Optimization (GroupCoOp) that employs group-specific text prompts as group representatives serving as multiple classifiers, leveraging the semantic knowledge of VLM text encoders to discover effective prompts even for small groups.

Result: Achieved best results on five benchmarks across five CLIP architectures, occasionally outperforming methods that fine-tune the entire network while training only 0.016% of parameters.

Conclusion: GroupCoOp effectively enhances group robustness of fine-tuned VLMs by addressing group imbalance issues through group-specific prompts, achieving strong performance with minimal parameter updates.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of vision-language models (VLMs)
excels in various vision tasks thanks to the rich knowledge and generalization
ability of VLMs. However, recent studies revealed that such fine-tuned VLMs are
vulnerable to spurious correlations stemming from the subgroup imbalance in the
fine-tuning datasets. To resolve this issue, we propose Group Context
Optimization (GroupCoOp), a simple and effective debiased fine-tuning algorithm
that enhances the group robustness of fine-tuned VLMs. Its key idea is to
employ group-specific text prompts as group representatives serving as multiple
classifiers for their target class. The rich semantic knowledge of the text
encoder of VLM enables the discovery of effective group prompts even for groups
with a small number of training samples. Leveraging the group prompts for each
class addresses the issues caused by the group-imbalanced training set, such as
the neglect of minority groups and the scattered distribution of each class in
the embedding space. GroupCoOp achieved the best results on five benchmarks
across five CLIP architectures and occasionally outperformed prior methods that
fine-tune the entire network, despite training only 0.016\% of the network's
parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PCG enables efficient content creation but struggles with consistently producing high-quality, stable levels that meet industry standards.

Method: Uses object segmentation and visual analysis of level images to identify structural gaps, then performs targeted repairs. Evaluated multiple segmentation models to select the most effective one for the repair pipeline.

Result: The method successfully improves stability and playability of AI-generated levels in Angry Birds.

Conclusion: The image-based approach is effective for level repair in Angry Birds and can be extended to other 2D games with similar structural characteristics.

Abstract: Procedural Content Generation (PCG) techniques enable automatic creation of
diverse and complex environments. While PCG facilitates more efficient content
creation, ensuring consistently high-quality, industry-standard content remains
a significant challenge. In this research, we propose a method to identify and
repair unstable levels generated by existing PCG models. We use Angry Birds as
a case study, demonstrating our method on game levels produced by established
PCG approaches. Our method leverages object segmentation and visual analysis of
level images to detect structural gaps and perform targeted repairs. We
evaluate multiple object segmentation models and select the most effective one
as the basis for our repair pipeline. Experimental results show that our method
improves the stability and playability of AI-generated levels. Although our
evaluation is specific to Angry Birds, our image-based approach is designed to
be applicable to a wide range of 2D games with similar level structures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing urban modeling methods have limitations - image-based methods lack geometric continuity and scalability, while graph-based methods overlook parcel semantics. There's a need for methods that combine both geometric and semantic information for realistic urban layout generation.

Method: Fuses geometric and semantic attributes, introduces edge weights, embeds building height in the graph structure, and extends 2D layouts to 3D structures. Users can directly control output by modifying semantic attributes.

Result: The method produces valid, large-scale urban models that maintain geometric continuity and incorporate semantic information, demonstrating effectiveness for urban planning applications.

Conclusion: The framework provides an effective tool for data-driven urban planning and design, offering controllable generation of realistic 3D urban layouts that address limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Urban modeling is essential for city planning, scene synthesis, and gaming.

relations yet overlook parcel semantics. We present a controllable framework
for large-scale 3D vector urban layout generation, conditioned on both geometry

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing single-view imaging and manual inspection methods are prone to errors due to occlusions, restricted perspectives, and lighting inconsistencies, requiring additional inspection stations that disrupt assembly lines and increase costs.

Method: Developed a multi-camera imaging system with three camera views and tailored image fusion methodology to combine results from multiple views, resolving ambiguities and enhancing detection reliability. Created a unique annotated dataset with diverse scenarios.

Result: Significantly outperforms single-view methods, achieving high precision and recall rates in identifying improperly fastened small assembly parts like screws.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable, cost-effective, and accurate quality control mechanism that overcomes single-view limitations, ensuring reliability and safety of assembly lines. The dataset is publicly available for further research.

Abstract: Quality control is a critical aspect of manufacturing, particularly in
ensuring the proper assembly of small components in production lines. Existing
solutions often rely on single-view imaging or manual inspection, which are
prone to errors due to occlusions, restricted perspectives, or lighting
inconsistencies. These limitations require the installation of additional
inspection stations, which could disrupt the assembly line and lead to
increased downtime and costs. This paper introduces a novel multi-view quality
control module designed to address these challenges, integrating a multi-camera
imaging system with advanced object detection algorithms. By capturing images
from three camera views, the system provides comprehensive visual coverage of
components of an assembly process. A tailored image fusion methodology combines
results from multiple views, effectively resolving ambiguities and enhancing
detection reliability. To support this system, we developed a unique dataset
comprising annotated images across diverse scenarios, including varied lighting
conditions, occlusions, and angles, to enhance applicability in real-world
manufacturing environments. Experimental results show that our approach
significantly outperforms single-view methods, achieving high precision and
recall rates in the identification of improperly fastened small assembly parts
such as screws. This work contributes to industrial automation by overcoming
single-view limitations, and providing a scalable, cost-effective, and accurate
quality control mechanism that ensures the reliability and safety of the
assembly line. The dataset used in this study is publicly available to

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Visual Privacy Taxonomy to evaluate Vision-Language Models' understanding of privacy principles, revealing significant inconsistencies in their contextual privacy comprehension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs and VLMs show impressive capabilities, they demonstrate critical limitations in understanding privacy concepts, creating a need to test and improve their privacy awareness.

Method: Developed a comprehensive, multi-level Visual Privacy Taxonomy and evaluated several state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models using this framework.

Result: Evaluation revealed significant inconsistencies in VLMs' understanding of contextual privacy, highlighting their limitations in grasping privacy principles.

Conclusion: There is an urgent need for more robust, privacy-aware AI systems, and the proposed taxonomy provides a foundational benchmark for future research in this area.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence have profoundly transformed the technological
landscape in recent years. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
impressive abilities in reasoning, text comprehension, contextual pattern
recognition, and integrating language with visual understanding. While these
advances offer significant benefits, they also reveal critical limitations in
the models' ability to grasp the notion of privacy. There is hence substantial
interest in determining if and how these models can understand and enforce
privacy principles, particularly given the lack of supporting resources to test
such a task. In this work, we address these challenges by examining how legal
frameworks can inform the capabilities of these emerging technologies. To this
end, we introduce a comprehensive, multi-level Visual Privacy Taxonomy that
captures a wide range of privacy issues, designed to be scalable and adaptable
to existing and future research needs. Furthermore, we evaluate the
capabilities of several state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs),
revealing significant inconsistencies in their understanding of contextual
privacy. Our work contributes both a foundational taxonomy for future research
and a critical benchmark of current model limitations, demonstrating the urgent
need for more robust, privacy-aware AI systems.

*Hanyu Zhou,Gim Hee Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Uni4D-LLM is the first unified vision-language model framework that enables both 4D scene understanding and generation within a single Transformer-based architecture, addressing the paradigm gap between autoregressive understanding and diffusion-based generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D/4D approaches use separate models for scene understanding (autoregressive) and generation (diffusion), preventing a single model from handling both tasks in dynamic 4D settings where spatiotemporal modeling is crucial.

Method: Extracts semantic features for understanding and noisy-injected appearance features for generation, incorporates 4D geometric cues, fuses them into spatiotemporal-aware visual representation via adaptive cross-attention, and integrates both tasks into a single LLM with task-specific heads.

Result: Achieves competitive or superior results compared to state-of-the-art models on multiple benchmarks, offering the first true unification of 4D scene understanding and generation.

Conclusion: Uni4D-LLM successfully bridges the paradigm gap between understanding and generation in 4D scenes through shared representations and architecture, demonstrating the feasibility of unified spatiotemporal-aware vision-language modeling.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in 2D
scene understanding and generation, but extending this unification to the
physical world remains an open challenge. Existing 3D and 4D approaches
typically embed scene geometry into autoregressive model for semantic
understanding and diffusion model for content generation. This paradigm gap
prevents a single model from jointly handling both tasks, especially in dynamic
4D settings where spatiotemporal modeling is critical. We propose Uni4D-LLM,
the first unified VLM framework with spatiotemporal awareness for 4D scene
understanding and generation. Our design is guided by two key insights: 1)
Unification requires a shared representation. We extract semantic features for
understanding and noisy-injected appearance features for generation,
incorporate 4D geometric cues, and fuse them into a spatiotemporal-aware visual
representation through adaptive cross-attention. 2) Unification requires a
shared architecture. Both autoregression and diffusion are built on Transformer
backbones, and this enables integration into a single LLM with task-specific
heads. By aligning visual and linguistic representations, our Uni4D-LLM
produces predictions for both understanding and generation within one
Transformer-based framework. We further apply instruction fine-tuning on
diverse 4D vision-language datasets to improve generalization across tasks.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Uni4D-LLM
achieves competitive or superior results compared to state-of-the-art models
and offers the first true unification of 4D scene understanding and generation.

TL;DR: Evaluation of Segment Concept (SeC) framework's zero-shot performance on MOSEv2 dataset, achieving 39.7 JFn and 2nd place in Complex VOS track without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous VOS methods rely heavily on appearance-based matching and lack robustness against visual changes, occlusions, and scene shifts due to insufficient high-level conceptual understanding of targets.

Method: Uses Segment Concept (SeC) framework with Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) to establish deep semantic understanding of objects for more persistent segmentation.

Result: Achieved 39.7 JFn on MOSEv2 test set and ranked 2nd place in Complex VOS track of 7th Large-scale Video Object Segmentation Challenge without any fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The SeC framework demonstrates strong zero-shot performance on challenging VOS tasks, showing the effectiveness of using LVLM for semantic understanding to overcome limitations of appearance-based methods.

Abstract: Semi-supervised Video Object Segmentation aims to segment a specified target
throughout a video sequence, initialized by a first-frame mask. Previous
methods rely heavily on appearance-based pattern matching and thus exhibit
limited robustness against challenges such as drastic visual changes,
occlusions, and scene shifts. This failure is often attributed to a lack of
high-level conceptual understanding of the target. The recently proposed
Segment Concept (SeC) framework mitigated this limitation by using a Large
Vision-Language Model (LVLM) to establish a deep semantic understanding of the
object for more persistent segmentation. In this work, we evaluate its
zero-shot performance on the challenging coMplex video Object SEgmentation v2
(MOSEv2) dataset. Without any fine-tuning on the training set, SeC achieved
39.7 \JFn on the test set and ranked 2nd place in the Complex VOS track of the
7th Large-scale Video Object Segmentation Challenge.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces T23D-CompBench, a comprehensive benchmark for compositional Text-to-3D generation, and proposes Rank2Score, a two-stage training method for T23D quality assessment that outperforms existing metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Text-to-3D quality assessment faces challenges due to outdated benchmarks and limitations in current objective metrics, which lack fine-grained evaluation and robust feature extraction.

Method: Created T23D-CompBench with 5 components and 12 sub-components for compositional prompts, generating 3,600 textured meshes from 10 state-of-the-art models. Proposed Rank2Score with two-stage training: first stage uses supervised contrastive regression and curriculum learning for pairwise training, second stage refines predictions using mean opinion scores.

Result: Collected 129,600 reliable human ratings through large-scale subjective experiments. Rank2Score consistently outperforms existing metrics across multiple dimensions and can serve as a reward function to optimize generative models.

Conclusion: The proposed benchmark and Rank2Score method effectively address limitations in Text-to-3D quality assessment, providing better alignment with human judgments and enabling improved evaluation of generative models.

Abstract: Recent advances in Text-to-3D (T23D) generative models have enabled the
synthesis of diverse, high-fidelity 3D assets from textual prompts. However,
existing challenges restrict the development of reliable T23D quality
assessment (T23DQA). First, existing benchmarks are outdated, fragmented, and
coarse-grained, making fine-grained metric training infeasible. Moreover,
current objective metrics exhibit inherent design limitations, resulting in
non-representative feature extraction and diminished metric robustness. To
address these limitations, we introduce T23D-CompBench, a comprehensive
benchmark for compositional T23D generation. We define five components with
twelve sub-components for compositional prompts, which are used to generate
3,600 textured meshes from ten state-of-the-art generative models. A
large-scale subjective experiment is conducted to collect 129,600 reliable
human ratings across different perspectives. Based on T23D-CompBench, we
further propose Rank2Score, an effective evaluator with two-stage training for
T23DQA. Rank2Score enhances pairwise training via supervised contrastive
regression and curriculum learning in the first stage, and subsequently refines
predictions using mean opinion scores to achieve closer alignment with human
judgments in the second stage. Extensive experiments and downstream
applications demonstrate that Rank2Score consistently outperforms existing
metrics across multiple dimensions and can additionally serve as a reward
function to optimize generative models. The project is available at

Motivation: Current saliency maps only highlight important regions without explaining their meaning, while concept-based explanations lack the ability to simultaneously reveal learned concepts, their corresponding regions, and their contributions to predictions.

Method: Uses a branched network that shares activation maps with an image classifier and learns to mimic VLM embeddings. Predicts concepts and represents their regions via weighted sum of activation maps using gradient-based weights, then quantifies contributions based on impact on classification score.

Result: Outperforms existing approaches in qualitative and quantitative evaluations, excels in zero-shot inference for unseen concepts, and provides a general framework that handles arbitrary concepts without requiring annotated datasets.

Conclusion: CE-FAM successfully addresses the limitations of existing explanation methods by providing comprehensive concept-based explanations that reveal learned concepts, their regions, and contributions while leveraging VLM knowledge for flexibility.

Abstract: Although saliency maps can highlight important regions to explain the
reasoning behind image classification in artificial intelligence (AI), the
meaning of these regions is left to the user's interpretation. In contrast,
conceptbased explanations decompose AI predictions into humanunderstandable
concepts, clarifying their contributions. However, few methods can
simultaneously reveal what concepts an image classifier learns, which regions
are associated with them, and how they contribute to predictions. We propose a
novel concept-based explanation method, Concept-based Explanation via Fusion of
Activation Maps (CE-FAM). It employs a branched network that shares activation
maps with an image classifier and learns to mimic the embeddings of a Vision
and Language Model (VLM). The branch network predicts concepts in an image, and
their corresponding regions are represented by a weighted sum of activation
maps, with weights given by the gradients of the concept prediction scores.
Their contributions are quantified based on their impact on the image
classification score. Our method provides a general framework for identifying
the concept regions and their contributions while leveraging VLM knowledge to
handle arbitrary concepts without requiring an annotated dataset. Furthermore,
we introduce a novel evaluation metric to assess the accuracy of the concept
regions. Our qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate our method
outperforms existing approaches and excels in zero-shot inference for unseen
concepts.

*Djamel Eddine Boukhari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FairViT-GAN is a hybrid CNN-ViT framework with adversarial debiasing that achieves state-of-the-art facial beauty prediction while significantly reducing ethnic bias and improving fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing facial beauty prediction models have architectural limitations (CNNs miss global context, ViTs miss fine details), inherent demographic biases, and lack transparency.

Method: Hybrid framework combining CNN branch for local features and ViT branch for global context, with adversarial debiasing mechanism to make representations invariant to protected attributes.

Result: Achieved Pearson Correlation of 0.9230 and RMSE of 0.2650 on SCUT-FBP5500, with 82.9% reduction in performance gap between ethnic subgroups and adversary accuracy dropping to 52.1%.

Conclusion: FairViT-GAN provides a robust, transparent, and significantly fairer blueprint for responsible AI systems in subjective visual assessment.

Abstract: Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) has made significant strides with the
application of deep learning, yet state-of-the-art models often exhibit
critical limitations, including architectural constraints, inherent demographic
biases, and a lack of transparency. Existing methods, primarily based on
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), excel at capturing local texture but
struggle with global facial harmony, while Vision Transformers (ViTs)
effectively model long-range dependencies but can miss fine-grained details.
Furthermore, models trained on benchmark datasets can inadvertently learn and
perpetuate societal biases related to protected attributes like ethnicity. To
address these interconnected challenges, we propose \textbf{FairViT-GAN}, a
novel hybrid framework that synergistically integrates a CNN branch for local
feature extraction and a ViT branch for global context modeling. More
significantly, we introduce an adversarial debiasing mechanism where the
feature extractor is explicitly trained to produce representations that are
invariant to protected attributes, thereby actively mitigating algorithmic
bias. Our framework's transparency is enhanced by visualizing the distinct
focus of each architectural branch. Extensive experiments on the SCUT-FBP5500
benchmark demonstrate that FairViT-GAN not only sets a new state-of-the-art in
predictive accuracy, achieving a Pearson Correlation of \textbf{0.9230} and
reducing RMSE to \textbf{0.2650}, but also excels in fairness. Our analysis
reveals a remarkable \textbf{82.9\% reduction in the performance gap} between
ethnic subgroups, with the adversary's classification accuracy dropping to
near-random chance (52.1\%). We believe FairViT-GAN provides a robust,
transparent, and significantly fairer blueprint for developing responsible AI
systems for subjective visual assessment.

*Jiajin Tang,Zhengxuan Wei,Yuchen Zhu,Cheng Shi,Guanbin Li,Liang Lin,Sibei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sim-DETR improves temporal sentence grounding by addressing query conflicts in DETR through constrained self-attention and query-to-frame alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard DETR enhancement strategies degrade performance in temporal sentence grounding due to query conflicts between similar target moments and internal conflicts between global semantics and local localization.

Method: Extends standard DETR with two modifications: (1) constraining self-attention between queries based on semantic and positional overlap, and (2) adding query-to-frame alignment to bridge global and local contexts.

Result: Sim-DETR unlocks the full potential of DETR for temporal sentence grounding, offering a strong baseline for future research.

Conclusion: The proposed Sim-DETR provides an effective solution to query conflicts in DETR for temporal sentence grounding, demonstrating superior performance compared to standard DETR approaches.

Abstract: Temporal sentence grounding aims to identify exact moments in a video that
correspond to a given textual query, typically addressed with detection
transformer (DETR) solutions. However, we find that typical strategies designed
to enhance DETR do not improve, and may even degrade, its performance in this
task. We systematically analyze and identify the root causes of this abnormal
behavior: (1) conflicts between queries from similar target moments and (2)
internal query conflicts due to the tension between global semantics and local
localization. Building on these insights, we propose a simple yet powerful
baseline, Sim-DETR, which extends the standard DETR with two minor
modifications in the decoder layers: (1) constraining self-attention between
queries based on their semantic and positional overlap and (2) adding
query-to-frame alignment to bridge the global and local contexts. Experiments
demonstrate that Sim-DETR unlocks the full potential of DETR for temporal
sentence grounding, offering a strong baseline for future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Information-Grounding Guidance (IGG) addresses information inconsistencies in autoregressive image generation by anchoring guidance to semantically important regions through attention, improving image quality and semantic alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models for image generation suffer from information inconsistencies between patches across timesteps due to progressive resolution scaling, which scatters guidance signals and causes them to drift from conditioning information, resulting in ambiguous and unfaithful features.

Method: Proposes Information-Grounding Guidance (IGG), a novel mechanism that anchors guidance to semantically important regions through attention. It adaptively reinforces informative patches during sampling to ensure guidance and content remain tightly aligned.

Result: IGG delivers sharper, more coherent, and semantically grounded images across both class-conditioned and text-to-image generation tasks, setting a new benchmark for AR-based methods.

Conclusion: IGG effectively tackles the critical weakness of information inconsistencies in autoregressive image generation models, enabling better alignment between guidance and content for improved image quality and semantic faithfulness.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models based on next-scale prediction are rapidly
emerging as a powerful tool for image generation, but they face a critical
weakness: information inconsistencies between patches across timesteps
introduced by progressive resolution scaling. These inconsistencies scatter
guidance signals, causing them to drift away from conditioning information and
leaving behind ambiguous, unfaithful features. We tackle this challenge with
Information-Grounding Guidance (IGG), a novel mechanism that anchors guidance
to semantically important regions through attention. By adaptively reinforcing
informative patches during sampling, IGG ensures that guidance and content
remain tightly aligned. Across both class-conditioned and text-to-image
generation tasks, IGG delivers sharper, more coherent, and semantically
grounded images, setting a new benchmark for AR-based methods.

TL;DR: PCRI is a new metric that measures MLLM robustness to visual context variations by comparing performance between localized image patches and full-image inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation metrics don't capture MLLM sensitivity to irrelevant visual context, which undermines reliability in real-world settings.

Method: PCRI systematically quantifies robustness by measuring performance changes between localized image patches and full-image input across 19 MLLMs and 15 benchmarks.

Result: Most leading models are brittle to background noise, with only InternVL2-26B and Qwen2VL-72B showing consistent robustness across tasks. PCRI reveals how different architectures handle visual context.

Conclusion: PCRI enables rigorous comparison of context robustness, supporting principled model selection and guiding development of more robust architectures and training strategies.

Abstract: The reliability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in real-world
settings is often undermined by sensitivity to irrelevant or distracting visual
context, an aspect not captured by existing evaluation metrics. We introduce
the \textbf{Patch Context Robustness Index (PCRI)}, the first systematic and
interpretable score for quantifying MLLM robustness to variations in visual
context granularity, measuring performance changes between localized image
patches and full-image input.
  Applying PCRI to 19 state-of-the-art MLLMs across 15 vision-language
benchmarks, we find that most leading models remain brittle to background
noise, with only a few, such as InternVL2-26B and Qwen2VL-72B, demonstrating
consistent robustness across tasks. PCRI analysis also highlights how different
model architectures handle and integrate visual context, offering actionable
diagnostic insight for both researchers and practitioners.
  PCRI enables rigorous comparison of context robustness, supporting principled
model selection and guiding the development of future architectures and
training strategies for robust, real-world deployment.

### [166] [Learning Adaptive Pseudo-Label Selection for Semi-Supervised 3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23880)
*Taehun Kong,Tae-Kyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a learnable pseudo-labeling module for semi-supervised 3D object detection that automatically selects high-quality pseudo-labels using context-adaptive thresholds and score fusion, with soft supervision to handle label noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pseudo-label selection methods in SS3DOD rely on manual thresholding or partial information, overlooking contextual factors like object distances, classes, and learning states, leading to suboptimal pseudo-label quality assessment.

Method: Introduces two networks at teacher output level that assess pseudo-label quality via score fusion and determine context-adaptive thresholds supervised by pseudo-label-GT bounding box alignment. Uses soft supervision strategy for robust learning under label noise.

Result: Extensive experiments on KITTI and Waymo datasets show the method selects high-precision pseudo-labels while maintaining wider context coverage and higher recall, significantly improving SS3DOD performance.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses pseudo-label quality assessment in SS3DOD by leveraging contextual information and adaptive thresholding, achieving superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Semi-supervised 3D object detection (SS3DOD) aims to reduce costly 3D
annotations utilizing unlabeled data. Recent studies adopt pseudo-label-based
teacher-student frameworks and demonstrate impressive performance. The main
challenge of these frameworks is in selecting high-quality pseudo-labels from
the teacher's predictions. Most previous methods, however, select pseudo-labels
by comparing confidence scores over thresholds manually set. The latest works
tackle the challenge either by dynamic thresholding or refining the quality of
pseudo-labels. Such methods still overlook contextual information e.g. object
distances, classes, and learning states, and inadequately assess the
pseudo-label quality using partial information available from the networks. In
this work, we propose a novel SS3DOD framework featuring a learnable
pseudo-labeling module designed to automatically and adaptively select
high-quality pseudo-labels. Our approach introduces two networks at the teacher
output level. These networks reliably assess the quality of pseudo-labels by
the score fusion and determine context-adaptive thresholds, which are
supervised by the alignment of pseudo-labels over GT bounding boxes.
Additionally, we introduce a soft supervision strategy that can learn robustly
under pseudo-label noises. This helps the student network prioritize cleaner
labels over noisy ones in semi-supervised learning. Extensive experiments on
the KITTI and Waymo datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The
proposed method selects high-precision pseudo-labels while maintaining a wider
coverage of contexts and a higher recall rate, significantly improving relevant
SS3DOD methods.

### [167] [Tunable-Generalization Diffusion Powered by Self-Supervised Contextual Sub-Data for Low-Dose CT Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23885)
*Guoquan Wei,Zekun Zhou,Liu Shi,Wenzhe Shan,Qiegen Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SuperDiff is a self-supervised tunable-generalization diffusion method for low-dose CT denoising that requires only LDCT projection data, outperforming existing methods in reconstruction and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models for low-dose CT denoising rely on paired data and generalize poorly, while diffusion models need clean data distribution and self-supervised methods struggle with dose generalization.

Method: Uses contextual subdata similarity adaptive sensing for projection domain denoising, combines knowledge distillation with latent diffusion models for detail optimization, and employs pixel-level self-correcting fusion for image fidelity enhancement.

Result: Qualitative and quantitative evaluations on datasets and real data show SuperDiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction and generalization performance.

Conclusion: SuperDiff provides an effective self-supervised solution for LDCT denoising with superior generalization capabilities across different doses using only projection domain data.

Abstract: Current models based on deep learning for low-dose CT denoising rely heavily
on paired data and generalize poorly. Even the more concerned diffusion models
need to learn the distribution of clean data for reconstruction, which is
difficult to satisfy in medical clinical applications. At the same time,
self-supervised-based methods face the challenge of significant degradation of
generalizability of models pre-trained for the current dose to expand to other
doses. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel method of
tunable-generalization diffusion powered by self-supervised contextual sub-data
for low-dose CT reconstruction, named SuperDiff. Firstly, a contextual subdata
similarity adaptive sensing strategy is designed for denoising centered on the
LDCT projection domain, which provides an initial prior for the subsequent
progress. Subsequently, the initial prior is used to combine knowledge
distillation with a deep combination of latent diffusion models for optimizing
image details. The pre-trained model is used for inference reconstruction, and
the pixel-level self-correcting fusion technique is proposed for fine-grained
reconstruction of the image domain to enhance the image fidelity, using the
initial prior and the LDCT image as a guide. In addition, the technique is
flexibly applied to the generalization of upper and lower doses or even unseen
doses. Dual-domain strategy cascade for self-supervised LDCT denoising,
SuperDiff requires only LDCT projection domain data for training and testing.
Full qualitative and quantitative evaluations on both datasets and real data
show that SuperDiff consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods
in terms of reconstruction and generalization performance.

*Tatsuro Banno,Takehiko Ohkawa,Ruicong Liu,Ryosuke Furuta,Yoichi Sato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AssemblyHands-X is the first markerless 3D hand-body benchmark for bimanual activities, showing that joint modeling of hand and body cues improves action recognition over using either alone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack kinematic-level annotations for both hands and body in bimanual activities, and marker-based systems introduce visual artifacts that limit generalization to natural videos.

Method: Constructed a pipeline combining multi-view triangulation with SMPL-X mesh fitting for 3D pose annotation from synchronized multi-view videos, then validated different input representations across action recognition models.

Result: Pose-based action inference is more efficient and accurate than video baselines, and joint modeling of hand and body cues improves action recognition over using hands or upper body alone.

Conclusion: Modeling interdependent hand-body dynamics is crucial for holistic understanding of bimanual activities, highlighting the importance of hand-body coordination in action recognition.

Abstract: Bimanual human activities inherently involve coordinated movements of both
hands and body. However, the impact of this coordination in activity
understanding has not been systematically evaluated due to the lack of suitable
datasets. Such evaluation demands kinematic-level annotations (e.g., 3D pose)
for the hands and body, yet existing 3D activity datasets typically annotate
either hand or body pose. Another line of work employs marker-based motion
capture to provide full-body pose, but the physical markers introduce visual
artifacts, thereby limiting models' generalization to natural, markerless
videos. To address these limitations, we present AssemblyHands-X, the first
markerless 3D hand-body benchmark for bimanual activities, designed to study
the effect of hand-body coordination for action recognition. We begin by
constructing a pipeline for 3D pose annotation from synchronized multi-view
videos. Our approach combines multi-view triangulation with SMPL-X mesh
fitting, yielding reliable 3D registration of hands and upper body. We then
validate different input representations (e.g., video, hand pose, body pose, or
hand-body pose) across recent action recognition models based on graph
convolution or spatio-temporal attention. Our extensive experiments show that
pose-based action inference is more efficient and accurate than video
baselines. Moreover, joint modeling of hand and body cues improves action
recognition over using hands or upper body alone, highlighting the importance
of modeling interdependent hand-body dynamics for a holistic understanding of
bimanual activities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CCU is a cross-modal contrastive unlearning framework that addresses privacy leakage in multimodal systems by selectively unlearning visual data while preserving cross-modal knowledge and structural stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual modality is most vulnerable to privacy leakage in multimodal applications, and existing unlearning methods fail to preserve cross-modal knowledge and maintain intra-class structural stability during visual unlearning.

Method: Proposes Cross-modal Contrastive Unlearning (CCU) with three components: selective visual unlearning using inverse contrastive learning, cross-modal knowledge retention via semantic consistency, and dual-set contrastive separation to isolate structural perturbations.

Result: Extensive experiments on three datasets show CCU achieves 7.12% accuracy improvement with only 7% of the unlearning time compared to the top-accuracy baseline.

Conclusion: CCU effectively addresses privacy leakage in multimodal systems by balancing selective unlearning with cross-modal knowledge preservation and structural stability maintenance.

Abstract: Visual modality is the most vulnerable to privacy leakage in real-world
multimodal applications like autonomous driving with visual and radar data;
Machine unlearning removes specific training data from pre-trained models to
address privacy leakage, however, existing methods fail to preserve cross-modal
knowledge and maintain intra-class structural stability of retain data, leading
to reduced overall and other modalities' performance during visual unlearning;
to address these challenges, we propose a Cross-modal Contrastive Unlearning
(CCU) framework, which integrates three key components: (a) selective visual
unlearning: employing inverse contrastive learning to dissociate visual
representations from their original semantics, (b) cross-modal knowledge
retention: preserving other modalities' discriminability through semantic
consistency, and (c) dual-set contrastive separation: preserving the model
performance via isolation of structural perturbations between the unlearn set
and retain set; extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the
superiority of CCU, and our method achieves a 7.12% accuracy improvement with
only 7% of the unlearning time compared to the top-accuracy baseline.

TL;DR: Q-FSRU combines frequency domain processing with quantum-inspired retrieval for medical VQA, achieving better performance on complex clinical questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical questions requiring both image and text understanding remain challenging in healthcare AI, needing models that can handle complex reasoning while filtering noise.

Method: Uses Fast Fourier Transform to shift medical image and text features to frequency domain, then integrates quantum-inspired retrieval to fetch relevant medical facts from external sources using quantum similarity techniques.

Result: Outperforms previous models on VQA-RAD dataset, especially on complex cases requiring image-text reasoning, with improved performance and explainability.

Conclusion: The combination of frequency processing and quantum information provides a promising approach for developing intelligent, transparent AI tools for medical professionals.

Abstract: Solving tough clinical questions that require both image and text
understanding is still a major challenge in healthcare AI. In this work, we
propose Q-FSRU, a new model that combines Frequency Spectrum Representation and
Fusion (FSRU) with a method called Quantum Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(Quantum RAG) for medical Visual Question Answering (VQA). The model takes in
features from medical images and related text, then shifts them into the
frequency domain using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). This helps it focus on
more meaningful data and filter out noise or less useful information. To
improve accuracy and ensure that answers are based on real knowledge, we add a
quantum inspired retrieval system. It fetches useful medical facts from
external sources using quantum-based similarity techniques. These details are
then merged with the frequency-based features for stronger reasoning. We
evaluated our model using the VQA-RAD dataset, which includes real radiology
images and questions. The results showed that Q-FSRU outperforms earlier
models, especially on complex cases needing image text reasoning. The mix of
frequency and quantum information improves both performance and explainability.
Overall, this approach offers a promising way to build smart, clear, and
helpful AI tools for doctors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical imaging foundation models need to adapt over time, but full retraining is often prevented by privacy constraints and high costs, requiring privacy-preserving continual learning approaches.

Method: Pairs class-conditional diffusion replay with Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) using a compact Vision Transformer backbone, avoiding storage of patient exemplars.

Result: Achieves 0.851 AUROC on CheXpert, reduces forgetting by more than 30% compared to DER++, and approaches joint training performance (0.869 AUROC) while remaining efficient and privacy-preserving.

Conclusion: Provides a practical route for scalable, privacy-aware continual adaptation of clinical imaging models, with forgetting connected to replay fidelity and Fisher-weighted parameter drift.

Abstract: Medical imaging foundation models must adapt over time, yet full retraining
is often blocked by privacy constraints and cost. We present a continual
learning framework that avoids storing patient exemplars by pairing class
conditional diffusion replay with Elastic Weight Consolidation. Using a compact
Vision Transformer backbone, we evaluate across eight MedMNIST v2 tasks and
CheXpert. On CheXpert our approach attains 0.851 AUROC, reduces forgetting by
more than 30\% relative to DER\texttt{++}, and approaches joint training at
0.869 AUROC, while remaining efficient and privacy preserving. Analyses connect
forgetting to two measurable factors: fidelity of replay and Fisher weighted
parameter drift, highlighting the complementary roles of replay diffusion and
synaptic stability. The results indicate a practical route for scalable,
privacy aware continual adaptation of clinical imaging models.

TL;DR: FedDA is a federated domain adaptation framework that addresses modality heterogeneity in medical image segmentation by using feature-level adversarial learning to align feature maps across clients, enabling cross-domain federated aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning in healthcare faces challenges from medical resource imbalance and data heterogeneity where different clients have medical images of different modalities, making cross-domain segmentation difficult.

Method: Proposes feature-level adversarial learning among clients by aligning feature maps through an embedded adversarial training mechanism to enhance model generalization across domains.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on three medical image datasets show FedDA achieves cross-domain federated aggregation, gives single modality clients cross-modality processing capabilities, and outperforms state-of-the-art federated aggregation algorithms.

Conclusion: FedDA successfully addresses modality heterogeneity in federated medical image segmentation through domain adaptation, providing robust performance for cross-domain processing.

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative training of machine learning models
among different clients while ensuring data privacy, emerging as the mainstream
for breaking data silos in the healthcare domain. However, the imbalance of
medical resources, data corruption or improper data preservation may lead to a
situation where different clients possess medical images of different modality.
This heterogeneity poses a significant challenge for cross-domain medical image
segmentation within the federated learning framework. To address this
challenge, we propose a new Federated Domain Adaptation (FedDA) segmentation
training framework. Specifically, we propose a feature-level adversarial
learning among clients by aligning feature maps across clients through
embedding an adversarial training mechanism. This design can enhance the
model's generalization on multiple domains and alleviate the negative impact
from domain-shift. Comprehensive experiments on three medical image datasets
demonstrate that our proposed FedDA substantially achieves cross-domain
federated aggregation, endowing single modality client with cross-modality
processing capabilities, and consistently delivers robust performance compared
to state-of-the-art federated aggregation algorithms in objective and
subjective assessment. Our code are available at

TL;DR: This paper introduces EditScore, a specialized reward model for instruction-guided image editing that enables effective reinforcement learning by providing high-fidelity reward signals, overcoming previous limitations in RL adoption for image editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current instruction-guided image editing models struggle with complex instructions and require multiple samples. RL offers promise but has been hindered by the lack of high-fidelity, efficient reward signals.

Method: Developed EditReward-Bench benchmark for systematic evaluation, then created EditScore reward models (7B-72B) through meticulous data curation and filtering, coupled with a self-ensemble strategy tailored for generative tasks.

Result: EditScore matches performance of proprietary VLMs, with the largest variant surpassing GPT-5 in the benchmark. When applied to OmniGen2 base model, it enables efficient RL training and shows substantial performance improvements.

Conclusion: A high-fidelity, domain-specialized reward model is key to unlocking RL's full potential in image editing, providing the first systematic path from benchmarking to reward modeling to RL training in this domain.

Abstract: Instruction-guided image editing has achieved remarkable progress, yet
current models still face challenges with complex instructions and often
require multiple samples to produce a desired result. Reinforcement Learning
(RL) offers a promising solution, but its adoption in image editing has been
severely hindered by the lack of a high-fidelity, efficient reward signal. In
this work, we present a comprehensive methodology to overcome this barrier,
centered on the development of a state-of-the-art, specialized reward model. We
first introduce EditReward-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark to systematically
evaluate reward models on editing quality. Building on this benchmark, we
develop EditScore, a series of reward models (7B-72B) for evaluating the
quality of instruction-guided image editing. Through meticulous data curation
and filtering, EditScore effectively matches the performance of learning
proprietary VLMs. Furthermore, coupled with an effective self-ensemble strategy
tailored for the generative nature of EditScore, our largest variant even
surpasses GPT-5 in the benchmark. We then demonstrate that a high-fidelity
reward model is the key to unlocking online RL for image editing. Our
experiments show that, while even the largest open-source VLMs fail to provide
an effective learning signal, EditScore enables efficient and robust policy
optimization. Applying our framework to a strong base model, OmniGen2, results
in a final model that shows a substantial and consistent performance uplift.
Overall, this work provides the first systematic path from benchmarking to
reward modeling to RL training in image editing, showing that a high-fidelity,
domain-specialized reward model is the key to unlocking the full potential of
RL in this domain.

### [176] [MoReact: Generating Reactive Motion from Textual Descriptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23911)
*Xiyan Xu,Sirui Xu,Yu-Xiong Wang,Liang-Yan Gui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoReact is a diffusion-based method for text-driven human reaction generation that disentangles global trajectory and local motion generation to produce realistic, diverse reactions that match counterpart movements and follow textual guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to integrate rich semantic information and lack adaptive responsiveness to diverse interaction scenarios. Current approaches either treat multiple individuals as a single entity or rely solely on one person's motion, missing the semantic underpinnings of human interactions.

Method: MoReact uses a diffusion-based approach that sequentially generates global trajectories first, then local motions. It introduces a novel interaction loss to enhance realism of close interactions and is trained on adapted two-person motion data.

Result: The method produces realistic, diverse, and controllable reactions that closely match counterpart movements while adhering to textual guidance. Experiments demonstrate efficacy for this novel text-driven human reaction generation task.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses limitations of existing models by focusing on text-driven human reaction generation, producing motion sequences that complement opponent movements and semantically fit described interactions through sequential trajectory and motion generation.

Abstract: Modeling and generating human reactions poses a significant challenge with
broad applications for computer vision and human-computer interaction. Existing
methods either treat multiple individuals as a single entity, directly
generating interactions, or rely solely on one person's motion to generate the
other's reaction, failing to integrate the rich semantic information that
underpins human interactions. Yet, these methods often fall short in adaptive
responsiveness, i.e., the ability to accurately respond to diverse and dynamic
interaction scenarios. Recognizing this gap, our work introduces an approach
tailored to address the limitations of existing models by focusing on
text-driven human reaction generation. Our model specifically generates
realistic motion sequences for individuals that responding to the other's
actions based on a descriptive text of the interaction scenario. The goal is to
produce motion sequences that not only complement the opponent's movements but
also semantically fit the described interactions. To achieve this, we present
MoReact, a diffusion-based method designed to disentangle the generation of
global trajectories and local motions sequentially. This approach stems from
the observation that generating global trajectories first is crucial for
guiding local motion, ensuring better alignment with given action and text.
Furthermore, we introduce a novel interaction loss to enhance the realism of
generated close interactions. Our experiments, utilizing data adapted from a
two-person motion dataset, demonstrate the efficacy of our approach for this
novel task, which is capable of producing realistic, diverse, and controllable
reactions that not only closely match the movements of the counterpart but also
adhere to the textual guidance. Please find our webpage at

*Yihang Guo,Tianyuan Yu,Liang Bai,Yanming Guo,Yirun Ruan,William Li,Weishi Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper analyzes optimization imbalance in multi-task learning (MTL) and finds that gradient norm correlation enables simple loss scaling to match expensive grid search performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why multi-task learning often underperforms single-task models due to unbalanced optimization and task interference, and to find more efficient solutions than costly grid searches.

Method: Systematic experimental analysis of MTL optimization factors, including investigation of gradient norms, Vision Foundation Models, and data scaling effects across different datasets.

Result: Revealed strong correlation between optimization imbalance and task-specific gradient norms; demonstrated that simple gradient-norm-based loss scaling achieves comparable performance to expensive grid searches.

Conclusion: Understanding and controlling gradient dynamics provides a more direct path to stable multi-task learning than developing complex methods, with gradient-norm-based scaling being an effective practical solution.

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) aims to build general-purpose vision systems by
training a single network to perform multiple tasks jointly. While promising,
its potential is often hindered by "unbalanced optimization", where task
interference leads to subpar performance compared to single-task models. To
facilitate research in MTL, this paper presents a systematic experimental
analysis to dissect the factors contributing to this persistent problem. Our
investigation confirms that the performance of existing optimization methods
varies inconsistently across datasets, and advanced architectures still rely on
costly grid-searched loss weights. Furthermore, we show that while powerful
Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) provide strong initialization, they do not
inherently resolve the optimization imbalance, and merely increasing data
quantity offers limited benefits. A crucial finding emerges from our analysis:
a strong correlation exists between the optimization imbalance and the norm of
task-specific gradients. We demonstrate that this insight is directly
applicable, showing that a straightforward strategy of scaling task losses
according to their gradient norms can achieve performance comparable to that of
an extensive and computationally expensive grid search. Our comprehensive
analysis suggests that understanding and controlling gradient dynamics is a
more direct path to stable MTL than developing increasingly complex methods.

*Kuanrong Liu,Siyuan Liang,Cheng Qian,Ming Zhang,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper analyzes adversarial transfer across CLIP-based models and proposes MT-AdvCLIP, a framework that enhances cross-task adversarial attacks by leveraging fine-grained task perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP struggles with fine-grained tasks and its robustness to adversarial perturbations is underexplored. Understanding adversarial transfer across tasks is crucial for assessing CLIP's generalization limits and security risks.

Method: Proposed Multi-Task Adversarial CLIP (MT-AdvCLIP) with task-aware feature aggregation loss to generate perturbations with enhanced cross-task generalization capability, strengthening attacks from fine-grained tasks on the shared CLIP backbone.

Result: MT-AdvCLIP significantly improves adversarial transfer success rate by over 39% on average across multiple tasks against various CLIP-derived models, without increasing perturbation budget.

Conclusion: The study reveals adversarial transfer mechanisms in multi-task CLIP models and provides insights for multi-task robustness evaluation and adversarial example design.

Abstract: As a general-purpose vision-language pretraining model, CLIP demonstrates
strong generalization ability in image-text alignment tasks and has been widely
adopted in downstream applications such as image classification and image-text
retrieval. However, it struggles with fine-grained tasks such as object
detection and semantic segmentation. While many variants aim to improve CLIP on
these tasks, its robustness to adversarial perturbations remains underexplored.
Understanding how adversarial examples transfer across tasks is key to
assessing CLIP's generalization limits and security risks. In this work, we
conduct a systematic empirical analysis of the cross-task transfer behavior of
CLIP-based models on image-text retrieval, object detection, and semantic
segmentation under adversarial perturbations. We find that adversarial examples
generated from fine-grained tasks (e.g., object detection and semantic
segmentation) often exhibit stronger transfer potential than those from
coarse-grained tasks, enabling more effective attacks against the original CLIP
model. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel framework, Multi-Task
Adversarial CLIP (MT-AdvCLIP), which introduces a task-aware feature
aggregation loss and generates perturbations with enhanced cross-task
generalization capability. This design strengthens the attack effectiveness of
fine-grained task models on the shared CLIP backbone. Experimental results on
multiple public datasets show that MT-AdvCLIP significantly improves the
adversarial transfer success rate (The average attack success rate across
multiple tasks is improved by over 39%.) against various CLIP-derived models,
without increasing the perturbation budget. This study reveals the transfer
mechanism of adversarial examples in multi-task CLIP models, offering new
insights into multi-task robustness evaluation and adversarial example design.

### [179] [Token Painter: Training-Free Text-Guided Image Inpainting via Mask Autoregressive Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23919)
*Longtao Jiang,Mingfei Han,Lei Chen,Yongqiang Yu,Feng Zhao,Xiaojun Chang,Zhihui Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Token Painter is a training-free text-guided image inpainting method that uses Mask AutoRegressive models with two novel components to better align with text prompts while maintaining background consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based methods struggle with aligning inpainting results with text prompts and maintaining background consistency due to modeling the entire image in latent space.

Method: Uses Mask AutoRegressive (MAR) models with Dual-Stream Encoder Information Fusion (DEIF) to fuse text and background information in frequency domain, and Adaptive Decoder Attention Score Enhancing (ADAE) to enhance attention on guidance and inpainting tokens.

Result: Outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods across almost all metrics and delivers superior visual results.

Conclusion: The proposed training-free method effectively addresses text-prompt alignment and background consistency issues in text-guided image inpainting.

Abstract: Text-guided image inpainting aims to inpaint masked image regions based on a
textual prompt while preserving the background. Although diffusion-based
methods have become dominant, their property of modeling the entire image in
latent space makes it challenging for the results to align well with prompt
details and maintain a consistent background. To address these issues, we
explore Mask AutoRegressive (MAR) models for this task. MAR naturally supports
image inpainting by generating latent tokens corresponding to mask regions,
enabling better local controllability without altering the background. However,
directly applying MAR to this task makes the inpainting content either ignore
the prompts or be disharmonious with the background context. Through analysis
of the attention maps from the inpainting images, we identify the impact of
background tokens on text tokens during the MAR generation, and leverage this
to design \textbf{Token Painter}, a training-free text-guided image inpainting
method based on MAR. Our approach introduces two key components: (1)
Dual-Stream Encoder Information Fusion (DEIF), which fuses the semantic and
context information from text and background in frequency domain to produce
novel guidance tokens, allowing MAR to generate text-faithful inpainting
content while keeping harmonious with background context. (2) Adaptive Decoder
Attention Score Enhancing (ADAE), which adaptively enhances attention scores on
guidance tokens and inpainting tokens to further enhance the alignment of
prompt details and the content visual quality. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our training-free method outperforms prior state-of-the-art
methods across almost all metrics and delivers superior visual results. Codes
will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A closed-loop evaluation framework for autonomous driving that integrates real-world traffic scenarios into CARLA simulator using infrastructure sensors and digital twins of intersections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CARLA benchmarks use manually configured traffic scenarios that diverge from real-world conditions, limiting their ability to reflect actual driving performance.

Method: Extract 800 dynamic traffic scenarios from 100-hour infrastructure sensor videos and create static digital twin assets for 15 real-world intersections with consistent visual appearance in CARLA.

Result: Created a challenging evaluation framework that accurately replicates real-world traffic and environmental characteristics, including diverse driving behaviors, locations, weather conditions, and times of day at complex urban intersections.

Conclusion: Provides a comprehensive closed-loop benchmark for evaluating end-to-end autonomous driving models that more realistically simulates real-world driving conditions.

Abstract: Closed-loop evaluation is increasingly critical for end-to-end autonomous
driving. Current closed-loop benchmarks using the CARLA simulator rely on
manually configured traffic scenarios, which can diverge from real-world
conditions, limiting their ability to reflect actual driving performance. To
address these limitations, we introduce a simple yet challenging closed-loop
evaluation framework that closely integrates real-world driving scenarios into
the CARLA simulator with infrastructure cooperation. Our approach involves
extracting 800 dynamic traffic scenarios selected from a comprehensive 100-hour
video dataset captured by high-mounted infrastructure sensors, and creating
static digital twin assets for 15 real-world intersections with consistent
visual appearance. These digital twins accurately replicate the traffic and
environmental characteristics of their real-world counterparts, enabling more
realistic simulations in CARLA. This evaluation is challenging due to the
diversity of driving behaviors, locations, weather conditions, and times of day
at complex urban intersections. In addition, we provide a comprehensive
closed-loop benchmark for evaluating end-to-end autonomous driving models.

### [181] [Learning Encoding-Decoding Direction Pairs to Unveil Concepts of Influence in Deep Vision Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23926)
*Alexandros Doumanoglou,Kurt Driessens,Dimitrios Zarpalas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to identify encoding and decoding direction pairs in deep vision networks to interpret concepts as directions in latent space, enabling model understanding, debugging, and improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To open the black box of deep networks by recovering encoding-decoding direction pairs that represent concepts as directions in latent space, enabling understanding, debugging, and improving models through concept analysis.

Method: Proposes directional clustering of activations to identify decoding directions and estimates encoding directions with signal vectors under a probabilistic view, leveraging network weights through Uncertainty Region Alignment.

Result: On synthetic data, recovers ground-truth direction pairs; on real data, decoding directions map to interpretable concepts and outperform unsupervised baselines; signal vectors faithfully estimate encoding directions.

Conclusion: The method enables applications in understanding global model behavior, explaining individual predictions, and intervening to produce counterfactuals or correct errors by identifying interpretable concept directions.

Abstract: Empirical evidence shows that deep vision networks represent concepts as
directions in latent space, vectors we call concept embeddings. Each concept
has a latent factor-a scalar-indicating its presence in an input patch. For a
given patch, multiple latent factors are encoded into a compact representation
by linearly combining concept embeddings, with the factors as coefficients.
Since these embeddings enable such encoding, we call them encoding directions.
A latent factor can be recovered via the inner product with a filter, a vector
we call a decoding direction. These encoding-decoding direction pairs are not
directly accessible, but recovering them helps open the black box of deep
networks, enabling understanding, debugging, and improving models. Decoder
directions attribute meaning to latent codes, while encoding directions assess
concept influence on predictions, with both enabling model correction by
unlearning irrelevant concepts. Unlike prior matrix decomposition, autoencoder,
or dictionary learning methods that rely on feature reconstruction, we propose
a new perspective: decoding directions are identified via directional
clustering of activations, and encoding directions are estimated with signal
vectors under a probabilistic view. We further leverage network weights through
a novel technique, Uncertainty Region Alignment, which reveals interpretable
directions affecting predictions. Our analysis shows that (a) on synthetic
data, our method recovers ground-truth direction pairs; (b) on real data,
decoding directions map to monosemantic, interpretable concepts and outperform
unsupervised baselines; and (c) signal vectors faithfully estimate encoding
directions, validated via activation maximization. Finally, we demonstrate
applications in understanding global model behavior, explaining individual
predictions, and intervening to produce counterfactuals or correct errors.

TL;DR: SAR-KnowLIP is the first universal SAR multimodal foundational model that addresses the gap in cross-modal AI for SAR imagery by incorporating geographic information, hierarchical cognitive annotations, and self-consistent optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cross-modal AI methods are mostly designed for RGB imagery, leaving a significant gap in modeling synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery, which has all-day, all-weather imaging capabilities crucial for remote sensing scene understanding.

Method: Constructed SAR-GEOVL-1M dataset with geographic projection properties; generated aligned structured text via hierarchical cognitive chain-of-thought; designed Self-Consistent Iterative Optimization mechanism for cross-modal alignment through contrastive, matching, and reconstruction learning.

Result: SAR-KnowLIP demonstrates leading performance across 11 downstream tasks, particularly in object counting and land-cover classification, outperforming 14 leading foundation models.

Conclusion: SAR-KnowLIP's large-scale multimodal data, transferable model architecture, and comprehensive experimental benchmark will significantly advance the development of SAR multimodal baseline models.

Abstract: Cross-modal artificial intelligence has garnered widespread attention in
recent years, achieving significant progress in the study of natural images.
However, existing methods are mostly designed for RGB imagery, leaving a
significant gap in modeling synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. SAR, with
its all-day, all-weather imaging capabilities, plays an irreplaceable role in
remote sensing scene understanding. To address this gap, this paper proposes
SAR-KnowLIP, the first universal SAR multimodal foundational model, along with
reusable data and evaluation baselines. Specifically: (1) This work introduces
the critical yet long-overlooked attribute of geographic information into
remote sensing research, constructing SAR-GEOVL-1M (the first large-scale SAR
dataset with complete geographic projection properties), covering multiple
satellite platforms, 120,000 images, and 135 cities. (2) Aligned structured
text is generated through a hierarchical cognitive chain-of-thought (HCoT),
providing more than one million multi-dimensional semantic annotations of
landforms, regional functions, target attributes, and spatial relationships.
(3) We design a Self-Consistent Iterative Optimization mechanism that
continuously enhances cross-modal alignment through a self-supervised closed
loop of contrastive, matching, and reconstruction learning on a transferable
multimodal encoder. (4) A unified evaluation benchmark is established across 11
representative downstream vision and vision-language tasks, with comparisons
against 14 leading foundation models, where SAR-KnowLIP demonstrates leading
performance, particularly in object counting and land-cover classification. We
expect that SAR-KnowLIP's large-scale multimodal data, transferable model
architecture, and comprehensive experimental benchmark will significantly
advance the development of SAR multimodal baseline models.

### [183] [AutoPrune: Each Complexity Deserves a Pruning Policy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23931)
*Hanshi Wang,Yuhao Xu,Zekun Xu,Jin Gao,Yufan Liu,Weiming Hu,Ke Wang,Zhipeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AutoPrune introduces a complexity-adaptive pruning framework for vision-language models that dynamically adjusts token pruning based on sample and task complexity, achieving 76.8% FLOPs reduction while retaining 96.7% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pruning methods use fixed schedules that don't adapt to different input complexities, failing to align with the model's reasoning trajectory. Human visual processing suggests adaptive strategies are needed.

Method: Quantifies mutual information between visual and textual tokens, then projects this to budget-constrained logistic retention curves that adapt to specific task complexities.

Result: Prunes 89% of visual tokens, reduces FLOPs by 76.8% while retaining 96.7% accuracy on LLaVA-1.5-7B, outperforming PDrop by 9.1%.

Conclusion: AutoPrune effectively adapts pruning to varying complexities, achieving significant computational savings without compromising performance across diverse vision-language tasks.

Abstract: The established redundancy in visual tokens within large vision-language
models allows pruning to effectively reduce their substantial computational
demands. Previous methods typically employ heuristic layer-specific pruning
strategies where, although the number of tokens removed may differ across
decoder layers, the overall pruning schedule is fixed and applied uniformly to
all input samples and tasks, failing to align token elimination with the
model's holistic reasoning trajectory. Cognitive science indicates that human
visual processing often begins with broad exploration to accumulate evidence
before narrowing focus as the target becomes distinct. Our experiments reveal
an analogous pattern in these models. This observation suggests that neither a
fixed pruning schedule nor a heuristic layer-wise strategy can optimally
accommodate the diverse complexities inherent in different inputs. To overcome
this limitation, we introduce Complexity-Adaptive Pruning (AutoPrune), a
training-free, plug-and-play framework that tailors pruning policies to varying
sample and task complexities. Specifically, AutoPrune quantifies the mutual
information between visual and textual tokens, then projects this signal to a
budget-constrained logistic retention curve. Each such logistic curve, defined
by its unique shape, corresponds to the specific complexity of different tasks
and can guarantee adherence to predefined computational constraints. We
evaluate AutoPrune on standard vision-language tasks and on
Vision-Language-Action models for autonomous driving. Notably, when applied to
LLaVA-1.5-7B, our method prunes 89% of visual tokens and reduces inference
FLOPs by 76.8% while retaining 96.7% of the original accuracy averaged over all
tasks. This corresponds to a 9.1% improvement over the recent work PDrop,
demonstrating the effectiveness. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces an automatic car damage detection pipeline that performs 3D damage segmentation by up-lifting 2D masks using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) and proposes a learning-free approach for single-view 3D-GS segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automatic car damage detection is important for the auto insurance industry, but few works leverage 3D reconstruction methods which provide more comprehensive and geometrically accurate damage representation. 3D-GS methods can generate accurate 3D reconstructions from limited views.

Method: The pipeline performs 3D damage segmentation by up-lifting 2D masks. It uses a learning-free approach for single-view 3D-GS segmentation where Gaussians are projected onto image plane using SfM camera parameters, then filtered through an algorithm using Z-buffering with normal distribution model of depth and opacities.

Result: The method is particularly effective for challenging scenarios like car damage detection where target objects (scratches, small dents) may only be clearly visible in a single view, making multi-view consistency approaches impractical.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enables effective 3D car damage detection even when damage is only visible in single views, overcoming limitations of multi-view consistency methods.

Abstract: Automatic car damage detection has been a topic of significant interest for
the auto insurance industry as it promises faster, accurate, and cost-effective
damage assessments. However, few works have gone beyond 2D image analysis to
leverage 3D reconstruction methods, which have the potential to provide a more
comprehensive and geometrically accurate representation of the damage.
Moreover, recent methods employing 3D representations for novel view synthesis,
particularly 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS), have demonstrated the ability to
generate accurate and coherent 3D reconstructions from a limited number of
views. In this work we introduce an automatic car damage detection pipeline
that performs 3D damage segmentation by up-lifting 2D masks. Additionally, we
propose a simple yet effective learning-free approach for single-view 3D-GS
segmentation. Specifically, Gaussians are projected onto the image plane using
camera parameters obtained via Structure from Motion (SfM). They are then
filtered through an algorithm that utilizes Z-buffering along with a normal
distribution model of depth and opacities. Through experiments we found that
this method is particularly effective for challenging scenarios like car damage
detection, where target objects (e.g., scratches, small dents) may only be
clearly visible in a single view, making multi-view consistency approaches
impractical or impossible. The code is publicly available at:

Motivation: Existing REC and REG datasets require labor-intensive manual annotation that is difficult to scale, creating a need for automated data generation methods.

Method: Uses Collaborative Multimodal Model Interaction (CMMI) with MLLMs and LLMs for description generation, and Spatial Progressive Augmentation (SPA) to enhance spatial expressiveness among duplicate instances.

Result: Significantly accelerates REC and REG annotation while improving expression quality and discriminability. Partially adopted in ICCV 2025 MARS2 Challenge data pipeline.

Conclusion: ColLab enables fully automated, high-quality REC and REG data generation without human supervision, addressing scalability limitations of manual annotation.

Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) and Referring Expression Generation
(REG) are fundamental tasks in multimodal understanding, supporting precise
object localization through natural language. However, existing REC and REG
datasets rely heavily on manual annotation, which is labor-intensive and
difficult to scale. In this paper, we propose ColLab, a collaborative spatial
progressive data engine that enables fully automated REC and REG data
generation without human supervision. Specifically, our method introduces a
Collaborative Multimodal Model Interaction (CMMI) strategy, which leverages the
semantic understanding of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and large

module termed Spatial Progressive Augmentation (SPA) to enhance spatial
expressiveness among duplicate instances. Experiments demonstrate that ColLab
significantly accelerates the annotation process of REC and REG while improving
the quality and discriminability of the generated expressions. In addition to
the core methodological contribution, our framework was partially adopted in

*Yang Ye,Tianyu He,Shuo Yang,Jiang Bian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RLIR is a post-training framework that uses inverse dynamics models to derive verifiable reward signals from generated videos, improving action-following capability in video world models without requiring expensive preference annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video world models have improved visual quality but struggle with accurately modeling human-specified actions. Traditional RL methods are impractical due to high annotation costs and difficulty in constructing video verifiers.

Method: Proposes RLIR framework that recovers input actions from generated videos using an Inverse Dynamics Model, mapping high-dimensional videos to low-dimensional action space for objective reward signals, then optimizes using Group Relative Policy Optimization.

Result: Achieves 5-10% gains in action-following, up to 10% improvements in visual quality, and higher human preference scores across autoregressive and diffusion paradigms.

Conclusion: RLIR establishes the first post-training method specifically designed to enhance action-following in video world models, providing a practical solution without expensive annotations.

Abstract: World models simulate dynamic environments, enabling agents to interact with
diverse input modalities. Although recent advances have improved the visual
quality and temporal consistency of video world models, their ability of
accurately modeling human-specified actions remains under-explored.
Reinforcement learning presents a promising approach for directly improving the
suboptimal action-following capability of pre-trained models, assuming that an
appropriate reward function can be defined. However, transferring reinforcement
learning post-training methods to world model is impractical due to the
prohibitive cost of large-scale preference annotations and the infeasibility of
constructing rule-based video verifiers. To address this gap, we propose
Reinforcement Learning with Inverse Rewards (RLIR), a post-training framework

TL;DR: An intelligent thyroid cancer classification method combining adaptive CNN with CDF9/7 wavelets modulated by chaotic system achieves 98.17% accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art models while being computationally efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Timely and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective thyroid cancer treatment and improved patient outcomes, addressing the global rise in thyroid cancer cases.

Method: Couples an Adaptive CNN with CDF9/7 wavelets whose detail coefficients are modulated by an n-scroll chaotic system to enrich discriminative features, evaluated on DDTI thyroid ultrasound dataset using 5-fold cross-validation.

Result: Achieves 98.17% accuracy, 98.76% sensitivity, 97.58% specificity, 97.55% F1-score, and AUC of 0.9912. Outperforms EfficientNetV2-S, Swin-T, ViT-B/16, and ConvNeXt-T by +1.23 points in accuracy. Chaotic modulation improves accuracy by +8.79 percentage points.

Conclusion: The wavelet-chaos-CNN pipeline delivers state-of-the-art thyroid ultrasound classification with strong generalization, practical runtime characteristics (28.7 ms per image), and suitability for clinical integration.

Abstract: Timely and accurate diagnosis is crucial in addressing the global rise in
thyroid cancer, ensuring effective treatment strategies and improved patient
outcomes. We present an intelligent classification method that couples an
Adaptive Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Cohen-Daubechies-Feauveau
(CDF9/7) wavelets whose detail coefficients are modulated by an n-scroll
chaotic system to enrich discriminative features. We evaluate on the public
DDTI thyroid ultrasound dataset (n = 1,638 images; 819 malignant / 819 benign)
using 5-fold cross-validation, where the proposed method attains 98.17%
accuracy, 98.76% sensitivity, 97.58% specificity, 97.55% F1-score, and an AUC
of 0.9912. A controlled ablation shows that adding chaotic modulation to CDF9/7
improves accuracy by +8.79 percentage points over a CDF9/7-only CNN (from
89.38% to 98.17%). To objectively position our approach, we trained
state-of-the-art backbones on the same data and splits: EfficientNetV2-S
(96.58% accuracy; AUC 0.987), Swin-T (96.41%; 0.986), ViT-B/16 (95.72%; 0.983),
and ConvNeXt-T (96.94%; 0.987). Our method outperforms the best of these by
+1.23 points in accuracy and +0.0042 in AUC, while remaining computationally
efficient (28.7 ms per image; 1,125 MB peak VRAM). Robustness is further
supported by cross-dataset testing on TCIA (accuracy 95.82%) and transfer to an
ISIC skin-lesion subset (n = 28 unique images, augmented to 2,048; accuracy
97.31%). Explainability analyses (Grad-CAM, SHAP, LIME) highlight clinically
relevant regions. Altogether, the wavelet-chaos-CNN pipeline delivers
state-of-the-art thyroid ultrasound classification with strong generalization
and practical runtime characteristics suitable for clinical integration.

*Kargi Chauhan,Leilani H. Gilpin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VFSI enforces physical constraints during diffusion sampling to fix systematic violations in traffic simulation models, reducing collisions by 67% and improving validity by 87% without model retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models for traffic simulation systematically violate physical constraints - 50% of generated trajectories have vehicles colliding, driving off roads, or spawning inside buildings, treating physical validity as emergent rather than required.

Method: Proposed Validity-First Spatial Intelligence (VFSI) uses energy-based guidance during diffusion sampling to enforce constraints. Incorporates collision avoidance and kinematic constraints as energy functions to guide denoising toward physically valid trajectories.

Result: Across 200 urban scenarios from Waymo Open Motion Dataset, VFSI reduces collision rates by 67% (24.6% to 8.1%) and improves overall validity by 87% (50.3% to 94.2%), while improving realism metrics (ADE: 1.34m to 1.21m).

Conclusion: Explicit constraint enforcement during inference is both necessary and sufficient for physically valid traffic simulation, and the model-agnostic approach works without retraining.

Abstract: Modern diffusion models generate realistic traffic simulations but
systematically violate physical constraints. In a large-scale evaluation of
SceneDiffuser++, a state-of-the-art traffic simulator, we find that 50% of
generated trajectories violate basic physical laws - vehicles collide, drive
off roads, and spawn inside buildings. This reveals a fundamental limitation:
current models treat physical validity as an emergent property rather than an
architectural requirement. We propose Validity-First Spatial Intelligence
(VFSI), which enforces constraints through energy-based guidance during
diffusion sampling, without model retraining. By incorporating collision
avoidance and kinematic constraints as energy functions, we guide the denoising
process toward physically valid trajectories. Across 200 urban scenarios from
the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, VFSI reduces collision rates by 67% (24.6% to
8.1%) and improves overall validity by 87% (50.3% to 94.2%), while
simultaneously improving realism metrics (ADE: 1.34m to 1.21m). Our
model-agnostic approach demonstrates that explicit constraint enforcement
during inference is both necessary and sufficient for physically valid traffic
simulation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OASIS is an efficient one-step diffusion model with attention specialization for real-world video super-resolution that reduces computational redundancy while achieving state-of-the-art performance and 6.2× speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct adaptation of diffusion models to video super-resolution creates redundancy since low-quality videos already contain substantial content information, leading to increased computational overhead and learning burden.

Method: Proposes attention specialization routing that assigns attention heads to different patterns according to their intrinsic behaviors, and a progressive training strategy starting with temporally consistent degradations then shifting to inconsistent settings.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets with 6.2× speedup over one-step diffusion baselines like SeedVR2.

Conclusion: OASIS effectively mitigates redundancy in diffusion models for VSR while preserving pretrained knowledge, enabling better adaptation and superior performance with significantly faster inference.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown promising results for video
super-resolution (VSR). However, directly adapting generative diffusion models
to VSR can result in redundancy, since low-quality videos already preserve
substantial content information. Such redundancy leads to increased
computational overhead and learning burden, as the model performs superfluous
operations and must learn to filter out irrelevant information. To address this
problem, we propose OASIS, an efficient $\textbf{o}$ne-step diffusion model
with $\textbf{a}$ttention $\textbf{s}$pecialization for real-world
v$\textbf{i}$deo $\textbf{s}$uper-resolution. OASIS incorporates an attention
specialization routing that assigns attention heads to different patterns
according to their intrinsic behaviors. This routing mitigates redundancy while
effectively preserving pretrained knowledge, allowing diffusion models to
better adapt to VSR and achieve stronger performance. Moreover, we propose a
simple yet effective progressive training strategy, which starts with
temporally consistent degradations and then shifts to inconsistent settings.
This strategy facilitates learning under complex degradations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that OASIS achieves state-of-the-art performance on
both synthetic and real-world datasets. OASIS also provides superior inference
speed, offering a $\textbf{6.2$\times$}$ speedup over one-step diffusion
baselines such as SeedVR2. The code will be available at

TL;DR: RPG360 is a training-free robust 360 monocular depth estimation method that uses perspective foundation models and graph optimization to address depth scale inconsistencies in omnidirectional images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of 360 images across various domains creates need for robust depth estimation techniques, but obtaining large-scale labeled datasets for 360 depth estimation remains challenging.

Method: Converts 360 images into six-face cubemap representations, uses perspective foundation model to estimate depth and surface normals, and introduces depth scale alignment using graph-based optimization with per-face scale parameters to ensure consistency across cubemap faces.

Result: Achieves superior performance across diverse datasets (Matterport3D, Stanford2D3D, 360Loc) and demonstrates benefits in downstream tasks: feature matching (3.2-5.4% improvement) and Structure from Motion (0.2-9.7% improvement in AUC@5).

Conclusion: RPG360 provides a robust, training-free solution for 360 monocular depth estimation that leverages perspective foundation models and graph optimization to overcome dataset limitations while maintaining 3D structural integrity.

Abstract: The increasing use of 360 images across various domains has emphasized the
need for robust depth estimation techniques tailored for omnidirectional
images. However, obtaining large-scale labeled datasets for 360 depth
estimation remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose RPG360, a
training-free robust 360 monocular depth estimation method that leverages
perspective foundation models and graph optimization. Our approach converts 360
images into six-face cubemap representations, where a perspective foundation
model is employed to estimate depth and surface normals. To address depth scale
inconsistencies across different faces of the cubemap, we introduce a novel
depth scale alignment technique using graph-based optimization, which
parameterizes the predicted depth and normal maps while incorporating an
additional per-face scale parameter. This optimization ensures depth scale
consistency across the six-face cubemap while preserving 3D structural
integrity. Furthermore, as foundation models exhibit inherent robustness in
zero-shot settings, our method achieves superior performance across diverse
datasets, including Matterport3D, Stanford2D3D, and 360Loc. We also demonstrate
the versatility of our depth estimation approach by validating its benefits in
downstream tasks such as feature matching 3.2 ~ 5.4% and Structure from Motion
0.2 ~ 9.7% in AUC@5.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with overall realism meta score of 0.7858 on Waymo Open Sim Agents Challenge, ranking first on the leaderboard at submission time.

Conclusion: SMART-R1 demonstrates that the simple yet powerful R1-style training framework effectively enhances foundation models for multi-agent traffic simulation, providing better alignment with human preferences and evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Scalable and realistic simulation of multi-agent traffic behavior is critical
for advancing autonomous driving technologies. Although existing data-driven
simulators have made significant strides in this domain, they predominantly
rely on supervised learning to align simulated distributions with real-world
driving scenarios. A persistent challenge, however, lies in the distributional
shift that arises between training and testing, which often undermines model
generalization in unseen environments. To address this limitation, we propose
SMART-R1, a novel R1-style reinforcement fine-tuning paradigm tailored for
next-token prediction models to better align agent behavior with human
preferences and evaluation metrics. Our approach introduces a metric-oriented
policy optimization algorithm to improve distribution alignment and an
iterative "SFT-RFT-SFT" training strategy that alternates between Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) to maximize performance
gains. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Waymo Open Motion Dataset

Conclusion: TREAT-Net shows potential as a non-invasive tool for timely patient triage, especially beneficial for underserved populations with limited angiography access.

Abstract: Coronary angiography remains the gold standard for diagnosing Acute Coronary
Syndrome (ACS). However, its resource-intensive and invasive nature can expose
patients to procedural risks and diagnostic delays, leading to postponed
treatment initiation. In this work, we introduce TREAT-Net, a multimodal deep
learning framework for ACS treatment prediction that leverages non-invasive
modalities, including echocardiography videos and structured clinical records.
TREAT-Net integrates tabular-guided cross-attention to enhance video

modalities. Trained on a dataset of over 9000 ACS cases, the model outperforms
unimodal and non-fused baselines, achieving a balanced accuracy of 67.6% and an
AUROC of 71.1%. Cross-modality agreement analysis demonstrates 88.6% accuracy
for intervention prediction. These findings highlight the potential of
TREAT-Net as a non-invasive tool for timely and accurate patient triage,
particularly in underserved populations with limited access to coronary
angiography.

quantifying the practical limitations of current methods. We conclude by
discussing these limitations and offering recommendations on how to best
integrate gaze estimation as a modality in HRI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for 3D head avatar generation lack fine-grained, intuitive control over expressions via text, making it challenging to create realistic and controllable avatars from single images.

Method: SIE3D fuses identity features from images with semantic text embeddings through a novel conditioning scheme, and introduces a perceptual expression loss function using a pre-trained expression classifier to regularize generation and ensure expression accuracy.

Result: Extensive experiments show SIE3D significantly improves controllability and realism, outperforming competitive methods in identity preservation and expression fidelity while running on a single consumer-grade GPU.

Conclusion: SIE3D provides an effective solution for generating high-fidelity 3D head avatars with detailed expression control from single images and text descriptions, achieving superior performance in both controllability and realism.

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity 3D head avatars from a single image is challenging,

TL;DR: FrameMind is an RL-trained framework that enables dynamic frame sampling for video understanding, allowing models to adaptively request visual information during reasoning through Frame-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video understanding models use fixed frame sampling strategies that don't adapt to specific reasoning requirements, limiting their ability to gather appropriate visual evidence for tasks needing either broad temporal coverage or fine-grained spatial detail.

Method: FrameMind uses reinforcement learning with Frame-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought (FiCOT) for multi-turn reasoning, Dynamic Resolution Frame Sampling (DRFS) for training diverse temporal-spatial trade-offs, and DRFS-GRPO policy optimization that learns from outcome-based rewards without frame-level annotations.

Result: Extensive experiments on MLVU and VideoMME benchmarks show FrameMind significantly outperforms existing models and advances state-of-the-art in flexible and efficient video understanding.

Conclusion: FrameMind demonstrates that dynamic, adaptive frame sampling through reinforcement learning enables more effective video understanding by allowing models to gather visual evidence based on specific reasoning needs.

Abstract: Current video understanding models rely on fixed frame sampling strategies,
processing predetermined visual inputs regardless of the specific reasoning
requirements of each question. This static approach limits their ability to
adaptively gather visual evidence, leading to suboptimal performance on tasks
that require either broad temporal coverage or fine-grained spatial detail. In
this paper, we introduce FrameMind, an end-to-end framework trained with
reinforcement learning that enables models to dynamically request visual
information during reasoning through Frame-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought
(FiCOT). Unlike traditional approaches, FrameMind operates in multiple turns
where the model alternates between textual reasoning and active visual
perception, using tools to extract targeted frames or video clips based on
identified knowledge gaps. To train effective dynamic sampling policies, we
propose Dynamic Resolution Frame Sampling (DRFS), which exposes models to
diverse temporal-spatial trade-offs during learning, and DRFS-GRPO, a
group-relative policy optimization algorithm that learns from outcome-based
rewards without requiring frame-level annotations. Extensive experiments on
challenging benchmarks like MLVU and VideoMME demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms existing models, advancing the state of the art in
flexible and efficient video understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First GCD framework for hyperspectral images using prototype subspace modeling with basis vectors instead of single prototypes, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GCD methods designed for RGB images don't generalize well to hyperspectral images due to their high-dimensional nature and complex spectral structures.

Method: Proposes prototype subspace modeling where each category is represented by a set of basis vectors forming a subspace, with basis orthogonality and reconstruction constraints for better discrimination.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art GCD methods on real-world HSI datasets.

Conclusion: Establishes a strong foundation for generalized category discovery in hyperspectral settings with the proposed subspace modeling approach.

Abstract: Generalized category discovery~(GCD) seeks to jointly identify both known and
novel categories in unlabeled data. While prior works have mainly focused on
RGB images, their assumptions and modeling strategies do not generalize well to
hyperspectral images~(HSI), which are inherently high-dimensional and exhibit
complex spectral structures. In this paper, we propose the first GCD framework
tailored for HSI, introducing a prototype subspace modeling model to better
capture class structure. Instead of learning a single prototype vector for each
category as in existing methods such as SimGCD, we model each category using a
set of basis vectors, forming a subspace representation that enables greater
expressiveness and discrimination in a high-dimensional feature space. To guide
the learning of such bases, we enforce two key constraints: (1) a basis
orthogonality constraint that promotes inter-class separability, and (2) a
reconstruction constraint that ensures each prototype basis can effectively
reconstruct its corresponding class samples. Experimental results on real-world
HSI demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art GCD
methods, establishing a strong foundation for generalized category discovery in
hyperspectral settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address physical information degradation and ineffective pedestrian interaction modeling in pedestrian trajectory prediction under hazy weather conditions.

Method: Combines differentiable atmospheric scattering model for haze mitigation, adaptive scanning state space model for feature extraction, and heterogeneous graph attention network with spatio-temporal fusion for pedestrian relationship modeling.

Result: 78% inference speed increase over native Mamba while preserving long-range dependencies; reduces minADE/minFDE by 37.2% and 41.5% respectively in dense haze scenarios (visibility < 30m) compared to SOTA models.

Conclusion: Provides a new modeling paradigm for reliable perception in intelligent transportation systems in adverse environments.

Abstract: To address the issues of physical information degradation and ineffective
pedestrian interaction modeling in pedestrian trajectory prediction under hazy
weather conditions, we propose a deep learning model that combines physical
priors of atmospheric scattering with topological modeling of pedestrian
relationships. Specifically, we first construct a differentiable atmospheric
scattering model that decouples haze concentration from light degradation
through a network with physical parameter estimation, enabling the learning of
haze-mitigated feature representations. Second, we design an adaptive scanning
state space model for feature extraction. Our adaptive Mamba variant achieves a
78% inference speed increase over native Mamba while preserving long-range
dependency modeling.
  Finally, to efficiently model pedestrian relationships, we develop a
heterogeneous graph attention network, using graph matrices to model
multi-granularity interactions between pedestrians and groups, combined with a
spatio-temporal fusion module to capture the collaborative evolution patterns
of pedestrian movements. Furthermore, we constructed a new pedestrian
trajectory prediction dataset based on ETH/UCY to evaluate the effectiveness of
the proposed method. Experiments show that our method reduces the minADE /
minFDE metrics by 37.2% and 41.5%, respectively, compared to the SOTA models in
dense haze scenarios (visibility < 30m), providing a new modeling paradigm for
reliable perception in intelligent transportation systems in adverse
environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Learning directly on raw Bayer mosaics yields superior image reconstruction compared to post-ISP sRGB training, demonstrating an ISP-last paradigm for low-level vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most reconstruction networks are trained on post-ISP sRGB images, which irreversibly mix colors, clip dynamic range, and blur fine detail. These losses are avoidable by working directly with raw data.

Method: Evaluate post-ISP and Bayer reconstruction pipelines, curate Raw-Rain benchmark (first public dataset with real rainy scenes in both 12-bit Bayer and sRGB), and introduce Information Conservation Score (ICS) metric.

Result: Raw-domain model improves sRGB results by up to +0.99 dB PSNR and +1.2% ICS, while running faster with half the GFLOPs.

Conclusion: Advocates for an ISP-last paradigm for low-level vision and opens the door to end-to-end learnable camera pipelines.

Abstract: Image reconstruction from corrupted images is crucial across many domains.
Most reconstruction networks are trained on post-ISP sRGB images, even though
the image-signal-processing pipeline irreversibly mixes colors, clips dynamic
range, and blurs fine detail. This paper uses the rain degradation problem as a
use case to show that these losses are avoidable, and demonstrates that
learning directly on raw Bayer mosaics yields superior reconstructions. To
substantiate the claim, we (i) evaluate post-ISP and Bayer reconstruction
pipelines, (ii) curate Raw-Rain, the first public benchmark of real rainy
scenes captured in both 12-bit Bayer and bit-depth-matched sRGB, and (iii)
introduce Information Conservation Score (ICS), a color-invariant metric that
aligns more closely with human opinion than PSNR or SSIM. On the test split,
our raw-domain model improves sRGB results by up to +0.99 dB PSNR and +1.2%
ICS, while running faster with half of the GFLOPs. The results advocate an
ISP-last paradigm for low-level vision and open the door to end-to-end
learnable camera pipelines.

TL;DR: Proposes an end-to-end framework that jointly optimizes superpixel segmentation and subspace clustering for hyperspectral images using a feedback mechanism between a self-representation network and differentiable superpixel module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing superpixel-based subspace clustering methods where segmentation is performed independently, leading to partitions that don't align with clustering objectives, and overcome computational/memory constraints of traditional subspace clustering.

Method: Unified framework with feedback mechanism: self-representation network based on unfolded ADMM guides differentiable superpixel module; joint optimization produces clustering-aware partitions; learns unique compactness parameter for each superpixel.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark HSI datasets show superior accuracy compared to state-of-the-art clustering approaches; method preserves both spectral and spatial structure.

Conclusion: Joint optimization of superpixel segmentation and subspace clustering through feedback mechanism enables more effective and adaptive hyperspectral image analysis with improved accuracy.

Abstract: Subspace clustering is a powerful unsupervised approach for hyperspectral
image (HSI) analysis, but its high computational and memory costs limit
scalability. Superpixel segmentation can improve efficiency by reducing the
number of data points to process. However, existing superpixel-based methods
usually perform segmentation independently of the clustering task, often
producing partitions that do not align with the subsequent clustering
objective. To address this, we propose a unified end-to-end framework that
jointly optimizes superpixel segmentation and subspace clustering. Its core is
a feedback mechanism: a self-representation network based on unfolded
Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) provides a model-driven
signal to guide a differentiable superpixel module. This joint optimization
yields clustering-aware partitions that preserve both spectral and spatial
structure. Furthermore, our superpixel network learns a unique compactness
parameter for each superpixel, enabling more flexible and adaptive
segmentation. Extensive experiments on benchmark HSI datasets demonstrate that
our method consistently achieves superior accuracy compared with
state-of-the-art clustering approaches.

Motivation: To address the challenge of pruning pre-trained vision models when downstream tasks are unknown, exploring how data influences pruning and whether task-specific pruning affects performance on unseen tasks.

Method: Investigate pruning-at-initialization on pre-trained vision models, examining the effects of pruning on one task on zero-shot performance of unseen tasks, and fine-tuning to recover performance.

Result: Pruning on one task retains zero-shot performance on unseen tasks, and fine-tuning pruned models improves performance on both seen and held-out tasks.

Conclusion: Extensive pre-training on large-scale datasets creates favorable loss landscapes that enable effective pruning without task-specific data, maintaining performance across tasks.

Abstract: The widespread availability of pre-trained vision models has enabled numerous
deep learning applications through their transferable representations. However,
their computational and storage costs often limit practical deployment.
Pruning-at-Initialization has emerged as a promising approach to compress
models before training, enabling efficient task-specific adaptation. While
conventional wisdom suggests that effective pruning requires task-specific
data, this creates a challenge when downstream tasks are unknown in advance. In
this paper, we investigate how data influences the pruning of pre-trained
vision models. Surprisingly, pruning on one task retains the model's zero-shot
performance also on unseen tasks. Furthermore, fine-tuning these pruned models
not only improves performance on original seen tasks but can recover held-out
tasks' performance. We attribute this phenomenon to the favorable loss
landscapes induced by extensive pre-training on large-scale datasets.

TL;DR: The paper investigates how visual structures improve multimodal reasoning in LVLMs by introducing Grounding IDs - latent identifiers that bind objects to partitions across modalities, enhancing cross-modal alignment and reducing hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large vision-language models show strong performance but lack structured reasoning and precise grounding. While simple visual structures improve accuracy, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.

Method: The study uses representation analysis to identify Grounding IDs as latent identifiers induced by external cues, and conducts causal interventions to confirm their role in mediating object-symbol binding.

Result: Grounding IDs emerge as robust within-partition alignment in embedding space, reduce modality gap between image and text, strengthen attention between related components, and improve cross-modal grounding while reducing hallucinations.

Conclusion: Grounding IDs are identified as a key symbolic mechanism that explains how external cues enhance multimodal binding, offering both interpretability and practical robustness improvements.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) show strong performance across
multimodal benchmarks but remain limited in structured reasoning and precise
grounding. Recent work has demonstrated that adding simple visual structures,
such as partitions and annotations, improves accuracy, yet the internal
mechanisms underlying these gains remain unclear. We investigate this
phenomenon and propose the concept of Grounding IDs, latent identifiers induced
by external cues that bind objects to their designated partitions across
modalities. Through representation analysis, we find that these identifiers
emerge as robust within-partition alignment in embedding space and reduce the
modality gap between image and text. Causal interventions further confirm that
these identifiers mediate binding between objects and symbolic cues. We show
that Grounding IDs strengthen attention between related components, which in
turn improves cross-modal grounding and reduces hallucinations. Taken together,
our results identify Grounding IDs as a key symbolic mechanism explaining how
external cues enhance multimodal binding, offering both interpretability and
practical improvements in robustness.

*Sucheng Ren,Chen Chen,Zhenbang Wang,Liangchen Song,Xiangxin Zhu,Alan Yuille,Yinfei Yang,Jiasen Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoAR challenges the conventional frame-by-frame approach in video generation by proposing spatiotemporal cubes as prediction units, enabling simultaneous spatial and temporal processing and achieving superior quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors question whether frames are the appropriate atomic units for video autoregression, arguing that the frame-by-frame approach may not be optimal and that alternative prediction units could improve video generation.

Method: VideoAR is a unified framework that supports multiple prediction units including full frames, key-detail frames, multiscale refinements, and spatiotemporal cubes. The key innovation is using spatiotemporal cubes that allow autoregressive models to operate across both spatial and temporal dimensions simultaneously.

Result: Cube-based prediction consistently delivers superior quality, speed, and temporal coherence compared to other strategies. The approach surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on VBench while achieving faster inference and enabling scaling to minute-long sequences.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates that removing the frame-by-frame constraint improves video generation performance and suggests rethinking sequence decomposition in video and other spatiotemporal domains.

Abstract: Autoregressive models for video generation typically operate frame-by-frame,
extending next-token prediction from language to video's temporal dimension. We
question that unlike word as token is universally agreed in language if frame
is a appropriate prediction unit? To address this, we present VideoAR, a
unified framework that supports a spectrum of prediction units including full
frames, key-detail frames, multiscale refinements, and spatiotemporal cubes.
Among these designs, we find model video generation using
\textit{spatiotemporal} cubes as prediction units, which allows autoregressive
models to operate across both spatial and temporal dimensions simultaneously.
This approach eliminates the assumption that frames are the natural atomic
units for video autoregression. We evaluate VideoAR across diverse prediction
strategies, finding that cube-based prediction consistently delivers superior
quality, speed, and temporal coherence. By removing the frame-by-frame
constraint, our video generator surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on VBench
while achieving faster inference and enabling seamless scaling to minute-long
sequences. We hope this work will motivate rethinking sequence decomposition in
video and other spatiotemporal domains.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating realistic, context-aware two-person motion conditioned on diverse modalities remains challenging in computer graphics and human-computer interaction.

Method: Uses rectified flow for deterministic straight-line sampling paths between noise and data, RAG module for motion exemplar retrieval using music features and LLM-based text decompositions, contrastive objective for signal alignment, and synchronization loss for inter-person coordination.

Result: Extensive evaluations show consistent gains in motion quality, responsiveness, and efficiency across text-to-motion, music-to-motion, and multi-modal interactive benchmarks.

Conclusion: DualFlow produces temporally coherent and rhythmically synchronized motions, setting state-of-the-art in multi-modal human motion generation.

Abstract: Generating realistic, context-aware two-person motion conditioned on diverse
modalities remains a central challenge in computer graphics, animation, and
human-computer interaction. We introduce DualFlow, a unified and efficient
framework for multi-modal two-person motion generation. DualFlow conditions 3D
motion synthesis on diverse inputs, including text, music, and prior motion
sequences. Leveraging rectified flow, it achieves deterministic straight-line
sampling paths between noise and data, reducing inference time and mitigating
error accumulation common in diffusion-based models. To enhance semantic
grounding, DualFlow employs a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module that
retrieves motion exemplars using music features and LLM-based text
decompositions of spatial relations, body movements, and rhythmic patterns. We
use contrastive objective that further strengthens alignment with conditioning
signals and introduce synchronization loss that improves inter-person
coordination. Extensive evaluations across text-to-motion, music-to-motion, and
multi-modal interactive benchmarks show consistent gains in motion quality,
responsiveness, and efficiency. DualFlow produces temporally coherent and
rhythmically synchronized motions, setting state-of-the-art in multi-modal
human motion generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RVOS methods using MLLMs face challenges including insufficient exploitation of prior knowledge, high computational costs for long videos, and poor handling of complex temporal dynamics.

Method: Proposes SVAC with Anchor-Based Spatio-Temporal Compression (ASTC) to compress visual tokens while preserving structure, and Clip-Specific Allocation (CSA) strategy for dynamic object behaviors.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple RVOS benchmarks with competitive efficiency.

Conclusion: SVAC provides an effective unified model for RVOS that balances performance and computational efficiency through innovative compression and allocation strategies.

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment target objects in
video sequences based on natural language descriptions. While recent advances
in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have improved RVOS performance
through enhanced text-video understanding, several challenges remain, including
insufficient exploitation of MLLMs' prior knowledge, prohibitive computational
and memory costs for long-duration videos, and inadequate handling of complex
temporal dynamics. In this work, we propose SVAC, a unified model that improves
RVOS by scaling up input frames and segmentation tokens to enhance
video-language interaction and segmentation precision. To address the resulting
computational challenges, SVAC incorporates the Anchor-Based Spatio-Temporal
Compression (ASTC) module to compress visual tokens while preserving essential
spatio-temporal structure. Moreover, the Clip-Specific Allocation (CSA)
strategy is introduced to better handle dynamic object behaviors across video
clips. Experimental results demonstrate that SVAC achieves state-of-the-art
performance on multiple RVOS benchmarks with competitive efficiency. Our code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GMS is a coarse-to-fine framework that combines general vision-language models as 'Scanner' and specialized GUI grounding models as 'Locator' to improve GUI grounding performance by 10x compared to individual components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Grounding natural language queries in GUIs is challenging due to diverse UI elements across applications and the need for precise spatial coordinate prediction.

Method: A synergistic framework with five stages using hierarchical search and cross-modal communication, where general VLMs scan for regions of interest and fine-tuned grounding models locate precise coordinates.

Result: GMS achieves 35.7% accuracy on ScreenSpot-Pro dataset, a 10x improvement over individual Scanner (2.0%) and Locator (3.7%) models, and outperforms other baselines.

Conclusion: GMS demonstrates robust performance and potential for general-purpose GUI grounding by effectively leveraging complementary strengths of general and specialized models.

Abstract: Grounding natural language queries in graphical user interfaces (GUIs)
presents a challenging task that requires models to comprehend diverse UI
elements across various applications and systems, while also accurately
predicting the spatial coordinates for the intended operation. To tackle this
problem, we propose GMS: Generalist Scanner Meets Specialist Locator, a
synergistic coarse-to-fine framework that effectively improves GUI grounding
performance. GMS leverages the complementary strengths of general
vision-language models (VLMs) and small, task-specific GUI grounding models by
assigning them distinct roles within the framework. Specifically, the general
VLM acts as a 'Scanner' to identify potential regions of interest, while the
fine-tuned grounding model serves as a 'Locator' that outputs precise
coordinates within these regions. This design is inspired by how humans perform
GUI grounding, where the eyes scan the interface and the brain focuses on
interpretation and localization. Our whole framework consists of five stages
and incorporates hierarchical search with cross-modal communication to achieve
promising prediction results. Experimental results on the ScreenSpot-Pro
dataset show that while the 'Scanner' and 'Locator' models achieve only $2.0\%$
and $3.7\%$ accuracy respectively when used independently, their integration
within GMS framework yields an overall accuracy of $35.7\%$, representing a $10
\times$ improvement. Additionally, GMS significantly outperforms other strong
baselines under various settings, demonstrating its robustness and potential
for general-purpose GUI grounding.

Method: Comparative analysis of models trained on SCUT-FBP5500 and MEBeauty datasets using rigorous statistical validation (Kruskal-Wallis H-tests, post hoc Dunn analyses) and cross-dataset validation on the balanced FairFace dataset.

Result: Both models show significant prediction disparities across ethnic groups (p < 0.001), with algorithmic amplification of societal beauty biases rather than mitigation. Only 4.8-9.5% of inter-group comparisons satisfy distributional parity criteria.

Conclusion: Current AI beauty prediction approaches are inadequate, underscoring the need for mitigation strategies to address algorithmic bias in aesthetic technologies.

Abstract: Bias can be introduced to AI systems even from seemingly balanced sources,

Method: Proposes FastVSR with f16 VAE (16x spatial compression), pixel shuffle and channel replication for upsampling, and a lower-bound-guided training strategy that uses simpler training objectives as performance lower bounds for stable convergence.

Conclusion: FastVSR demonstrates that significant efficiency improvements in diffusion-based video super-resolution are achievable through high compression VAEs and stable training strategies, making real-time applications more feasible.

Abstract: Diffusion models have significant advantages in the field of real-world video
super-resolution and have demonstrated strong performance in past research. In
recent diffusion-based video super-resolution (VSR) models, the number of
sampling steps has been reduced to just one, yet there remains significant room
for further optimization in inference efficiency. In this paper, we propose
FastVSR, which achieves substantial reductions in computational cost by
implementing a high compression VAE (spatial compression ratio of 16, denoted
as f16). We design the structure of the f16 VAE and introduce a stable training
framework. We employ pixel shuffle and channel replication to achieve
additional upsampling. Furthermore, we propose a lower-bound-guided training
strategy, which introduces a simpler training objective as a lower bound for
the VAE's performance. It makes the training process more stable and easier to
converge. Experimental results show that FastVSR achieves speedups of 111.9
times compared to multi-step models and 3.92 times compared to existing
one-step models. We will release code and models at

TL;DR: LatXGen is a generative framework that synthesizes lateral spinal radiographs from posterior RGBD images, enabling radiation-free sagittal alignment assessment for Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current radiation-free methods focus mainly on coronal plane assessment, leaving reliable sagittal alignment evaluation without ionizing radiation largely unexplored.

Method: Dual-stage architecture with attention-based FFC module for anatomical feature integration and Spatial Deformation Network for modeling lateral morphological variations, using 3,264 paired RGBD-radiograph dataset.

Result: LatXGen produces anatomically accurate radiographs and outperforms existing GAN-based methods in both visual fidelity and quantitative metrics.

Conclusion: The framework offers a promising radiation-free solution for sagittal spine assessment and advances comprehensive AIS evaluation.

Abstract: Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) is a complex three-dimensional spinal
deformity, and accurate morphological assessment requires evaluating both
coronal and sagittal alignment. While previous research has made significant
progress in developing radiation-free methods for coronal plane assessment,
reliable and accurate evaluation of sagittal alignment without ionizing
radiation remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, we propose
LatXGen, a novel generative framework that synthesizes realistic lateral spinal
radiographs from posterior Red-Green-Blue and Depth (RGBD) images of unclothed
backs. This enables accurate, radiation-free estimation of sagittal spinal
alignment. LatXGen tackles two core challenges: (1) inferring sagittal spinal
morphology changes from a lateral perspective based on posteroanterior surface
geometry, and (2) performing cross-modality translation from RGBD input to the
radiographic domain. The framework adopts a dual-stage architecture that
progressively estimates lateral spinal structure and synthesizes corresponding
radiographs. To enhance anatomical consistency, we introduce an attention-based
Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC) module for integrating anatomical features from
RGBD images and 3D landmarks, and a Spatial Deformation Network (SDN) to model
morphological variations in the lateral view. Additionally, we construct the
first large-scale paired dataset for this task, comprising 3,264 RGBD and
lateral radiograph pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that LatXGen
produces anatomically accurate radiographs and outperforms existing GAN-based
methods in both visual fidelity and quantitative metrics. This study offers a
promising, radiation-free solution for sagittal spine assessment and advances
comprehensive AIS evaluation.

Result: Experiments on medical image classification show improved distillation performance while preserving privacy and maintaining model accuracy comparable to original datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses limitations of existing trajectory matching approaches and provides a practical solution for medical data sharing challenges.

Abstract: Medical image analysis faces significant challenges in data sharing due to

offers a solution to address these challenges by synthesizing compact datasets
that capture essential information from real, large medical datasets.
Trajectory matching has emerged as a promising methodology for dataset
distillation; however, existing methods primarily focus on terminal states,

*Yinghao Jin,Xi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DECERN is a novel active learning method for fine-grained image classification that combines discrepancy-confusion uncertainty and calibration diversity to select the most informative samples under limited annotation budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In fine-grained image classification, assessing sample informativeness is challenging due to subtle inter-class differences, making traditional active learning methods less effective.

Method: DECERN introduces a multifaceted informativeness measure combining discrepancy-confusion uncertainty (quantifying category directionality and structural stability) and calibration diversity (using uncertainty-weighted clustering to maximize global diversity while maintaining local representativeness).

Result: Extensive experiments on 7 fine-grained image datasets across 26 experimental settings demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed DECERN method effectively addresses the challenges of active learning in fine-grained image classification by combining uncertainty and diversity measures to select the most valuable samples for annotation.

Abstract: Active learning (AL) aims to build high-quality labeled datasets by
iteratively selecting the most informative samples from an unlabeled pool under
limited annotation budgets. However, in fine-grained image classification,
assessing this informativeness is especially challenging due to subtle
inter-class differences. In this paper, we introduce a novel method, combining
discrepancy-confusion uncertainty and calibration diversity for active
fine-grained image classification (DECERN), to effectively perceive the
distinctiveness between fine-grained images and evaluate the sample value.
DECERN introduces a multifaceted informativeness measure that combines
discrepancy-confusion uncertainty and calibration diversity. The
discrepancy-confusion uncertainty quantifies the category directionality and
structural stability of fine-grained unlabeled data during local feature
fusion. Subsequently, uncertainty-weighted clustering is performed to diversify
the uncertainty samples. Then we calibrate the diversity to maximize the global
diversity of the selected sample while maintaining its local
representativeness. Extensive experiments conducted on 7 fine-grained image
datasets across 26 distinct experimental settings demonstrate that our method
achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: A tumor generation model using radiomics features as conditions to generate diverse 3D medical images for addressing data scarcity in medical image analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy concerns make obtaining large 3D medical datasets (CT/MRI) challenging, and existing generative models lack output diversity to accurately represent 3D medical images.

Method: Uses GAN-based model for tumor mask generation and diffusion-based approach for tumor texture generation, both conditioned on radiomics features (size, shape, texture). Allows user-specified tumor generation at arbitrary locations.

Result: Successfully tested on tumors in four organs (kidney, lung, breast, brain) across CT and MRI. Synthesized images effectively aid downstream task training and passed expert authenticity evaluations.

Conclusion: The method enables tumor removal, manipulation, and repositioning, generating various tumor types in different scenarios, with potential applications in treatment planning using diverse synthesized tumors.

Abstract: Due to privacy concerns, obtaining large datasets is challenging in medical
image analysis, especially with 3D modalities like Computed Tomography (CT) and
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Existing generative models, developed to
address this issue, often face limitations in output diversity and thus cannot
accurately represent 3D medical images. We propose a tumor-generation model
that utilizes radiomics features as generative conditions. Radiomics features
are high-dimensional handcrafted semantic features that are biologically
well-grounded and thus are good candidates for conditioning. Our model employs
a GAN-based model to generate tumor masks and a diffusion-based approach to
generate tumor texture conditioned on radiomics features. Our method allows the
user to generate tumor images according to user-specified radiomics features
such as size, shape, and texture at an arbitrary location. This enables the
physicians to easily visualize tumor images to better understand tumors
according to changing radiomics features. Our approach allows for the removal,
manipulation, and repositioning of tumors, generating various tumor types in
different scenarios. The model has been tested on tumors in four different
organs (kidney, lung, breast, and brain) across CT and MRI. The synthesized
images are shown to effectively aid in training for downstream tasks and their
authenticity was also evaluated through expert evaluations. Our method has
potential usage in treatment planning with diverse synthesized tumors.

Method: Uses maximum intensity projection images from DCE-MRI and leverages diffusion models with prompt tuning to incorporate clinical factors affecting NAC response, generating post-treatment images from pre-treatment scans.

Result: The model outperformed other generative models in image quality metrics and was better at generating images that reflected tumor size changes according to pathological complete response (pCR). Ablation studies confirmed the method's design choices.

Conclusion: The proposed approach has potential to contribute to precision medicine by improving NAC response prediction through advanced image generation techniques.

Abstract: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is a common therapy option before the main
surgery for breast cancer. Response to NAC is monitored using follow-up dynamic
contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI). Accurate prediction of
NAC response helps with treatment planning. Here, we adopt maximum intensity
projection images from DCE-MRI to generate post-treatment images (i.e., 3 or 12
weeks after NAC) from pre-treatment images leveraging the emerging diffusion
model. We introduce prompt tuning to account for the known clinical factors
affecting response to NAC. Our model performed better than other generative
models in image quality metrics. Our model was better at generating images that
reflected changes in tumor size according to pCR compared to other models.
Ablation study confirmed the design choices of our method. Our study has the
potential to help with precision medicine.

### [217] [Talk in Pieces, See in Whole: Disentangling and Hierarchical Aggregating Representations for Language-based Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24192)
*Sojung An,Kwanyong Park,Yong Jae Lee,Donghyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes TaSe framework to improve vision-language models' ability to handle complex queries with descriptive attributes and relational clauses by disentangling text into objects, attributes, and relations, then hierarchically aggregating them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models struggle with complex queries involving descriptive attributes and relational clauses due to text encoders treating sentences as bags-of-words, leading to false positives in object detection.

Method: Proposed TaSe framework with three components: (1) hierarchical synthetic captioning dataset, (2) Talk in Pieces module for disentangling text into objects/attributes/relations using novel loss function, (3) See in Whole module for hierarchical aggregation of components.

Result: Experimental results on OmniLabel benchmark show 24% performance improvement, demonstrating the importance of linguistic compositionality.

Conclusion: The TaSe framework strengthens hierarchical linguistic structure bias and enables fine-grained multimodal representations for better language-based object detection.

Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in
multimodal perception (e.g., open-vocabulary object detection) with simple
language queries, state-of-the-art VLMs still show limited ability to perceive
complex queries involving descriptive attributes and relational clauses. Our
in-depth analysis shows that these limitations mainly stem from text encoders
in VLMs. Such text encoders behave like bags-of-words and fail to separate
target objects from their descriptive attributes and relations in complex
queries, resulting in frequent false positives. To address this, we propose
restructuring linguistic representations according to the hierarchical
relations within sentences for language-based object detection. A key insight
is the necessity of disentangling textual tokens into core components-objects,
attributes, and relations ("talk in pieces")-and subsequently aggregating them
into hierarchically structured sentence-level representations ("see in whole").
Building on this principle, we introduce the TaSe framework with three main
contributions: (1) a hierarchical synthetic captioning dataset spanning three
tiers from category names to descriptive sentences; (2) Talk in Pieces, the
three-component disentanglement module guided by a novel disentanglement loss
function, transforms text embeddings into subspace compositions; and (3) See in
Whole, which learns to aggregate disentangled components into hierarchically
structured embeddings with the guide of proposed hierarchical objectives. The
proposed TaSe framework strengthens the inductive bias of hierarchical
linguistic structures, resulting in fine-grained multimodal representations for
language-based object detection. Experimental results under the OmniLabel
benchmark show a 24% performance improvement, demonstrating the importance of
linguistic compositionality.

### [218] [An Efficient 3D Latent Diffusion Model for T1-contrast Enhanced MRI Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24194)
*Zach Eidex,Mojtaba Safari,Jie Ding,Richard Qiu,Justin Roper,David Yu,Hui-Kuo Shu,Zhen Tian,Hui Mao,Xiaofeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A 3D deep learning framework called T1C-RFlow generates T1-contrast enhanced MRI images from pre-contrast multiparametric MRI, eliminating the need for gadolinium-based contrast agents while achieving high-quality results faster than traditional diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gadolinium-based contrast agents have limitations including nephrogenic systemic fibrosis risks and imaging inconsistencies due to administration variations. This study aims to create a contrast-agent-free alternative for T1C image generation.

Method: The T1C-RFlow model uses a pretrained autoencoder to compress T1w and T2-FLAIR images into latent space, then trains a rectified flow diffusion model in this latent representation. The model was trained on a large dataset of 4096 patients with brain tumors (glioma, meningioma, metastases).

Result: T1C-RFlow outperformed benchmark models (pix2pix, DDPM, DiT-3D) with superior metrics: NMSE 0.044-0.098 and SSIM 0.905-0.937 across tumor types. It achieved significantly faster denoising (6.9s/volume) compared to DDPM (37.7s) and patch-based methods (4.3hr/volume).

Conclusion: The proposed method generates synthetic T1C images that closely resemble ground truth in much less time than previous diffusion models, potentially enabling practical contrast-agent-free MRI for brain tumors.

Abstract: Objective: Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are commonly employed
with T1w MRI to enhance lesion visualization but are restricted in patients at
risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis and variations in GBCA administration can
introduce imaging inconsistencies. This study develops an efficient 3D
deep-learning framework to generate T1-contrast enhanced images (T1C) from
pre-contrast multiparametric MRI. Approach: We propose the 3D latent rectified
flow (T1C-RFlow) model for generating high-quality T1C images. First, T1w and
T2-FLAIR images are input into a pretrained autoencoder to acquire an efficient
latent space representation. A rectified flow diffusion model is then trained
in this latent space representation. The T1C-RFlow model was trained on a
curated dataset comprised of the BraTS 2024 glioma (GLI; 1480 patients),
meningioma (MEN; 1141 patients), and metastases (MET; 1475 patients) datasets.
Selected patients were split into train (N=2860), validation (N=612), and test
(N=614) sets. Results: Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate
that the T1C-RFlow model outperforms benchmark 3D models (pix2pix, DDPM,
Diffusion Transformers (DiT-3D)) trained in the same latent space. T1C-RFlow
achieved the following metrics - GLI: NMSE 0.044 +/- 0.047, SSIM 0.935 +/-
0.025; MEN: NMSE 0.046 +/- 0.029, SSIM 0.937 +/- 0.021; MET: NMSE 0.098 +/-
0.088, SSIM 0.905 +/- 0.082. T1C-RFlow had the best tumor reconstruction
performance and significantly faster denoising times (6.9 s/volume, 200 steps)
than conventional DDPM models in both latent space (37.7s, 1000 steps) and
patch-based in image space (4.3 hr/volume). Significance: Our proposed method
generates synthetic T1C images that closely resemble ground truth T1C in much
less time than previous diffusion models. Further development may permit a
practical method for contrast-agent-free MRI for brain tumors.

TL;DR: UniVid is a unified video model that combines generation and understanding capabilities using an MLLM with diffusion decoder and lightweight adapter, achieving state-of-the-art performance on video benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in unified video modeling: maintaining semantic faithfulness during flow-based generation due to text-visual token imbalance, and efficiently extending image-centric MLLMs to video without costly retraining.

Method: Couples an MLLM with a diffusion decoder through lightweight adapter; introduces Temperature Modality Alignment for prompt adherence and Pyramid Reflection for efficient temporal reasoning via dynamic keyframe selection.

Result: Achieves 2.2% improvement on VBench-Long total score vs EasyAnimateV5.1, and 1.0% and 3.3% accuracy gains on MSVD-QA and ActivityNet-QA vs best prior 7B baselines.

Conclusion: UniVid provides an effective unified architecture for both video understanding and generation with state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Unified video modeling that combines generation and understanding
capabilities is increasingly important but faces two key challenges:
maintaining semantic faithfulness during flow-based generation due to
text-visual token imbalance and the limitations of uniform cross-modal
attention across the flow trajectory, and efficiently extending image-centric
MLLMs to video without costly retraining. We present UniVid, a unified
architecture that couples an MLLM with a diffusion decoder through a
lightweight adapter, enabling both video understanding and generation. We
introduce Temperature Modality Alignment to improve prompt adherence and
Pyramid Reflection for efficient temporal reasoning via dynamic keyframe
selection. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance, achieving a 2.2% improvement on VBench-Long total
score compared to EasyAnimateV5.1, and 1.0% and 3.3% accuracy gains on MSVD-QA
and ActivityNet-QA, respectively, compared with the best prior 7B baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BALR-SAM is a boundary-aware low-rank adaptation framework that enhances SAM for medical image segmentation by combining detail enhancement, low-rank adapters, and efficient attention mechanisms, achieving SOTA performance while updating only 1.8% of parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision foundation models like SAM struggle with medical image segmentation due to domain gap and require efficient fine-tuning methods that maintain performance while minimizing resource demands in clinical practice.

Method: Three key components: (1) Complementary Detail Enhancement Network with depthwise separable convolutions for boundary features; (2) Low-rank adapters in Vision Transformer blocks; (3) Low-rank tensor attention mechanism in mask decoder reducing memory usage by 75%.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods including fully fine-tuned MedSAM on standard medical segmentation datasets, while updating only 1.8% (11.7M) of parameters and requiring no prompts.

Conclusion: BALR-SAM provides an efficient and effective adaptation framework for medical imaging that addresses domain gap issues while significantly reducing computational resources and maintaining strong segmentation performance.

Abstract: Vision foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM), pretrained on
large-scale natural image datasets, often struggle in medical image
segmentation due to a lack of domain-specific adaptation. In clinical practice,
fine-tuning such models efficiently for medical downstream tasks with minimal
resource demands, while maintaining strong performance, is challenging. To
address these issues, we propose BALR-SAM, a boundary-aware low-rank adaptation
framework that enhances SAM for medical imaging. It combines three tailored
components: (1) a Complementary Detail Enhancement Network (CDEN) using
depthwise separable convolutions and multi-scale fusion to capture
boundary-sensitive features essential for accurate segmentation; (2) low-rank
adapters integrated into SAM's Vision Transformer blocks to optimize feature
representation and attention for medical contexts, while simultaneously
significantly reducing the parameter space; and (3) a low-rank tensor attention
mechanism in the mask decoder, cutting memory usage by 75% and boosting
inference speed. Experiments on standard medical segmentation datasets show
that BALR-SAM, without requiring prompts, outperforms several state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods, including fully fine-tuned MedSAM, while updating just 1.8%
(11.7M) of its parameters.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Forge4D is a feed-forward 4D human reconstruction model that efficiently creates temporally aligned representations from uncalibrated sparse-view videos, enabling both novel view and novel time synthesis through streaming 3D Gaussian reconstruction and dense motion prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for dynamic 3D human reconstruction from sparse-view videos are either too slow or cannot generate novel-time representations, limiting downstream applications.

Method: The model uses streaming 3D Gaussian reconstruction with learnable state tokens for temporal consistency, and a motion prediction module with occlusion-aware Gaussian fusion for interpolation. It employs self-supervised retargeting loss and optical flow loss for motion supervision.

Result: Extensive experiments show effectiveness on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, demonstrating successful 4D reconstruction and interpolation capabilities.

Conclusion: Forge4D provides an efficient solution for instant 4D human reconstruction from sparse-view videos, enabling both novel view and novel time synthesis through joint streaming reconstruction and motion prediction.

Abstract: Instant reconstruction of dynamic 3D humans from uncalibrated sparse-view
videos is critical for numerous downstream applications. Existing methods,
however, are either limited by the slow reconstruction speeds or incapable of
generating novel-time representations. To address these challenges, we propose
Forge4D, a feed-forward 4D human reconstruction and interpolation model that
efficiently reconstructs temporally aligned representations from uncalibrated
sparse-view videos, enabling both novel view and novel time synthesis. Our
model simplifies the 4D reconstruction and interpolation problem as a joint
task of streaming 3D Gaussian reconstruction and dense motion prediction. For
the task of streaming 3D Gaussian reconstruction, we first reconstruct static
3D Gaussians from uncalibrated sparse-view images and then introduce learnable
state tokens to enforce temporal consistency in a memory-friendly manner by
interactively updating shared information across different timestamps. For
novel time synthesis, we design a novel motion prediction module to predict
dense motions for each 3D Gaussian between two adjacent frames, coupled with an
occlusion-aware Gaussian fusion process to interpolate 3D Gaussians at
arbitrary timestamps. To overcome the lack of the ground truth for dense motion
supervision, we formulate dense motion prediction as a dense point matching
task and introduce a self-supervised retargeting loss to optimize this module.
An additional occlusion-aware optical flow loss is introduced to ensure motion
consistency with plausible human movement, providing stronger regularization.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on both
in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Project page and code at:

TL;DR: AVF-MAE++ is a family of audio-visual masked autoencoder models that addresses data scarcity in affective video facial analysis through scalable pre-training and improved cross-modal correlation modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Affective video facial analysis suffers from limited data availability, and while self-supervised learning with MAE has shown promise, scaling properties and cross-modal correlation modeling in this specific domain remain largely unexplored.

Method: Proposes AVF-MAE++ with dual masking strategy across audio/visual modalities, enhanced modality encoders, Iterative Audio-Visual Correlation Learning Module, and progressive semantic injection strategy organized in three training stages.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across 17 datasets covering three major AVFA tasks, with comprehensive ablation studies validating each component's importance.

Conclusion: The framework successfully demonstrates scalable pre-training for AVFA, provides insights into design choices, and releases code/models publicly for community adoption.

Abstract: Affective video facial analysis (AVFA) has emerged as a key research field
for building emotion-aware intelligent systems, yet this field continues to
suffer from limited data availability. In recent years, the self-supervised
learning (SSL) technique of Masked Autoencoders (MAE) has gained momentum, with
growing adaptations in its audio-visual contexts. While scaling has proven
essential for breakthroughs in general multi-modal learning domains, its
specific impact on AVFA remains largely unexplored. Another core challenge in
this field is capturing both intra- and inter-modal correlations through
scalable audio-visual representations. To tackle these issues, we propose
AVF-MAE++, a family of audio-visual MAE models designed to efficiently
investigate the scaling properties in AVFA while enhancing cross-modal
correlation modeling. Our framework introduces a novel dual masking strategy
across audio and visual modalities and strengthens modality encoders with a
more holistic design to better support scalable pre-training. Additionally, we
present the Iterative Audio-Visual Correlation Learning Module, which improves
correlation learning within the SSL paradigm, bridging the limitations of
previous methods. To support smooth adaptation and reduce overfitting risks, we
further introduce a progressive semantic injection strategy, organizing the
model training into three structured stages. Extensive experiments conducted on
17 datasets, covering three major AVFA tasks, demonstrate that AVF-MAE++
achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.
Comprehensive ablation studies further highlight the importance of each
proposed component and provide deeper insights into the design choices driving
these improvements. Our code and models have been publicly released at Github.

TL;DR: The paper introduces two training-free inference-time techniques for robot video generation that actively use action parameters to guide diffusion models, improving action coherence and visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To build effective world models and robotics foundation models by generating realistic robot videos from explicit action trajectories, moving beyond treating actions as passive conditioning signals.

Method: Two training-free techniques: 1) Action-scaled classifier-free guidance that modulates guidance strength based on action magnitude, and 2) Action-scaled noise truncation that adjusts initial noise sampling to align with motion dynamics.

Result: Experiments on real robot manipulation datasets show significant improvements in action coherence and visual quality across diverse robot environments.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively exploit explicit action parameters in diffusion-based video generation, enhancing controllability and motion dynamics without requiring additional training.

Abstract: Generating realistic robot videos from explicit action trajectories is a
critical step toward building effective world models and robotics foundation
models. We introduce two training-free, inference-time techniques that fully
exploit explicit action parameters in diffusion-based robot video generation.
Instead of treating action vectors as passive conditioning signals, our methods
actively incorporate them to guide both the classifier-free guidance process
and the initialization of Gaussian latents. First, action-scaled
classifier-free guidance dynamically modulates guidance strength in proportion
to action magnitude, enhancing controllability over motion intensity. Second,
action-scaled noise truncation adjusts the distribution of initially sampled
noise to better align with the desired motion dynamics. Experiments on real
robot manipulation datasets demonstrate that these techniques significantly
improve action coherence and visual quality across diverse robot environments.

TL;DR: LVR enables autoregressive reasoning directly in visual embedding space, achieving substantial gains on perception-intensive VQA tasks compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs confine reasoning to language space and treat visual information as static preconditions, fundamentally limiting their capabilities.

Method: Projects images into visual tokens in joint semantic space, trains language model to generate latent states that reconstruct key visual tokens for answering queries, and adapts GRPO algorithm for reinforcement learning on latent reasoning.

Result: Achieves 71.67% on MMVP compared to 66.67% with Qwen2.5-VL, showing substantial improvement in fine-grained visual understanding and perception.

Conclusion: LVR paradigm enables direct visual reasoning in embedding space, significantly enhancing multimodal reasoning capabilities beyond language-only approaches.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved notable gains in
various tasks by incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in language
spaces. Recent work extends this direction by leveraging external tools for
visual editing, thereby enhancing the visual signal along the reasoning
trajectories. Nevertheless, these approaches remain fundamentally constrained:
reasoning is still confined to the language space, with visual information
treated as static preconditions. We introduce Latent Visual Reasoning (LVR), a
new paradigm that enables autoregressive reasoning directly in the visual
embedding space. A visual encoder first projects images into visual tokens
within a joint semantic space shared with the language model. The language
model is then trained to generate latent states that reconstruct key visual
tokens critical for answering the query, constituting the process of latent
visual reasoning. By interleaving LVR with standard text generation, our model
achieves substantial gains on perception-intensive visual question answering
tasks. In addition, we adapt the GRPO algorithm to conduct reinforcement
learning on latent reasoning, further balancing LVR and textual generation. We
show that LVR substantially improves fine-grained visual understanding and
perception, achieving 71.67% on MMVP compared to 66.67% with Qwen2.5-VL. Code
base and model weights will be released later.

TL;DR: Proposes CoTAM, an image codec tailored for Multimodal Large Language Models that adaptively protects multi-level features to achieve up to 35.99% bitrate savings while maintaining MLLM task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional image codecs are optimized for human visual fidelity but ill-suited for MLLMs, which require preservation of diverse features for multiple downstream tasks. Cloud-deployed MLLMs need efficient compression for edge device transmission with minimal bandwidth.

Method: CoTAM uses CLIP's shallow-layer attention to generate importance maps for bit allocation, preserving critical semantic regions. The decoder integrates a lightweight adapter with multi-level loss function to reconstruct both low-level details and high-level semantic context.

Result: Achieves up to 35.99% bitrate saving while maintaining same performance on MLLM tasks, outperforming previous state-of-the-art neural codecs.

Conclusion: The proposed CoTAM codec effectively addresses the unique compression needs of MLLMs by adaptively protecting multi-level features, demonstrating significant bandwidth efficiency gains without compromising task performance.

Abstract: The increasing deployment of powerful Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), typically hosted on cloud platforms, urgently requires effective
compression techniques to efficiently transmit signal inputs (e.g., images,
videos) from edge devices with minimal bandwidth usage. However, conventional
image codecs are optimized for fidelity to serve the Human Visual System (HVS)
and ill-suited for MLLMs, in which diverse downstream tasks are jointly
considered. In this paper, we first systematically analyze the impact of
compression artifacts on several mainstream MLLMs. We find that: Compression
distortion unevenly impacts different-level image features, leading to varying
effects on MLLMs' downstream tasks depending on their feature-level reliance.
Motivated by this discovery, we propose an image Codec TAilored to MLLMs
(CoTAM) designed to adaptively protect multi-level features and suit different
demands of downstream tasks. The encoder leverages CLIP's shallow-layer
attention to generate an importance map for bit allocation, preserving critical
semantic regions. Concurrently, the decoder integrates a lightweight adapter
with a multi-level loss function to ensure the faithful reconstruction both of
low-level details and high-level semantic context for robust synthesis of
cross-level features. Extensive experiments validate that our method achieves
up to 35.99\% bitrate saving while maintaining the same performance on the MLLM
tasks, outperforming previous SOTA neural codecs.

Motivation: To address the substantial storage and computational demands of large-scale SNNs despite recent binary SNN advances, by exploring further compression and acceleration potential.

Method: Establishes S²NN baseline using kernel clustering patterns, then introduces OS-Quant to mitigate outlier-induced codeword selection bias, and MPFD for feature distillation from teacher models.

Result: Extensive experiments on vision and non-vision tasks show S²NN outperforms existing quantized SNNs in both performance and efficiency.

Conclusion: S²NNs are promising for edge computing applications due to their superior performance and efficiency compared to existing quantized SNN approaches.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer an energy-efficient paradigm for machine
intelligence, but their continued scaling poses challenges for resource-limited
deployment. Despite recent advances in binary SNNs, the storage and
computational demands remain substantial for large-scale networks. To further
explore the compression and acceleration potential of SNNs, we propose Sub-bit
Spiking Neural Networks (S$^2$NNs) that represent weights with less than one
bit. Specifically, we first establish an S$^2$NN baseline by leveraging the
clustering patterns of kernels in well-trained binary SNNs. This baseline is
highly efficient but suffers from \textit{outlier-induced codeword selection
bias} during training. To mitigate this issue, we propose an
\textit{outlier-aware sub-bit weight quantization} (OS-Quant) method, which
optimizes codeword selection by identifying and adaptively scaling outliers.
Furthermore, we propose a \textit{membrane potential-based feature
distillation} (MPFD) method, improving the performance of highly compressed
S$^2$NN via more precise guidance from a teacher model. Extensive results on
vision and non-vision tasks reveal that S$^2$NN outperforms existing quantized
SNNs in both performance and efficiency, making it promising for edge computing
applications.

In this work, we introduce a cycle training framework to fine-tune diffusion
models for improved conditioning adherence and enhanced synthetic image
realism. Our approach, Cycle Diffusion Model (CDM), enforces consistency
between generated and original images by incorporating cycle constraints,
enabling more reliable direct and counterfactual generation. Experiments on a
combined 3D brain MRI dataset (from ABCD, HCP aging & young adults, ADNI, and
PPMI) show that our method improves conditioning accuracy and enhances image
quality as measured by FID and SSIM. The results suggest that the cycle
strategy used in CDM can be an effective method for refining diffusion-based
medical image generation, with applications in data augmentation,
counterfactual, and disease progression modeling.

*Yongqiang Wang,Weigang Li,Wenping Liu,Zhiqiang Tian,Jinling Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A skeleton-based robust registration framework (SRRF) that uses corruption-resilient skeletal representations to improve point cloud registration accuracy and robustness against density distortions, noise contamination, and geometric deformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world point clouds suffer from sensor limitations, environmental noise, and preprocessing errors, making registration challenging. Existing methods relying on direct point matching or surface feature extraction are highly susceptible to these corruptions.

Method: Integrates skeletal structures into registration process, combines transformations from both corrupted point cloud alignment and skeleton alignment, and uses a distribution distance loss function to enforce consistency between source and target skeletons.

Result: SRRF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art registration methods across various corruption scenarios including density distortions, noise contamination, and geometric deformations on diverse corrupted datasets.

Conclusion: The framework provides robust and accurate registration by considering both original local geometric features and global stability of skeleton structure, making it suitable for 3D perception tasks in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Point cloud registration is fundamental in 3D vision applications, including
autonomous driving, robotics, and medical imaging, where precise alignment of
multiple point clouds is essential for accurate environment reconstruction.
However, real-world point clouds are often affected by sensor limitations,
environmental noise, and preprocessing errors, making registration challenging
due to density distortions, noise contamination, and geometric deformations.
Existing registration methods rely on direct point matching or surface feature
extraction, which are highly susceptible to these corruptions and lead to
reduced alignment accuracy. To address these challenges, a skeleton-based
robust registration framework is presented, which introduces a
corruption-resilient skeletal representation to improve registration robustness
and accuracy. The framework integrates skeletal structures into the
registration process and combines the transformations obtained from both the
corrupted point cloud alignment and its skeleton alignment to achieve optimal
registration. In addition, a distribution distance loss function is designed to
enforce the consistency between the source and target skeletons, which
significantly improves the registration performance. This framework ensures
that the alignment considers both the original local geometric features and the
global stability of the skeleton structure, resulting in robust and accurate
registration results. Experimental evaluations on diverse corrupted datasets
demonstrate that SRRF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art registration
methods across various corruption scenarios, including density distortions,
noise contamination, and geometric deformations. The results confirm the
robustness of SRRF in handling corrupted point clouds, making it a potential
approach for 3D perception tasks in real-world scenarios.

*Yongqiang Wang,Weigang Li,Wenping Liu,Zhe Xu,Zhiqiang Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CEGC is a confidence-driven framework for partial 3D point cloud registration that jointly models overlap confidence and correspondence reliability using global context to handle structural ambiguity, partial visibility, and noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Partial point cloud registration faces challenges from structural ambiguity, partial visibility, and noise, making accurate alignment difficult in complex scenes.

Method: Uses hybrid overlap confidence estimation (semantic descriptors + geometric similarity) and context-aware matching with global attention to assign soft confidence scores, guiding a differentiable weighted SVD solver for transformation computation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN, and 7Scenes datasets in accuracy, robustness, and generalization.

Conclusion: CEGC provides an interpretable and scalable solution for partial point cloud registration under challenging conditions.

Abstract: Partial point cloud registration is essential for autonomous perception and
3D scene understanding, yet it remains challenging owing to structural
ambiguity, partial visibility, and noise. We address these issues by proposing
Confidence Estimation under Global Context (CEGC), a unified, confidence-driven
framework for robust partial 3D registration. CEGC enables accurate alignment
in complex scenes by jointly modeling overlap confidence and correspondence
reliability within a shared global context. Specifically, the hybrid overlap
confidence estimation module integrates semantic descriptors and geometric
similarity to detect overlapping regions and suppress outliers early. The
context-aware matching strategy smitigates ambiguity by employing global
attention to assign soft confidence scores to correspondences, improving
robustness. These scores guide a differentiable weighted singular value
decomposition solver to compute precise transformations. This tightly coupled
pipeline adaptively down-weights uncertain regions and emphasizes contextually
reliable matches. Experiments on ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN, and 7Scenes 3D
vision datasets demonstrate that CEGC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
accuracy, robustness, and generalization. Overall, CEGC offers an interpretable
and scalable solution to partial point cloud registration under challenging
conditions.

*Sai Raj Kishore Perla,Aditya Vora,Sauradip Nag,Ali Mahdavi-Amiri,Hao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ASIA enables 3D segmentation of arbitrary parts using few image annotations, leveraging diffusion models to transfer segmentation from 2D to 3D space with cross-view consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D segmentation methods require expensive multi-view images, complex 3D model annotations, or ambiguous text descriptions. ASIA addresses this by using easier-to-collect in-the-wild image annotations.

Method: Optimizes text tokens for each segment, fine-tunes with cross-view part correspondence loss, segments multi-view renderings, fuses labels in UV-space via voting, and refines with Noise Optimization technique.

Result: Outperforms existing methods by a noticeable margin in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations for both semantic and non-semantic 3D segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: ASIA provides a practical and generalizable solution for 3D segmentation that works with few image annotations and handles significant geometric/structure differences between annotated and target objects.

Abstract: We introduce ASIA (Adaptive 3D Segmentation using few Image Annotations), a
novel framework that enables segmentation of possibly non-semantic and
non-text-describable "parts" in 3D. Our segmentation is controllable through a
few user-annotated in-the-wild images, which are easier to collect than
multi-view images, less demanding to annotate than 3D models, and more precise
than potentially ambiguous text descriptions. Our method leverages the rich
priors of text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion (SD), to
transfer segmentations from image space to 3D, even when the annotated and
target objects differ significantly in geometry or structure. During training,
we optimize a text token for each segment and fine-tune our model with a novel
cross-view part correspondence loss. At inference, we segment multi-view
renderings of the 3D mesh, fuse the labels in UV-space via voting, refine them
with our novel Noise Optimization technique, and finally map the UV-labels back
onto the mesh. ASIA provides a practical and generalizable solution for both
semantic and non-semantic 3D segmentation tasks, outperforming existing methods
by a noticeable margin in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

*Hanqi Chen,Zhongyin Zhao,Ye Chen,Zhujin Liang,Bingbing Ni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SVGThinker is a reasoning-driven framework for text-to-SVG generation that uses chain-of-thought reasoning to improve generalization and instruction adherence, producing more stable and editable vector graphics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address weak generalization and poor adherence to input instructions in text-to-SVG generation using large language models.

Method: A pipeline that renders SVG primitives sequentially, uses multimodal models for annotation, builds stepwise updates mirroring incremental primitive addition, and trains LLMs with supervised fine-tuning using chain-of-thought reasoning.

Result: SVGThinker produces more stable, editable, and higher-quality SVGs while preserving vector graphics structural advantages, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The framework enables precise hierarchical editing and opens new directions for design, content creation, and automated graphics generation, unlike image-based methods.

Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is a code-based representation for 2D visuals.
Leveraging recent advances in large language models (LLMs), we study
text-to-SVG generation and address two persistent gaps: weak generalization and
poor adherence to input instructions. We present SVGThinker, a reasoning-driven
framework that aligns the production of SVG code with the visualization process
and supports the full set of SVG primitives. Our pipeline first renders each
primitive in sequence and uses a multimodal model to annotate the image and
code; we then build stepwise updates that mirror the incremental addition of
primitives. On this data, we train an LLM with supervised fine-tuning that
exposes its chain-of-thought as intermediate reasoning, improving robustness
and reducing errors and hallucinations. Experiments against state-of-the-art
baselines show that SVGThinker produces more stable, editable, and
higher-quality SVGs while preserving the structural advantages of vector
graphics. Unlike image-based methods, our outputs enable precise and
hierarchical editing, opening new directions for design, content creation, and
automated graphics generation.

*Zefeng He,Xiaoye Qu,Yafu Li,Siyuan Huang,Daizong Liu,Yu Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FrameThinker is a novel framework that enables Large Vision-Language Models to iteratively interrogate long videos through strategic frame selection, achieving state-of-the-art performance with dramatically reduced frame processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLMs struggle with long video reasoning due to uniform frame sampling and static textual reasoning, which are inefficient and inadequate for visually intensive video tasks.

Method: Two-phase training: Supervised Fine-Tuning to instill fundamental action capabilities, followed by Reinforcement Learning with comprehensive reward design to optimize strategic decision-making for frame selection.

Result: Achieves 76.1% accuracy on LongVideo-Reason using only 20.6 frames on average, outperforming LongVILA-R1 (72.0%) with over 20x fewer frames (vs. 512). Overall average improvement of +10.4% over baselines.

Conclusion: FrameThinker demonstrates unparalleled efficiency and effectiveness in long video reasoning, establishing new state-of-the-art performance while drastically reducing computational costs through strategic frame interrogation.

Abstract: While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved substantial progress
in video understanding, their application to long video reasoning is hindered
by uniform frame sampling and static textual reasoning, which are inefficient
and struggle to handle visually intensive video tasks. To overcome these
challenges, in this paper, we introduce the concept of thinking with long
videos and propose a novel framework FrameThinker. Within this framework, LVLMs
are able to iteratively interrogate video content. Developing such video
reasoning capabilities in LVLMs presents notable challenges, particularly in
adapting the model to new video actions (e.g. select frame), and designing
reward functions to guide LVLMs to adopt the newly introduced action. To solve
these challenges, we propose a two-phase training strategy, first employing
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to instill fundamental action capabilities,
followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize a strategic decision-making
policy.Notably, in this RL phase, we conduct an in-depth and comprehensive
exploration of the reward design for each action and format reward. Extensive
experiments on reasoning benchmarks like Video-Holmes, LongVideo-Reason, and
long-video understanding benchmarks such as LongVideoBench, MLVU, VideoMME, and
LVBench, demonstrate that FrameThinker achieves a significant average
improvement of +10.4% over baselines while drastically reducing the number of
processed frames. Most notably, our 7B model, FrameThinker establishes a new
state-of-the-art on LongVideo-Reason, achieving 76.1% accuracy using an average
of only 20.6 frames. This not only outperforms the competitive LongVILA-R1
(72.0%) but does so with over 20x fewer frames (vs. 512), demonstrating
unparalleled efficiency and effectiveness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OMeGa is an end-to-end framework that jointly optimizes triangle meshes and 2D Gaussian splats for improved indoor scene reconstruction, addressing geometry inaccuracies in texture-less regions through mesh constraints and iterative refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural rendering methods suffer from inaccurate geometry in texture-less indoor regions and decouple mesh extraction from optimization, missing opportunities to leverage mesh geometry for guiding splat optimization.

Method: Joint optimization of explicit triangle mesh and 2D Gaussian splats via flexible binding strategy, integrating mesh constraints and monocular normal supervision, with heuristic iterative mesh-refinement that splits high-error faces and prunes unreliable ones.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on indoor reconstruction benchmarks, reducing Chamfer-L1 by 47.3% over 2DGS baseline while maintaining competitive novel-view rendering quality.

Conclusion: OMeGa effectively addresses prior limitations in indoor texture-less reconstruction by integrating mesh optimization with Gaussian splatting.

Abstract: Neural rendering with Gaussian splatting has advanced novel view synthesis,
and most methods reconstruct surfaces via post-hoc mesh extraction. However,
existing methods suffer from two limitations: (i) inaccurate geometry in
texture-less indoor regions, and (ii) the decoupling of mesh extraction from
optimization, thereby missing the opportunity to leverage mesh geometry to
guide splat optimization. In this paper, we present OMeGa, an end-to-end
framework that jointly optimizes an explicit triangle mesh and 2D Gaussian
splats via a flexible binding strategy, where spatial attributes of Gaussian
Splats are expressed in the mesh frame and texture attributes are retained on
splats. To further improve reconstruction accuracy, we integrate mesh
constraints and monocular normal supervision into the optimization, thereby
regularizing geometry learning. In addition, we propose a heuristic, iterative
mesh-refinement strategy that splits high-error faces and prunes unreliable
ones to further improve the detail and accuracy of the reconstructed mesh.
OMeGa achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging indoor
reconstruction benchmarks, reducing Chamfer-$L_1$ by 47.3\% over the 2DGS
baseline while maintaining competitive novel-view rendering quality. The
experimental results demonstrate that OMeGa effectively addresses prior
limitations in indoor texture-less reconstruction.

Motivation: Address challenges in cryo-ET subtomogram analysis including scarce annotations, severe noise, and poor generalization by developing foundation models.

Method: Three key components: 1) CryoEngine for large-scale synthetic data generation (904k subtomograms from 452 classes), 2) APT-ViT with adaptive phase tokenization for equivariance, 3) Noise-Resilient Contrastive Learning for stable representation under noise.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on all three major subtomogram tasks across 24 synthetic and real datasets, with strong generalization to unseen datasets.

Conclusion: Advances scalable and robust subtomogram analysis in cryo-ET through foundation model approach with synthetic data, equivariance enhancement, and noise resilience.

Abstract: Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) enables in situ visualization of
macromolecular structures, where subtomogram analysis tasks such as
classification, alignment, and averaging are critical for structural
determination. However, effective analysis is hindered by scarce annotations,
severe noise, and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we take the
first step towards foundation models for cryo-ET subtomograms. First, we
introduce CryoEngine, a large-scale synthetic data generator that produces over
904k subtomograms from 452 particle classes for pretraining. Second, we design
an Adaptive Phase Tokenization-enhanced Vision Transformer (APT-ViT), which
incorporates adaptive phase tokenization as an equivariance-enhancing module
that improves robustness to both geometric and semantic variations. Third, we
introduce a Noise-Resilient Contrastive Learning (NRCL) strategy to stabilize
representation learning under severe noise conditions. Evaluations across 24
synthetic and real datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on
all three major subtomogram tasks and strong generalization to unseen datasets,
advancing scalable and robust subtomogram analysis in cryo-ET.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional feature-metric methods miss complex inter-correlation relationships, while correlation-metric approaches suffer from high computational costs due to processing 4D correlation maps.

Method: Uses selective state-space models (SSMs) with a similarity-aware selective scan mechanism adapted from Mamba's linear-complexity algorithm to refine 4D correlation maps without compromising feature resolution or receptive field.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard semantic correspondence benchmarks.

Conclusion: MambaMatcher effectively overcomes limitations of both traditional feature-metric and recent correlation-metric approaches by efficiently modeling high-dimensional correlations with linear complexity.

Abstract: Establishing semantic correspondences between images is a fundamental yet
challenging task in computer vision. Traditional feature-metric methods enhance
visual features but may miss complex inter-correlation relationships, while
recent correlation-metric approaches are hindered by high computational costs
due to processing 4D correlation maps. We introduce MambaMatcher, a novel
method that overcomes these limitations by efficiently modeling
high-dimensional correlations using selective state-space models (SSMs). By
implementing a similarity-aware selective scan mechanism adapted from Mamba's
linear-complexity algorithm, MambaMatcher refines the 4D correlation map
effectively without compromising feature map resolution or receptive field.
Experiments on standard semantic correspondence benchmarks demonstrate that
MambaMatcher achieves state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Animal counting in smart farming is challenging due to occlusions and limited camera views in crowded scenes.

Method: Uses tri-plane-based multi-view fusion with geometric projection to integrate features from multiple cameras onto a unified ground plane, then decodes scene-level density maps.

Result: Achieves 95.1% accuracy and strong robustness in dense, occluded scenarios, outperforming single-view and conventional fusion methods.

Conclusion: Demonstrates practical potential for intelligent agriculture with superior performance in challenging farming conditions.

Abstract: Accurate animal counting is essential for smart farming but remains difficult
in crowded scenes due to occlusions and limited camera views. To address this,
we propose a tri-plane-based multi-view chicken counting model (TP-MVCC), which
leverages geometric projection and tri-plane fusion to integrate features from
multiple cameras onto a unified ground plane. The framework extracts
single-view features, aligns them via spatial transformation, and decodes a
scene-level density map for precise chicken counting. In addition, we construct
the first multi-view dataset of silkie chickens under real farming conditions.
Experiments show that TP-MVCC significantly outperforms single-view and
conventional fusion comparisons, achieving 95.1\% accuracy and strong
robustness in dense, occluded scenarios, demonstrating its practical potential
for intelligent agriculture.

*Guolin Ke,Hui Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SphereAR addresses variance collapse in autoregressive image generation by constraining VAE latents to a hypersphere, achieving state-of-the-art FID scores and outperforming larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models for image generation suffer from heterogeneous variance in VAE latents that gets amplified during decoding, especially under classifier-free guidance, leading to variance collapse.

Method: Proposes SphereAR which constrains all AR inputs and outputs to lie on a fixed-radius hypersphere using hyperspherical VAEs, removing the scale component that causes variance collapse.

Result: SphereAR-H (943M) achieves FID 1.34 on ImageNet, setting new AR state-of-the-art. Smaller variants SphereAR-L (479M) and SphereAR-B (208M) achieve FID 1.54 and 1.92 respectively, matching or surpassing much larger baselines.

Conclusion: SphereAR is the first pure next-token AR image generator with raster order that surpasses diffusion and masked-generation models at comparable parameter scales, demonstrating the effectiveness of hyperspherical constraints.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models are promising for image generation, yet
continuous-token AR variants often trail latent diffusion and masked-generation
models. The core issue is heterogeneous variance in VAE latents, which is
amplified during AR decoding, especially under classifier-free guidance (CFG),
and can cause variance collapse. We propose SphereAR to address this issue. Its
core design is to constrain all AR inputs and outputs -- including after CFG --
to lie on a fixed-radius hypersphere (constant $\ell_2$ norm), leveraging
hyperspherical VAEs. Our theoretical analysis shows that hyperspherical
constraint removes the scale component (the primary cause of variance
collapse), thereby stabilizing AR decoding. Empirically, on ImageNet
generation, SphereAR-H (943M) sets a new state of the art for AR models,
achieving FID 1.34. Even at smaller scales, SphereAR-L (479M) reaches FID 1.54
and SphereAR-B (208M) reaches 1.92, matching or surpassing much larger
baselines such as MAR-H (943M, 1.55) and VAR-d30 (2B, 1.92). To our knowledge,
this is the first time a pure next-token AR image generator with raster order
surpasses diffusion and masked-generation models at comparable parameter
scales.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-agent framework for agricultural visual question answering that integrates four roles (Retriever, Reflector, Answerer, Improver) to handle multi-image inputs and incomplete evidence through self-reflective reasoning and iterative improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agricultural QA systems are limited to text-only queries or single-image cases, failing to handle real-world scenarios requiring multi-image inputs across spatial scales and growth stages, and struggling with incomplete evidence due to limited external context access.

Method: Proposes a self-reflective multi-agent framework with four collaborative roles: Retriever (gathers external info), Reflector (assesses adequacy and triggers reformulation), Answerer (drafts candidate responses), and Improver (refines answers through iterative checks and multi-image alignment).

Result: Experiments on the AgMMU benchmark show the framework achieves competitive performance on multi-image agricultural QA tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed self-reflective multi-agent framework effectively addresses limitations of existing agricultural QA systems by enabling context enrichment, reflective reasoning, and iterative improvement for handling multi-image inputs and incomplete evidence.

Abstract: Agricultural visual question answering is essential for providing farmers and
researchers with accurate and timely knowledge. However, many existing
approaches are predominantly developed for evidence-constrained settings such
as text-only queries or single-image cases. This design prevents them from
coping with real-world agricultural scenarios that often require multi-image
inputs with complementary views across spatial scales, and growth stages.
Moreover, limited access to up-to-date external agricultural context makes
these systems struggle to adapt when evidence is incomplete. In addition, rigid
pipelines often lack systematic quality control. To address this gap, we
propose a self-reflective and self-improving multi-agent framework that
integrates four roles, the Retriever, the Reflector, the Answerer, and the
Improver. They collaborate to enable context enrichment, reflective reasoning,
answer drafting, and iterative improvement.
  A Retriever formulates queries and gathers external information, while a
Reflector assesses adequacy and triggers sequential reformulation and renewed
retrieval. Two Answerers draft candidate responses in parallel to reduce bias.
The Improver refines them through iterative checks while ensuring that
information from multiple images is effectively aligned and utilized.
Experiments on the AgMMU benchmark show that our framework achieves competitive
performance on multi-image agricultural QA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeRV-Diffusion is an implicit latent video diffusion model that generates videos by synthesizing neural network weights, which form an implicit neural representation (INR) to decode videos from frame indices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an efficient and high-quality video synthesis framework that compresses and generates videos holistically as unified neural networks, avoiding temporal cross-frame attentions and enabling smooth interpolations.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Hypernetwork-based tokenizer encodes videos to neural parameter space, 2) Implicit diffusion transformer denoises latent INR weights. Uses modified NeRV architecture with shared bottleneck latent, reformed weight assignment, SNR-adaptive loss weighting, and scheduled sampling.

Result: Superior video generation quality over previous INR-based models and comparable performance to state-of-the-art non-implicit models on UCF-101 and Kinetics-600 benchmarks. Enables smooth interpolations between frames/videos.

Conclusion: NeRV-Diffusion demonstrates effective implicit video generation through neural weight synthesis, achieving competitive performance while providing a smooth latent space for interpolation capabilities.

Abstract: We present NeRV-Diffusion, an implicit latent video diffusion model that
synthesizes videos via generating neural network weights. The generated weights
can be rearranged as the parameters of a convolutional neural network, which
forms an implicit neural representation (INR), and decodes into videos with
frame indices as the input. Our framework consists of two stages: 1) A
hypernetworkbased tokenizer that encodes raw videos from pixel space to neural
parameter space, where the bottleneck latent serves as INR weights to decode.
2) An implicit diffusion transformer that denoises on the latent INR weights.
In contrast to traditional video tokenizers that encode videos into frame-wise
feature maps, NeRV-Diffusion compresses and generates a video holistically as a
unified neural network. This enables efficient and high-quality video synthesis
via obviating temporal cross-frame attentions in the denoiser and decoding
video latent with dedicated decoders. To achieve Gaussian-distributed INR
weights with high expressiveness, we reuse the bottleneck latent across all
NeRV layers, as well as reform its weight assignment, upsampling connection and
input coordinates. We also introduce SNR-adaptive loss weighting and scheduled
sampling for effective training of the implicit diffusion model. NeRV-Diffusion
reaches superior video generation quality over previous INR-based models and
comparable performance to most recent state-of-the-art non-implicit models on
real-world video benchmarks including UCF-101 and Kinetics-600. It also brings
a smooth INR weight space that facilitates seamless interpolations between
frames or videos.

Motivation: To address the high computational cost of Transformers and their deficiencies in extracting local detailed information in multi-organ medical image segmentation.

Method: Proposes LamFormer with Linear Attention Mamba in pyramid encoder for multi-scale dependencies, Parallel Hierarchical Feature Aggregation module for feature integration, and Reduced Transformer for global modeling of up-sampled features.

Result: Outperforms existing segmentation methods on seven complex datasets and achieves balance between performance and model complexity.

Conclusion: LamFormer effectively addresses computational cost and local detail extraction issues in medical image segmentation while maintaining high performance.

Abstract: In the field of multi-organ medical image segmentation, recent methods
frequently employ Transformers to capture long-range dependencies from image
features. However, these methods overlook the high computational cost of
Transformers and their deficiencies in extracting local detailed information.
To address high computational costs and inadequate local detail information, we
reassess the design of feature extraction modules and propose a new
deep-learning network called LamFormer for fine-grained segmentation tasks
across multiple organs. LamFormer is a novel U-shaped network that employs
Linear Attention Mamba (LAM) in an enhanced pyramid encoder to capture
multi-scale long-range dependencies. We construct the Parallel Hierarchical
Feature Aggregation (PHFA) module to aggregate features from different layers
of the encoder, narrowing the semantic gap among features while filtering
information. Finally, we design the Reduced Transformer (RT), which utilizes a
distinct computational approach to globally model up-sampled features. RRT
enhances the extraction of detailed local information and improves the
network's capability to capture long-range dependencies. LamFormer outperforms
existing segmentation methods on seven complex and diverse datasets,
demonstrating exceptional performance. Moreover, the proposed network achieves
a balance between model performance and model complexity.

### [242] [DRIFT: Divergent Response in Filtered Transformations for Robust Adversarial Defense](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24359)
*Amira Guesmi,Muhammad Shafique*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DRIFT is a stochastic ensemble defense that disrupts gradient consensus to improve adversarial robustness by enforcing gradient dissonance across transformations while maintaining natural prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples, and most defenses fail when gradients can be reliably estimated. The paper identifies gradient consensus as a key driver of adversarial transferability that attackers exploit.

Method: Introduces DRIFT - a stochastic ensemble of lightweight, learnable filters trained to actively disrupt gradient consensus through consensus-divergence training combining prediction consistency, Jacobian separation, logit-space separation, and adversarial robustness.

Result: DRIFT achieves substantial robustness gains on ImageNet across CNNs and Vision Transformers, outperforming state-of-the-art preprocessing, adversarial training, and diffusion-based defenses under various attack scenarios with negligible runtime and memory cost.

Conclusion: Gradient divergence is established as a practical and generalizable principle for adversarial defense, providing robust protection while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Deep neural networks remain highly vulnerable to adversarial examples, and
most defenses collapse once gradients can be reliably estimated. We identify
\emph{gradient consensus} -- the tendency of randomized transformations to
yield aligned gradients -- as a key driver of adversarial transferability.
Attackers exploit this consensus to construct perturbations that remain
effective across transformations. We introduce \textbf{DRIFT} (Divergent
Response in Filtered Transformations), a stochastic ensemble of lightweight,
learnable filters trained to actively disrupt gradient consensus. Unlike prior
randomized defenses that rely on gradient masking, DRIFT enforces
\emph{gradient dissonance} by maximizing divergence in Jacobian- and
logit-space responses while preserving natural predictions. Our contributions
are threefold: (i) we formalize gradient consensus and provide a theoretical
analysis linking consensus to transferability; (ii) we propose a
consensus-divergence training strategy combining prediction consistency,
Jacobian separation, logit-space separation, and adversarial robustness; and
(iii) we show that DRIFT achieves substantial robustness gains on ImageNet
across CNNs and Vision Transformers, outperforming state-of-the-art
preprocessing, adversarial training, and diffusion-based defenses under
adaptive white-box, transfer-based, and gradient-free attacks. DRIFT delivers
these improvements with negligible runtime and memory cost, establishing
gradient divergence as a practical and generalizable principle for adversarial
defense.

*Hao Yang,Weijie Qiu,Ru Zhang,Zhou Fang,Ruichao Mao,Xiaoyu Lin,Maji Huang,Zhaosong Huang,Teng Guo,Shuoyang Liu,Hai Rao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UI-UG is a unified Multimodal Large Language Model that integrates both UI understanding and generation capabilities, achieving SOTA performance on understanding tasks and competitive generation performance with lower computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs face challenges in domain-specific UI tasks, particularly in understanding accuracy and generation quality for complex modern UIs.

Method: Uses SFT with GRPO for understanding tasks, DPO for generation tasks, and proposes an industrial workflow including LLM-friendly DSL, training strategies, rendering processes, and evaluation metrics.

Result: Achieves SOTA on understanding tasks, outperforming larger general-purpose MLLMs and similarly-sized UI-specialized models. On par with larger MLLMs in UI generation at fraction of computational cost. Integration improves both accuracy and quality.

Conclusion: UI-UG successfully integrates UI understanding and generation, demonstrating that combining both capabilities can mutually enhance performance while being computationally efficient.

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have been widely applied
across domains, they are still facing challenges in domain-specific tasks, such
as User Interface (UI) understanding accuracy and UI generation quality. In
this paper, we introduce UI-UG (a unified MLLM for UI Understanding and
Generation), integrating both capabilities. For understanding tasks, we employ
Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) combined with Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) to enhance fine-grained understanding on the modern complex UI data. For
generation tasks, we further use Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to make
our model generate human-preferred UIs. In addition, we propose an industrially
effective workflow, including the design of an LLM-friendly domain-specific
language (DSL), training strategies, rendering processes, and evaluation
metrics. In experiments, our model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance
on understanding tasks, outperforming both larger general-purpose MLLMs and
similarly-sized UI-specialized models. Our model is also on par with these
larger MLLMs in UI generation performance at a fraction of the computational
cost. We also demonstrate that integrating understanding and generation tasks
can improve accuracy and quality for both tasks.

### [244] [Uni-X: Mitigating Modality Conflict with a Two-End-Separated Architecture for Unified Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24365)
*Jitai Hao,Hao Liu,Xinyan Xiao,Qiang Huang,Jun Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Uni-X is a novel multimodal architecture that addresses gradient conflicts in shared transformers by using modality-specific layers at both ends and shared middle layers, achieving superior efficiency and performance compared to standard unified models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard unified multimodal models suffer from severe gradient conflicts between vision and text modalities due to their different low-level statistical properties, particularly in shallow and deep layers.

Method: Proposes Uni-X, a two-end-separated, middle-shared architecture with modality-specific initial and final layers, and shared parameters in middle layers for high-level semantic fusion.

Result: Uni-X achieves superior training efficiency and, when scaled to 3B parameters, matches or surpasses 7B AR-based unified multimodal models, with a GenEval score of 82 for image generation and strong performance in text/vision understanding.

Conclusion: Uni-X establishes a parameter-efficient and scalable foundation for unified multimodal modeling by effectively eliminating gradient conflicts while maintaining semantic fusion capabilities.

Abstract: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) built on shared autoregressive (AR)
transformers are attractive for their architectural simplicity. However, we
identify a critical limitation: when trained on multimodal inputs,
modality-shared transformers suffer from severe gradient conflicts between
vision and text, particularly in shallow and deep layers. We trace this issue
to the fundamentally different low-level statistical properties of images and
text, while noting that conflicts diminish in middle layers where
representations become more abstract and semantically aligned. To overcome this
challenge, we propose Uni-X, a two-end-separated, middle-shared architecture.
Uni-X dedicates its initial and final layers to modality-specific processing,
while maintaining shared parameters in the middle layers for high-level
semantic fusion. This X-shaped design not only eliminates gradient conflicts at
both ends but also further alleviates residual conflicts in the shared layers.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Uni-X. Under identical
training conditions, Uni-X achieves superior training efficiency compared to
strong baselines. When scaled to 3B parameters with larger training data, Uni-X
matches or surpasses 7B AR-based UMMs, achieving a GenEval score of 82 for
image generation alongside strong performance in text and vision understanding
tasks. These results establish Uni-X as a parameter-efficient and scalable
foundation for future unified multimodal modeling. Our code is available at

*Jinhee Park,Guisik Kim,Choongsang Cho,Junseok Kwon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: R²M is a training-free model merging framework for deepfake detection that combines specialized detectors through weight averaging and residual decomposition, achieving better performance than joint training while being composable for new forgery types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfake generators evolve rapidly, making exhaustive data collection and repeated retraining impractical. Model merging is well-suited for deepfake detection since specialists share the same binary decision but differ in generator-specific artifacts.

Method: Real-aware Residual Model Merging (R²M) estimates a shared Real component via low-rank factorization, decomposes specialists into Real-aligned parts and Fake residuals, denoises residuals with layerwise rank truncation, and aggregates them with per-task norm matching.

Result: R²M outperforms joint training and other merging baselines across in-distribution, cross-dataset, and unseen-dataset scenarios. It also enables composability - when new forgery families appear, fine-tuning one specialist and re-merging eliminates retraining needs.

Conclusion: Model merging is an effective approach for deepfake detection that preserves Real representations while attenuating Fake-specific cues, with R²M providing a training-free framework that achieves strong performance and composability for evolving deepfake threats.

Abstract: Deepfake generators evolve quickly, making exhaustive data collection and
repeated retraining impractical. We argue that model merging is a natural fit
for deepfake detection: unlike generic multi-task settings with disjoint
labels, deepfake specialists share the same binary decision and differ in
generator-specific artifacts. Empirically, we show that simple weight averaging
preserves Real representations while attenuating Fake-specific cues. Building
upon these findings, we propose Real-aware Residual Model Merging (R$^2$M), a
training-free parameter-space merging framework. R$^2$M estimates a shared Real
component via a low-rank factorization of task vectors, decomposes each
specialist into a Real-aligned part and a Fake residual, denoises residuals
with layerwise rank truncation, and aggregates them with per-task norm matching
to prevent any single generator from dominating. A concise rationale explains
why a simple head suffices: the Real component induces a common separation
direction in feature space, while truncated residuals contribute only minor
off-axis variations. Across in-distribution, cross-dataset, and unseen-dataset,
R$^2$M outperforms joint training and other merging baselines. Importantly,
R$^2$M is also composable: when a new forgery family appears, we fine-tune one
specialist and re-merge, eliminating the need for retraining.

*Khawlah Bajbaa,Abbas Anwar,Muhammad Saqib,Hafeez Anwar,Nabin Sharma,Muhammad Usman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid framework combining diffusion models and conditional GANs to generate geographically consistent street-view images from satellite imagery, achieving improved visual quality and geometric consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Street view imagery is valuable for urban analytics, but synthesizing street views from satellite images is challenging due to significant appearance and perspective differences between the two domains.

Method: Multi-stage training strategy using Stable Diffusion as core component in dual-branch architecture, integrated with conditional GAN for panoramic street views, and fusion strategy combining both models' strengths.

Result: Outperforms diffusion-only methods across multiple metrics and achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art GAN methods on CVUSA dataset, generating realistic street views with preserved local details.

Conclusion: The hybrid framework successfully generates geometrically consistent and visually realistic street-view images from satellite imagery, preserving fine details like street markings and atmospheric elements.

Abstract: Street view imagery has become an essential source for geospatial data
collection and urban analytics, enabling the extraction of valuable insights
that support informed decision-making. However, synthesizing street-view images
from corresponding satellite imagery presents significant challenges due to
substantial differences in appearance and viewing perspective between these two
domains. This paper presents a hybrid framework that integrates diffusion-based
models and conditional generative adversarial networks to generate
geographically consistent street-view images from satellite imagery. Our
approach uses a multi-stage training strategy that incorporates Stable
Diffusion as the core component within a dual-branch architecture. To enhance
the framework's capabilities, we integrate a conditional Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) that enables the generation of geographically consistent
panoramic street views. Furthermore, we implement a fusion strategy that
leverages the strengths of both models to create robust representations,
thereby improving the geometric consistency and visual quality of the generated
street-view images. The proposed framework is evaluated on the challenging
Cross-View USA (CVUSA) dataset, a standard benchmark for cross-view image
synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that our hybrid approach
outperforms diffusion-only methods across multiple evaluation metrics and
achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art GAN-based
methods. The framework successfully generates realistic and geometrically
consistent street-view images while preserving fine-grained local details,
including street markings, secondary roads, and atmospheric elements such as
clouds.

*Congjia Chen,Yufu Qu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DINOReg is a point cloud registration network that effectively fuses visual features from DINOv2 with geometric features at patch level, achieving significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing point cloud registration methods rely mainly on geometric information and don't fully exploit texture and semantic information from RGB-D data. Current multi-modal methods perform feature fusion in an image-lossy manner.

Method: Uses DINOv2 to extract visual features from images and fuses them with geometric features at patch level. Introduces mixed positional embedding to encode both image and point cloud spatial information.

Result: Achieves 14.2% increase in patch inlier ratio and 15.7% increase in registration recall on RGBD-3DMatch and RGBD-3DLoMatch datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed DINOReg effectively combines visual and geometric information for point cloud registration, demonstrating significant performance improvements through proper feature fusion and spatial encoding.

Abstract: Point cloud registration is a fundamental task in 3D computer vision. Most
existing methods rely solely on geometric information for feature extraction
and matching. Recently, several studies have incorporated color information
from RGB-D data into feature extraction. Although these methods achieve
remarkable improvements, they have not fully exploited the abundant texture and
semantic information in images, and the feature fusion is performed in an
image-lossy manner, which limit their performance. In this paper, we propose
DINOReg, a registration network that sufficiently utilizes both visual and
geometric information to solve the point cloud registration problem. Inspired
by advances in vision foundation models, we employ DINOv2 to extract
informative visual features from images, and fuse visual and geometric features
at the patch level. This design effectively combines the rich texture and
global semantic information extracted by DINOv2 with the detailed geometric
structure information captured by the geometric backbone. Additionally, a mixed
positional embedding is proposed to encode positional information from both
image space and point cloud space, which enhances the model's ability to
perceive spatial relationships between patches. Extensive experiments on the
RGBD-3DMatch and RGBD-3DLoMatch datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
significant improvements over state-of-the-art geometry-only and multi-modal
registration methods, with a 14.2% increase in patch inlier ratio and a 15.7%
increase in registration recall. The code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MCAE is a mask clustering-based annotation engine that enables efficient large-scale land cover mapping of submeter resolution imagery by treating semantically consistent mask groups as minimal annotating units, improving annotation efficiency by 1-2 orders of magnitude.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Submeter resolution imagery offers fine-grained detail for land cover analysis but is underutilized due to lack of sufficient high-quality annotated datasets. Existing annotation methods are unreliable or prohibitively expensive for massive submeter imagery volumes.

Method: Proposed Mask Clustering-based Annotation Engine (MCAE) that leverages spatial autocorrelation principle - objects of same class tend to co-occur with similar visual features in local neighborhoods. Treats semantically consistent mask groups as minimal annotating units for simultaneous multi-instance annotation.

Result: Built HiCity-LC dataset with ~14 billion labeled pixels, enabling city-scale land cover maps across five major Chinese cities with classification accuracies above 85%. First publicly available submeter resolution city-level land cover benchmark.

Conclusion: MCAE demonstrates scalability and practical utility for large-scale submeter resolution mapping, significantly improving annotation efficiency while preserving label quality, semantic diversity, and spatial representativeness.

Abstract: Recent advances in remote sensing technology have made submeter resolution
imagery increasingly accessible, offering remarkable detail for fine-grained
land cover analysis. However, its full potential remains underutilized -
particularly for large-scale land cover mapping - due to the lack of
sufficient, high-quality annotated datasets. Existing labels are typically
derived from pre-existing products or manual annotation, which are often
unreliable or prohibitively expensive, particularly given the rich visual
detail and massive data volumes of submeter imagery. Inspired by the spatial
autocorrelation principle, which suggests that objects of the same class tend
to co-occur with similar visual features in local neighborhoods, we propose the
Mask Clustering-based Annotation Engine (MCAE), which treats semantically
consistent mask groups as the minimal annotating units to enable efficient,
simultaneous annotation of multiple instances. It significantly improves
annotation efficiency by one to two orders of magnitude, while preserving label
quality, semantic diversity, and spatial representativeness. With MCAE, we
build a high-quality annotated dataset of about 14 billion labeled pixels,
referred to as HiCity-LC, which supports the generation of city-scale land
cover maps across five major Chinese cities with classification accuracies
above 85%. It is the first publicly available submeter resolution city-level
land cover benchmark, highlighting the scalability and practical utility of
MCAE for large-scale, submeter resolution mapping. The dataset is available at

### [249] [REALIGN: Regularized Procedure Alignment with Matching Video Embeddings via Partial Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24382)
*Soumyadeep Chandra,Kaushik Roy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: REALIGN is a self-supervised framework for procedure learning that uses Regularized Fused Partial Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport to handle noisy instructional videos with background segments, repeated actions, and non-monotonic step orders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world instructional videos contain background segments, repeated actions, and steps presented out of order, which violate the monotonicity assumptions of existing alignment methods like OPEL that rely solely on feature similarity and fail to capture temporal structure.

Method: Uses Regularized Fused Partial Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport (R-FPGWOT) to jointly model visual correspondences and temporal relations under partial alignment, integrated with inter-sequence contrastive learning to stabilize training without multiple regularizers.

Result: Achieves up to 18.9% average F1-score improvements and over 30% temporal IoU gains across egocentric (EgoProceL) and third-person (ProceL, CrossTask) benchmarks, producing more interpretable transport maps that preserve key-step orderings.

Conclusion: REALIGN effectively handles noisy instructional videos by jointly modeling visual and temporal relationships through partial optimal transport, outperforming prior methods while producing more interpretable alignments.

Abstract: Learning from procedural videos remains a core challenge in self-supervised
representation learning, as real-world instructional data often contains
background segments, repeated actions, and steps presented out of order. Such
variability violates the strong monotonicity assumptions underlying many
alignment methods. Prior state-of-the-art approaches, such as OPEL, leverage
Kantorovich Optimal Transport (KOT) to build frame-to-frame correspondences,
but rely solely on feature similarity and fail to capture the higher-order
temporal structure of a task. In this paper, we introduce REALIGN, a
self-supervised framework for procedure learning based on Regularized Fused
Partial Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport (R-FPGWOT). In contrast to KOT,
our formulation jointly models visual correspondences and temporal relations
under a partial alignment scheme, enabling robust handling of irrelevant
frames, repeated actions, and non-monotonic step orders common in instructional
videos. To stabilize training, we integrate FPGWOT distances with
inter-sequence contrastive learning, avoiding the need for multiple
regularizers and preventing collapse to degenerate solutions. Across egocentric
(EgoProceL) and third-person (ProceL, CrossTask) benchmarks, REALIGN achieves
up to 18.9% average F1-score improvements and over 30% temporal IoU gains,
while producing more interpretable transport maps that preserve key-step
orderings and filter out noise.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vid-LLM is a video-based 3D Multimodal Large Language Model that processes video inputs without requiring external 3D data, enabling practical 3D scene understanding through geometric priors and cross-task alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending multimodal reasoning from 2D to 3D domains is challenging, and existing 3D-MLLMs rely on 3D data inputs which limits scalability and real-world deployment.

Method: Uses video inputs with geometric priors, Cross-Task Adapter for aligning 3D geometry with vision-language representations, Metric Depth Model for real-scale geometry recovery, and two-stage distillation optimization for training.

Result: Achieves superior performance on 3D Question Answering, 3D Dense Captioning, and 3D Visual Grounding tasks across diverse benchmarks, demonstrating effective multi-task capabilities.

Conclusion: Vid-LLM provides a practical solution for 3D scene understanding without external 3D data, showing strong generalization and scalability through video-based geometric reasoning.

Abstract: Recent developments in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
significantly improved Vision-Language (VL) reasoning in 2D domains. However,
extending these capabilities to 3D scene understanding remains a major
challenge. Existing 3D Multimodal Large Language Models (3D-MLLMs) often depend
on 3D data inputs, which limits scalability and generalization. To address this
limitation, we propose Vid-LLM, a video-based 3D-MLLM that directly processes
video inputs without requiring external 3D data, making it practical for
real-world deployment. In our method, the geometric prior are directly used to
improve the performance of the sceen perception. To integrate the geometric
cues into the MLLM compactly, we design a Cross-Task Adapter (CTA) module to
align the 3D geometric priors with the vision-language representations. To
ensure geometric consistency and integrity, we introduce a Metric Depth Model
that recovers real-scale geometry from the reconstruction outputs. Finally, the
model is fine-tuned with a two-stage distillation optimization strategy,
realizing fast convergence and stabilizes training. Extensive experiments
across diverse benchmarks verified the effectiveness of our method on 3D
Question Answering, 3D Dense Captioning and 3D Visual Grounding tasks,
demonstrating the superior multi-task capabilities.

*Junyi Gu,Beatriz Cabrero-Daniel,Ali Nouri,Lydia Armini,Christian Berger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PCICF is a framework for systematically identifying and classifying vulnerable road user (VRU) situations to support operational design domain (ODD) incident analysis for robotaxis, using space-filling curves to match real-world scenarios with a structured synthetic dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotaxis need reliable VRU detection in urban ODDs, and end-to-end AI systems require high-quality data for training and evaluation. Current datasets like SMIRK only handle single pedestrians, limiting their usefulness for complex multi-pedestrian scenarios.

Method: Extended SMIRK into MoreSMIRK dataset with multi-pedestrian crossing situations, used space-filling curves to transform multi-dimensional scenario features into patterns, and matched them with MoreSMIRK entries.

Result: PCICF successfully identified and classified complex pedestrian crossings in the PIE dataset (150+ annotated videos), handling scenarios where pedestrian groups merge or split.

Conclusion: PCICF provides an effective framework for VRU situation analysis with potential for onboard OOD detection in robotaxis, and is available as open-source with complete dataset and algorithms.

Abstract: We have recently observed the commercial roll-out of robotaxis in various
countries. They are deployed within an operational design domain (ODD) on
specific routes and environmental conditions, and are subject to continuous
monitoring to regain control in safety-critical situations. Since ODDs
typically cover urban areas, robotaxis must reliably detect vulnerable road
users (VRUs) such as pedestrians, bicyclists, or e-scooter riders. To better
handle such varied traffic situations, end-to-end AI, which directly compute
vehicle control actions from multi-modal sensor data instead of only for
perception, is on the rise. High quality data is needed for systematically
training and evaluating such systems within their OOD. In this work, we propose
PCICF, a framework to systematically identify and classify VRU situations to
support ODD's incident analysis. We base our work on the existing synthetic
dataset SMIRK, and enhance it by extending its single-pedestrian-only design
into the MoreSMIRK dataset, a structured dictionary of multi-pedestrian
crossing situations constructed systematically. We then use space-filling
curves (SFCs) to transform multi-dimensional features of scenarios into
characteristic patterns, which we match with corresponding entries in
MoreSMIRK. We evaluate PCICF with the large real-world dataset PIE, which
contains more than 150 manually annotated pedestrian crossing videos. We show
that PCICF can successfully identify and classify complex pedestrian crossings,
even when groups of pedestrians merge or split. By leveraging computationally
efficient components like SFCs, PCICF has even potential to be used onboard of
robotaxis for OOD detection for example. We share an open-source replication
package for PCICF containing its algorithms, the complete MoreSMIRK dataset and
dictionary, as well as our experiment results presented in:

Method: Proposes a novel spatio-angular latent space that encodes both spatial appearance and angular viewpoint deviations into a single latent, with a strategically decomposed multi-step training process.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in consistency and latency while maintaining competitive quality and text-image alignment.

Conclusion: RapidMV enables rapid generation of high-quality, consistent multi-view images from text, serving as an efficient bridge to 3D asset generation.

Abstract: Generating synthetic multi-view images from a text prompt is an essential
bridge to generating synthetic 3D assets. In this work, we introduce RapidMV, a
novel text-to-multi-view generative model that can produce 32 multi-view
synthetic images in just around 5 seconds. In essence, we propose a novel
spatio-angular latent space, encoding both the spatial appearance and angular
viewpoint deviations into a single latent for improved efficiency and

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLQ is a cross-layer guided orthogonal-based quantization method for diffusion transformers that enables W4A4 quantization with minimal performance degradation, achieving 3.98x memory saving and 3.95x speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion transformers (DiTs) face practical deployment challenges on edge devices due to large model size and complexity, while existing post-training quantization methods suffer from performance degradation.

Method: Proposes three key designs: cross-block calibration for accurate data distribution, orthogonal-based smoothing to handle outliers using block Hadamard matrix, and cross-layer parameter searching.

Result: Successfully compresses DiTs to W4A4 format with negligible degradation in visual quality and metrics, achieving 3.98x memory saving and 3.95x speedup for both image and video generation models.

Conclusion: CLQ provides an effective quantization solution for DiTs that maintains performance while significantly reducing memory and computational requirements, enabling practical deployment on edge devices.

Abstract: Visual generation quality has been greatly promoted with the rapid advances
in diffusion transformers (DiTs), which is attributed to the scaling of model
size and complexity. However, these attributions also hinder the practical
deployment of DiTs on edge devices, limiting their development and application.
Serve as an efficient model compression technique, model post-training
quantization (PTQ) can reduce the memory consumption and speed up the
inference, with inevitable performance degradation. To alleviate the
degradation, we propose CLQ, a cross-layer guided orthogonal-based quantization
method for DiTs. To be specific, CLQ consists of three key designs. First, we
observe that the calibration data used by most of the PTQ methods can not
honestly represent the distribution of the activations. Therefore, we propose
cross-block calibration (CBC) to obtain accurate calibration data, with which
the quantization can be better guided. Second, we propose orthogonal-based
smoothing (OBS), which quantifies the outlier score of each channel and
leverages block Hadamard matrix to smooth the outliers with negligible
overhead. Third, we propose cross-layer parameter searching (CLPS) to search.
We evaluate CLQ with both image generation and video generation models and
successfully compress the model into W4A4 with negligible degradation in visual
quality and metrics. CLQ achieves 3.98x memory saving and 3.95x speedup. Our

*Pei-Han Chen,Szu-Chi Chung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a systematic approach to assess image dataset quality using enhanced tools (CleanVision and Fastdup) with automatic thresholding, showing significant improvements in detecting low-quality images and near-duplicates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As model architectures mature and gains from refinements diminish, data quality becomes critical. However, systematic studies on evaluating image dataset quality remain limited.

Method: Developed a pipeline integrating CleanVision and Fastdup tools with enhancements including automatic threshold selection. Analyzed impact of various image quality issues on model performance using CIFAKE dataset.

Result: Automatic thresholding improved F1 score from 0.6794 to 0.9468 (single perturbations) and 0.7447 to 0.8557 (dual perturbations). Near-duplicate detection F1 score increased from 0.4576 to 0.7928. CNNs are resilient to some distortions but vulnerable to blurring and severe downscaling.

Conclusion: The proposed workflow effectively advances data quality assessment in image-based machine learning, demonstrating that not all quality issues have equal impact and providing a foundation for systematic dataset evaluation.

Abstract: In machine learning, research has traditionally focused on model development,
with relatively less attention paid to training data. As model architectures
have matured and marginal gains from further refinements diminish, data quality
has emerged as a critical factor. However, systematic studies on evaluating and
ensuring dataset quality in the image domain remain limited.
  This study investigates methods for systematically assessing image dataset
quality and examines how various image quality factors influence model
performance. Using the publicly available and relatively clean CIFAKE dataset,
we identify common quality issues and quantify their impact on training.
Building on these findings, we develop a pipeline that integrates two
community-developed tools, CleanVision and Fastdup. We analyze their underlying
mechanisms and introduce several enhancements, including automatic threshold
selection to detect problematic images without manual tuning.
  Experimental results demonstrate that not all quality issues exert the same
level of impact. While convolutional neural networks show resilience to certain
distortions, they are particularly vulnerable to degradations that obscure
critical visual features, such as blurring and severe downscaling. To assess
the performance of existing tools and the effectiveness of our proposed
enhancements, we formulate the detection of low-quality images as a binary
classification task and use the F1 score as the evaluation metric. Our
automatic thresholding method improves the F1 score from 0.6794 to 0.9468 under
single perturbations and from 0.7447 to 0.8557 under dual perturbations. For
near-duplicate detection, our deduplication strategy increases the F1 score
from 0.4576 to 0.7928. These results underscore the effectiveness of our
workflow and provide a foundation for advancing data quality assessment in
image-based machine learning.

Motivation: Current 3DGS methods and MLP-based variants suffer from significant redundancy due to lack of occlusion awareness, leading to computational overhead despite pruning strategies and LOD techniques.

Method: Uses a fast proxy system that generates precise occlusion depth maps at 1000x1000 resolution in under 1ms to guide culling of anchors/Gaussians and direct densification during training.

Result: Achieves over 2.5x speedup over Octree-GS on MatrixCity Streets dataset while delivering substantially higher rendering quality, especially in heavily occluded scenarios.

Conclusion: Proxy-GS effectively addresses occlusion redundancy in 3D Gaussian Splatting, enabling both faster rendering and improved visual fidelity through occlusion-aware processing.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as an efficient approach for
achieving photorealistic rendering. Recent MLP-based variants further improve
visual fidelity but introduce substantial decoding overhead during rendering.
To alleviate computation cost, several pruning strategies and level-of-detail
(LOD) techniques have been introduced, aiming to effectively reduce the number
of Gaussian primitives in large-scale scenes. However, our analysis reveals
that significant redundancy still remains due to the lack of occlusion
awareness. In this work, we propose Proxy-GS, a novel pipeline that exploits a
proxy to introduce Gaussian occlusion awareness from any view. At the core of
our approach is a fast proxy system capable of producing precise occlusion
depth maps at a resolution of 1000x1000 under 1ms. This proxy serves two roles:
first, it guides the culling of anchors and Gaussians to accelerate rendering
speed. Second, it guides the densification towards surfaces during training,
avoiding inconsistencies in occluded regions, and improving the rendering
quality. In heavily occluded scenarios, such as the MatrixCity Streets dataset,
Proxy-GS not only equips MLP-based Gaussian splatting with stronger rendering
capability but also achieves faster rendering speed. Specifically, it achieves
more than 2.5x speedup over Octree-GS, and consistently delivers substantially
higher rendering quality. Code will be public upon acceptance.

*Runmin Zhang,Jialiang Wang,Si-Yuan Cao,Zhu Yu,Junchen Yu,Guangyi Zhang,Hui-Liang Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DCFlow is an unsupervised cross-modal flow estimation framework that uses decoupled optimization and cross-modal consistency to address modality discrepancy and geometric misalignment without ground-truth flow supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous approaches implicitly learn flow estimation from appearance similarity alone, which fails to adequately address modality discrepancy and geometric misalignment between different modalities.

Method: Uses a decoupled optimization strategy with collaborative training of modality transfer and flow estimation networks, combined with geometry-aware data synthesis and outlier-robust loss for motion supervision without ground-truth flow.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised approaches and can be integrated with various flow estimation networks, as demonstrated on a comprehensive cross-modal flow benchmark.

Conclusion: DCFlow effectively addresses cross-modal flow estimation challenges through its novel decoupled optimization and cross-modal consistency constraints, enabling reliable unsupervised learning across different modalities.

Abstract: This work presents DCFlow, a novel unsupervised cross-modal flow estimation
framework that integrates a decoupled optimization strategy and a cross-modal
consistency constraint. Unlike previous approaches that implicitly learn flow
estimation solely from appearance similarity, we introduce a decoupled
optimization strategy with task-specific supervision to address modality
discrepancy and geometric misalignment distinctly. This is achieved by
collaboratively training a modality transfer network and a flow estimation
network. To enable reliable motion supervision without ground-truth flow, we
propose a geometry-aware data synthesis pipeline combined with an
outlier-robust loss. Additionally, we introduce a cross-modal consistency
constraint to jointly optimize both networks, significantly improving flow
prediction accuracy. For evaluation, we construct a comprehensive cross-modal
flow benchmark by repurposing public datasets. Experimental results demonstrate
that DCFlow can be integrated with various flow estimation networks and
achieves state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised approaches.

*Ailing Zhang,Lina Lei,Dehong Kong,Zhixin Wang,Jiaqi Xu,Fenglong Song,Chun-Le Guo,Chang Liu,Fan Li,Jie Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UI2V-Bench is a new benchmark for evaluating Image-to-Video (I2V) models that focuses on semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks that overlook subject semantics and physical/commonsense alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing I2V evaluation benchmarks primarily focus on video quality and temporal consistency, but largely ignore the model's ability to understand specific subject semantics and ensure alignment with physical laws and human commonsense.

Method: Proposes UI2V-Bench with four evaluation dimensions (spatial understanding, attribute binding, category understanding, reasoning) and two MLLM-based evaluation methods: instance-level pipeline for fine-grained semantic understanding and feedback-based reasoning pipeline for step-by-step causal assessment.

Result: The benchmark includes ~500 text-image pairs and evaluates various open-source and closed-source I2V models across all dimensions. Human evaluations show strong alignment with the proposed MLLM-based metrics.

Conclusion: UI2V-Bench fills a critical gap in I2V evaluation by emphasizing semantic comprehension and reasoning ability, providing a robust framework and dataset to support future research and model development.

Abstract: Generative diffusion models are developing rapidly and attracting increasing
attention due to their wide range of applications. Image-to-Video (I2V)
generation has become a major focus in the field of video synthesis. However,
existing evaluation benchmarks primarily focus on aspects such as video quality
and temporal consistency, while largely overlooking the model's ability to
understand the semantics of specific subjects in the input image or to ensure
that the generated video aligns with physical laws and human commonsense. To
address this gap, we propose UI2V-Bench, a novel benchmark for evaluating I2V
models with a focus on semantic understanding and reasoning. It introduces four
primary evaluation dimensions: spatial understanding, attribute binding,
category understanding, and reasoning. To assess these dimensions, we design
two evaluation methods based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs): an
instance-level pipeline for fine-grained semantic understanding, and a
feedback-based reasoning pipeline that enables step-by-step causal assessment
for more accurate evaluation. UI2V-Bench includes approximately 500 carefully
constructed text-image pairs and evaluates a range of both open source and
closed-source I2V models across all defined dimensions. We further incorporate
human evaluations, which show strong alignment with the proposed MLLM-based
metrics. Overall, UI2V-Bench fills a critical gap in I2V evaluation by
emphasizing semantic comprehension and reasoning ability, offering a robust
framework and dataset to support future research and model development in the
field.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeoWorld is a deep learning framework that generates interactive 3D virtual worlds from a single image using a hybrid approach combining 3D object modeling with 2D background synthesis for efficient rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspired by on-demand worldbuilding from Simulacron-3, the goal is to create expansive virtual environments where only actively explored regions are rendered with high visual realism, overcoming limitations of previous global generation or 2D hallucination methods.

Method: Uses object-centric 3D representations for key foreground objects while synthesizing backgrounds and non-interacted regions in 2D. Implements hybrid scene structure with representation learning and object-to-3D techniques, enabling flexible viewpoint manipulation and natural language control of object appearance and dynamics.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing 2D and depth-layered 2.5D methods on the WorldScore benchmark. The system progressively unfolds virtual worlds with increasing 3D detail as users interact, delivering dynamic, immersive, and visually coherent exploration experiences.

Conclusion: NeoWorld successfully demonstrates a practical approach to generating interactive 3D virtual worlds from single images, balancing visual quality with computational efficiency through its hybrid 3D/2D rendering strategy and enabling natural user interaction through language commands.

Abstract: We introduce NeoWorld, a deep learning framework for generating interactive
3D virtual worlds from a single input image. Inspired by the on-demand
worldbuilding concept in the science fiction novel Simulacron-3 (1964), our
system constructs expansive environments where only the regions actively
explored by the user are rendered with high visual realism through
object-centric 3D representations. Unlike previous approaches that rely on
global world generation or 2D hallucination, NeoWorld models key foreground
objects in full 3D, while synthesizing backgrounds and non-interacted regions
in 2D to ensure efficiency. This hybrid scene structure, implemented with
cutting-edge representation learning and object-to-3D techniques, enables
flexible viewpoint manipulation and physically plausible scene animation,
allowing users to control object appearance and dynamics using natural language
commands. As users interact with the environment, the virtual world
progressively unfolds with increasing 3D detail, delivering a dynamic,
immersive, and visually coherent exploration experience. NeoWorld significantly
outperforms existing 2D and depth-layered 2.5D methods on the WorldScore
benchmark.

### [259] [Beyond Isolated Facts: Synthesizing Narrative and Grounded Supervision for VideoQA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24445)
*Jianxin Liang,Tan Yue,Yuxuan Wang,Yueqian Wang,Zhihan Yin,Huishuai Zhang,Dongyan Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to enhance VideoQA by synthesizing richer supervision through Question-Based Paraphrasing (QBP) and Question-Based Captioning (QBC), moving beyond isolated factual QA pairs to capture narrative structure and visual rationales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VideoQA models are limited by "bag-of-facts" supervision that fails to capture narrative and causal structure of events, leading to shallow video understanding.

Method: Proposes two strategies: QBP synthesizes diverse questions into holistic narrative paragraphs reconstructing event structure; QBC generates fine-grained visual rationales grounding answers in specific evidence. Uses generative models to create synthetic data for unified next-token prediction training.

Result: Achieves significant accuracy gains: 72.5% on STAR (+4.9%) with 3B model and 80.8% on NExT-QA with 7B model. Both QBP and QBC enhance cross-dataset generalization, with QBP accelerating convergence by over 2.5x.

Conclusion: Shifting from isolated facts to narrative coherence and grounded rationales creates a more accurate, efficient, and generalizable VideoQA training paradigm.

Abstract: The performance of Video Question Answering (VideoQA) models is fundamentally
constrained by the nature of their supervision, which typically consists of
isolated, factual question-answer pairs. This "bag-of-facts" approach fails to
capture the underlying narrative and causal structure of events, limiting
models to a shallow understanding of video content. To move beyond this
paradigm, we introduce a framework to synthesize richer supervisory signals. We
propose two complementary strategies: Question-Based Paraphrasing (QBP), which
synthesizes the diverse inquiries (what, how, why) from a video's existing set
of question-answer pairs into a holistic narrative paragraph that reconstructs
the video's event structure; and Question-Based Captioning (QBC), which
generates fine-grained visual rationales, grounding the answer to each question
in specific, relevant evidence. Leveraging powerful generative models, we use
this synthetic data to train VideoQA models under a unified next-token
prediction objective. Extensive experiments on STAR and NExT-QA validate our
approach, demonstrating significant accuracy gains and establishing new
state-of-the-art results, such as improving a 3B model to 72.5\% on STAR
(+4.9\%) and a 7B model to 80.8\% on NExT-QA. Beyond accuracy, our analysis
reveals that both QBP and QBC substantially enhance cross-dataset
generalization, with QBP additionally accelerating model convergence by over
2.5x. These results demonstrate that shifting data synthesis from isolated
facts to narrative coherence and grounded rationales yields a more accurate,
efficient, and generalizable training paradigm.

*Hangil Park,Yongmin Seo,Tae-Kyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dual-model ensemble approach using knowledge distillation for general anomaly detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance across both industrial and semantic anomaly detection tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current anomaly detection methods are biased towards industrial inspection and struggle with generalization across different domains like semantic anomaly detection. Existing general AD methods are sensitive to dataset-specific settings and single-class tasks.

Method: Proposes a dual-model ensemble with teacher-student knowledge distillation: an Encoder-Decoder model for patch-level industrial defects and an Encoder-Encoder model for semantic AD, both using shared DINOv2 encoder. Uses Noisy-OR objective and joint probability scoring.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on 8 benchmarks: 99.7% AUROC on MVTec-AD (industrial) and 97.8% on CIFAR-10 (semantic), outperforming prior general AD models and even specialist models in multi-class settings.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates strong generalization across multiple anomaly detection domains, effectively bridging the gap between industrial and semantic anomaly detection while maintaining high performance in both single-class and multi-class settings.

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) plays an important role in various real-world
applications. Recent advancements in AD, however, are often biased towards
industrial inspection, struggle to generalize to broader tasks like semantic
anomaly detection and vice versa. Although recent methods have attempted to
address general anomaly detection, their performance remains sensitive to
dataset-specific settings and single-class tasks. In this paper, we propose a
novel dual-model ensemble approach based on knowledge distillation (KD) to
bridge this gap. Our framework consists of a teacher and two student models: an
Encoder-Decoder model, specialized in detecting patch-level minor defects for
industrial AD and an Encoder-Encoder model, optimized for semantic AD. Both
models leverage a shared pre-trained encoder (DINOv2) to extract high-quality
feature representations. The dual models are jointly learned using the Noisy-OR
objective, and the final anomaly score is obtained using the joint probability
via local and semantic anomaly scores derived from the respective models. We
evaluate our method on eight public benchmarks under both single-class and
multi-class settings: MVTec-AD, MVTec-LOCO, VisA and Real-IAD for industrial
inspection and CIFAR-10/100, FMNIST and View for semantic anomaly detection.
The proposed method achieved state-of-the-art accuracies in both domains, in
multi-class as well as single-class settings, demonstrating generalization
across multiple domains of anomaly detection. Our model achieved an image-level
AUROC of 99.7% on MVTec-AD and 97.8% on CIFAR-10, which is significantly better
than the prior general AD models in multi-class settings and even higher than
the best specialist models on individual benchmarks.

*Heechang Kim,Gwanghyun Kim,Se Young Chun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a zero-shot optimization method that integrates Laban Effort and Shape components into text-to-motion diffusion models to achieve fine-grained expressive motion control without additional training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-motion synthesis lacks fine-grained expressive control due to limited motion style diversity in datasets and difficulty expressing quantitative characteristics in natural language. Laban movement analysis provides a systematic way to express motion quality details consistently.

Method: A zero-shot inference-time optimization method that updates text embeddings of pretrained diffusion models during sampling to guide motion generation toward desired Laban Effort and Shape components, without requiring additional motion data.

Result: The approach successfully generates diverse expressive motion qualities while preserving motion identity, effectively manipulating motion attributes according to target Laban tags.

Conclusion: The proposed method enables interpretable and expressive control of human motion generation by seamlessly integrating Laban quantification methods into text-guided motion generation models.

Abstract: Diverse human motion generation is an increasingly important task, having
various applications in computer vision, human-computer interaction and
animation. While text-to-motion synthesis using diffusion models has shown
success in generating high-quality motions, achieving fine-grained expressive
motion control remains a significant challenge. This is due to the lack of
motion style diversity in datasets and the difficulty of expressing
quantitative characteristics in natural language. Laban movement analysis has
been widely used by dance experts to express the details of motion including
motion quality as consistent as possible. Inspired by that, this work aims for
interpretable and expressive control of human motion generation by seamlessly
integrating the quantification methods of Laban Effort and Shape components
into the text-guided motion generation models. Our proposed zero-shot,
inference-time optimization method guides the motion generation model to have
desired Laban Effort and Shape components without any additional motion data by
updating the text embedding of pretrained diffusion models during the sampling
step. We demonstrate that our approach yields diverse expressive motion
qualities while preserving motion identity by successfully manipulating motion
attributes according to target Laban tags.

*Shijie Lian,Changti Wu,Laurence Tianruo Yang,Hang Yuan,Bin Yu,Lei Zhang,Kai Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fine-tuning MLLMs on Euclidean geometry problems (Euclid30K dataset) improves spatial reasoning abilities across multiple benchmarks without task-specific adaptations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spatial intelligence remains a critical unresolved challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), despite being a rich suite of abilities including shape visualization, mental rotation, and relational reasoning.

Method: Used Euclidean geometry problem-solving as a surrogate task with a curated 30K multimodal dataset (Euclid30K), and employed Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to finetune Qwen2.5VL and RoboBrain2.0 model families.

Result: Models achieved substantial zero-shot gains across four spatial reasoning benchmarks (Super-CLEVR, Omni3DBench, VSI-Bench, and MindCube). Mean VSI-Bench accuracy rose from 34.5% to 40.5%, with RoboBrain2.0-Euclid-7B achieving 49.6% accuracy, surpassing previous state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: This is the first systematic study showing that geometry-centric fine-tuning can confer vision-language models with broadly transferable spatial skills.

Abstract: Spatial intelligence spans a rich suite of abilities, including visualising
and transforming shapes, mentally rotating objects, judging relational
positions and containment, and estimating numerosity. However, it still remains
a critical unresolved challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).To
fill this gap, we propose to treat Euclidean geometry problem-solving as a
surrogate task. Specifically, we meticulously constructed a curated multimodal
dataset, called Euclid30K, comprising approximately 30K plane and solid
geometry problems. To enable the model to acquire and apply Euclidean
principles from these geometry problems, we employed Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) to finetune the Qwen2.5VL family and RoboBrain2.0 family,
inspiring the models to identify shapes, count, and relate entities, and
perform multi-step deductive reasoning using Euclidean principles. Our
experiments demonstrate that the resulting models achieve substantial zero-shot
gains across four spatial reasoning benchmarks (Super-CLEVR, Omni3DBench,
VSI-Bench, and MindCube) without any task-specific adaptations. Notably, after
training on the Euclid30K, the mean VSI-Bench accuracy of all evaluated models
rose from 34.5% to 40.5%, improving by 5.5 percentage points. Among them,
RoboBrain2.0-Euclid-7B achieves 49.6\% accuracy, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art model, Spatial-MLLM.To our knowledge, this is the first
systematic study showing that geometry-centric fine-tuning can confer
vision-language models with broadly transferable spatial skills. Code and
Euclid30K dataset can be found in https://zgca-ai4edu.github.io/Euclids_Gift.

TL;DR: A selective representation framework that shrinks second-hand fashion image databases to 10% of original size while maintaining retrieval accuracy through clustering, coreset selection, and outlier removal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The fashion industry contributes significantly to waste and emissions, creating need for efficient second-hand marketplaces that require scalable image retrieval systems for large-scale garment valuation.

Method: Uses clustering and coreset selection to identify representative samples, plus an outlier removal method based on neighbour-homogeneity consistency score to filter uncharacteristic samples before selection.

Result: Maintains near-optimal retrieval accuracy while reducing computational costs by shrinking databases to 10% of original size. Outlier removal combined with clustering further improves retrieval performance.

Conclusion: Strategic pruning and selection of representative image vectors enables efficient second-hand fashion retrieval with minimal accuracy loss, supporting scalable second-hand marketplaces.

Abstract: The fashion industry has been identified as a major contributor to waste and
emissions, leading to an increased interest in promoting the second-hand
market. Machine learning methods play an important role in facilitating the
creation and expansion of second-hand marketplaces by enabling the large-scale
valuation of used garments. We contribute to this line of work by addressing
the scalability of second-hand image retrieval from databases. By introducing a
selective representation framework, we can shrink databases to 10% of their
original size without sacrificing retrieval accuracy. We first explore
clustering and coreset selection methods to identify representative samples
that capture the key features of each garment and its internal variability.
Then, we introduce an efficient outlier removal method, based on a
neighbour-homogeneity consistency score measure, that filters out
uncharacteristic samples prior to selection. We evaluate our approach on three
public datasets: DeepFashion Attribute, DeepFashion Con2Shop, and DeepFashion2.
The results demonstrate a clear performance-efficiency trade-off by
strategically pruning and selecting representative vectors of images. The
retrieval system maintains near-optimal accuracy, while greatly reducing
computational costs by reducing the images added to the vector database.
Furthermore, applying our outlier removal method to clustering techniques
yields even higher retrieval performance by removing non-discriminative samples
before the selection.

TL;DR: SCPO is a novel framework that addresses visual hallucinations in MLLMs through semantic curriculum preference optimization, reducing hallucination rates by up to 62.9% while maintaining general capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs suffer from visual hallucinations where responses contradict visual evidence, and existing DPO methods fail to capture fine-grained semantic differences and encourage shortcut learning.

Method: Proposes SCPO framework with progressive easy-to-hard curriculum using Semantic Curriculum Preference Pairs dataset, dynamic reference model, and symmetric bidirectional objective for simultaneous learning from textual and visual preferences.

Result: Extensive experiments show SCPO reduces hallucination rate by up to 62.9% on various benchmarks, improves factuality while preserving general capabilities, and maintains stable performance across vision-language benchmarks.

Conclusion: SCPO is the first framework to unify semantics, symmetry, and curriculum for MLLM alignment, effectively mitigating visual hallucinations while maintaining model performance.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly improved the
performance of various tasks, but continue to suffer from visual
hallucinations, a critical issue where generated responses contradict visual
evidence. While Direct Preference Optimization(DPO) is widely used for
alignment, its application to MLLMs often fails to capture fine-grained
semantic differences and encourages shortcut learning. To address these
challenges, we propose Semantic Curriculum Preference Optimization (SCPO), a
novel framework for MLLM alignment. SCPO employs a progressive, easy-to-hard
curriculum built upon our Semantic Curriculum Preference Pairs dataset, which
provides fine-grained semantic contrasts sorted by difficulty. This curriculum
is trained with a dynamic reference model and a novel symmetric, bidirectional
objective to facilitate simultaneous learning from both textual and visual
preferences. To our knowledge, SCPO is the first framework to unify semantics,
symmetry, and curriculum for MLLMs alignment, effectively mitigating visual
hallucinations. Extensive experiments on LLaVA models across various scales and
versions validate that SCPO demonstrates superior performance compared to
baseline models on multiple hallucination benchmarks, reducing the
hallucination rate by up to 62.9%. Moreover, evaluations on generalized
benchmarks show that SCPO improves factuality while preserving general
capabilities, with its performance remaining stable across general
vision-language benchmarks.

TL;DR: EQUISeg is a multimodal segmentation framework that addresses modality imbalance through equal encoding and a self-guided module with mutual guidance mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal segmentation methods suffer from imbalanced modal dependencies where performance degrades when dominant modalities deteriorate, making modality balance a critical challenge.

Method: Proposes EQUISeg with four-stage Cross-modal Transformer Block for efficient multimodal fusion and hierarchical selection, plus Self-guided Module with mutual guidance mechanism for adaptive modality contribution adjustment.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple datasets show EQUISeg achieves significant performance gains and effectively alleviates adverse effects of modality imbalance.

Conclusion: EQUISeg successfully addresses modality imbalance in multimodal segmentation through balanced encoding and mutual guidance, enhancing robustness under degraded conditions.

Abstract: Multimodal semantic segmentation enhances model robustness by exploiting
cross-modal complementarities. However, existing methods often suffer from
imbalanced modal dependencies, where overall performance degrades significantly
once a dominant modality deteriorates in real-world scenarios. Thus, modality
balance has become acritical challenge for practical multimodal segmentation.
To address this issue, we propose EQUISeg, a multimodal segmentation framework
that balances modality contributions through equal encoding of modalities.
Built upon a four-stage Cross-modal Transformer Block(CMTB), EQUISeg enables
efficient multimodal fusion and hierarchical selection. Furthermore, we design
a Self-guided Module(SGM) that mitigates modality imbalance by introducing a
mutual guidance mechanism, enabling each modality to adaptively adjust its
contribution and enhance robustness under degraded conditions. Extensive
experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that EQUISeg achieves significant
performance gains and effectively alleviates the adverse effects of modality
imbalance in segmentation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard CLIP text encoders often fail in complex scenes with many objects, particularly in maintaining object counts and spatial layouts while accommodating diverse categories.

Method: QL-Adapter consists of ILFM (fuses layout priors with ViT patch tokens) and CMAM (injects image features into text branch). Also built QL-Dataset benchmark for quantity and layout consistent image editing.

Result: QL-Adapter achieves state-of-the-art performance on QL-Edit task and significantly outperforms existing models in extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses multiple object editing challenges by combining layout fusion and cross-modal augmentation, demonstrating superior performance on the new QL-Edit benchmark.

Abstract: Instruction driven image editing with standard CLIP text encoders often fails
in complex scenes with many objects. We present QL-Adapter, a framework for
multiple object editing that tackles two challenges: enforcing object counts
and spatial layouts, and accommodating diverse categories. QL-Adapter consists
of two core modules: the Image-Layout Fusion Module (ILFM) and the Cross-Modal
Augmentation Module (CMAM). ILFM fuses layout priors with ViT patch tokens from
the CLIP image encoder to strengthen spatial structure understanding. CMAM
injects image features into the text branch to enrich textual embeddings and
improve instruction following. We further build QL-Dataset, a benchmark that
spans broad category, layout, and count variations, and define the task of
quantity and layout consistent image editing (QL-Edit). Extensive experiments
show that QL-Adapter achieves state of the art performance on QL-Edit and
significantly outperforms existing models.

*Zheyuan Hu,Chieh-Hsin Lai,Yuki Mitsufuji,Stefano Ermon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Consistency Mid-Training (CMT) introduces a lightweight intermediate stage between diffusion pre-training and flow map training that enables stable initialization for few-step generation models, achieving state-of-the-art results with significantly reduced training time and data requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing flow map models like Consistency Models and Mean Flow suffer from unstable training, sensitivity to hyperparameters, and high computational costs, even when initialized from pre-trained diffusion models. The core problem is converting infinitesimal steps into long-jump maps while maintaining stability.

Method: CMT inserts a mid-training stage that trains a model to map points along a solver trajectory from a pre-trained diffusion model directly to the solver-generated clean sample, creating a trajectory-consistent and stable initialization for subsequent flow map training.

Result: CMT achieves state-of-the-art two-step FIDs: 1.97 on CIFAR-10, 1.32 on ImageNet 64x64, and 1.84 on ImageNet 512x512, while using up to 98% less training data and GPU time compared to Consistency Models. On ImageNet 256x256, it reaches 1-step FID 3.34 with ~50% training time reduction.

Conclusion: CMT establishes a principled, efficient, and general framework for training flow map models, enabling fast and robust convergence without heuristics while significantly reducing computational requirements.

Abstract: Flow map models such as Consistency Models (CM) and Mean Flow (MF) enable
few-step generation by learning the long jump of the ODE solution of diffusion
models, yet training remains unstable, sensitive to hyperparameters, and
costly. Initializing from a pre-trained diffusion model helps, but still
requires converting infinitesimal steps into a long-jump map, leaving
instability unresolved. We introduce mid-training, the first concept and
practical method that inserts a lightweight intermediate stage between the
(diffusion) pre-training and the final flow map training (i.e., post-training)
for vision generation. Concretely, Consistency Mid-Training (CMT) is a compact
and principled stage that trains a model to map points along a solver
trajectory from a pre-trained model, starting from a prior sample, directly to
the solver-generated clean sample. It yields a trajectory-consistent and stable
initialization. This initializer outperforms random and diffusion-based
baselines and enables fast, robust convergence without heuristics. Initializing
post-training with CMT weights further simplifies flow map learning.
Empirically, CMT achieves state of the art two step FIDs: 1.97 on CIFAR-10,
1.32 on ImageNet 64x64, and 1.84 on ImageNet 512x512, while using up to 98%
less training data and GPU time, compared to CMs. On ImageNet 256x256, CMT
reaches 1-step FID 3.34 while cutting total training time by about 50% compared
to MF from scratch (FID 3.43). This establishes CMT as a principled, efficient,
and general framework for training flow map models.

Motivation: Existing methods for zero-shot 3D semantic mapping produce fragmented masks and inaccurate semantic assignments due to direct use of raw masks from vision-language models, limiting effectiveness in complex environments.

Method: Leverage SemanticSAM with progressive granularity refinement for more accurate object-level masks, and employ context-aware CLIP encoding with multiple contextual views and empirical weighting for richer semantic context.

Result: Experimental results on multiple 3D scene understanding tasks show significant improvements over existing methods in 3D semantic segmentation and object retrieval from language queries across benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses limitations of previous methods by improving mask quality and semantic context, demonstrating superior performance in 3D scene understanding tasks.

Abstract: 3D scene understanding is fundamental for embodied AI and robotics,
supporting reliable perception for interaction and navigation. Recent
approaches achieve zero-shot, open-vocabulary 3D semantic mapping by assigning
embedding vectors to 2D class-agnostic masks generated via vision-language
models (VLMs) and projecting these into 3D. However, these methods often
produce fragmented masks and inaccurate semantic assignments due to the direct
use of raw masks, limiting their effectiveness in complex environments. To
address this, we leverage SemanticSAM with progressive granularity refinement
to generate more accurate and numerous object-level masks, mitigating the
over-segmentation commonly observed in mask generation models such as vanilla
SAM, and improving downstream 3D semantic segmentation. To further enhance
semantic context, we employ a context-aware CLIP encoding strategy that
integrates multiple contextual views of each mask using empirically determined
weighting, providing much richer visual context. We evaluate our approach on
multiple 3D scene understanding tasks, including 3D semantic segmentation and
object retrieval from language queries, across several benchmark datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over existing
methods, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

### [269] [Diffusion Bridge or Flow Matching? A Unifying Framework and Comparative Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24531)
*Kaizhen Zhu,Mokai Pan,Zhechuan Yu,Jingya Wang,Jingyi Yu,Ye Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper provides a unified theoretical and experimental comparison between Diffusion Bridge and Flow Matching models, showing that Diffusion Bridge has lower cost functions and more stable trajectories, while Flow Matching becomes less effective with reduced training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is confusion about which approach (Diffusion Bridge vs Flow Matching) is generally preferable, and substantial discrepancies in their modeling assumptions and implementations have hindered unified theoretical analysis of their relative merits.

Method: Recast both frameworks through Stochastic Optimal Control and Optimal Transport perspectives, propose a novel Diffusion Bridge architecture using latent Transformer, and implement Flow Matching with same structure for fair comparison across multiple tasks with varying distributional discrepancies and training data sizes.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows Diffusion Bridge has lower cost function guiding toward more stable trajectories, while Flow Matching interpolation coefficients become ineffective with reduced training data. Experimental results across Image Inpainting, Super-Resolution, Deblurring, Denoising, Translation, and Style Transfer tasks perfectly align with theoretical predictions.

Conclusion: The paper systematically delineates the respective advantages and disadvantages of Diffusion Bridge and Flow Matching models, providing clear guidance on when each approach is preferable based on theoretical analysis and comprehensive experimental validation.

Abstract: Diffusion Bridge and Flow Matching have both demonstrated compelling
empirical performance in transformation between arbitrary distributions.
However, there remains confusion about which approach is generally preferable,
and the substantial discrepancies in their modeling assumptions and practical
implementations have hindered a unified theoretical account of their relative
merits. We have, for the first time, provided a unified theoretical and
experimental validation of these two models. We recast their frameworks through
the lens of Stochastic Optimal Control and prove that the cost function of the
Diffusion Bridge is lower, guiding the system toward more stable and natural
trajectories. Simultaneously, from the perspective of Optimal Transport,
interpolation coefficients $t$ and $1-t$ of Flow Matching become increasingly
ineffective when the training data size is reduced. To corroborate these
theoretical claims, we propose a novel, powerful architecture for Diffusion
Bridge built on a latent Transformer, and implement a Flow Matching model with
the same structure to enable a fair performance comparison in various
experiments. Comprehensive experiments are conducted across Image Inpainting,
Super-Resolution, Deblurring, Denoising, Translation, and Style Transfer tasks,
systematically varying both the distributional discrepancy (different
difficulty) and the training data size. Extensive empirical results align
perfectly with our theoretical predictions and allow us to delineate the
respective advantages and disadvantages of these two models. Our code is

*Yuhao Wang,Zhuoran Zheng,Han Hu,Dianjie Lu,Guijuan Zhang,Chen Lyu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A crowd counting method for foggy environments that combines atmospheric scattering physics with deep learning, achieving significant accuracy improvements in dense fog scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address key challenges in crowd counting under foggy conditions: long-range target blurring, local feature degradation, and image contrast attenuation caused by atmospheric scattering.

Method: 1) Differentiable atmospheric scattering model with transmittance dynamic estimation and scattering parameter calibration; 2) MSA-KAN architecture based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Theorem for enhanced nonlinear representation; 3) Weather-aware GCN that dynamically constructs spatial adjacency matrices.

Result: Achieves 12.2%-27.5% reduction in MAE metrics compared to mainstream algorithms on four public datasets in dense fog scenarios.

Conclusion: The synergistic optimization of physical mechanisms and data-driven approaches effectively improves crowd counting accuracy under complex meteorological conditions.

Abstract: Aiming at the key challenges of crowd counting in foggy environments, such as
long-range target blurring, local feature degradation, and image contrast
attenuation, this paper proposes a crowd-counting method with a physical a
priori of atmospheric scattering, which improves crowd counting accuracy under
complex meteorological conditions through the synergistic optimization of the
physical mechanism and data-driven.Specifically, first, the method introduces a
differentiable atmospheric scattering model and employs transmittance dynamic
estimation and scattering parameter adaptive calibration techniques to
accurately quantify the nonlinear attenuation laws of haze on targets with
different depths of field.Secondly, the MSA-KAN was designed based on the
Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem to construct a learnable edge
activation function. By integrating a multi-layer progressive architecture with
adaptive skip connections, it significantly enhances the model's nonlinear
representation capability in feature-degraded regions, effectively suppressing
feature confusion under fog interference.Finally, we further propose a
weather-aware GCN that dynamically constructs spatial adjacency matrices using
deep features extracted by MSA-KAN. Experiments on four public datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves a 12.2\%-27.5\% reduction in MAE metrics
compared to mainstream algorithms in dense fog scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed NeMo task and NeMoBench benchmark effectively assess VideoLLMs' critical reasoning capabilities, providing key insights into model capabilities and limitations for temporal reasoning in video understanding.

Abstract: Recent advances in video large language models (VideoLLMs) call for new
evaluation protocols and benchmarks for complex temporal reasoning in
video-language understanding. Inspired by the needle in a haystack test widely
used by LLMs, we introduce a novel task of Needle in a Montage (NeMo), designed

### [272] [TokenSwap: Backdoor Attack on the Compositional Understanding of Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24566)
*Zhifang Zhang,Qiqi Tao,Jiaqi Lv,Na Zhao,Lei Feng,Joey Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TokenSwap is a stealthy backdoor attack on Large Vision-Language Models that subtly disrupts object relationship understanding rather than forcing fixed target patterns, making it harder to detect than traditional backdoor attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing backdoor attacks on LVLMs use fixed target patterns that are easy to detect due to model overconfidence and pattern memorization. TokenSwap aims to create more evasive attacks by targeting compositional understanding capabilities.

Method: TokenSwap injects visual triggers into training samples while swapping grammatical roles of key tokens in textual answers. It uses an adaptive token-weighted loss to emphasize learning of swapped tokens, associating visual triggers with bags-of-words behavior where objects are mentioned correctly but relationships are misrepresented.

Result: Extensive experiments show TokenSwap achieves high attack success rates while maintaining superior evasiveness and stealthiness across multiple benchmarks and various LVLM architectures.

Conclusion: TokenSwap demonstrates that backdoor attacks can be made more stealthy by targeting compositional understanding rather than fixed output patterns, highlighting vulnerabilities in LVLMs' relationship understanding capabilities.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive performance
across a wide range of vision-language tasks, while they remain vulnerable to
backdoor attacks. Existing backdoor attacks on LVLMs aim to force the victim
model to generate a predefined target pattern, which is either inserted into or
replaces the original content. We find that these fixed-pattern attacks are
relatively easy to detect, because the attacked LVLM tends to memorize such
frequent patterns in the training dataset, thereby exhibiting overconfidence on
these targets given poisoned inputs. To address these limitations, we introduce
TokenSwap, a more evasive and stealthy backdoor attack that focuses on the
compositional understanding capabilities of LVLMs. Instead of enforcing a fixed
targeted content, TokenSwap subtly disrupts the understanding of object
relationships in text. Specifically, it causes the backdoored model to generate
outputs that mention the correct objects in the image but misrepresent their
relationships (i.e., bags-of-words behavior). During training, TokenSwap
injects a visual trigger into selected samples and simultaneously swaps the
grammatical roles of key tokens in the corresponding textual answers. However,
the poisoned samples exhibit only subtle differences from the original ones,
making it challenging for the model to learn the backdoor behavior. To address
this, TokenSwap employs an adaptive token-weighted loss that explicitly
emphasizes the learning of swapped tokens, such that the visual triggers and
bags-of-words behavior are associated. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
TokenSwap achieves high attack success rates while maintaining superior
evasiveness and stealthiness across multiple benchmarks and various LVLM
architectures.

*Peter Hönig,Stefan Thalhammer,Jean-Baptiste Weibel,Matthias Hirschmanner,Markus Vincze*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCOPE is a diffusion-based category-level object pose estimation model that uses DINOv2 features as continuous semantic priors, eliminating the need for discrete category labels and enabling generalization beyond known object categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots need accurate object pose estimation in open environments with unknown objects, requiring semantic understanding to generalize both to known categories and beyond.

Method: Combines DINOv2 features with photorealistic training data and a noise model for point normals, using cross-attention to inject continuous semantic priors for learning canonicalized object coordinate systems.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art in synthetically trained category-level object pose estimation with 31.9% relative improvement on 5°5cm metric. Achieves up to 100% success rate in grasping unseen objects from unknown categories.

Conclusion: SCOPE successfully bridges the Sim2Real gap and enables generalization beyond known object categories through continuous semantic priors, making it suitable for real-world robotic manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Object manipulation requires accurate object pose estimation. In open
environments, robots encounter unknown objects, which requires semantic
understanding in order to generalize both to known categories and beyond. To
resolve this challenge, we present SCOPE, a diffusion-based category-level
object pose estimation model that eliminates the need for discrete category
labels by leveraging DINOv2 features as continuous semantic priors. By
combining these DINOv2 features with photorealistic training data and a noise
model for point normals, we reduce the Sim2Real gap in category-level object
pose estimation. Furthermore, injecting the continuous semantic priors via
cross-attention enables SCOPE to learn canonicalized object coordinate systems
across object instances beyond the distribution of known categories. SCOPE
outperforms the current state of the art in synthetically trained
category-level object pose estimation, achieving a relative improvement of
31.9\% on the 5$^\circ$5cm metric. Additional experiments on two instance-level
datasets demonstrate generalization beyond known object categories, enabling
grasping of unseen objects from unknown categories with a success rate of up to
100\%. Code available: https://github.com/hoenigpeter/scope.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A joint face-skull morphable model (BFSM) is developed for medical applications, addressing data scarcity and registration challenges, with capabilities for bidirectional shape inference and tissue thickness modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable applications in remote diagnostics, surgical planning, and facial simulation by overcoming limitations of scarce paired face-skull data, poor registration accuracy, and lack of inclusion for craniofacial deformity cases.

Method: Constructed a dataset of 200+ samples with CT-based skulls/faces and textured face scans; developed dense ray matching registration for topological consistency; created 3D Bidirectional Face-Skull Morphable Model (BFSM) with shared coefficient space and tissue thickness modeling.

Result: The BFSM enables accurate bidirectional shape inference between face and skull, supports one-to-many facial reconstructions from the same skull, and demonstrates robust performance in medical applications including 3D reconstruction from single images and surgical planning.

Conclusion: BFSM successfully addresses key challenges in face-skull modeling, providing an inclusive framework that works for both normal and craniofacial deformity cases, with demonstrated potential for various medical applications.

Abstract: Building a joint face-skull morphable model holds great potential for
applications such as remote diagnostics, surgical planning, medical education,
and physically based facial simulation. However, realizing this vision is
constrained by the scarcity of paired face-skull data, insufficient
registration accuracy, and limited exploration of reconstruction and clinical
applications. Moreover, individuals with craniofacial deformities are often
overlooked, resulting in underrepresentation and limited inclusivity. To
address these challenges, we first construct a dataset comprising over 200
samples, including both normal cases and rare craniofacial conditions. Each
case contains a CT-based skull, a CT-based face, and a high-fidelity textured
face scan. Secondly, we propose a novel dense ray matching registration method
that ensures topological consistency across face, skull, and their tissue
correspondences. Based on this, we introduce the 3D Bidirectional Face-Skull
Morphable Model (BFSM), which enables shape inference between the face and
skull through a shared coefficient space, while also modeling tissue thickness
variation to support one-to-many facial reconstructions from the same skull,
reflecting individual changes such as fat over time. Finally, we demonstrate
the potential of BFSM in medical applications, including 3D face-skull
reconstruction from a single image and surgical planning prediction. Extensive
experiments confirm the robustness and accuracy of our method. BFSM is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Comprehensive evaluation of YOLOv11 variants for fine-grained peripheral blood cell detection using a large annotated dataset, showing YOLOv11 Medium achieves the best trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual peripheral blood smear analysis is labor-intensive and subjective, while existing deep learning approaches lack systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art models like YOLOv11 for fine-grained blood cell detection.

Method: Curated a large-scale annotated dataset with 16,891 images across 12 peripheral blood cell classes plus red blood cells (298,850 total annotated cells). Evaluated five YOLOv11 variants (Nano to XLarge) using two data splitting strategies (70:20:10 and 80:10:10) with multiple performance metrics including mAP, precision, recall, F1 score, and computational efficiency.

Result: YOLOv11 Medium achieved the best trade-off with mAP@0.5 of 0.934 under 80:10:10 split. Larger models provided only marginal accuracy gains at substantially higher computational cost. The 80:10:10 split consistently outperformed the 70:20:10 split across all models.

Conclusion: YOLOv11, particularly the Medium variant, is highly effective for automated fine-grained peripheral blood smear detection. The publicly released dataset provides a valuable resource for advancing blood cell detection research in hematology.

Abstract: Manual peripheral blood smear (PBS) analysis is labor intensive and
subjective. While deep learning offers a promising alternative, a systematic
evaluation of state of the art models such as YOLOv11 for fine grained PBS
detection is still lacking. In this work, we make two key contributions. First,
we curate a large scale annotated dataset for blood cell detection and
classification, comprising 16,891 images across 12 peripheral blood cell (PBC)
classes, along with the red blood cell class, all carefully re annotated for
object detection tasks. In total, the dataset contains 298,850 annotated cells.
Second, we leverage this dataset to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of five
YOLOv11 variants (ranging from Nano to XLarge). These models are rigorously
benchmarked under two data splitting strategies (70:20:10 and 80:10:10) and
systematically assessed using multiple performance criteria, including mean
Average Precision (mAP), precision, recall, F1 score, and computational
efficiency. Our experiments show that the YOLOv11 Medium variant achieves the
best trade off, reaching a mAP@0.5 of 0.934 under the 8:1:1 split. Larger
models (Large and XLarge) provide only marginal accuracy gains at substantially
higher computational cost. Moreover, the 8:1:1 split consistently outperforms
the 7:2:1 split across all models. These findings highlight YOLOv11,
particularly the Medium variant, as a highly effective framework for automated,
fine grained PBS detection. Beyond benchmarking, our publicly released dataset
(github.com/Mohamad-AbouAli/OI-PBC-Dataset) offers a valuable resource to
advance research on blood cell detection and classification in hematology.

*Bikash Kumar Badatya,Vipul Baghel,Jyotirmoy Amin,Ravi Hegde*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an unsupervised framework using structured optimal transport with ASTGCN for automatic temporal segmentation of javelin-throw motion phases without manual labeling, achieving superior performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional sports motion analysis relies on manual annotation or lab instrumentation, which is time-consuming, costly, and lacks scalability for elite athletic performance analysis.

Method: Uses structured optimal transport (SOT) to augment Attention-based Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (ASTGCN) for unsupervised temporal segmentation of javelin-throw motion phases.

Result: Achieves 71.02% mean average precision (mAP) and 74.61% F1-score on test data, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art unsupervised methods.

Conclusion: The framework enables automatic extraction of kinetic variables and motion phase transitions without expensive manual labeling, demonstrated through a new dataset of 211 annotated professional javelin-throw videos.

Abstract: Precise analysis of athletic motion is central to sports analytics,
particularly in disciplines where nuanced biomechanical phases directly impact
performance outcomes. Traditional analytics techniques rely on manual
annotation or laboratory-based instrumentation, which are time-consuming,
costly, and lack scalability. Automatic extraction of relevant kinetic
variables requires a robust and contextually appropriate temporal segmentation.
Considering the specific case of elite javelin-throw, we present a novel
unsupervised framework for such a contextually aware segmentation, which
applies the structured optimal transport (SOT) concept to augment the
well-known Attention-based Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network
(ASTGCN). This enables the identification of motion phase transitions without
requiring expensive manual labeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, achieving 71.02%
mean average precision (mAP) and 74.61% F1-score on test data, substantially
higher than competing baselines. We also release a new dataset of 211 manually
annotated professional javelin-throw videos with frame-level annotations,
covering key biomechanical phases: approach steps, drive, throw, and recovery.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreeRet is a plug-and-play framework that converts any multimodal large language model (MLLM) into a two-stage retriever without additional training, using semantic embeddings for candidate search and reasoning for reranking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs require heavy post-hoc training to become contrastive encoders for retrieval. This work explores whether off-the-shelf MLLMs can serve as powerful retrievers without additional training.

Method: FreeRet uses a two-stage approach: 1) derives semantically grounded embeddings directly from MLLMs for fast candidate search, 2) exploits MLLM reasoning ability for precise reranking. Key innovations include bypassing lexical alignment layers, conditioning representation generation with explicit priors, and mitigating framing effect via neutral choice framing.

Result: On MMEB and MMEB-V2 benchmarks spanning 46 datasets, FreeRet substantially outperforms models trained on millions of pairs. It scales across MLLM families and sizes, preserves generative abilities, supports arbitrary modality combinations, and unifies retrieval, reranking, and generation in end-to-end RAG.

Conclusion: Pretrained MLLMs, when carefully harnessed, can serve as strong retrieval engines without training, closing a critical gap in their role as generalists.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are emerging as versatile
foundations for mixed-modality retrieval. Yet, they often require heavy
post-hoc training to convert them into contrastive encoders for retrieval. This
work asks: Can off-the-shelf MLLMs serve as powerful retrievers without
additional training? We present FreeRet, a plug-and-play framework that turns
any MLLM into a two-stage retriever. FreeRet first derives semantically
grounded embeddings directly from the model for fast candidate search, and then
exploits its reasoning ability for precise reranking. The framework contributes
three advances: bypassing lexical alignment layers to obtain semantically
faithful embeddings, conditioning representation generation with explicit
priors, and mitigating framing effect in reranking via neutral choice framing.
On the MMEB and MMEB-V2 benchmarks spanning 46 datasets, FreeRet substantially
outperforms models trained on millions of pairs. Beyond benchmarks, FreeRet is
model-agnostic and scales seamlessly across MLLM families and sizes, preserves
their generative abilities, supports arbitrary modality combinations, and
unifies retrieval, reranking, and generation into end-to-end RAG within a
single model. Our findings demonstrate that pretrained MLLMs, when carefully
harnessed, can serve as strong retrieval engines without training, closing a
critical gap in their role as generalists.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPLICE is a human-curated benchmark from COIN dataset for evaluating event-based reasoning across temporal, causal, spatial, contextual, and knowledge dimensions. It shows VLMs significantly underperform humans in rearranging event sequences, relying more on language priors than visual understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a comprehensive benchmark for probing event-based reasoning capabilities across multiple dimensions and assess the gap between human reasoning and state-of-the-art vision-language models.

Method: Developed SPLICE benchmark with 3,381 human-filtered videos from 12 categories, segmented into 11,423 event clips. Evaluated both humans and VLMs on rearranging clips into coherent sequences, with and without human-annotated textual descriptions.

Result: Significant performance gap between humans and VLMs. Human annotations improve VLM accuracy but don't affect human performance. VLMs perform better on temporal/causal reasoning tasks than contextual/spatial reasoning, and better on everyday tasks than specialized ones.

Conclusion: VLMs still fall short of human-level visual reasoning, relying heavily on language priors rather than genuine visual understanding. Persistent challenges remain in achieving human-like event-based reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce SPLICE, a human-curated benchmark derived from the
COIN instructional video dataset, designed to probe event-based reasoning
across multiple dimensions: temporal, causal, spatial, contextual, and general
knowledge. SPLICE includes 3,381 human-filtered videos spanning 12 categories
and 180 sub-categories, such as sports, engineering, and housework. These
videos are segmented into a total of 11,423 event clips. We evaluate both human
participants and state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) on the task of
rearranging these clips into coherent event sequences to assess visual
reasoning capabilities. Results reveal a significant gap: VLMs struggle to
match human performance. While human-annotated textual descriptions improve
model accuracy, they do not affect human performance, suggesting that models
rely more on language priors than on visual understanding. Even with
annotations, VLMs fall short of human-level reasoning, underscoring persistent
challenges in visual reasoning. A deeper analysis across sub-categories shows
that VLMs perform relatively better on videos where temporal and causal
reasoning are dominant, compared to those where contextual and spatial
reasoning are dominant. They also perform better on everyday tasks than on
specialized ones.

*Zhu,Libo,Zhou,Zihan,Liu,Xiaoyang,Zhang,Weihang,Shi,Keyu,Fu,Yifan,Zhang,Yulun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RIFLE is a diffusion-based framework that removes flicker-banding artifacts from photos of emissive displays while preserving fine details, using a flicker-banding prior estimator and masked loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flicker-banding artifacts frequently degrade photos of screens due to temporal aliasing between camera rolling-shutter and display modulation, impacting readability and quality, but this problem remains underexplored compared to moire degradation.

Method: Proposes RIFLE framework with flicker-banding prior estimator (FPE) to predict banding attributes, masked loss to focus supervision on banded regions, and a simulation pipeline to synthesize realistic FB artifacts with stochastic variations in angle, spacing, and width.

Result: RIFLE consistently outperforms recent image reconstruction baselines across quantitative metrics and visual comparisons on real-world dataset, from mild to severe flicker-banding cases.

Conclusion: This is the first work to research simulation and removal of flicker-banding, establishing foundation for future research with released dataset and code.

Abstract: Capturing screens is now routine in our everyday lives. But the photographs
of emissive displays are often influenced by the flicker-banding (FB), which is
alternating bright%u2013dark stripes that arise from temporal aliasing between
a camera's rolling-shutter readout and the display's brightness modulation.
Unlike moire degradation, which has been extensively studied, the FB remains
underexplored despite its frequent and severe impact on readability and
perceived quality. We formulate FB removal as a dedicated restoration task and
introduce Removal of Image Flicker-Banding via Latent Diffusion Enhancement,
RIFLE, a diffusion-based framework designed to remove FB while preserving fine
details. We propose the flicker-banding prior estimator (FPE) that predicts key
banding attributes and injects it into the restoration network. Additionally,
Masked Loss (ML) is proposed to concentrate supervision on banded regions
without sacrificing global fidelity. To overcome data scarcity, we provide a
simulation pipeline that synthesizes FB in the luminance domain with stochastic
jitter in banding angle, banding spacing, and banding width. Feathered
boundaries and sensor noise are also applied for a more realistic simulation.
For evaluation, we collect a paired real-world FB dataset with pixel-aligned
banding-free references captured via long exposure. Across quantitative metrics
and visual comparisons on our real-world dataset, RIFLE consistently
outperforms recent image reconstruction baselines from mild to severe
flicker-banding. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work to research
the simulation and removal of FB. Our work establishes a great foundation for
subsequent research in both the dataset construction and the removal model
design. Our dataset and code will be released soon.

*Adil Kaan Akan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SlotAdapt, a framework that adapts pretrained diffusion models for object-centric synthesis by integrating slot-based conditioning, enabling fine-grained object control while maintaining scene coherence for both images and videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models treat images holistically and rely on text conditioning, creating a mismatch for object-level editing. The goal is to represent scenes as compositions of discrete objects for controllable generation.

Method: Uses lightweight slot-based conditioning integrated into pretrained diffusion models. For images: register token for background/style and slot-conditioned modules for objects. For videos: Invariant Slot Attention (ISA) to separate object identity from pose, plus Transformer-based temporal aggregator.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art in object discovery, segmentation, compositional editing, and controllable generation for images. For videos, sets new benchmarks in unsupervised video object segmentation and reconstruction, supporting advanced editing tasks like object removal, replacement, and insertion.

Conclusion: Establishes a general and scalable approach to object-centric generative modeling that bridges human object-based perception with machine learning, expanding possibilities for interactive and structured generative tools.

Abstract: A central goal in AI is to represent scenes as compositions of discrete
objects, enabling fine-grained, controllable image and video generation. Yet
leading diffusion models treat images holistically and rely on text
conditioning, creating a mismatch for object-level editing. This thesis
introduces a framework that adapts powerful pretrained diffusion models for
object-centric synthesis while retaining their generative capacity.
  We identify a core challenge: balancing global scene coherence with
disentangled object control. Our method integrates lightweight, slot-based
conditioning into pretrained models, preserving their visual priors while
providing object-specific manipulation. For images, SlotAdapt augments
diffusion models with a register token for background/style and
slot-conditioned modules for objects, reducing text-conditioning bias and
achieving state-of-the-art results in object discovery, segmentation,
compositional editing, and controllable image generation.
  We further extend the framework to video. Using Invariant Slot Attention
(ISA) to separate object identity from pose and a Transformer-based temporal
aggregator, our approach maintains consistent object representations and
dynamics across frames. This yields new benchmarks in unsupervised video object
segmentation and reconstruction, and supports advanced editing tasks such as
object removal, replacement, and insertion without explicit supervision.
  Overall, this work establishes a general and scalable approach to
object-centric generative modeling for images and videos. By bridging human
object-based perception and machine learning, it expands the design space for
interactive, structured, and user-driven generative tools in creative,
scientific, and practical domains.

TL;DR: A classifier-centric adaptive framework improves open-vocabulary camouflaged object segmentation by enhancing classification via a lightweight text adapter with layered asymmetric initialization, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-vocabulary camouflaged object segmentation requires high generalization to segment unseen categories, and analysis shows classification components significantly impact segmentation performance.

Method: Proposes a classifier-centric adaptive framework with a lightweight text adapter using layered asymmetric initialization to improve classification capabilities.

Result: Substantial improvements on OVCamo benchmark: cIoU increased from 0.443 to 0.493, cSm from 0.579 to 0.658, and cMAE reduced from 0.336 to 0.239 compared to OVCoser baseline.

Conclusion: Targeted classification enhancement provides an effective approach for advancing camouflaged object segmentation performance in open-vocabulary settings.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary camouflaged object segmentation requires models to segment
camouflaged objects of arbitrary categories unseen during training, placing
extremely high demands on generalization capabilities. Through analysis of
existing methods, it is observed that the classification component
significantly affects overall segmentation performance. Accordingly, a
classifier-centric adaptive framework is proposed to enhance segmentation
performance by improving the classification component via a lightweight text
adapter with a novel layered asymmetric initialization. Through the
classification enhancement, the proposed method achieves substantial
improvements in segmentation metrics compared to the OVCoser baseline on the
OVCamo benchmark: cIoU increases from 0.443 to 0.493, cSm from 0.579 to 0.658,
and cMAE reduces from 0.336 to 0.239. These results demonstrate that targeted
classification enhancement provides an effective approach for advancing

*Ghanshyam Dhamat,Vaanathi Sundaresan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Development of an automated pipeline for segmenting traumatic brain injury lesions in T1-weighted MRI scans using nnUNet architectures and post-processing, achieving competitive results in the AIMS-TBI 2025 challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traumatic brain injury lesions are extremely heterogeneous in size, number, and laterality, which complicates neuroimaging analysis tasks like image registration and brain parcellation, reducing analytical accuracy.

Method: Multiple approaches using various nnUNet architectures for initial segmentation, complemented by post-processing strategies to enhance evaluation metrics.

Result: Achieved accuracy of 0.8451, Dice scores of 0.4711 (images with visible lesions) and 0.8514 (images without visible lesions), with overall Dice score of 0.5973, ranking among top-6 methods in AIMS-TBI 2025 challenge.

Conclusion: The developed automated segmentation pipeline effectively addresses the challenge of TBI lesion segmentation and is publicly available for research use.

Abstract: The identification and segmentation of moderate-severe traumatic brain injury
(TBI) lesions pose a significant challenge in neuroimaging. This difficulty
arises from the extreme heterogeneity of these lesions, which vary in size,
number, and laterality, thereby complicating downstream image processing tasks
such as image registration and brain parcellation, reducing the analytical
accuracy. Thus, developing methods for highly accurate segmentation of TBI
lesions is essential for reliable neuroimaging analysis. This study aims to
develop an effective automated segmentation pipeline to automatically detect
and segment TBI lesions in T1-weighted MRI scans. We evaluate multiple
approaches to achieve accurate segmentation of the TBI lesions. The core of our
pipeline leverages various architectures within the nnUNet framework for
initial segmentation, complemented by post-processing strategies to enhance
evaluation metrics. Our final submission to the challenge achieved an accuracy
of 0.8451, Dice score values of 0.4711 and 0.8514 for images with and without
visible lesions, respectively, with an overall Dice score of 0.5973, ranking
among the top-6 methods in the AIMS-TBI 2025 challenge. The Python
implementation of our pipeline is publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SANA-Video is an efficient diffusion model for generating high-resolution (720x1280), minute-long videos with fast speed, deployable on consumer GPUs like RTX 5090.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a cost-effective video generation model that can produce high-quality, long videos efficiently without requiring massive computational resources.

Method: Uses Linear DiT with linear attention for efficiency and constant-memory KV cache for block linear attention to enable minute-long video generation with fixed memory cost.

Result: Achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art models while being 16x faster, with training cost reduced to 1% of MovieGen (12 days on 64 H100 GPUs).

Conclusion: SANA-Video enables low-cost, high-quality video generation that is deployable on consumer hardware with significant speed improvements.

Abstract: We introduce SANA-Video, a small diffusion model that can efficiently
generate videos up to 720x1280 resolution and minute-length duration.
SANA-Video synthesizes high-resolution, high-quality and long videos with
strong text-video alignment at a remarkably fast speed, deployable on RTX 5090
GPU. Two core designs ensure our efficient, effective and long video
generation: (1) Linear DiT: We leverage linear attention as the core operation,
which is more efficient than vanilla attention given the large number of tokens
processed in video generation. (2) Constant-Memory KV cache for Block Linear
Attention: we design block-wise autoregressive approach for long video
generation by employing a constant-memory state, derived from the cumulative
properties of linear attention. This KV cache provides the Linear DiT with
global context at a fixed memory cost, eliminating the need for a traditional
KV cache and enabling efficient, minute-long video generation. In addition, we
explore effective data filters and model training strategies, narrowing the
training cost to 12 days on 64 H100 GPUs, which is only 1% of the cost of
MovieGen. Given its low cost, SANA-Video achieves competitive performance
compared to modern state-of-the-art small diffusion models (e.g., Wan 2.1-1.3B
and SkyReel-V2-1.3B) while being 16x faster in measured latency. Moreover,
SANA-Video can be deployed on RTX 5090 GPUs with NVFP4 precision, accelerating
the inference speed of generating a 5-second 720p video from 71s to 29s (2.4x
speedup). In summary, SANA-Video enables low-cost, high-quality video
generation.

*Yutong Hao,Chen Chen,Ajmal Saeed Mian,Chang Xu,Daochang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free framework that improves physical plausibility in video generation by using physics-aware reasoning to create counterfactual prompts and a novel Synchronized Decoupled Guidance strategy to suppress implausible content during denoising.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models for video generation implicitly learn physics from large datasets, which is costly, difficult to scale, and still produces physically implausible motions that violate fundamental laws.

Method: Uses a lightweight physics-aware reasoning pipeline to construct counterfactual prompts encoding physics-violating behaviors, and proposes Synchronized Decoupled Guidance (SDG) with synchronized directional normalization and trajectory-decoupled denoising to suppress implausible content.

Result: Experiments across different physical domains show substantial enhancement in physical fidelity while maintaining photorealism, with no additional training required. Both physics-aware reasoning and SDG components are validated as critically effective.

Conclusion: Establishes a new plug-and-play physics-aware paradigm for video generation that explicitly reasons about physical plausibility at inference time without training.

Abstract: Diffusion models can generate realistic videos, but existing methods rely on
implicitly learning physical reasoning from large-scale text-video datasets,
which is costly, difficult to scale, and still prone to producing implausible
motions that violate fundamental physical laws. We introduce a training-free
framework that improves physical plausibility at inference time by explicitly
reasoning about implausibility and guiding the generation away from it.
Specifically, we employ a lightweight physics-aware reasoning pipeline to
construct counterfactual prompts that deliberately encode physics-violating
behaviors. Then, we propose a novel Synchronized Decoupled Guidance (SDG)
strategy, which leverages these prompts through synchronized directional
normalization to counteract lagged suppression and trajectory-decoupled
denoising to mitigate cumulative trajectory bias, ensuring that implausible
content is suppressed immediately and consistently throughout denoising.
Experiments across different physical domains show that our approach
substantially enhances physical fidelity while maintaining photorealism,
despite requiring no additional training. Ablation studies confirm the
complementary effectiveness of both the physics-aware reasoning component and
SDG. In particular, the aforementioned two designs of SDG are also individually
validated to contribute critically to the suppression of implausible content
and the overall gains in physical plausibility. This establishes a new and
plug-and-play physics-aware paradigm for video generation.

TL;DR: IWR-Bench is a new benchmark for evaluating Large Vision-Language Models on interactive webpage reconstruction from video, addressing limitations of static screenshot-to-code tasks by focusing on dynamic interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on static screenshot-to-code tasks, overlooking dynamic interactions that are fundamental to real-world web applications.

Method: IWR-Bench comprises 113 curated tasks from 100 real-world websites with 1,001 actions, featuring diverse interaction complexities. It includes user interaction videos and crawled static assets, evaluating models on multi-modal reasoning and code generation through an agent-as-a-judge framework.

Result: Experiments on 28 LVLMs show the best model achieves only 36.35% overall score, with functional correctness (24.39% IFS) lagging significantly behind visual fidelity (64.25% VFS).

Conclusion: Current models have critical limitations in reasoning about temporal dynamics and synthesizing event-driven logic, establishing IWR-Bench as a challenging frontier for vision-language research.

Abstract: The webpage-to-code task requires models to understand visual representations
of webpages and generate corresponding code. However, existing benchmarks
primarily focus on static screenshot-to-code tasks, thereby overlooking the
dynamic interactions fundamental to real-world web applications. To address
this limitation, this paper introduces IWR-Bench, a novel benchmark for
evaluating the capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in
interactive webpage reconstruction from video. IWR-Bench comprises 113
meticulously curated tasks from 100 real-world websites, with 1,001 actions and
featuring diverse interaction complexities (e.g., web games), visual styles,
and domains. Aligning with standard web development practices, each task
includes not only user interaction videos but also all crawled static assets
(e.g., images, videos). This benchmark evaluates models on two fundamental
challenges: comprehensive multi-modal reasoning to infer interaction logic from
video and assets, and advanced code generation to translate this logic into
functional code. An agent-as-a-judge framework with a comprehensive metric
system automatically assesses the functional correctness and visual fidelity of
generated webpages. Extensive experiments on 28 LVLMs reveal a significant
challenge: the best model achieves an overall score of only 36.35%, as
functional correctness (24.39% IFS) lags significantly behind visual fidelity
(64.25% VFS). These results highlight critical limitations in current models'
ability to reason about temporal dynamics and synthesize event-driven logic,
establishing IWR-Bench as a challenging frontier for vision-language research.

*Luis F. W. Batista,Tom Bourbon,Cedric Pradalier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Polarimetric imaging improves segmentation of floating debris by mitigating water-surface glare, though it increases computational load and may introduce new false positives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate segmentation of floating debris is compromised by surface glare and changing outdoor illumination, which polarimetric imaging can help mitigate.

Method: Benchmark state-of-the-art fusion networks on PoTATO dataset of polarimetric images, comparing with single-image baselines using traditional models.

Result: Polarimetric cues help recover low-contrast objects and suppress reflection-induced false positives, improving mean IoU and lowering contour error compared to RGB inputs.

Conclusion: Polarized cameras can improve segmentation but come with computational costs and potential new false positives; the benchmark helps researchers evaluate suitability for their applications.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of floating debris on water is often compromised by
surface glare and changing outdoor illumination. Polarimetric imaging offers a
single-sensor route to mitigate water-surface glare that disrupts semantic
segmentation of floating objects. We benchmark state-of-the-art fusion networks
on PoTATO, a public dataset of polarimetric images of plastic bottles in inland
waterways, and compare their performance with single-image baselines using
traditional models. Our results indicate that polarimetric cues help recover
low-contrast objects and suppress reflection-induced false positives, raising
mean IoU and lowering contour error relative to RGB inputs. These sharper masks
come at a cost: the additional channels enlarge the models increasing the
computational load and introducing the risk of new false positives. By
providing a reproducible, diagnostic benchmark and publicly available code, we
hope to help researchers choose if polarized cameras are suitable for their
applications and to accelerate related research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the first Vietnamese-language multimodal medical dataset with 1.5M+ CT-PET images and 2,757 clinical reports, addressing gaps in PET/CT data and low-resource language representation for medical VLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical VLMs lack diverse imaging modalities (especially PET/CT) and focus primarily on high-resource languages, limiting their clinical utility and generalizability, particularly for Vietnamese healthcare.

Method: Created a novel Vietnamese multimodal dataset with CT-PET image pairs and clinical reports, implemented a training framework with data augmentation and expert-validated test sets, and benchmarked state-of-the-art VLMs on medical report generation and visual question answering tasks.

Result: Incorporating the new dataset significantly improved the performance of existing VLMs on downstream medical tasks, demonstrating enhanced capabilities in handling functional imaging and Vietnamese language processing.

Conclusion: The dataset and benchmark represent a pivotal advancement for developing more robust medical VLMs, particularly benefiting low-resource languages like Vietnamese and improving clinical relevance in healthcare applications.

Abstract: Vision-Language Foundation Models (VLMs), trained on large-scale multimodal
datasets, have driven significant advances in Artificial Intelligence by
enabling rich cross-modal reasoning. Despite their success in general domains,
applying these models to medical imaging remains challenging due to the limited
availability of diverse imaging modalities and multilingual clinical data. Most
existing medical VLMs are trained on a subset of imaging modalities and focus
primarily on high-resource languages, thus limiting their generalizability and
clinical utility. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel
Vietnamese-language multimodal medical dataset comprising 1,567,062 paired
CT-PET images and corresponding 2,757 full-length clinical reports. This
dataset is designed to fill two pressing gaps in medical AI development: (1)
the lack of PET/CT imaging data in existing VLMs training corpora, which
hinders the development of models capable of handling functional imaging tasks;
and (2) the underrepresentation of low-resource languages, particularly the
Vietnamese language, in medical vision-language research. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first dataset to provide comprehensive PET/CT-report
pairs in Vietnamese. We further introduce a training framework to enhance VLMs'
learning, including data augmentation and expert-validated test sets. We
conduct comprehensive experiments benchmarking state-of-the-art VLMs on
downstream tasks, including medical report generation and visual question
answering. The experimental results show that incorporating our dataset
significantly improves the performance of existing VLMs. We believe this
dataset and benchmark will serve as a pivotal step in advancing the development
of more robust VLMs for medical imaging, particularly in low-resource
languages, and improving their clinical relevance in Vietnamese healthcare.

Motivation: Existing multi-modal tracking approaches focus on dual-modal paradigms (RGB-Depth or RGB-Thermal) and struggle in complex scenarios due to limited input modalities. The authors aim to address this gap by leveraging three complementary modalities.

Method: Proposes RDTTrack, a multi-modal tracker that integrates tri-modal information using a pretrained RGB-only tracking model and prompt learning.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over existing dual-modal approaches in terms of tracking accuracy and robustness in complex scenarios. The method effectively harmonizes tri-modal complementary cues.

Conclusion: The proposed tri-modal tracking approach using RGB, Depth, and Thermal Infrared modalities provides enhanced robustness in complex scenarios, outperforming dual-modal methods and showing the value of complementary multi-modal fusion.

Abstract: Existing multi-modal object tracking approaches primarily focus on dual-modal
paradigms, such as RGB-Depth or RGB-Thermal, yet remain challenged in complex
scenarios due to limited input modalities. To address this gap, this work
introduces a novel multi-modal tracking task that leverages three complementary
modalities, including visible RGB, Depth (D), and Thermal Infrared (TIR),
aiming to enhance robustness in complex scenarios. To support this task, we
construct a new multi-modal tracking dataset, coined RGBDT500, which consists
of 500 videos with synchronised frames across the three modalities. Each frame
provides spatially aligned RGB, depth, and thermal infrared images with precise
object bounding box annotations. Furthermore, we propose a novel multi-modal
tracker, dubbed RDTTrack. RDTTrack integrates tri-modal information for robust
tracking by leveraging a pretrained RGB-only tracking model and prompt learning
techniques. In specific, RDTTrack fuses thermal infrared and depth modalities
under a proposed orthogonal projection constraint, then integrates them with
RGB signals as prompts for the pre-trained foundation tracking model,
effectively harmonising tri-modal complementary cues. The experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method, showing
significant improvements over existing dual-modal approaches in terms of

TL;DR: ExGS is a feed-forward framework for extreme 3D Gaussian Splatting compression that combines Universal Gaussian Compression (UGC) for aggressive pruning with GaussPainter for quality restoration using diffusion priors, achieving over 100x compression while preserving rendering quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural scene representations like 3DGS have high storage and transmission costs that hinder deployment in resource-constrained environments, and existing compression methods either require costly optimization or degrade quality under high compression ratios.

Method: ExGS unifies Universal Gaussian Compression (UGC) for re-optimization-free pruning with GaussPainter that leverages diffusion priors and mask-guided refinement to restore high-quality renderings from heavily pruned Gaussian scenes.

Result: The framework achieves over 100x compression (reducing 354.77 MB to about 3.31 MB) while preserving fidelity and significantly improving image quality under challenging conditions.

Conclusion: Diffusion priors play a central role in bridging the gap between extreme compression and high-quality neural rendering, enabling practical real-time restoration with lightweight components.

Abstract: Neural scene representations, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have
enabled high-quality neural rendering; however, their large storage and
transmission costs hinder deployment in resource-constrained environments.
Existing compression methods either rely on costly optimization, which is slow
and scene-specific, or adopt training-free pruning and quantization, which
degrade rendering quality under high compression ratios. In contrast, recent
data-driven approaches provide a promising direction to overcome this
trade-off, enabling efficient compression while preserving high rendering
quality. We introduce \textbf{ExGS}, a novel feed-forward framework that
unifies \textbf{Universal Gaussian Compression} (UGC) with
\textbf{GaussPainter} for \textbf{Ex}treme 3D\textbf{GS} compression.
\textbf{UGC} performs re-optimization-free pruning to aggressively reduce
Gaussian primitives while retaining only essential information, whereas
\textbf{GaussPainter} leverages powerful diffusion priors with mask-guided
refinement to restore high-quality renderings from heavily pruned Gaussian
scenes. Unlike conventional inpainting, GaussPainter not only fills in missing
regions but also enhances visible pixels, yielding substantial improvements in
degraded renderings. To ensure practicality, it adopts a lightweight VAE and a
one-step diffusion design, enabling real-time restoration. Our framework can
even achieve over $100\times$ compression (reducing a typical 354.77 MB model
to about 3.31 MB) while preserving fidelity and significantly improving image
quality under challenging conditions. These results highlight the central role
of diffusion priors in bridging the gap between extreme compression and
high-quality neural rendering. Our code repository will be released at

Motivation: Multimodal large language models often fail to properly ground reasoning in perceptual evidence, leading to inaccurate or ungrounded conclusions.

Method: Two-stage framework: Stage 1 uses perception-augmented fine-tuning, Stage 2 applies perception-aware reinforcement learning with visual, textual, and consistency rewards.

Result: Significantly improves reasoning accuracy and robustness across diverse multimodal tasks, with explicit perception strategies showing the best improvements.

Conclusion: VTPerception-R1 provides a scalable and auditable solution for perception-grounded multimodal reasoning, with explicit perception strategies being particularly effective.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often struggle to ground reasoning
in perceptual evidence. We present a systematic study of perception
strategies-explicit, implicit, visual, and textual-across four multimodal
benchmarks and two MLLMs. Our findings show that explicit perception,
especially when paired with textual cues, consistently yields the best
improvements, particularly for smaller models. Based on this insight, we
propose VTPerception-R1, a unified two-stage framework that decouples
perception from reasoning. Stage 1 introduces perception-augmented fine-tuning,
and Stage 2 applies perception-aware reinforcement learning with novel visual,
textual, and consistency rewards. Experiments demonstrate that VTPerception-R1
significantly improves reasoning accuracy and robustness across diverse tasks,
offering a scalable and auditable solution for perception-grounded multimodal

Result: Achieves 25.75% Recall@1 accuracy on University-1652 in UAVM2025 Challenge, demonstrating robustness and generalization across diverse urban scenarios.

Conclusion: SkyLink effectively addresses viewpoint variation challenges in cross-view geo-localization through enhanced feature retrieval and 3D scene integration, showing superior performance in urban scenarios.

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization aims at establishing location correspondences
between different viewpoints. Existing approaches typically learn cross-view
correlations through direct feature similarity matching, often overlooking
semantic degradation caused by extreme viewpoint disparities. To address this
unique problem, we focus on robust feature retrieval under viewpoint variation
and propose the novel SkyLink method. We firstly utilize the Google Retrieval
Enhancement Module to perform data enhancement on street images, which
mitigates the occlusion of the key target due to restricted street viewpoints.
The Patch-Aware Feature Aggregation module is further adopted to emphasize
multiple local feature aggregations to ensure the consistent feature extraction
across viewpoints. Meanwhile, we integrate the 3D scene information constructed
from multi-scale UAV images as a bridge between street and satellite
viewpoints, and perform feature alignment through self-supervised and
cross-view contrastive learning. Experimental results demonstrate robustness
and generalization across diverse urban scenarios, which achieve 25.75$\%$

### [293] [LOVE-R1: Advancing Long Video Understanding with an Adaptive Zoom-in Mechanism via Multi-Step Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24786)
*Shenghao Fu,Qize Yang,Yuan-Ming Li,Xihan Wei,Xiaohua Xie,Wei-Shi Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LOVE-R1 is a Large Video-Language Model that uses adaptive zoom-in reasoning to balance temporal understanding and spatial perception in long videos, achieving better performance than baseline models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLMs with uniform frame sampling sacrifice either temporal clues or spatial details, creating a conflict between long-form temporal understanding and detailed spatial perception.

Method: Proposes a multi-step reasoning process where the model starts with densely sampled small-resolution frames and adaptively zooms in on clips of interest with higher resolution when spatial details are needed. Uses 38k CoT data for finetuning and decoupled reinforcement finetuning for process supervision.

Result: LOVE-R1 outperforms Qwen2.5-VL baseline by an average of 3.1% across 4 long video understanding benchmarks, achieving better trade-off between sampling density and frame resolutions.

Conclusion: The adaptive slow-fast frame sampling mechanism effectively resolves the conflict between temporal understanding and spatial perception in long video analysis.

Abstract: Long video understanding is still challenging for recent Large Video-Language
Models (LVLMs) due to the conflict between long-form temporal understanding and
detailed spatial perception. LVLMs with a uniform frame sampling mechanism,
which samples frames with an equal frame size and fixed sampling rate,
inevitably sacrifice either temporal clues or spatial details, resulting in
suboptimal solutions. To mitigate this dilemma, we propose LOVE-R1, a model
that can adaptively zoom in on a video clip. The model is first provided with
densely sampled frames but in a small resolution. If some spatial details are
needed, the model can zoom in on a clip of interest with a large frame
resolution based on its reasoning until key visual information is obtained. The
whole process is implemented as a multi-step reasoning process. To train the
reasoning ability, we first finetune the model on our collected 38k
high-quality CoT data and enhance it with decoupled reinforcement finetuning.
As outcome rewards can not provide fine-grained process supervision, we
decouple multi-step reasoning into multiple single-step reasoning and optimize
the internal zoom-in ability explicitly. Experiments on long video

### [294] [Vision Function Layer in Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24791)
*Cheng Shi,Yizhou Yu,Sibei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper identifies Vision Function Layers (VFLs) in MLLMs where specific visual functions like counting, grounding, and OCR are localized to 2-3 layers, following a consistent pattern across models that aligns with human visual processing hierarchy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how visual functions are distributed across decoder layers in MLLMs and leverage this understanding for more efficient model training and data selection.

Method: Uses Visual Token Swapping framework to modify KV cache entries and precisely identify layer-specific functions during decoding. Also develops VFL-LoRA for selective layer training and VFL-select for automated data classification.

Result: Found consistent VFL patterns across MLLMs aligned with human visual processing (recognition → counting → grounding). VFL-LoRA outperforms full-LoRA and prevents function forgetting. VFL-select achieves 98% performance with only 20% data, surpassing human experts in data selection.

Conclusion: The study provides deeper understanding of MLLM visual processing, enabling more efficient, interpretable, and robust models through targeted layer training and automated data selection based on function-specific layers.

Abstract: This study identifies that visual-related functional decoding is distributed
across different decoder layers in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).
Typically, each function, such as counting, grounding, or OCR recognition,
narrows down to two or three layers, which we define as Vision Function Layers
(VFL). Additionally, the depth and its order of different VFLs exhibits a
consistent pattern across different MLLMs, which is well-aligned with human
behaviors (e.g., recognition occurs first, followed by counting, and then
grounding). These findings are derived from Visual Token Swapping, our novel
analytical framework that modifies targeted KV cache entries to precisely
elucidate layer-specific functions during decoding. Furthermore, these insights
offer substantial utility in tailoring MLLMs for real-world downstream
applications. For instance, when LoRA training is selectively applied to VFLs
whose functions align with the training data, VFL-LoRA not only outperform
full-LoRA but also prevent out-of-domain function forgetting. Moreover, by
analyzing the performance differential on training data when particular VFLs
are ablated, VFL-select automatically classifies data by function, enabling
highly efficient data selection to directly bolster corresponding capabilities.
Consequently, VFL-select surpasses human experts in data selection, and
achieves 98% of full-data performance with only 20% of the original dataset.
This study delivers deeper comprehension of MLLM visual processing, fostering
the creation of more efficient, interpretable, and robust models.

*Lei Tong,Zhihua Liu,Chaochao Lu,Dino Oglic,Tom Diethe,Philip Teare,Sotirios A. Tsaftaris,Chen Jin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Causal-Adapter is a modular framework that adapts frozen text-to-image diffusion models for counterfactual image generation, enabling causal interventions on attributes while preserving image identity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior approaches rely on prompt engineering without explicit causal structure, lacking precise control over attribute modifications and identity preservation in counterfactual image generation.

Method: Leverages structural causal modeling with two attribute regularization strategies: prompt-aligned injection for semantic control and conditioned token contrastive loss to disentangle attribute factors and reduce spurious correlations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 91% MAE reduction on Pendulum for accurate attribute control and 87% FID reduction on ADNI for high-fidelity MRI image generation.

Conclusion: The approach enables robust, generalizable counterfactual editing with faithful attribute modification and strong identity preservation across synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: We present Causal-Adapter, a modular framework that adapts frozen
text-to-image diffusion backbones for counterfactual image generation. Our
method enables causal interventions on target attributes, consistently
propagating their effects to causal dependents without altering the core
identity of the image. In contrast to prior approaches that rely on prompt
engineering without explicit causal structure, Causal-Adapter leverages
structural causal modeling augmented with two attribute regularization
strategies: prompt-aligned injection, which aligns causal attributes with
textual embeddings for precise semantic control, and a conditioned token
contrastive loss to disentangle attribute factors and reduce spurious
correlations. Causal-Adapter achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
synthetic and real-world datasets, with up to 91\% MAE reduction on Pendulum
for accurate attribute control and 87\% FID reduction on ADNI for high-fidelity
MRI image generation. These results show that our approach enables robust,
generalizable counterfactual editing with faithful attribute modification and
strong identity preservation.

*Anirban Ghosh,Ayan Dutta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TACO-Net is a novel 3D object classification method that combines topological data analysis with image filtration techniques and 1D CNN, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on ModelNet benchmarks and demonstrating strong robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D object classification is crucial for applications like computer vision, robotics, and autonomous driving, but remains challenging due to unordered, irregular, and noisy point clouds.

Method: Transform point clouds into voxelized binary 3D images, extract topological features using topological data analysis and image filtration, then train a lightweight 1D CNN on these features.

Result: Achieved 99.05% accuracy on ModelNet40 and 99.52% on ModelNet10, with strong performance on real-world OmniObject3D dataset and high resiliency to corrupted inputs.

Conclusion: TACO-Net sets new state-of-the-art performance for 3D object classification and demonstrates robustness across synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: 3D object classification is a crucial problem due to its significant
practical relevance in many fields, including computer vision, robotics, and
autonomous driving. Although deep learning methods applied to point clouds
sampled on CAD models of the objects and/or captured by LiDAR or RGBD cameras
have achieved remarkable success in recent years, achieving high classification
accuracy remains a challenging problem due to the unordered point clouds and
their irregularity and noise. To this end, we propose a novel state-of-the-art
(SOTA) 3D object classification technique that combines topological data
analysis with various image filtration techniques to classify objects when they
are represented using point clouds. We transform every point cloud into a
voxelized binary 3D image to extract distinguishing topological features. Next,
we train a lightweight one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN)
using the extracted feature set from the training dataset. Our framework,
TACO-Net, sets a new state-of-the-art by achieving $99.05\%$ and $99.52\%$
accuracy on the widely used synthetic benchmarks ModelNet40 and ModelNet10, and
further demonstrates its robustness on the large-scale real-world OmniObject3D
dataset. When tested with ten different kinds of corrupted ModelNet40 inputs,
the proposed TACO-Net demonstrates strong resiliency overall.

*Zeyu Cai,Ziyang Li,Xiaoben Li,Boqian Li,Zeyu Wang,Zhenyu Zhang,Yuliang Xiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UP2You is a tuning-free solution for reconstructing high-fidelity 3D clothed portraits from unconstrained 2D photos, handling varying poses, viewpoints, cropping, and occlusions without requiring clean inputs or pre-captured templates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous 3D reconstruction methods require clean inputs like full-body images with minimal occlusions or well-calibrated cross-view captures, limiting their practical use in real-world scenarios where photos are unstructured and unconstrained.

Method: Introduces a data rectifier paradigm that converts unconstrained inputs into clean orthogonal multi-view images in seconds, a pose-correlated feature aggregation module (PCFA) for selective information fusion, and a perceiver-based multi-reference shape predictor that eliminates need for pre-captured body templates.

Result: UP2You consistently surpasses previous methods in geometric accuracy (Chamfer-15%, P2S-18% on PuzzleIOI) and texture fidelity (PSNR-21%, LPIPS-46% on 4D-Dress), is efficient (1.5 minutes per person), and supports arbitrary pose control and training-free multi-garment 3D virtual try-on.

Conclusion: UP2You provides a practical solution for real-world 3D clothed portrait reconstruction from casual photos, demonstrating superior performance, efficiency, and versatility compared to existing methods, making it suitable for applications like virtual try-on and casual human capture scenarios.

Abstract: We present UP2You, the first tuning-free solution for reconstructing
high-fidelity 3D clothed portraits from extremely unconstrained in-the-wild 2D
photos. Unlike previous approaches that require "clean" inputs (e.g., full-body
images with minimal occlusions, or well-calibrated cross-view captures), UP2You
directly processes raw, unstructured photographs, which may vary significantly
in pose, viewpoint, cropping, and occlusion. Instead of compressing data into
tokens for slow online text-to-3D optimization, we introduce a data rectifier
paradigm that efficiently converts unconstrained inputs into clean, orthogonal
multi-view images in a single forward pass within seconds, simplifying the 3D
reconstruction. Central to UP2You is a pose-correlated feature aggregation
module (PCFA), that selectively fuses information from multiple reference
images w.r.t. target poses, enabling better identity preservation and nearly
constant memory footprint, with more observations. We also introduce a
perceiver-based multi-reference shape predictor, removing the need for
pre-captured body templates. Extensive experiments on 4D-Dress, PuzzleIOI, and
in-the-wild captures demonstrate that UP2You consistently surpasses previous
methods in both geometric accuracy (Chamfer-15%, P2S-18% on PuzzleIOI) and
texture fidelity (PSNR-21%, LPIPS-46% on 4D-Dress). UP2You is efficient (1.5
minutes per person), and versatile (supports arbitrary pose control, and
training-free multi-garment 3D virtual try-on), making it practical for
real-world scenarios where humans are casually captured. Both models and code
will be released to facilitate future research on this underexplored task.

### [298] [Training-Free Token Pruning via Zeroth-Order Gradient Estimation in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24837)
*Youngeun Kim,Youjia Zhang,Huiling Liu,Aecheon Jung,Sunwoo Lee,Sungeun Hong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free token pruning framework for VLMs that selects tokens based on sensitivity and complementarity, achieving up to 94.4% pruning while maintaining accuracy and 2.30x faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing token pruning methods have limitations - attention-based methods use unstable attention scores leading to redundant selections, while diversity-based methods risk dropping important regions needed for accurate predictions.

Method: Proposes a framework that estimates token sensitivity using zeroth-order perturbations at the projection layer, measuring how small random perturbations affect projection outputs to approximate token influence without backpropagation.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method consistently outperforms prior approaches, pruning up to 94.4% of tokens while maintaining accuracy and achieving up to 2.30x faster end-to-end inference.

Conclusion: The proposed training-free framework effectively identifies important tokens through sensitivity analysis and complementarity, significantly improving VLM efficiency without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable strong multimodal reasoning but
incur heavy inference costs from redundant visual tokens. Token pruning
alleviates this issue, yet existing approaches face limitations.
Attention-based methods rely on raw attention scores, which are often unstable
across layers and heads and can lead to redundant selections. Diversity-based
methods improve robustness by selecting tokens far apart in feature space but
risk dropping regions needed for accurate prediction. We propose \ours, a
training-free framework built on a simple intuition: tokens with higher
sensitivity are more likely to influence the model's output, and they should
also capture complementary visual cues rather than overlapping information. To
achieve this, we estimate token sensitivity using zeroth-order perturbations at
the projection layer, a shallow and computationally light component of the
model. This approach measures how small random perturbations affect the
projection outputs, allowing us to approximate each token's influence through
lightweight forward passes without backpropagation. Extensive experiments
across multiple VLMs and benchmarks show that \ours consistently outperforms
prior methods, pruning up to 94.4\% of tokens while maintaining accuracy and
significantly improving efficiency, achieving up to 2.30x faster end-to-end
inference over the baseline.

TL;DR: PHASE-Net is a physics-informed rPPG model based on hemodynamics theory that uses a lightweight architecture with axial swapping, adaptive spatial filtering, and gated temporal convolutions to achieve state-of-the-art performance in remote photoplethysmography.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) lack theoretical grounding and suffer from accuracy degradation under head motion and illumination changes, limiting robustness and interpretability.

Method: Derived from Navier-Stokes equations, the authors design PHASE-Net with three components: Zero-FLOPs Axial Swapper for cross-region feature interaction, Adaptive Spatial Filter to highlight signal-rich areas, and Gated Temporal Convolutional Network for long-range temporal dynamics modeling.

Result: PHASE-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance with strong efficiency in extensive experiments, demonstrating robust rPPG measurement under challenging conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed physics-informed paradigm provides a theoretically grounded and deployment-ready rPPG solution that outperforms existing heuristic deep learning approaches.

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) measurement enables non-contact
physiological monitoring but suffers from accuracy degradation under head
motion and illumination changes. Existing deep learning methods are mostly
heuristic and lack theoretical grounding, which limits robustness and
interpretability. In this work, we propose a physics-informed rPPG paradigm
derived from the Navier-Stokes equations of hemodynamics, showing that the
pulse signal follows a second-order dynamical system whose discrete solution
naturally leads to a causal convolution. This provides a theoretical
justification for using a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN). Based on this
principle, we design PHASE-Net, a lightweight model with three key components:
(1) Zero-FLOPs Axial Swapper module, which swaps or transposes a few spatial
channels to mix distant facial regions and enhance cross-region feature
interaction without breaking temporal order; (2) Adaptive Spatial Filter, which
learns a soft spatial mask per frame to highlight signal-rich areas and
suppress noise; and (3) Gated TCN, a causal dilated TCN with gating that models
long-range temporal dynamics for accurate pulse recovery. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PHASE-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance with strong
efficiency, offering a theoretically grounded and deployment-ready rPPG
solution.

Result: Achieves 97.63% accuracy and 97.33% F1 score on the 128-channel MODMA dataset (53 subjects), surpassing the 2025 state-of-the-art ACM-GNN. Ablation studies show removing any module lowers F1 by up to 4.35.

Conclusion: ELPG-DTFS offers a robust and interpretable framework for next-generation EEG-based MDD diagnostics, with complementary value from all proposed modules.

Abstract: Timely and objective screening of major depressive disorder (MDD) is vital,
yet diagnosis still relies on subjective scales. Electroencephalography (EEG)

Method: Apply Difference-of-Gaussians (DoG) filtering to RGB, grayscale, and opponent-color channels as model-agnostic preprocessing step.

Result: Maintains in-distribution performance while improving robustness to adverse conditions (night, fog, snow) on Cityscapes, ACDC, and Dark Zurich datasets.

Conclusion: Lightweight, model-agnostic preprocessing enables imaging systems to deliver task-ready, robust inputs for safety-critical vision applications.

Abstract: Inspired by the human visual system's mechanisms for contrast enhancement and
color-opponency, we explore biologically motivated input preprocessing for
robust semantic segmentation. By applying Difference-of-Gaussians (DoG)
filtering to RGB, grayscale, and opponent-color channels, we enhance local
contrast without modifying model architecture or training. Evaluations on
Cityscapes, ACDC, and Dark Zurich show that such preprocessing maintains
in-distribution performance while improving robustness to adverse conditions
like night, fog, and snow. As this processing is model-agnostic and
lightweight, it holds potential for integration into imaging pipelines,
enabling imaging systems to deliver task-ready, robust inputs for downstream
vision models in safety-critical environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs have limitations in real-time streaming scenarios due to storage constraints of historical visual features and insufficient real-time spatiotemporal reasoning.

Method: Proposes StreamForest with Persistent Event Memory Forest that organizes video frames into event-level tree structures using penalty functions, and Fine-grained Spatiotemporal Window for detailed short-term visual cues. Also introduces OnlineIT instruction-tuning dataset.

Result: Achieves 77.3% on StreamingBench, 60.5% on OVBench, and 55.6% on OVO-Bench. Maintains 96.8% accuracy even under extreme visual token compression (1024 tokens).

Conclusion: StreamForest demonstrates robustness, efficiency, and generalizability for streaming video understanding, particularly in autonomous driving scenarios.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable
progress in video understanding. However, their effectiveness in real-time
streaming scenarios remains limited due to storage constraints of historical
visual features and insufficient real-time spatiotemporal reasoning. To address
these challenges, we propose StreamForest, a novel architecture specifically
designed for streaming video understanding. Central to StreamForest is the
Persistent Event Memory Forest, a memory mechanism that adaptively organizes
video frames into multiple event-level tree structures. This process is guided
by penalty functions based on temporal distance, content similarity, and merge
frequency, enabling efficient long-term memory retention under limited
computational resources. To enhance real-time perception, we introduce a
Fine-grained Spatiotemporal Window, which captures detailed short-term visual
cues to improve current scene perception. Additionally, we present OnlineIT, an
instruction-tuning dataset tailored for streaming video tasks. OnlineIT
significantly boosts MLLM performance in both real-time perception and future
prediction. To evaluate generalization in practical applications, we introduce
ODV-Bench, a new benchmark focused on real-time streaming video understanding
in autonomous driving scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that
StreamForest achieves the state-of-the-art performance, with accuracies of
77.3% on StreamingBench, 60.5% on OVBench, and 55.6% on OVO-Bench. In
particular, even under extreme visual token compression (limited to 1024
tokens), the model retains 96.8% of its average accuracy in eight benchmarks
relative to the default setting. These results underscore the robustness,
efficiency, and generalizability of StreamForest for streaming video
understanding.

TL;DR: A novel diffusion model for satellite image generation that conditions on environmental context using three control signals: text, metadata, and visual data, with improved robustness to missing data and better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models for remote sensing have limitations including limited environmental context, poor handling of missing/corrupted data, and unreliable reflection of user intentions in generated outputs.

Method: Proposed diffusion model conditioned on environmental context using three control signals (text, metadata, visual data) with metadata fusion strategy to handle partial/corrupt observations and dynamic environmental conditions.

Result: Outperforms previous methods both qualitatively (robustness to missing metadata, higher responsiveness to control inputs) and quantitatively (higher fidelity, accuracy, quality measured using 6 metrics) in single-image and temporal generation trials.

Conclusion: Conditioning on environmental context improves foundation model performance for satellite imagery, making the model promising for downstream tasks. Also created the first public dataset combining three different data modalities.

Abstract: Diffusion-based foundation models have recently garnered much attention in
the field of generative modeling due to their ability to generate images of
high quality and fidelity. Although not straightforward, their recent
application to the field of remote sensing signaled the first successful trials
towards harnessing the large volume of publicly available datasets containing
multimodal information. Despite their success, existing methods face
considerable limitations: they rely on limited environmental context, struggle
with missing or corrupted data, and often fail to reliably reflect user
intentions in generated outputs. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion
model conditioned on environmental context, that is able to generate satellite
images by conditioning from any combination of three different control signals:
a) text, b) metadata, and c) visual data. In contrast to previous works, the
proposed method is i) to our knowledge, the first of its kind to condition
satellite image generation on dynamic environmental conditions as part of its
control signals, and ii) incorporating a metadata fusion strategy that models
attribute embedding interactions to account for partially corrupt and/or
missing observations. Our method outperforms previous methods both
qualitatively (robustness to missing metadata, higher responsiveness to control
inputs) and quantitatively (higher fidelity, accuracy, and quality of
generations measured using 6 different metrics) in the trials of single-image
and temporal generation. The reported results support our hypothesis that
conditioning on environmental context can improve the performance of foundation
models for satellite imagery, and render our model a promising candidate for
usage in downstream tasks. The collected 3-modal dataset is to our knowledge,
the first publicly-available dataset to combine data from these three different
mediums.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of synchronized and calibrated RGB-thermal image pairs presents a major obstacle for visual-thermal sensor fusion and cross-modality tasks, motivating the need for RGB-to-thermal image translation to synthesize thermal images from abundant RGB datasets.

Method: Proposed ThermalGen, an adaptive flow-based generative model with RGB image conditioning architecture and style-disentangled mechanism, trained on eight public RGB-T datasets plus three new large-scale satellite-aerial datasets captured across diverse conditions.

Result: Extensive evaluations show ThermalGen achieves comparable or superior translation performance compared to existing GAN-based and diffusion-based methods, capable of synthesizing thermal images with significant variations in viewpoints, sensor characteristics, and environmental conditions.

Conclusion: ThermalGen is the first RGB-T image translation model that can synthesize thermal images reflecting diverse real-world variations, addressing the critical data scarcity problem in RGB-thermal applications.

Abstract: Paired RGB-thermal data is crucial for visual-thermal sensor fusion and
cross-modality tasks, including important applications such as multi-modal
image alignment and retrieval. However, the scarcity of synchronized and
calibrated RGB-thermal image pairs presents a major obstacle to progress in
these areas. To overcome this challenge, RGB-to-Thermal (RGB-T) image
translation has emerged as a promising solution, enabling the synthesis of
thermal images from abundant RGB datasets for training purposes. In this study,
we propose ThermalGen, an adaptive flow-based generative model for RGB-T image
translation, incorporating an RGB image conditioning architecture and a
style-disentangled mechanism. To support large-scale training, we curated eight
public satellite-aerial, aerial, and ground RGB-T paired datasets, and
introduced three new large-scale satellite-aerial RGB-T datasets--DJI-day,
Bosonplus-day, and Bosonplus-night--captured across diverse times, sensor
types, and geographic regions. Extensive evaluations across multiple RGB-T
benchmarks demonstrate that ThermalGen achieves comparable or superior
translation performance compared to existing GAN-based and diffusion-based
methods. To our knowledge, ThermalGen is the first RGB-T image translation
model capable of synthesizing thermal images that reflect significant
variations in viewpoints, sensor characteristics, and environmental conditions.

TL;DR: The paper addresses vehicle type recognition with class imbalance by creating a balanced 16-class dataset and testing ensembles vs CNNs, finding CNNs perform better but rare classes remain challenging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Severe class imbalance in public datasets suppresses performance on rare vehicle categories, limiting intelligent transportation and logistics applications.

Method: Created a 16-class corpus (~47k images) from multiple sources, generated balanced variants using SMOTE and undersampling, and benchmarked lightweight ensembles (Random Forest, AdaBoost, soft-voting) against a configurable ResNet-style CNN with strong augmentation and label smoothing.

Result: Best ensemble achieved 74.8% test accuracy, while CNN achieved 79.19% on full test set and 81.25% on unseen inference batch. The most under-represented class (Barge) remained a failure mode despite rebalancing.

Conclusion: Deep models have advantage over ensembles, but rebalancing alone has limits. Future work should prioritize additional minority-class collection, cost-sensitive objectives like focal loss, and hybrid ensemble-CNN pipelines to combine interpretability with representational power.

Abstract: Accurate vehicle type recognition underpins intelligent transportation and
logistics, but severe class imbalance in public datasets suppresses performance
on rare categories. We curate a 16-class corpus (~47k images) by merging
Kaggle, ImageNet, and web-crawled data, and create six balanced variants via
SMOTE oversampling and targeted undersampling. Lightweight ensembles, such as
Random Forest, AdaBoost, and a soft-voting combiner built on MobileNet-V2
features are benchmarked against a configurable ResNet-style CNN trained with
strong augmentation and label smoothing. The best ensemble (SMOTE-combined)
attains 74.8% test accuracy, while the CNN achieves 79.19% on the full test set
and 81.25% on an unseen inference batch, confirming the advantage of deep
models. Nonetheless, the most under-represented class (Barge) remains a failure
mode, highlighting the limits of rebalancing alone. Results suggest
prioritizing additional minority-class collection and cost-sensitive objectives
(e.g., focal loss) and exploring hybrid ensemble or CNN pipelines to combine
interpretability with representational power.

TL;DR: MMRQA is a multimodal MRI quality assessment framework that combines MLLMs with signal processing to bridge quantitative metrics and semantic understanding for interpretable quality control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI quality assessment faces challenges from data scarcity and protocol variability. Traditional methods trade off quantitative metrics vs interpretability - signal-based methods lack semantic understanding while deep learning sacrifices interpretability.

Method: MMRQA integrates multimodal LLMs with acquisition-aware signal processing using three innovations: robust metric extraction with simulated artifacts, transformation of metrics into QA pairs using Qwen, and parameter-efficient fusion via LoRA of LLaVA-OneVision.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on MR-ART, FastMRI, and MyConnectome benchmarks with strong zero-shot generalization, validated by comprehensive ablation studies.

Conclusion: The framework bridges quantitative analysis with semantic reasoning to generate clinically interpretable outputs that enhance quality control in dynamic medical settings.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) quality assessment is crucial for clinical
decision-making, yet remains challenging due to data scarcity and protocol
variability. Traditional approaches face fundamental trade-offs: signal-based
methods like MRIQC provide quantitative metrics but lack semantic
understanding, while deep learning approaches achieve high accuracy but
sacrifice interpretability. To address these limitations, we introduce the
Multimodal MRI Quality Assessment (MMRQA) framework, pioneering the integration
of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with acquisition-aware signal
processing. MMRQA combines three key innovations: robust metric extraction via

### [307] [VAGUEGAN: Stealthy Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks on Image Generative Pipelines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24891)
*Mostafa Mohaimen Akand Faisal,Rabeya Amin Jhuma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VagueGAN is an attack pipeline that crafts stealthy triggers to cause targeted changes in generative model outputs, showing that poisoning can retain or enhance visual quality rather than reduce fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore adversarial attacks on generative pipelines where small perturbations lead to controlled output changes, which is less studied compared to attacks on discriminative models.

Method: Combines a modular perturbation network (PoisonerNet) with Generator-Discriminator pairs to create stealthy triggers, evaluated using custom metrics and perceptual/frequency analysis, with transferability tested on diffusion models via ControlNet.

Result: Poisoned outputs can display higher visual quality than clean counterparts, latent space poisoning retains/enhances aesthetics, and optimized perturbations produce consistent stealthy effects while remaining visually inconspicuous.

Conclusion: The method exposes blind spots in pixel-level defenses and raises concerns for image generation pipeline integrity, as carefully crafted perturbations can manipulate outputs without detection.

Abstract: Generative models such as GANs and diffusion models are widely used to
synthesize photorealistic images and to support downstream creative and editing
tasks. While adversarial attacks on discriminative models are well studied,
attacks targeting generative pipelines where small, stealthy perturbations in
inputs lead to controlled changes in outputs are less explored. This study
introduces VagueGAN, an attack pipeline combining a modular perturbation
network PoisonerNet with a Generator Discriminator pair to craft stealthy
triggers that cause targeted changes in generated images. Attack efficacy is
evaluated using a custom proxy metric, while stealth is analyzed through
perceptual and frequency domain measures. The transferability of the method to
a modern diffusion based pipeline is further examined through ControlNet guided
editing. Interestingly, the experiments show that poisoned outputs can display
higher visual quality compared to clean counterparts, challenging the
assumption that poisoning necessarily reduces fidelity. Unlike conventional
pixel level perturbations, latent space poisoning in GANs and diffusion
pipelines can retain or even enhance output aesthetics, exposing a blind spot
in pixel level defenses. Moreover, carefully optimized perturbations can
produce consistent, stealthy effects on generator outputs while remaining
visually inconspicuous, raising concerns for the integrity of image generation
pipelines.

*Yu Ma,Guoliang Wei,Yue Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DWGS enhances 3D Gaussian Splatting for sparse-view novel view synthesis by integrating depth estimation, virtual view generation, and occlusion-aware reconstruction to overcome overfitting and geometric distortion issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting suffers from floating artifacts and structural inconsistencies under sparse-input settings, which limits its effectiveness for novel view synthesis from sparse views.

Method: Proposes three key components: Hybrid-Loss Depth Estimation for multi-view consistency, Bidirectional Warping Virtual View Synthesis for geometric constraints, and Occlusion-Aware Reconstruction using depth-difference masks and learning-based inpainting.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on LLFF, Blender, and DTU benchmarks with up to 21.13 dB PSNR and 0.189 LPIPS, while maintaining real-time inference capabilities.

Conclusion: DWGS successfully addresses the limitations of 3DGS in sparse-view settings through integrated structural cues and virtual constraints, enabling high-quality novel view synthesis with real-time performance.

Abstract: Novel View Synthesis (NVS) from sparse views remains a core challenge in 3D
reconstruction, typically suffering from overfitting, geometric distortion, and
incomplete scene recovery due to limited multi-view constraints. Although 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time, high-fidelity rendering, it
suffers from floating artifacts and structural inconsistencies under
sparse-input settings. To address these issues, we propose DWGS, a novel
unified framework that enhances 3DGS for sparse-view synthesis by integrating
robust structural cues, virtual view constraints, and occluded region
completion. Our approach introduces three principal contributions: a
Hybrid-Loss Depth Estimation module that leverages dense matching priors with
reprojection, point propagation, and smoothness constraints to enforce
multi-view consistency; a Bidirectional Warping Virtual View Synthesis method
generates virtual training views to impose stronger geometric and photometric
constraints; and an Occlusion-Aware Reconstruction component that utilizes
depth-difference mask and a learning-based inpainting model to recover obscured
regions. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks (LLFF, Blender, and DTU)
show that DWGS achieves a new state-of-the-art, achieving up to 21.13 dB PSNR
and 0.189 LPIPS, while retaining real-time inference capabilities.

*Xi Chen,Hongxun Yao,Zhaopan Xu,Kui Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAM is a novel framework for source-free active domain adaptation that integrates multimodal supervision from Vision-and-Language models with sparse human annotations through bidirectional distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent domain adaptation studies use Vision-and-Language models but treat ViL-based and data supervision as separate sources without effective fusion, limiting their potential.

Method: DAM initializes stable ViL-guided targets and employs bidirectional distillation to enable mutual knowledge exchange between target model and dual supervisions during iterative adaptation.

Result: Extensive experiments show DAM consistently outperforms existing methods and sets new state-of-the-art across multiple SFADA benchmarks and active learning strategies.

Conclusion: The proposed DAM framework effectively integrates multimodal supervision with human annotations through dual supervisory signals and bidirectional distillation, achieving superior performance in source-free active domain adaptation.

Abstract: Source-free active domain adaptation (SFADA) enhances knowledge transfer from
a source model to an unlabeled target domain using limited manual labels
selected via active learning. While recent domain adaptation studies have
introduced Vision-and-Language (ViL) models to improve pseudo-label quality or
feature alignment, they often treat ViL-based and data supervision as separate
sources, lacking effective fusion. To overcome this limitation, we propose Dual
Active learning with Multimodal (DAM) foundation model, a novel framework that
integrates multimodal supervision from a ViL model to complement sparse human
annotations, thereby forming a dual supervisory signal. DAM initializes stable
ViL-guided targets and employs a bidirectional distillation mechanism to foster
mutual knowledge exchange between the target model and the dual supervisions
during iterative adaptation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAM
consistently outperforms existing methods and sets a new state-of-the-art
across multiple SFADA benchmarks and active learning strategies.

TL;DR: A deep learning framework for automated assessment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis that simultaneously predicts vertebral endplate angles and coordinates, enabling flexible detection of diverse scoliosis patterns without predefined curve assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional manual Cobb angle measurements for AIS suffer from significant observer variability, and existing automated methods use simplified spinal models that fail to address clinical complexity.

Method: Combines HRNet backbone with Swin-Transformer modules and biomechanically informed constraints for feature extraction, using SVD to analyze angle predictions directly from vertebral morphology without predefined curve assumptions.

Result: Achieved 83.45% diagnostic accuracy and 2.55° mean absolute error on 630 full-spine radiographs, with exceptional generalization on out-of-distribution cases. Introduced Vertebral Wedging Index (VWI) that showed significant prognostic correlation with curve progression.

Conclusion: The framework provides robust support for early AIS detection, personalized treatment planning, and progression monitoring, with VWI offering superior prognostic value compared to traditional Cobb angles.

Abstract: Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a common spinal deformity affecting
approximately 2.2% of boys and 4.8% of girls worldwide. The Cobb angle serves
as the gold standard for AIS severity assessment, yet traditional manual
measurements suffer from significant observer variability, compromising
diagnostic accuracy. Despite prior automation attempts, existing methods use
simplified spinal models and predetermined curve patterns that fail to address
clinical complexity. We present a novel deep learning framework for AIS
assessment that simultaneously predicts both superior and inferior endplate
angles with corresponding midpoint coordinates for each vertebra, preserving
the anatomical reality of vertebral wedging in progressive AIS. Our approach
combines an HRNet backbone with Swin-Transformer modules and biomechanically
informed constraints for enhanced feature extraction. We employ Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to analyze angle predictions directly from vertebral
morphology, enabling flexible detection of diverse scoliosis patterns without
predefined curve assumptions. Using 630 full-spine anteroposterior radiographs
from patients aged 10-18 years with rigorous dual-rater annotation, our method
achieved 83.45% diagnostic accuracy and 2.55{\deg} mean absolute error. The
framework demonstrates exceptional generalization capability on
out-of-distribution cases. Additionally, we introduce the Vertebral Wedging
Index (VWI), a novel metric quantifying vertebral deformation. Longitudinal
analysis revealed VWI's significant prognostic correlation with curve
progression while traditional Cobb angles showed no correlation, providing
robust support for early AIS detection, personalized treatment planning, and
progression monitoring.

TL;DR: Attention Surgery is an efficient framework for linearizing or hybridizing attention in pretrained video diffusion models without costly retraining, achieving up to 40% FLOPs reduction while maintaining generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based video diffusion models suffer from quadratic computational cost of self-attention, making long sequences and high resolutions computationally expensive. Linear attention offers sub-quadratic complexity but prior methods fail to match softmax attention expressiveness without expensive retraining.

Method: Combines hybrid attention mechanism (mixing softmax and linear tokens) with lightweight distillation and fine-tuning pipeline requiring only a few GPU-days. Incorporates cost-aware block-rate strategy to balance expressiveness and efficiency across layers.

Result: Applied to Wan2.1 1.3B VDM, achieves first competitive sub-quadratic attention video diffusion models, reducing attention cost by up to 40% in FLOPs while maintaining generation quality on VBench and VBench-2.0 benchmarks.

Conclusion: Attention Surgery successfully enables efficient linear/hybrid attention in pretrained VDMs without full retraining, providing significant computational savings while preserving video generation quality.

Abstract: Transformer-based video diffusion models (VDMs) deliver state-of-the-art
video generation quality but are constrained by the quadratic cost of
self-attention, making long sequences and high resolutions computationally
expensive. While linear attention offers sub-quadratic complexity, prior
attempts fail to match the expressiveness of softmax attention without costly
retraining. We introduce \textit{Attention Surgery}, an efficient framework for
\textit{linearizing} or \textit{hybridizing} attention in pretrained VDMs
without training from scratch. Inspired by recent advances in language models,
our method combines a novel hybrid attention mechanism-mixing softmax and
linear tokens-with a lightweight distillation and fine-tuning pipeline
requiring only a few GPU-days. Additionally, we incorporate a cost-aware
block-rate strategy to balance expressiveness and efficiency across layers.
Applied to Wan2.1 1.3B, a state-of-the-art DiT-based VDM, Attention Surgery

TL;DR: OpenGPT-4o-Image is a large-scale dataset for multimodal image generation/editing, featuring hierarchical taxonomy and automated generation of 80k instruction-image pairs across 11 domains, achieving up to 18% performance improvement on editing tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack systematic structure and challenging scenarios needed for real-world multimodal applications, constraining model performance.

Method: Combines hierarchical task taxonomy with automated data generation using structured resource pools and GPT-4o, covering 11 domains and 51 subtasks including scientific imagery and complex instruction editing.

Result: Fine-tuning on the dataset achieves significant gains: up to 18% improvement on editing tasks (UniWorld-V1 on ImgEdit-Bench) and 13% on generation tasks (Harmon on GenEval).

Conclusion: Systematic data construction is key to advancing multimodal AI capabilities, demonstrating that comprehensive training data quality directly impacts model performance.

Abstract: The performance of unified multimodal models for image generation and editing
is fundamentally constrained by the quality and comprehensiveness of their
training data. While existing datasets have covered basic tasks like style
transfer and simple object manipulation, they often lack the systematic
structure and challenging scenarios required for real-world applications. To
address this bottleneck, we introduce OpenGPT-4o-Image, a large-scale dataset
constructed using a novel methodology that combines hierarchical task taxonomy
with automated data generation. Our taxonomy not only includes fundamental
capabilities such as text rendering and style control but also introduces
highly practical yet challenging categories like scientific imagery for
chemistry illustrations and complex instruction editing requiring simultaneous
execution of multiple operations. Through an automated pipeline leveraging
structured resource pools and GPT-4o, we generate 80k high-quality
instruction-image pairs with controlled diversity, covering 11 major domains
and 51 subtasks. Extensive experiments show that fine-tuning leading models on
our dataset achieves significant performance gains across multiple benchmarks,
with improvements of up to 18\% on editing tasks (UniWorld-V1 on ImgEdit-Bench)
and 13% on generation tasks (Harmon on GenEval). Our work demonstrates that
systematic data construction is key to advancing multimodal AI capabilities.

TL;DR: SID is a goal-oriented language-guided navigation approach that uses self-improving demonstrations to enhance agent exploration capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance on navigation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing navigation methods rely heavily on shortest-path trajectories, lacking effective exploration priors for training agents to navigate to specified goals in unknown environments without step-by-step instructions.

Method: SID learns an initial agent on shortest-path data, then uses this agent to generate novel exploration trajectories. These rollouts provide demonstrations with stronger exploration strategies to train better agents, creating an iterative self-improving pipeline.

Result: SID significantly boosts exploration capabilities and generalization, achieving 50.9% success rate on SOON unseen validation splits (13.9% improvement over prior methods) and new state-of-the-art performance on REVERIE and SOON tasks.

Conclusion: The iterative self-improving pipeline readily scales to new environments and the resulting demonstrations can be transferred across various language-guided navigation tasks, elevating performance in diverse goal-oriented navigation tasks.

Abstract: Goal-oriented language-guided navigation requires robust exploration
capabilities for agents to navigate to specified goals in unknown environments
without step-by-step instructions. Existing methods tend to exclusively utilize
shortest-path trajectories, lacking effective exploration priors for training
navigation agents. To address the above challenges, we present SID, a
goal-oriented language-guided navigation learning approach with Self-Improving
Demonstrations. Specifically, SID learns an initial agent on the shortest-path
data sampled from environments and then leverages this agent to generate novel
exploration trajectories. The novel rollouts provide demonstrations with
stronger exploration strategies to train a better agent, which in turn produces
higher-quality agent demonstrations for the next round of training. We show
that this iterative self-improving pipeline readily scales to new environments,
and the resulting demonstrations can be transferred across a variety of
language-guided navigation tasks, elevating the performance ceiling in diverse
goal-oriented navigation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SID
significantly boosts the exploration capabilities and generalization of
navigation agents. The resulting agent achieves new state-of-the-art
performance on goal-oriented language-guided navigation tasks, including
REVERIE, SOON, notably achieving a 50.9% success rate on the unseen validation
splits of SOON, surpassing the prior leading approaches by a margin of 13.9%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Seg-CFT is a method for generating counterfactual medical images that enables structure-specific interventions without requiring pixel-level label maps, producing locally coherent counterfactuals for applications like disease modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current counterfactual image generation methods rely on external classifiers and are insufficient for structure-specific interventions, often causing undesirable global effects. Previous approaches required tedious pixel-level label maps.

Method: Segmentor-guided Counterfactual Fine-Tuning (Seg-CFT) preserves the simplicity of intervening on scalar-valued, structure-specific variables while generating locally coherent counterfactuals without needing hypothetical segmentations.

Result: The method demonstrates capability of generating realistic chest radiographs and shows promising results for modeling coronary artery disease.

Conclusion: Seg-CFT provides an effective approach for structure-specific counterfactual generation in medical imaging, overcoming limitations of previous methods that required pixel-level guidance.

Abstract: Counterfactual image generation is a powerful tool for augmenting training
data, de-biasing datasets, and modeling disease. Current approaches rely on
external classifiers or regressors to increase the effectiveness of
subject-level interventions (e.g., changing the patient's age). For
structure-specific interventions (e.g., changing the area of the left lung in a
chest radiograph), we show that this is insufficient, and can result in
undesirable global effects across the image domain. Previous work used
pixel-level label maps as guidance, requiring a user to provide hypothetical
segmentations which are tedious and difficult to obtain. We propose
Segmentor-guided Counterfactual Fine-Tuning (Seg-CFT), which preserves the
simplicity of intervening on scalar-valued, structure-specific variables while
producing locally coherent and effective counterfactuals. We demonstrate the
capability of generating realistic chest radiographs, and we show promising
results for modeling coronary artery disease. Code:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore scalability principles for GANs, which have been effective in other generative models but remain underexplored in adversarial learning.

Method: Training GANs in compact VAE latent space with transformer-based generators/discriminators, plus lightweight intermediate supervision and width-aware learning rate adjustment to address scaling issues.

Result: GAT-XL/2 achieves FID of 2.96 on ImageNet-256 in just 40 epochs, 6x faster than baselines, with reliable training across various model capacities.

Conclusion: GANs can be effectively scaled using latent space training and transformer architectures with proper scaling solutions, achieving state-of-the-art performance efficiently.

Abstract: Scalability has driven recent advances in generative modeling, yet its
principles remain underexplored for adversarial learning. We investigate the
scalability of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) through two design
choices that have proven to be effective in other types of generative models:
training in a compact Variational Autoencoder latent space and adopting purely
transformer-based generators and discriminators. Training in latent space
enables efficient computation while preserving perceptual fidelity, and this
efficiency pairs naturally with plain transformers, whose performance scales
with computational budget. Building on these choices, we analyze failure modes
that emerge when naively scaling GANs. Specifically, we find issues as
underutilization of early layers in the generator and optimization instability
as the network scales. Accordingly, we provide simple and scale-friendly
solutions as lightweight intermediate supervision and width-aware learning-rate
adjustment. Our experiments show that GAT, a purely transformer-based and
latent-space GANs, can be easily trained reliably across a wide range of
capacities (S through XL). Moreover, GAT-XL/2 achieves state-of-the-art
single-step, class-conditional generation performance (FID of 2.96) on
ImageNet-256 in just 40 epochs, 6x fewer epochs than strong baselines.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long videos have temporal complexity and sparse task-relevant information, making it challenging for AI systems to achieve both completeness and efficiency in understanding.

Method: Uses an interactive loop between Multi-Granular Perception Agent (MGPA) for capturing task-related information and Verification-Enhanced Reflection Agent (VERA) for verification and strategy optimization.

Result: Achieves superior accuracy and efficiency on EgoSchema, Video-MME, NExT-QA, and MovieChat datasets. On EgoSchema, surpasses training-free methods using only 11.2 frames and matches Gemini 1.5-Pro performance.

Conclusion: The interactive perception-verification loop enables efficient and reliable long video understanding by exploring minimal informative task-related clues.

Abstract: Long videos, characterized by temporal complexity and sparse task-relevant
information, pose significant reasoning challenges for AI systems. Although
various Large Language Model (LLM)-based approaches have advanced long video
understanding, they still struggle to achieve both completeness and efficiency
in capturing task-critical information. Inspired by human progressive visual
cognition, we propose CogniGPT, a framework that leverages an interactive loop
between Multi-Granular Perception Agent (MGPA) and Verification-Enhanced
Reflection Agent (VERA) for efficient and reliable long video understanding.
Specifically, MGPA mimics human visual divergent and focused attention to
capture task-related information, while VERA verifies perceived key clues to
mitigate hallucination and optimize subsequent perception strategies. Through
this interactive process, CogniGPT explores a minimal set of informative and
reliable task-related clues. Extensive experiments on EgoSchema, Video-MME,
NExT-QA, and MovieChat datasets demonstrate CogniGPT's superiority in both
accuracy and efficiency. Notably, on EgoSchema, it surpasses existing
training-free methods using only 11.2 frames and achieves performance
comparable to Gemini 1.5-Pro.

Motivation: Improve confidence estimation in deep learning for medical imaging to prevent overconfident misclassifications that could have serious consequences in high-stakes fields.

Method: Developed custom CNN trained on merged brain MRI dataset, introduced 5 types of image noise (Gaussian, Poisson, Salt & Pepper, Speckle, Uniform), applied Temperature Scaling as post-hoc calibration technique.

Result: TS significantly reduced Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) under all noise conditions without degrading classification accuracy.

Conclusion: Temperature Scaling is an effective and computationally efficient approach to enhance decision confidence of medical AI systems, making model outputs more reliable in noisy or uncertain settings.

Abstract: Precise confidence estimation in deep learning is vital for high-stakes
fields like medical imaging, where overconfident misclassifications can have
serious consequences. This work evaluates the effectiveness of Temperature
Scaling (TS), a post-hoc calibration technique, in improving the reliability of
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for brain tumor classification. We develop
a custom CNN and train it on a merged brain MRI dataset. To simulate real-world
uncertainty, five types of image noise are introduced: Gaussian, Poisson, Salt
& Pepper, Speckle, and Uniform. Model performance is evaluated using precision,
recall, F1-score, accuracy, negative log-likelihood (NLL), and expected
calibration error (ECE), both before and after calibration. Results demonstrate
that TS significantly reduces ECE and NLL under all noise conditions without
degrading classification accuracy. This underscores TS as an effective and
computationally efficient approach to enhance decision confidence of medical AI
systems, hence making model outputs more reliable in noisy or uncertain
settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D Scene Graph approaches ignore humans and lack annotated human-environment relationships, limiting robots' ability to understand social interactions and context-aware behaviors.

Method: Introduce Social 3D Scene Graphs that capture humans, attributes, activities, and local/remote relationships in environments using open-vocabulary framework, and create a new benchmark with synthetic environments and comprehensive human-scene relationship annotations.

Result: The representation improves human activity prediction and reasoning about human-environment relations, demonstrating enhanced social scene understanding capabilities.

Conclusion: Social 3D Scene Graphs pave the way toward socially intelligent robots by enabling better understanding of human interactions and relationships in 3D environments.

Abstract: Understanding how people interact with their surroundings and each other is
essential for enabling robots to act in socially compliant and context-aware
ways. While 3D Scene Graphs have emerged as a powerful semantic representation
for scene understanding, existing approaches largely ignore humans in the
scene, also due to the lack of annotated human-environment relationships.
Moreover, existing methods typically capture only open-vocabulary relations
from single image frames, which limits their ability to model long-range
interactions beyond the observed content. We introduce Social 3D Scene Graphs,
an augmented 3D Scene Graph representation that captures humans, their
attributes, activities and relationships in the environment, both local and
remote, using an open-vocabulary framework. Furthermore, we introduce a new
benchmark consisting of synthetic environments with comprehensive human-scene
relationship annotations and diverse types of queries for evaluating social
scene understanding in 3D. The experiments demonstrate that our representation
improves human activity prediction and reasoning about human-environment
relations, paving the way toward socially intelligent robots.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework using cross-modal fusion attention and self-supervised multi-event representation learning for event-based facial keypoint alignment, achieving state-of-the-art performance on real and synthetic event datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras offer advantages for facial keypoint alignment in challenging conditions like low light and rapid motion, but existing RGB methods perform poorly on event data, and training solely on event data leads to suboptimal performance due to limited spatial information and lack of comprehensive labeled datasets.

Method: Proposes cross-modal fusion attention (CMFA) to integrate RGB data for guiding robust facial feature extraction from event inputs, and self-supervised multi-event representation learning (SSMER) for effective feature learning from unlabeled event data to overcome spatial limitations.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-event E-SIE dataset and synthetic-event WFLW-V benchmark show the approach consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the limitations of event-based facial keypoint alignment by leveraging cross-modal guidance and self-supervised learning, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Event cameras offer unique advantages for facial keypoint alignment under
challenging conditions, such as low light and rapid motion, due to their high
temporal resolution and robustness to varying illumination. However, existing
RGB facial keypoint alignment methods do not perform well on event data, and
training solely on event data often leads to suboptimal performance because of
its limited spatial information. Moreover, the lack of comprehensive labeled
event datasets further hinders progress in this area. To address these issues,
we propose a novel framework based on cross-modal fusion attention (CMFA) and
self-supervised multi-event representation learning (SSMER) for event-based
facial keypoint alignment. Our framework employs CMFA to integrate
corresponding RGB data, guiding the model to extract robust facial features
from event input images. In parallel, SSMER enables effective feature learning
from unlabeled event data, overcoming spatial limitations. Extensive
experiments on our real-event E-SIE dataset and a synthetic-event version of
the public WFLW-V benchmark show that our approach consistently surpasses
state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: Proposed on-the-fly augmentation using pretrained GliGANs to insert synthetic tumors during training for robust glioma segmentation across pre- and post-treatment scans, achieving top performance in BraTS 2025 Task 1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robust segmentation across treatment timelines requires generalized models, but limited annotated data and computational costs of storing augmented 3D data are challenges.

Method: On-the-fly augmentation strategy using pretrained GliGANs to dynamically insert synthetic tumors during training, evaluated with three nnU-Net-based models and their ensembles.

Result: Ensemble achieved lesion-wise Dice scores: 0.79 (ET), 0.749 (NETC), 0.872 (RC), 0.825 (SNFH), 0.79 (TC), 0.88 (WT) on BraTS 2025 validation, ranking first in the challenge.

Conclusion: The proposed on-the-fly augmentation with GliGANs effectively addresses data limitations and computational constraints, enabling robust glioma segmentation across treatment timelines.

Abstract: Robust segmentation across both pre-treatment and post-treatment glioma scans
can be helpful for consistent tumor monitoring and treatment planning. BraTS
2025 Task 1 addresses this by challenging models to generalize across varying
tumor appearances throughout the treatment timeline. However, training such
generalized models requires access to diverse, high-quality annotated data,
which is often limited. While data augmentation can alleviate this, storing
large volumes of augmented 3D data is computationally expensive. To address
these challenges, we propose an on-the-fly augmentation strategy that
dynamically inserts synthetic tumors using pretrained generative adversarial
networks (GliGANs) during training. We evaluate three nnU-Net-based models and
their ensembles: (1) a baseline without external augmentation, (2) a regular

*Haotian Dong,Wenjing Wang,Chen Li,Di Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Wan-Alpha is a framework for generating transparent RGBA videos with superior visual quality by jointly learning RGB and alpha channels using a VAE and diffusion transformer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RGBA video generation methods often neglect visual quality, limiting their practical usability for applications requiring transparency.

Method: Proposed a variational autoencoder that encodes alpha channel into RGB latent space, and trained a diffusion transformer on a newly constructed high-quality RGBA video dataset.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance in visual quality, motion realism, and transparency rendering compared to state-of-the-art methods. Can generate semi-transparent objects, glowing effects, and fine details like hair strands.

Conclusion: Wan-Alpha successfully addresses the visual quality limitations in RGBA video generation and provides a practical solution for generating high-quality transparent videos.

Abstract: RGBA video generation, which includes an alpha channel to represent
transparency, is gaining increasing attention across a wide range of
applications. However, existing methods often neglect visual quality, limiting
their practical usability. In this paper, we propose \textit{Wan-Alpha}, a new
framework that generates transparent videos by learning both RGB and alpha
channels jointly. We design an effective variational autoencoder (VAE) that
encodes the alpha channel into the RGB latent space. Then, to support the
training of our diffusion transformer, we construct a high-quality and diverse
RGBA video dataset. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our model
demonstrates superior performance in visual quality, motion realism, and
transparency rendering. Notably, our model can generate a wide variety of
semi-transparent objects, glowing effects, and fine-grained details such as
hair strands. The released model is available on our website:

### [322] [SDPose: Exploiting Diffusion Priors for Out-of-Domain and Robust Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24980)
*Shuang Liang,Jing He,Chuanmeizhi Wang,Lejun Liao,Guo Zhang,Yingcong Chen,Yuan Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SDPose is a fine-tuning framework that adapts Stable Diffusion for human pose estimation by predicting keypoint heatmaps in the latent space, using a lightweight pose head, and incorporating RGB reconstruction for robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of pre-trained diffusion models for structured outputs like human pose estimation, which remains underexplored compared to dense prediction tasks.

Method: Directly predict keypoint heatmaps in SD U-Net's latent space, use lightweight convolutional pose head, and include auxiliary RGB reconstruction branch for domain robustness.

Result: Achieves parity with Sapiens-1B/2B on COCO with only 1/5 training time, sets new SOTA on cross-domain benchmarks HumanArt and COCO-OOD, and works as zero-shot pose annotator for controllable generation.

Conclusion: SDPose effectively leverages diffusion priors for human pose estimation with strong cross-domain generalization and practical applications in controllable generation.

Abstract: Pre-trained diffusion models provide rich multi-scale latent features and are
emerging as powerful vision backbones. While recent works such as
Marigold~\citep{ke2024repurposing} and Lotus~\citep{he2024lotus} adapt
diffusion priors for dense prediction with strong cross-domain generalization,
their potential for structured outputs (e.g., human pose estimation) remains
underexplored. In this paper, we propose \textbf{SDPose}, a fine-tuning
framework built upon Stable Diffusion to fully exploit pre-trained diffusion
priors for human pose estimation. First, rather than modifying cross-attention
modules or introducing learnable embeddings, we directly predict keypoint
heatmaps in the SD U-Net's image latent space to preserve the original
generative priors. Second, we map these latent features into keypoint heatmaps
through a lightweight convolutional pose head, which avoids disrupting the
pre-trained backbone. Finally, to prevent overfitting and enhance
out-of-distribution robustness, we incorporate an auxiliary RGB reconstruction
branch that preserves domain-transferable generative semantics. To evaluate
robustness under domain shift, we further construct \textbf{COCO-OOD}, a
style-transferred variant of COCO with preserved annotations. With just
one-fifth of the training schedule used by Sapiens on COCO, SDPose attains
parity with Sapiens-1B/2B on the COCO validation set and establishes a new
state of the art on the cross-domain benchmarks HumanArt and COCO-OOD.
Furthermore, we showcase SDPose as a zero-shot pose annotator for downstream
controllable generation tasks, including ControlNet-based image synthesis and
video generation, where it delivers qualitatively superior pose guidance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PanoWorld-X is a framework for high-fidelity, controllable panoramic video generation with diverse camera trajectories, addressing limitations of narrow field-of-view and insufficient camera controllability in prior works.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable complete and explorable 360-degree visual worlds for downstream applications, overcoming constraints of narrow field-of-view and limited camera controllability in existing methods.

Method: Constructed a large-scale dataset of panoramic video-exploration route pairs using Unreal Engine simulations, and introduced a Sphere-Aware Diffusion Transformer that reprojects equirectangular features onto spherical surfaces to model geometric adjacency.

Result: Extensive experiments show superior performance in motion range, control precision, and visual quality compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: PanoWorld-X demonstrates strong potential for real-world applications in panoramic video generation with enhanced controllability and visual fidelity.

Abstract: Generating a complete and explorable 360-degree visual world enables a wide
range of downstream applications. While prior works have advanced the field,
they remain constrained by either narrow field-of-view limitations, which
hinder the synthesis of continuous and holistic scenes, or insufficient camera
controllability that restricts free exploration by users or autonomous agents.
To address this, we propose PanoWorld-X, a novel framework for high-fidelity
and controllable panoramic video generation with diverse camera trajectories.
Specifically, we first construct a large-scale dataset of panoramic
video-exploration route pairs by simulating camera trajectories in virtual 3D
environments via Unreal Engine. As the spherical geometry of panoramic data
misaligns with the inductive priors from conventional video diffusion, we then
introduce a Sphere-Aware Diffusion Transformer architecture that reprojects
equirectangular features onto the spherical surface to model geometric
adjacency in latent space, significantly enhancing visual fidelity and
spatiotemporal continuity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
PanoWorld-X achieves superior performance in various aspects, including motion
range, control precision, and visual quality, underscoring its potential for
real-world applications.

*Tooba Imtiaz,Lucy Chai,Kathryn Heal,Xuan Luo,Jungyeon Park,Jennifer Dy,John Flynn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LVT is a transformer-based architecture for large-scale 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis that avoids quadratic attention complexity by processing only local view neighborhoods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard transformers have quadratic complexity that limits scalability to large scenes. Spatially nearby views provide more useful local scene information than distant views.

Method: Processes information in local neighborhoods around each view using novel positional encoding based on relative geometric transformations between query and nearby views. Decodes output into 3D Gaussian Splat representation with color and opacity view-dependence.

Result: Enables reconstruction of arbitrarily large, high-resolution scenes in a single forward pass.

Conclusion: LVT successfully addresses scalability limitations of standard transformers for 3D vision tasks while maintaining high-quality scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis capabilities.

Abstract: Large transformer models are proving to be a powerful tool for 3D vision and
novel view synthesis. However, the standard Transformer's well-known quadratic
complexity makes it difficult to scale these methods to large scenes. To
address this challenge, we propose the Local View Transformer (LVT), a
large-scale scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis architecture that
circumvents the need for the quadratic attention operation. Motivated by the
insight that spatially nearby views provide more useful signal about the local
scene composition than distant views, our model processes all information in a
local neighborhood around each view. To attend to tokens in nearby views, we
leverage a novel positional encoding that conditions on the relative geometric
transformation between the query and nearby views. We decode the output of our
model into a 3D Gaussian Splat scene representation that includes both color
and opacity view-dependence. Taken together, the Local View Transformer enables
reconstruction of arbitrarily large, high-resolution scenes in a single forward
pass. See our project page for results and interactive demos

*Max Curie,Paulo da Costa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLASP is a lightweight unsupervised image segmentation framework that uses self-supervised ViT features, spectral clustering, and automatic segment selection without any training or labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a simple, training-free solution for image segmentation that can handle large unannotated datasets, particularly useful for digital advertising and marketing workflows like brand safety screening and content moderation.

Method: Extracts patch features using DINO ViT encoder, builds affinity matrix, applies spectral clustering, automatically selects segment count via eigengap silhouette search, and sharpens boundaries with DenseCRF.

Result: Achieves competitive mIoU and pixel accuracy on COCO Stuff and ADE20K, matching recent unsupervised baselines despite being training-free.

Conclusion: CLASP provides a strong, easily reproducible baseline for unsupervised image segmentation that works well on large unannotated datasets without requiring training or labeled data.

Abstract: We introduce CLASP (Clustering via Adaptive Spectral Processing), a
lightweight framework for unsupervised image segmentation that operates without
any labeled data or finetuning. CLASP first extracts per patch features using a
self supervised ViT encoder (DINO); then, it builds an affinity matrix and
applies spectral clustering. To avoid manual tuning, we select the segment
count automatically with a eigengap silhouette search, and we sharpen the
boundaries with a fully connected DenseCRF. Despite its simplicity and training
free nature, CLASP attains competitive mIoU and pixel accuracy on COCO Stuff
and ADE20K, matching recent unsupervised baselines. The zero training design
makes CLASP a strong, easily reproducible baseline for large unannotated
corpora especially common in digital advertising and marketing workflows such
as brand safety screening, creative asset curation, and social media content
moderation

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning has shown strong reasoning in natural images but remains unexplored for Earth Observation, which has unique challenges like object detection, captioning, and change detection that require task-aware reasoning.

Method: Proposed a novel post-training framework incorporating task-aware rewards to adapt reasoning-based RL models to diverse EO tasks, enhancing reasoning for remote sensing images and stabilizing optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple EO benchmarks show consistent performance gains over state-of-the-art generic and specialized vision language models.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enhances reasoning capabilities for remote sensing images, improves robustness, and delivers better performance on Earth Observation tasks compared to existing models.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have delivered strong
reasoning capabilities in natural image domains, yet their potential for Earth
Observation (EO) remains largely unexplored. EO tasks introduce unique
challenges, spanning referred object detection, image or region captioning,
change detection, grounding, and temporal analysis, that demand task aware
reasoning. We propose a novel post training framework that incorporates task
aware rewards to enable effective adaptation of reasoning based RL models to
diverse EO tasks. This training strategy enhances reasoning capabilities for

*Xiaoxiao Ma,Haibo Qiu,Guohui Zhang,Zhixiong Zeng,Siqi Yang,Lin Ma,Feng Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STAGE is a stable reinforcement learning framework for autoregressive image generation that addresses gradient conflicts and entropy instability in GRPO algorithms through advantage/KL reweighting and entropy rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GRPO algorithms struggle with autoregressive image models due to training instability that disrupts pretrained capabilities, leading to marginal gains, degraded quality, and poor generalization.

Method: STAGE introduces two solutions: 1) Advantage/KL reweighting with similarity-aware reweighting to alleviate conflicting gradient updates, and 2) Entropy reward based on reference model to stabilize learning dynamics.

Result: Experiments show STAGE consistently improves visual quality, stability, and cross-task generalization compared to baseline GRPO across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework successfully reduces disruption of pretrained distributions and mitigates reward hacking, leading to better generalization and transfer to other benchmarks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has recently been explored to improve text-to-image
generation, yet applying existing GRPO algorithms to autoregressive (AR) image
models remains challenging. The instability of the training process easily
disrupts the pretrained model capability during long runs, resulting in
marginal gains, degraded image quality, and poor generalization. In this work,
we revisit GRPO for AR image generation and identify two key issues:
contradictory gradients from unnecessary tokens and unstable policy entropy
dynamics. To address these, we introduce STAGE, a stable and generalizable
framework that leverages two targeted solutions: 1) Advantage/KL reweighting.
Similarity-aware reweighting to alleviate conflicting updates; and 2) Entropy
reward. An entropy-based reward corresponding to reference model to stabilize
learning. With the help of alleviating conflicts between tokens and an entropy
reward for stabilizing training, we reduce disruption of the pretrained
distribution and mitigate reward hacking, which in turn improves generalization
and transfer better to other benchmarks. Experiments across multiple benchmarks
show that STAGE consistently improves visual quality, stability, and cross-task
generalization compared to baseline GRPO.

### [328] [VT-FSL: Bridging Vision and Text with LLMs for Few-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25033)
*Wenhao Li,Qiangchang Wang,Xianjing Meng,Zhibin Wu,Yilong Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VT-FSL is a novel few-shot learning framework that bridges vision and text using LLMs, achieving SOTA performance across 10 benchmarks through cross-modal iterative prompting and geometric alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FSL methods suffer from hallucinating semantics that contradict visual evidence due to lack of grounding in actual instances, resulting in noisy guidance and costly corrections.

Method: Uses Cross-modal Iterative Prompting (CIP) to generate precise class descriptions from LLMs conditioned on class names and support images, and Cross-modal Geometric Alignment (CGA) to align fused textual, support, and synthetic visual representations by minimizing kernelized volume.

Result: Establishes new state-of-the-art performance across ten diverse benchmarks including standard, cross-domain, and fine-grained few-shot learning scenarios.

Conclusion: VT-FSL effectively integrates LLMs with visual data through structured cross-modal prompting and geometric alignment, providing comprehensive semantic understanding and intra-class diversity for few-shot learning.

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to recognize novel concepts from only a few
labeled support samples. Recent studies enhance support features by
incorporating additional semantic information or designing complex semantic
fusion modules. However, they still suffer from hallucinating semantics that
contradict the visual evidence due to the lack of grounding in actual
instances, resulting in noisy guidance and costly corrections. To address these
issues, we propose a novel framework, bridging Vision and Text with LLMs for
Few-Shot Learning (VT-FSL), which constructs precise cross-modal prompts
conditioned on Large Language Models (LLMs) and support images, seamlessly
integrating them through a geometry-aware alignment. It mainly consists of
Cross-modal Iterative Prompting (CIP) and Cross-modal Geometric Alignment
(CGA). Specifically, the CIP conditions an LLM on both class names and support
images to generate precise class descriptions iteratively in a single
structured reasoning pass. These descriptions not only enrich the semantic
understanding of novel classes but also enable the zero-shot synthesis of
semantically consistent images. The descriptions and synthetic images act
respectively as complementary textual and visual prompts, providing high-level
class semantics and low-level intra-class diversity to compensate for limited
support data. Furthermore, the CGA jointly aligns the fused textual, support,
and synthetic visual representations by minimizing the kernelized volume of the
3-dimensional parallelotope they span. It captures global and nonlinear
relationships among all representations, enabling structured and consistent
multimodal integration. The proposed VT-FSL method establishes new
state-of-the-art performance across ten diverse benchmarks, including standard,
cross-domain, and fine-grained few-shot learning scenarios. Code is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image registration algorithms haven't scaled with image acquisition capabilities, creating bottlenecks in biomedical and life sciences where large datasets need processing.

Method: Uses IO-aware non-GEMM fused kernels with distributed framework, complements model parallelism by optimizing non-GEMM bottlenecks and enabling convolution-aware tensor sharding.

Result: Accelerates existing registration pipelines by 6-7x, reduces memory consumption by 20-59%, fits 64x larger problems on single GPU compared to SOTA, processes 100 micron brain MRI at native resolution.

Conclusion: FFDP enables unprecedented scale in image registration with significant performance and efficiency gains over existing methods.

Abstract: In this work, we propose FFDP, a set of IO-aware non-GEMM fused kernels
supplemented with a distributed framework for image registration at
unprecedented scales. Image registration is an inverse problem fundamental to
biomedical and life sciences, but algorithms have not scaled in tandem with
image acquisition capabilities. Our framework complements existing model
parallelism techniques proposed for large-scale transformer training by
optimizing non-GEMM bottlenecks and enabling convolution-aware tensor sharding.
We demonstrate unprecedented capabilities by performing multimodal registration
of a 100 micron ex-vivo human brain MRI volume at native resolution - an
inverse problem more than 570x larger than a standard clinical datum in about a
minute using only 8 A6000 GPUs. FFDP accelerates existing state-of-the-art
optimization and deep learning registration pipelines by upto 6 - 7x while
reducing peak memory consumption by 20 - 59%. Comparative analysis on a 250
micron dataset shows that FFDP can fit upto 64x larger problems than existing
SOTA on a single GPU, and highlights both the performance and efficiency gains
of FFDP compared to SOTA image registration methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GEM introduces a cryo-EM reconstruction framework using 3D Gaussian Splatting that achieves faster training, lower memory usage, and improved resolution compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional cryo-EM reconstruction methods are computationally expensive and memory intensive for large datasets, while neural radiance field approaches improve accuracy but have cubic memory/computation overhead.

Method: GEM represents proteins with compact 3D Gaussians (11 parameters each) and uses a novel gradient computation to efficiently train only Gaussians contributing to each voxel, operating directly in real-space.

Result: GEM achieves up to 48% faster training, 12% lower memory usage, and improves local resolution by up to 38.8% compared to state-of-the-art methods on standard cryo-EM benchmarks.

Conclusion: GEM establishes a practical and scalable paradigm for cryo-EM reconstruction that unifies speed, efficiency, and high-resolution accuracy.

Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has become a central tool for
high-resolution structural biology, yet the massive scale of datasets (often
exceeding 100k particle images) renders 3D reconstruction both computationally
expensive and memory intensive. Traditional Fourier-space methods are efficient
but lose fidelity due to repeated transforms, while recent real-space
approaches based on neural radiance fields (NeRFs) improve accuracy but incur
cubic memory and computation overhead. Therefore, we introduce GEM, a novel
cryo-EM reconstruction framework built on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that
operates directly in real-space while maintaining high efficiency. Instead of
modeling the entire density volume, GEM represents proteins with compact 3D
Gaussians, each parameterized by only 11 values. To further improve the
training efficiency, we designed a novel gradient computation to 3D Gaussians
that contribute to each voxel. This design substantially reduced both memory
footprint and training cost. On standard cryo-EM benchmarks, GEM achieves up to
48% faster training and 12% lower memory usage compared to state-of-the-art
methods, while improving local resolution by as much as 38.8%. These results
establish GEM as a practical and scalable paradigm for cryo-EM reconstruction,
unifying speed, efficiency, and high-resolution accuracy. Our code is available

Conclusion: The innovative data generation and training paradigm fosters general and robust depth features, advancing monocular depth estimation capabilities.

Abstract: Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is a foundational task for computer vision.
Traditional methods are limited by data scarcity and quality, hindering their
robustness. To overcome this, we propose BRIDGE, an RL-optimized depth-to-image

to achieve breakthroughs in scale and domain diversity, consistently

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniLat3D is a unified single-stage 3D asset generation framework that encodes both geometry and appearance in a single latent space, eliminating the misalignment and inefficiency issues of traditional two-stage approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional two-stage 3D generation pipelines (geometry first, then appearance) suffer from geometry-texture misalignment and high computational costs, motivating the need for a unified approach.

Method: Developed a geometry-appearance Unified VAE that compresses high-resolution sparse features into a compact latent representation (UniLat), then trained a single flow-matching model to generate UniLat directly from Gaussian noise.

Result: UniLat3D produces high-quality 3D assets in seconds from a single image, achieving superior appearance fidelity and geometric quality compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: The unified single-stage approach successfully addresses the limitations of decoupled 3D generation pipelines, enabling efficient and high-fidelity 3D asset creation.

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D asset generation is crucial for various industries. While
recent 3D pretrained models show strong capability in producing realistic
content, most are built upon diffusion models and follow a two-stage pipeline
that first generates geometry and then synthesizes appearance. Such a decoupled
design tends to produce geometry-texture misalignment and non-negligible cost.
In this paper, we propose UniLat3D, a unified framework that encodes geometry
and appearance in a single latent space, enabling direct single-stage
generation. Our key contribution is a geometry-appearance Unified VAE, which
compresses high-resolution sparse features into a compact latent representation
-- UniLat. UniLat integrates structural and visual information into a dense
low-resolution latent, which can be efficiently decoded into diverse 3D
formats, e.g., 3D Gaussians and meshes. Based on this unified representation,
we train a single flow-matching model to map Gaussian noise directly into
UniLat, eliminating redundant stages. Trained solely on public datasets,
UniLat3D produces high-quality 3D assets in seconds from a single image,
achieving superior appearance fidelity and geometric quality. More demos \&

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MANI-Pure is a magnitude-adaptive adversarial purification framework that uses frequency-targeted noise injection instead of uniform noise, achieving state-of-the-art robust accuracy while preserving clean accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial purification methods use uniform noise injection that corrupts semantic structures. The authors discovered that adversarial perturbations are concentrated in high-frequency regions with heterogeneous patterns, motivating a more targeted approach.

Method: MANI-Pure leverages the magnitude spectrum of inputs to guide purification. It adaptively applies heterogeneous, frequency-targeted noise that suppresses adversarial perturbations in fragile high-frequency, low-magnitude bands while preserving critical low-frequency content.

Result: On CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1K, MANI-Pure narrows the clean accuracy gap to within 0.59 of the original classifier, boosts robust accuracy by 2.15, and achieves top-1 robust accuracy on RobustBench leaderboard, surpassing previous state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: Magnitude-adaptive purification with frequency-targeted noise injection is an effective defense strategy that significantly improves robust accuracy while maintaining clean accuracy, outperforming uniform noise approaches.

Abstract: Adversarial purification with diffusion models has emerged as a promising
defense strategy, but existing methods typically rely on uniform noise
injection, which indiscriminately perturbs all frequencies, corrupting semantic
structures and undermining robustness. Our empirical study reveals that
adversarial perturbations are not uniformly distributed: they are predominantly
concentrated in high-frequency regions, with heterogeneous magnitude intensity
patterns that vary across frequencies and attack types. Motivated by this
observation, we introduce MANI-Pure, a magnitude-adaptive purification
framework that leverages the magnitude spectrum of inputs to guide the
purification process. Instead of injecting homogeneous noise, MANI-Pure
adaptively applies heterogeneous, frequency-targeted noise, effectively
suppressing adversarial perturbations in fragile high-frequency, low-magnitude
bands while preserving semantically critical low-frequency content. Extensive
experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1K validate the effectiveness of
MANI-Pure. It narrows the clean accuracy gap to within 0.59 of the original
classifier, while boosting robust accuracy by 2.15, and achieves the top-1
robust accuracy on the RobustBench leaderboard, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting methods are incompatible with mesh-based pipelines used in VR and graphics applications, and conversion solutions increase complexity and degrade quality.

Method: Directly optimize triangles with shared vertices in differentiable splatting framework, using opaque triangle training strategy to produce immediately usable meshes.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Mip-NeRF360 and Tanks & Temples datasets, surpassing prior splatting approaches in visual fidelity while remaining efficient.

Conclusion: The method produces semi-connected meshes that support downstream applications like physics simulation and interactive walkthroughs without post-processing.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D scenes and synthesizing novel views has seen rapid progress
in recent years. Neural Radiance Fields demonstrated that continuous volumetric
radiance fields can achieve high-quality image synthesis, but their long
training and rendering times limit practicality. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
addressed these issues by representing scenes with millions of Gaussians,
enabling real-time rendering and fast optimization. However, Gaussian
primitives are not natively compatible with the mesh-based pipelines used in VR
headsets, and real-time graphics applications. Existing solutions attempt to
convert Gaussians into meshes through post-processing or two-stage pipelines,
which increases complexity and degrades visual quality. In this work, we
introduce Triangle Splatting+, which directly optimizes triangles, the
fundamental primitive of computer graphics, within a differentiable splatting
framework. We formulate triangle parametrization to enable connectivity through
shared vertices, and we design a training strategy that enforces opaque
triangles. The final output is immediately usable in standard graphics engines
without post-processing. Experiments on the Mip-NeRF360 and Tanks & Temples
datasets show that Triangle Splatting+achieves state-of-the-art performance in
mesh-based novel view synthesis. Our method surpasses prior splatting
approaches in visual fidelity while remaining efficient and fast to training.
Moreover, the resulting semi-connected meshes support downstream applications
such as physics-based simulation or interactive walkthroughs. The project page

### [336] [Score Distillation of Flow Matching Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25127)
*Mingyuan Zhou,Yi Gu,Huangjie Zheng,Liangchen Song,Guande He,Yizhe Zhang,Wenze Hu,Yinfei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Score identity Distillation (SiD) is successfully extended to pretrained text-to-image flow-matching models, demonstrating that score distillation techniques work broadly across diffusion and flow-based generators without requiring major modifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models produce high-quality images but suffer from slow iterative sampling, while flow matching has been shown to be theoretically equivalent to diffusion under Gaussian assumptions. The paper investigates whether distillation techniques can transfer directly to flow matching models.

Method: The authors provide a simple derivation using Bayes' rule and conditional expectations to unify Gaussian diffusion and flow matching. They extend Score identity Distillation (SiD) to various pretrained text-to-image flow-matching models (SANA, SD3-Medium, SD3.5-Medium/Large, FLUX.1-dev) with only modest flow-matching and DiT-specific adjustments.

Result: Experiments show that SiD works out of the box across all tested models in both data-free and data-aided settings, without requiring teacher finetuning or architectural changes. This provides systematic evidence that score distillation applies broadly to text-to-image flow matching models.

Conclusion: The study resolves prior concerns about stability and soundness of applying distillation to flow matching models, and unifies acceleration techniques across diffusion- and flow-based generators. The PyTorch implementation will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve high-quality image generation but are limited by
slow iterative sampling. Distillation methods alleviate this by enabling one-
or few-step generation. Flow matching, originally introduced as a distinct
framework, has since been shown to be theoretically equivalent to diffusion
under Gaussian assumptions, raising the question of whether distillation
techniques such as score distillation transfer directly. We provide a simple
derivation -- based on Bayes' rule and conditional expectations -- that unifies
Gaussian diffusion and flow matching without relying on ODE/SDE formulations.
Building on this view, we extend Score identity Distillation (SiD) to
pretrained text-to-image flow-matching models, including SANA, SD3-Medium,
SD3.5-Medium/Large, and FLUX.1-dev, all with DiT backbones. Experiments show
that, with only modest flow-matching- and DiT-specific adjustments, SiD works
out of the box across these models, in both data-free and data-aided settings,
without requiring teacher finetuning or architectural changes. This provides
the first systematic evidence that score distillation applies broadly to
text-to-image flow matching models, resolving prior concerns about stability
and soundness and unifying acceleration techniques across diffusion- and
flow-based generators. We will make the PyTorch implementation publicly
available.

*Junyi Zhang,Jia-Chen Gu,Wenbo Hu,Yu Zhou,Robinson Piramuthu,Nanyun Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TemMed-Bench is the first benchmark for analyzing patient condition changes across clinical visits using temporal medical images, revealing LVLMs' limitations in temporal reasoning and showing multi-modal retrieval augmentation improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical reasoning benchmarks focus on single-visit analysis, which deviates from real clinical practice where doctors track patient changes over time using historical data.

Method: Created TemMed-Bench with three tasks (VQA, report generation, image-pair selection) and 17K+ knowledge corpus. Evaluated 12 LVLMs and explored multi-modal retrieval augmentation with visual and textual modalities.

Result: Most LVLMs lack temporal reasoning ability, with many performing at random-guessing level. GPT o3, o4-mini and Claude 3.5 Sonnet showed better but still insufficient performance. Multi-modal retrieval improved VQA by 2.59% on average.

Conclusion: LVLMs have significant limitations in temporal medical image reasoning. Multi-modal retrieval augmentation shows promise for addressing this challenge and should be further explored.

Abstract: Existing medical reasoning benchmarks for vision-language models primarily
focus on analyzing a patient's condition based on an image from a single visit.
However, this setting deviates significantly from real-world clinical practice,
where doctors typically refer to a patient's historical conditions to provide a
comprehensive assessment by tracking their changes over time. In this paper, we
introduce TemMed-Bench, the first benchmark designed for analyzing changes in
patients' conditions between different clinical visits, which challenges large
vision-language models (LVLMs) to reason over temporal medical images.
TemMed-Bench consists of a test set comprising three tasks - visual
question-answering (VQA), report generation, and image-pair selection - and a
supplementary knowledge corpus of over 17,000 instances. With TemMed-Bench, we
conduct an evaluation of six proprietary and six open-source LVLMs. Our results
show that most LVLMs lack the ability to analyze patients' condition changes
over temporal medical images, and a large proportion perform only at a
random-guessing level in the closed-book setting. In contrast, GPT o3, o4-mini
and Claude 3.5 Sonnet demonstrate comparatively decent performance, though they
have yet to reach the desired level. Furthermore, we explore augmenting the
input with both retrieved visual and textual modalities in the medical domain.
We also show that multi-modal retrieval augmentation yields notably higher
performance gains than no retrieval and textual retrieval alone across most
models on our benchmark, with the VQA task showing an average improvement of
2.59%. Overall, we compose a benchmark grounded on real-world clinical
practice, and it reveals LVLMs' limitations in temporal medical image
reasoning, as well as highlighting the use of multi-modal retrieval
augmentation as a potentially promising direction worth exploring to address
this challenge.

*Richeek Das,Kostas Daniilidis,Pratik Chaudhari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: F³ (Fast Feature Field) is a novel representation for event-based camera data that learns by predicting future events from past events, enabling efficient processing at 120-440 Hz and achieving state-of-the-art performance on optical flow, semantic segmentation, and depth estimation across various robotic platforms and conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop efficient representations for event-based camera data that can handle the sparsity and noise of event streams while preserving scene structure and motion information for downstream robotic vision tasks.

Method: Learns F³ representation by predicting future events from past events using multi-resolution hash encoding and deep sets, exploiting event data sparsity and robustness to noise and rate variations.

Result: Achieves processing speeds of 120 Hz at HD and 440 Hz at VGA resolutions. State-of-the-art performance on optical flow, semantic segmentation, and monocular depth estimation across three robotic platforms (car, quadruped, flying) in diverse conditions (day/night, indoor/outdoor, urban/off-road).

Conclusion: F³ provides an efficient, robust representation for event-based vision that enables high-speed processing and superior performance on multiple robotic vision tasks across diverse real-world conditions.

Abstract: This paper develops a mathematical argument and algorithms for building
representations of data from event-based cameras, that we call Fast Feature
Field ($\text{F}^3$). We learn this representation by predicting future events
from past events and show that it preserves scene structure and motion
information. $\text{F}^3$ exploits the sparsity of event data and is robust to
noise and variations in event rates. It can be computed efficiently using ideas
from multi-resolution hash encoding and deep sets - achieving 120 Hz at HD and
440 Hz at VGA resolutions. $\text{F}^3$ represents events within a contiguous
spatiotemporal volume as a multi-channel image, enabling a range of downstream
tasks. We obtain state-of-the-art performance on optical flow estimation,
semantic segmentation, and monocular metric depth estimation, on data from
three robotic platforms (a car, a quadruped robot and a flying platform),
across different lighting conditions (daytime, nighttime), environments
(indoors, outdoors, urban, as well as off-road) and dynamic vision sensors
(resolutions and event rates). Our implementations can predict these tasks at
25-75 Hz at HD resolution.

*Zhaozhi Wang,Tong Zhang,Mingyue Guo,Yaowei Wang,Qixiang Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoAnchor is a plug-and-play module that improves visual-spatial reasoning in MLLMs by leveraging subspace affinities to reinforce visual cues across frames without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs have limitations in visual-spatial reasoning because visual tokens are overshadowed by language tokens in attention mechanisms, preventing consistent recognition of visual cues across frames.

Method: Proposes VideoAnchor module that connects self-expressiveness property from sparse subspace clustering with Transformer attention, using subspace affinities to anchor attention to shared visual structures across frames.

Result: Achieves consistent performance gains: 3.2% and 4.6% improvements on VSI-Bench and Video-MME (spatial-related tasks) with InternVL2-8B and Qwen2.5VL-72B models. Qualitative analyses show more coherent subspace partitions and stronger visual grounding.

Conclusion: VideoAnchor effectively addresses visual-spatial reasoning limitations in MLLMs through subspace affinity-based attention anchoring, providing plug-and-play improvements without retraining.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive progress in
vision-language alignment, yet they remain limited in visual-spatial reasoning.
We first identify that this limitation arises from the attention mechanism:
visual tokens are overshadowed by language tokens, preventing the model from
consistently recognizing the same visual cues across frames. To address this
challenge, we draw a novel connection between the self-expressiveness property
in sparse subspace clustering and the attention mechanism in Transformers.
Building on this insight, we propose VideoAnchor, a plug-and-play module that
leverages subspace affinities to reinforce visual cues across frames without
retraining, effectively anchoring attention to shared visual structures.
Extensive experiments across benchmarks and backbone models show consistent
performance gains -- $e.g.$, 3.2% and 4.6% improvements on VSI-Bench and
Video-MME (spatial-related tasks) with InternVL2-8B and Qwen2.5VL-72B -- while
qualitative analyses demonstrate more coherent subspace partitions and stronger
visual grounding. Our codes will be made public available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GSM8K-V is a new visual mathematical reasoning benchmark that converts text-based GSM8K problems into multi-image visual format, revealing significant performance gaps in current vision language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual mathematical reasoning benchmarks are limited to geometry problems, lack math word problems, and rarely assess reasoning across multiple images, creating a gap in evaluating comprehensive visual reasoning capabilities.

Method: Systematically mapped GSM8K text problems into visual form using automated image-generation pipeline combined with human annotation, creating 1,319 high-quality multi-image samples.

Result: Current VLMs show substantial performance gap: best model (Gemini-2.5-Pro) achieves 95.22% on text GSM8K but only 46.93% on GSM8K-V, indicating visual reasoning remains challenging.

Conclusion: GSM8K-V provides a new benchmark for visual mathematical reasoning that reveals limitations of current models and guides development of more robust and generalizable vision language models.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) achieve unified modeling of images and text,
enabling them to accomplish complex real-world tasks through perception,
planning, and reasoning. Among these tasks, reasoning is particularly
representative, with mathematical reasoning serving as a prominent example. It
highlights the high-level capability of VLMs to comprehend mathematical
information in images and to perform sophisticated reasoning. Recently,
numerous visual mathematical reasoning benchmarks have been proposed, but they
are often restricted to geometry, lack coverage of math word problems, and
rarely assess reasoning across multiple images. To address these gaps, we
introduce GSM8K-V, a purely visual multi-image mathematical reasoning
benchmark. GSM8K-V is built by systematically mapping each sample from the
widely used text-based GSM8K into visual form. Through a carefully designed
automated image-generation pipeline combined with meticulous human annotation,
we curate 1,319 high-quality samples. We evaluate a wide range of open-source
and closed-source models on GSM8K-V. Results show that although existing VLMs
have nearly saturated performance on text-based GSM8K, there remains
substantial room for improvement on GSM8K-V. For example, the best-performing
model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieves 95.22% accuracy on GSM8K but only 46.93% on
GSM8K-V. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of GSM8K-V, examining the
limitations of current models as well as potential directions for improvement.
GSM8K-V offers a new perspective on visual mathematical reasoning and
establishes a benchmark to guide the development of more robust and
generalizable VLMs.

*Kunhao Liu,Wenbo Hu,Jiale Xu,Ying Shan,Shijian Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Rolling Forcing is a novel video generation technique that enables streaming long videos with minimal error accumulation through joint denoising, attention sink mechanism, and efficient training algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing streaming video generation methods suffer from severe error accumulation that degrades video quality over long horizons, limiting their use in interactive world models and neural game engines.

Method: Three key designs: 1) Joint denoising scheme that simultaneously denoises multiple frames with progressive noise levels, 2) Attention sink mechanism to maintain global context from initial frames, 3) Efficient training algorithm for few-step distillation over extended denoising windows.

Result: Enables real-time streaming generation of multi-minute videos on a single GPU with substantially reduced error accumulation compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Rolling Forcing effectively addresses error accumulation in long video streaming generation, making it suitable for applications requiring high-quality, low-latency, and temporally coherent video streams.

Abstract: Streaming video generation, as one fundamental component in interactive world
models and neural game engines, aims to generate high-quality, low-latency, and
temporally coherent long video streams. However, most existing work suffers
from severe error accumulation that often significantly degrades the generated
stream videos over long horizons. We design Rolling Forcing, a novel video
generation technique that enables streaming long videos with minimal error
accumulation. Rolling Forcing comes with three novel designs. First, instead of
iteratively sampling individual frames, which accelerates error propagation, we
design a joint denoising scheme that simultaneously denoises multiple frames
with progressively increasing noise levels. This design relaxes the strict
causality across adjacent frames, effectively suppressing error growth. Second,
we introduce the attention sink mechanism into the long-horizon stream video
generation task, which allows the model to keep key value states of initial
frames as a global context anchor and thereby enhances long-term global
consistency. Third, we design an efficient training algorithm that enables
few-step distillation over largely extended denoising windows. This algorithm
operates on non-overlapping windows and mitigates exposure bias conditioned on
self-generated histories. Extensive experiments show that Rolling Forcing
enables real-time streaming generation of multi-minute videos on a single GPU,
with substantially reduced error accumulation.

*Bowei Chen,Sai Bi,Hao Tan,He Zhang,Tianyuan Zhang,Zhengqi Li,Yuanjun Xiong,Jianming Zhang,Kai Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Aligning pretrained visual encoders as tokenizers for latent diffusion models, enabling faster convergence and better image generation quality compared to traditional VAEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage the rich semantic structure of foundation encoders rather than training VAEs from scratch that focus mainly on low-level details.

Method: Three-stage alignment strategy: (1) freeze encoder and train adapter/decoder, (2) joint optimization with semantic preservation loss, (3) decoder refinement for better reconstruction.

Result: Achieved gFID of 1.90 on ImageNet 256×256 within 64 epochs, outperformed FLUX VAE in 2B-parameter text-to-image model on LAION dataset.

Conclusion: The method provides a simple, scalable approach for creating semantically rich image tokenizers that benefit diffusion models.

Abstract: In this work, we propose aligning pretrained visual encoders to serve as
tokenizers for latent diffusion models in image generation. Unlike training a
variational autoencoder (VAE) from scratch, which primarily emphasizes
low-level details, our approach leverages the rich semantic structure of
foundation encoders. We introduce a three-stage alignment strategy: (1) freeze
the encoder and train an adapter and a decoder to establish a semantic latent
space; (2) jointly optimize all components with an additional semantic
preservation loss, enabling the encoder to capture perceptual details while
retaining high-level semantics; and (3) refine the decoder for improved
reconstruction quality. This alignment yields semantically rich image
tokenizers that benefit diffusion models. On ImageNet 256$\times$256, our
tokenizer accelerates the convergence of diffusion models, reaching a gFID of
1.90 within just 64 epochs, and improves generation both with and without
classifier-free guidance. Scaling to LAION, a 2B-parameter text-to-image model
trained with our tokenizer consistently outperforms FLUX VAE under the same
training steps. Overall, our method is simple, scalable, and establishes a
semantically grounded paradigm for continuous tokenizer design.

*Yuxin Jiang,Yuchao Gu,Yiren Song,Ivor Tsang,Mike Zheng Shou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PICO is a visual in-context learning framework that uses diffusion transformers to perform personalized vision tasks from a single annotated example, without requiring retraining or synthetic data pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision models struggle with personalized tasks defined at test time, and current personalization approaches rely on costly fine-tuning or inflexible synthetic data pipelines that are restricted to fixed task formats.

Method: PICO uses a four-panel framework with diffusion transformers as visual in-context learners, trained on VisRel - a compact but diverse dataset. It includes an attention-guided seed scorer for improved reliability through efficient inference scaling.

Result: PICO surpasses fine-tuning and synthetic-data baselines, flexibly adapts to novel user-defined tasks, and generalizes across both recognition and generation tasks.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates that task diversity rather than scale drives robust generalization for visual in-context learning, enabling effective personalized vision without retraining.

Abstract: Modern vision models, trained on large-scale annotated datasets, excel at
predefined tasks but struggle with personalized vision -- tasks defined at test
time by users with customized objects or novel objectives. Existing
personalization approaches rely on costly fine-tuning or synthetic data
pipelines, which are inflexible and restricted to fixed task formats. Visual
in-context learning (ICL) offers a promising alternative, yet prior methods
confine to narrow, in-domain tasks and fail to generalize to open-ended
personalization. We introduce Personalized In-Context Operator (PICO), a simple
four-panel framework that repurposes diffusion transformers as visual
in-context learners. Given a single annotated exemplar, PICO infers the
underlying transformation and applies it to new inputs without retraining. To
enable this, we construct VisRel, a compact yet diverse tuning dataset, showing
that task diversity, rather than scale, drives robust generalization. We
further propose an attention-guided seed scorer that improves reliability via
efficient inference scaling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PICO (i)
surpasses fine-tuning and synthetic-data baselines, (ii) flexibly adapts to
novel user-defined tasks, and (iii) generalizes across both recognition and
generation.

*Bingkui Tong,Jiaer Xia,Kaiyang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LayerCD is a simple method that reduces hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models by contrasting output distributions from shallow vs deep visual features in vision encoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs often generate hallucinations - coherent but contextually inaccurate outputs. Shallow visual features are more likely to cause hallucinations as they only capture biased, low-level information insufficient for high-level reasoning.

Method: Layer Contrastive Decoding (LayerCD) filters hallucinations by contrasting output distributions generated from shallow vs deep visual features in vision encoders.

Result: Extensive experiments on two hallucination benchmarks show LayerCD significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: LayerCD effectively reduces hallucinations in MLLMs by leveraging the contrast between shallow and deep visual features, with code publicly available.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive perception and
reasoning capabilities, yet they often suffer from hallucinations -- generating
outputs that are linguistically coherent but inconsistent with the context of
the input image, including inaccuracies in objects, attributes, and relations.
To address this challenge, we propose a simple approach called Layer
Contrastive Decoding (LayerCD). Our design is motivated by the observation that
shallow visual features are much more likely than deep visual features to cause
an MLLM to hallucinate as they only capture biased, low-level information that
is insufficient for high-level reasoning. Therefore, LayerCD aims to filter out
hallucinations by contrasting the output distributions generated from visual
features of different levels, specifically those from the shallow and deep
layers of the vision encoder, respectively. We conduct extensive experiments on
two hallucination benchmarks and show that LayerCD significantly outperforms
current state-of-the-art. The code for LayerCD is available at
https://github.com/maifoundations/LayerCD .

*Aryan Yazdan Parast,Parsa Hosseini,Hesam Asadollahzadeh,Arshia Soltani Moakhar,Basim Azam,Soheil Feizi,Naveed Akhtar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GHOST is a method to stress-test MLLMs by generating images that induce object hallucination through optimization in embedding space and diffusion models, achieving high success rates and transferable vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current static benchmarks for studying object hallucination in MLLMs are limited and cannot uncover model-specific or unanticipated vulnerabilities, requiring a more dynamic testing approach.

Method: GHOST optimizes in image embedding space to mislead models while keeping target objects absent, then uses diffusion models to generate natural-looking images with subtle misleading cues that cause hallucinations.

Result: Achieved hallucination success rate exceeding 28% across various models, with transferable vulnerabilities (66.5% rate from Qwen2.5-VL to GPT-4o), and confirmed image quality through human evaluation.

Conclusion: GHOST serves as both diagnostic and corrective tool for building more reliable multimodal systems, as fine-tuning on generated images can mitigate hallucination.

Abstract: Object hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is a
persistent failure mode that causes the model to perceive objects absent in the
image. This weakness of MLLMs is currently studied using static benchmarks with
fixed visual scenarios, which preempts the possibility of uncovering
model-specific or unanticipated hallucination vulnerabilities. We introduce
GHOST (Generating Hallucinations via Optimizing Stealth Tokens), a method
designed to stress-test MLLMs by actively generating images that induce
hallucination. GHOST is fully automatic and requires no human supervision or
prior knowledge. It operates by optimizing in the image embedding space to
mislead the model while keeping the target object absent, and then guiding a
diffusion model conditioned on the embedding to generate natural-looking
images. The resulting images remain visually natural and close to the original
input, yet introduce subtle misleading cues that cause the model to
hallucinate. We evaluate our method across a range of models, including
reasoning models like GLM-4.1V-Thinking, and achieve a hallucination success
rate exceeding 28%, compared to around 1% in prior data-driven discovery
methods. We confirm that the generated images are both high-quality and
object-free through quantitative metrics and human evaluation. Also, GHOST
uncovers transferable vulnerabilities: images optimized for Qwen2.5-VL induce
hallucinations in GPT-4o at a 66.5% rate. Finally, we show that fine-tuning on
our images mitigates hallucination, positioning GHOST as both a diagnostic and
corrective tool for building more reliable multimodal systems.

*Wenkun He,Yuchao Gu,Junyu Chen,Dongyun Zou,Yujun Lin,Zhekai Zhang,Haocheng Xi,Muyang Li,Ligeng Zhu,Jincheng Yu,Junsong Chen,Enze Xie,Song Han,Han Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DC-Gen is a framework that accelerates text-to-image diffusion models by using deeply compressed latent spaces, achieving up to 138x speedup for 4K image generation while maintaining quality comparable to base models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image diffusion models face efficiency challenges at high resolutions like 4K, and previous research seldom addresses the inherent redundancy in latent space, creating a need for acceleration without quality loss.

Method: DC-Gen uses a post-training pipeline with lightweight embedding alignment to bridge representation gaps between base and compressed latent spaces, followed by minimal LoRA fine-tuning to preserve generation quality.

Result: DC-Gen achieves significant speedups: DC-Gen-FLUX reduces 4K image generation latency by 53x on H100 GPU and 138x total reduction when combined with NVFP4 SVDQuant, generating 4K images in 3.5 seconds on NVIDIA 5090 GPU while maintaining comparable quality to base models.

Conclusion: DC-Gen provides an effective framework for accelerating high-resolution text-to-image generation through latent space compression, offering substantial efficiency gains without requiring costly retraining from scratch.

Abstract: Existing text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating high-quality
images, but face significant efficiency challenges when scaled to high
resolutions, like 4K image generation. While previous research accelerates
diffusion models in various aspects, it seldom handles the inherent redundancy
within the latent space. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces DC-Gen, a
general framework that accelerates text-to-image diffusion models by leveraging
a deeply compressed latent space. Rather than a costly training-from-scratch
approach, DC-Gen uses an efficient post-training pipeline to preserve the
quality of the base model. A key challenge in this paradigm is the
representation gap between the base model's latent space and a deeply
compressed latent space, which can lead to instability during direct
fine-tuning. To overcome this, DC-Gen first bridges the representation gap with
a lightweight embedding alignment training. Once the latent embeddings are
aligned, only a small amount of LoRA fine-tuning is needed to unlock the base
model's inherent generation quality. We verify DC-Gen's effectiveness on SANA
and FLUX.1-Krea. The resulting DC-Gen-SANA and DC-Gen-FLUX models achieve
quality comparable to their base models but with a significant speedup.

Conclusion: DC-VideoGen provides an efficient post-training acceleration solution that significantly improves video generation speed while maintaining quality and enabling high-resolution outputs.

Abstract: We introduce DC-VideoGen, a post-training acceleration framework for
efficient video generation. DC-VideoGen can be applied to any pre-trained video
diffusion model, improving efficiency by adapting it to a deep compression
latent space with lightweight fine-tuning. The framework builds on two key
innovations: (i) a Deep Compression Video Autoencoder with a novel chunk-causal
temporal design that achieves 32x/64x spatial and 4x temporal compression while
preserving reconstruction quality and generalization to longer videos; and (ii)
AE-Adapt-V, a robust adaptation strategy that enables rapid and stable transfer
of pre-trained models into the new latent space. Adapting the pre-trained
Wan-2.1-14B model with DC-VideoGen requires only 10 GPU days on the NVIDIA H100
GPU. The accelerated models achieve up to 14.8x lower inference latency than
their base counterparts without compromising quality, and further enable
2160x3840 video generation on a single GPU. Code:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PAD3R reconstructs deformable 3D objects from unposed monocular videos using a personalized pose estimator guided by pre-trained image-to-3D models and regularized by long-term 2D point tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches struggle with long video sequences containing substantial object deformation, large camera movement, and limited view coverage that challenge conventional 3D reconstruction systems.

Method: Trains a personalized object-centric pose estimator supervised by pre-trained image-to-3D models, guides optimization of deformable 3D Gaussian representation, and regularizes with long-term 2D point tracking across the entire video.

Result: Reconstructs high-fidelity, articulated 3D representations in a category-agnostic way, showing robust performance across challenging scenarios with substantial deformation and camera movement.

Conclusion: PAD3R demonstrates strong potential for dynamic scene understanding and 3D content creation by effectively combining generative priors with differentiable rendering for deformable object reconstruction.

Abstract: We present PAD3R, a method for reconstructing deformable 3D objects from
casually captured, unposed monocular videos. Unlike existing approaches, PAD3R
handles long video sequences featuring substantial object deformation,
large-scale camera movement, and limited view coverage that typically challenge
conventional systems. At its core, our approach trains a personalized,
object-centric pose estimator, supervised by a pre-trained image-to-3D model.
This guides the optimization of deformable 3D Gaussian representation. The
optimization is further regularized by long-term 2D point tracking over the
entire input video. By combining generative priors and differentiable
rendering, PAD3R reconstructs high-fidelity, articulated 3D representations of
objects in a category-agnostic way. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
results show that PAD3R is robust and generalizes well across challenging
scenarios, highlighting its potential for dynamic scene understanding and 3D
content creation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PixelCraft is a multi-agent system that enhances visual reasoning on structured images (charts, diagrams) through high-fidelity image processing and flexible reasoning with dynamic tool selection, agent discussion, and self-criticism mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for structured image analysis suffer from low-fidelity image processing and rigid linear reasoning patterns, leading to perceptual errors that cascade into incorrect conclusions.

Method: A multi-agent system with dispatcher, planner, reasoner, critics, and visual tool agents. Uses fine-tuned MLLM for pixel-level localization integrated with traditional CV algorithms, and implements dynamic three-stage workflow with tool selection, agent discussion, and self-criticism.

Result: Significantly improves visual reasoning performance on challenging chart and geometry benchmarks, setting new standards for structured image reasoning.

Conclusion: PixelCraft demonstrates that combining high-fidelity image processing with flexible multi-agent reasoning can effectively address the challenges of structured image analysis in MLLMs.

Abstract: Structured images (e.g., charts and geometric diagrams) remain challenging
for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), as perceptual slips can cascade
into erroneous conclusions. Intermediate visual cues can steer reasoning;
however, existing cue-based methods are constrained with low-fidelity image
processing and linear, rigid reasoning patterns, limiting their effectiveness
on complex structured-image tasks. In this paper, we propose PixelCraft, a
novel multi-agent system for high-fidelity image processing and flexible visual
reasoning on structured images. The system comprises a dispatcher, a planner, a
reasoner, critics, and a set of visual tool agents. To achieve high-fidelity
processing, we construct a high-quality corpus and fine-tune an MLLM into a
grounding model, whose pixel-level localizations are integrated with
traditional computer vision (CV) algorithms in tool agents. Building on this
foundation, PixelCraft facilitates flexible visual reasoning through a dynamic
three-stage workflow of tool selection, agent discussion, and self-criticism.
Moreover, unlike prior linear reasoning patterns that simply append historical
images, PixelCraft maintains an image memory to allow the planner to adaptively
revisit earlier visual steps, explore alternative reasoning branches, and
dynamically adjust the reasoning trajectory during discussion. Extensive
experiments on challenging chart and geometry benchmarks demonstrate that
PixelCraft significantly improves visual reasoning performance for advanced
MLLMs, setting a new standard for structured image reasoning. Our code will be
available at https://github.com/microsoft/PixelCraft.

### [351] [FlashI2V: Fourier-Guided Latent Shifting Prevents Conditional Image Leakage in Image-to-Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25187)
*Yunyang Ge,Xinhua Cheng,Chengshu Zhao,Xianyi He,Shenghai Yuan,Bin Lin,Bin Zhu,Li Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlashI2V is a novel Image-to-Video generation method that prevents conditional image leakage using latent shifting and Fourier guidance, achieving superior out-of-domain performance with only 1.3B parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing I2V methods suffer from conditional image leakage where denoisers shortcut the conditional image, causing slow motion, color inconsistency, and poor generalization to out-of-domain data.

Method: FlashI2V uses two key techniques: (1) Latent Shifting - modifies flow matching distributions by subtracting conditional image information from noisy latents, (2) Fourier Guidance - uses high-frequency magnitude features from Fourier Transform to accelerate convergence and adjust detail levels.

Result: FlashI2V achieves dynamic degree score of 53.01 on Vbench-I2V, outperforming larger models like CogVideoX1.5-5B-I2V and Wan2.1-I2V-14B-480P despite having only 1.3B parameters, and shows best generalization on out-of-domain data.

Conclusion: The proposed FlashI2V effectively overcomes conditional image leakage and achieves state-of-the-art performance in I2V generation with superior out-of-domain generalization capabilities.

Abstract: In Image-to-Video (I2V) generation, a video is created using an input image
as the first-frame condition. Existing I2V methods concatenate the full
information of the conditional image with noisy latents to achieve high
fidelity. However, the denoisers in these methods tend to shortcut the
conditional image, which is known as conditional image leakage, leading to
performance degradation issues such as slow motion and color inconsistency. In
this work, we further clarify that conditional image leakage leads to
overfitting to in-domain data and decreases the performance in out-of-domain
scenarios. Moreover, we introduce Fourier-Guided Latent Shifting I2V, named
FlashI2V, to prevent conditional image leakage. Concretely, FlashI2V consists
of: (1) Latent Shifting. We modify the source and target distributions of flow
matching by subtracting the conditional image information from the noisy
latents, thereby incorporating the condition implicitly. (2) Fourier Guidance.
We use high-frequency magnitude features obtained by the Fourier Transform to
accelerate convergence and enable the adjustment of detail levels in the
generated video. Experimental results show that our method effectively
overcomes conditional image leakage and achieves the best generalization and
performance on out-of-domain data among various I2V paradigms. With only 1.3B
parameters, FlashI2V achieves a dynamic degree score of 53.01 on Vbench-I2V,
surpassing CogVideoX1.5-5B-I2V and Wan2.1-I2V-14B-480P. Github page:

### [352] [Visual Jigsaw Post-Training Improves MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25190)
*Penghao Wu,Yushan Zhang,Haiwen Diao,Bo Li,Lewei Lu,Ziwei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Visual Jigsaw is a self-supervised post-training framework that enhances MLLMs' visual understanding through ordering tasks where models reconstruct shuffled visual partitions by producing correct permutations in natural language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current post-training for MLLMs is predominantly text-centric, using visual inputs only to extract sparse cues for text-based reasoning. There's a need for vision-centric approaches that directly enhance visual understanding without relying on text as an intermediate mediator or additional visual generative components.

Method: Visual Jigsaw partitions visual inputs (images, videos, 3D data), shuffles them, and requires the model to reconstruct the correct permutation in natural language. It uses reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) without requiring annotations or additional visual generative components.

Result: Extensive experiments show substantial improvements in fine-grained perception, temporal reasoning, and 3D spatial understanding across three visual modalities (images, videos, 3D data).

Conclusion: Visual Jigsaw demonstrates the potential of self-supervised vision-centric tasks for post-training MLLMs and aims to inspire further research on vision-centric pretext designs for enhancing visual understanding capabilities.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning based post-training has recently emerged as a powerful
paradigm for enhancing the alignment and reasoning capabilities of multimodal
large language models (MLLMs). While vision-centric post-training is crucial
for enhancing MLLMs' intrinsic understanding of visual signals, current
post-training paradigms are predominantly text-centric, where dense visual
inputs are only leveraged to extract sparse cues for text-based reasoning.
There exist a few approaches in this direction, however, they often still rely
on text as an intermediate mediator or introduce additional visual generative
designs. In this work, we introduce Visual Jigsaw, a generic self-supervised
post-training framework designed to strengthen visual understanding in MLLMs.
Visual Jigsaw is formulated as a general ordering task: visual inputs are
partitioned, shuffled, and the model must reconstruct the visual information by
producing the correct permutation in natural language. This naturally aligns
with reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR), requires no
additional visual generative components, and derives its supervisory signal
automatically without any annotations. We instantiate Visual Jigsaw across
three visual modalities, including images, videos, and 3D data. Extensive
experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in fine-grained perception,
temporal reasoning, and 3D spatial understanding. Our findings highlight the
potential of self-supervised vision-centric tasks in post-training MLLMs and
aim to inspire further research on vision-centric pretext designs. Project

### [353] [VGGT-X: When VGGT Meets Dense Novel View Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25191)
*Yang Liu,Chuanchen Luo,Zimo Tang,Junran Peng,Zhaoxiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VGGT-X addresses VRAM and output quality issues when scaling 3D Foundation Models to dense novel view synthesis, achieving state-of-the-art COLMAP-free performance through memory-efficient implementation and robust training practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current NVS approaches rely on slow and fragile SfM pipelines for 3D attributes. While 3DFMs offer speed advantages, they face VRAM and output quality barriers when scaled to dense views.

Method: VGGT-X includes: 1) memory-efficient VGGT implementation scaling to 1000+ images, 2) adaptive global alignment for output enhancement, and 3) robust 3DGS training practices.

Result: Substantially closes fidelity gap with COLMAP-initialized pipelines, achieving SOTA results in dense COLMAP-free NVS and pose estimation.

Conclusion: The approach provides insights for future development of 3D foundation models and dense NVS, with remaining gaps analyzed for further improvement.

Abstract: We study the problem of applying 3D Foundation Models (3DFMs) to dense Novel
View Synthesis (NVS). Despite significant progress in Novel View Synthesis
powered by NeRF and 3DGS, current approaches remain reliant on accurate 3D
attributes (e.g., camera poses and point clouds) acquired from
Structure-from-Motion (SfM), which is often slow and fragile in low-texture or
low-overlap captures. Recent 3DFMs showcase orders of magnitude speedup over
the traditional pipeline and great potential for online NVS. But most of the
validation and conclusions are confined to sparse-view settings. Our study
reveals that naively scaling 3DFMs to dense views encounters two fundamental
barriers: dramatically increasing VRAM burden and imperfect outputs that
degrade initialization-sensitive 3D training. To address these barriers, we
introduce VGGT-X, incorporating a memory-efficient VGGT implementation that
scales to 1,000+ images, an adaptive global alignment for VGGT output
enhancement, and robust 3DGS training practices. Extensive experiments show
that these measures substantially close the fidelity gap with
COLMAP-initialized pipelines, achieving state-of-the-art results in dense
COLMAP-free NVS and pose estimation. Additionally, we analyze the causes of
remaining gaps with COLMAP-initialized rendering, providing insights for the
future development of 3D foundation models and dense NVS. Our project page is
