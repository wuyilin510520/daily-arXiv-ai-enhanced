We study symbolic graphics programming, where\nthe goal is to generate an SGP from a natural-language description. This task\nalso serves as a lens into how LLMs understand the visual world by prompting\nthem to generate images rendered from SGPs. Among various SGPs, our paper\nsticks to scalable vector graphics (SVGs). We begin by examining the extent to\nwhich LLMs can generate SGPs. To this end, we introduce SGP-GenBench, a\ncomprehensive benchmark covering object fidelity, scene fidelity, and\ncompositionality (attribute binding, spatial relations, numeracy). On\nSGP-GenBench, we discover that frontier proprietary models substantially\noutperform open-source models, and performance correlates well with general\ncoding capabilities. Motivated by this gap, we aim to improve LLMs' ability to\ngenerate SGPs. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards\napproach, where a format-validity gate ensures renderable SVG, and a\ncross-modal reward aligns text and the rendered image via strong vision\nencoders (e.g., SigLIP for text-image and DINO for image-image). Applied to\nQwen-2.5-7B, our method substantially improves SVG generation quality and\nsemantics, achieving performance on par with frontier systems.
