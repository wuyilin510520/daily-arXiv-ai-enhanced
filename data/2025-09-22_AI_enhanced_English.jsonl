However, existing open-source\nmodels often suffer from a performance trade-off between these capabilities. We\npresent Manzano, a simple and scalable unified framework that substantially\nreduces this tension by coupling a hybrid image tokenizer with a well-curated\ntraining recipe. A single shared vision encoder feeds two lightweight adapters\nthat produce continuous embeddings for image-to-text understanding and discrete\ntokens for text-to-image generation within a common semantic space. A unified\nautoregressive LLM predicts high-level semantics in the form of text and image\ntokens, with an auxiliary diffusion decoder subsequently translating the image\ntokens into pixels. The architecture, together with a unified training recipe\nover understanding and generation data, enables scalable joint learning of both\ncapabilities. Manzano achieves state-of-the-art results among unified models,\nand is competitive with specialist models, particularly on text-rich\nevaluation. Our studies show minimal task conflicts and consistent gains from\nscaling model size, validating our design choice of a hybrid tokenizer.", "AI": {"tldr": "Manzano is a unified multimodal LLM framework that reduces performance trade-offs between visual understanding and generation by using a hybrid image tokenizer with a shared vision encoder and unified training.", "motivation": "Existing open-source multimodal LLMs suffer from performance trade-offs between understanding and generating visual content, limiting their potential as unified models.", "method": "Uses a shared vision encoder with two lightweight adapters producing continuous embeddings for understanding and discrete tokens for generation.
