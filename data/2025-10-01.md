*Haozhe Jia,Wenshuo Chen,Yuqi Lin,Yang Yang,Lei Wang,Mang Ning,Bowen Tian,Songning Lai,Nanqian Jia,Yifan Chen,Yutao Yue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LUMA is a text-to-motion diffusion model that uses dual-path anchoring with temporal and frequency domain signals to address gradient attenuation and improve semantic alignment in motion generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based text-to-motion models suffer from semantic misalignment and kinematic artifacts due to severe gradient attenuation in deep network layers, leading to insufficient learning of high-level features.

Method: Proposes LUMA with dual-path anchoring: (1) lightweight MoCLIP model for temporal domain semantic supervision via contrastive learning, and (2) frequency domain alignment using low-frequency DCT components. Uses adaptive fusion through temporal modulation to transition from coarse to fine-grained alignment during denoising.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with FID scores of 0.035 on HumanML3D and 0.123 on KIT-ML. Accelerates convergence by 1.4× compared to baseline.

Conclusion: LUMA provides an efficient and scalable solution for high-fidelity text-to-motion generation by addressing gradient attenuation through dual-path semantic alignment.

Abstract: While current diffusion-based models, typically built on U-Net architectures,
have shown promising results on the text-to-motion generation task, they still
suffer from semantic misalignment and kinematic artifacts. Through analysis, we
identify severe gradient attenuation in the deep layers of the network as a key
bottleneck, leading to insufficient learning of high-level features. To address
this issue, we propose \textbf{LUMA} (\textit{\textbf{L}ow-dimension
\textbf{U}nified \textbf{M}otion \textbf{A}lignment}), a text-to-motion
diffusion model that incorporates dual-path anchoring to enhance semantic
alignment. The first path incorporates a lightweight MoCLIP model trained via
contrastive learning without relying on external data, offering semantic
supervision in the temporal domain. The second path introduces complementary
alignment signals in the frequency domain, extracted from low-frequency DCT
components known for their rich semantic content. These two anchors are
adaptively fused through a temporal modulation mechanism, allowing the model to
progressively transition from coarse alignment to fine-grained semantic
refinement throughout the denoising process. Experimental results on HumanML3D
and KIT-ML demonstrate that LUMA achieves state-of-the-art performance, with
FID scores of 0.035 and 0.123, respectively. Furthermore, LUMA accelerates
convergence by 1.4$\times$ compared to the baseline, making it an efficient and
scalable solution for high-fidelity text-to-motion generation.

### [2] [VisualOverload: Probing Visual Understanding of VLMs in Really Dense Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25339)
*Paul Gavrikov,Wei Lin,M. Jehanzeb Mirza,Soumya Jahagirdar,Muhammad Huzaifa,Sivan Doveh,Serena Yeung-Levy,James Glass,Hilde Kuehne*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisualOverload is a VQA benchmark challenging VLMs with densely populated scenes, revealing significant performance gaps despite claims of solved visual understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test if state-of-the-art VLMs truly solve basic visual understanding by evaluating them on knowledge-free vision tasks in densely populated scenes, as current benchmarks may overestimate their capabilities.

Method: Created a dataset of 2,720 question-answer pairs using high-resolution scans of public-domain paintings with dense visual elements, manually annotated across six task categories to probe detailed scene understanding.

Result: Even the best model (o3) among 37 tested achieved only 19.6% accuracy on the hardest test split and 69.5% overall, revealing major deficiencies in counting, OCR, and logical reasoning.

Conclusion: VisualOverload exposes critical gaps in current vision models' ability to handle densely populated scenes and provides a crucial resource for developing better models.

Abstract: Is basic visual understanding really solved in state-of-the-art VLMs? We
present VisualOverload, a slightly different visual question answering (VQA)
benchmark comprising 2,720 question-answer pairs, with privately held
ground-truth responses. Unlike prior VQA datasets that typically focus on near
global image understanding, VisualOverload challenges models to perform simple,
knowledge-free vision tasks in densely populated (or, overloaded) scenes. Our
dataset consists of high-resolution scans of public-domain paintings that are
populated with multiple figures, actions, and unfolding subplots set against
elaborately detailed backdrops. We manually annotated these images with
questions across six task categories to probe for a thorough understanding of
the scene. We hypothesize that current benchmarks overestimate the performance
of VLMs, and encoding and reasoning over details is still a challenging task
for them, especially if they are confronted with densely populated scenes.
Indeed, we observe that even the best model (o3) out of 37 tested models only
achieves 19.6% accuracy on our hardest test split and overall 69.5% accuracy on
all questions. Beyond a thorough evaluation, we complement our benchmark with
an error analysis that reveals multiple failure modes, including a lack of
counting skills, failure in OCR, and striking logical inconsistencies under
complex tasks. Altogether, VisualOverload exposes a critical gap in current
vision models and offers a crucial resource for the community to develop better
models.

### [3] [Editing Physiological Signals in Videos Using Latent Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25348)
*Tianwen Zhou,Akshay Paruchuri,Josef Spjut,Kaan Akşit*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework that edits physiological signals in videos while preserving visual quality, using a 3D VAE and text embeddings to modulate heart rate signals for privacy protection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Camera-based heart rate monitoring raises privacy concerns as physiological signals in facial videos can reveal sensitive health and emotional information.

Method: Uses a pretrained 3D VAE to encode videos, text encoder for HR prompts, and spatio-temporal layers with AdaLN and FiLM modulation to edit physiological signals while maintaining visual fidelity.

Result: Achieves high visual quality (PSNR 38.96 dB, SSIM 0.98) and accurate HR modulation (10.00 bpm MAE, 10.09% MAPE) using state-of-the-art rPPG estimator.

Conclusion: The method enables controllable HR editing for applications like anonymizing biometric signals or synthesizing realistic videos with desired vital signs while protecting privacy.

Abstract: Camera-based physiological signal estimation provides a non-contact and
convenient means to monitor Heart Rate (HR). However, the presence of vital
signals in facial videos raises significant privacy concerns, as they can
reveal sensitive personal information related to the health and emotional
states of an individual. To address this, we propose a learned framework that
edits physiological signals in videos while preserving visual fidelity. First,
we encode an input video into a latent space via a pretrained 3D Variational
Autoencoder (3D VAE), while a target HR prompt is embedded through a frozen
text encoder. We fuse them using a set of trainable spatio-temporal layers with
Adaptive Layer Normalizations (AdaLN) to capture the strong temporal coherence
of remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) signals. We apply Feature-wise Linear
Modulation (FiLM) in the decoder with a fine-tuned output layer to avoid the
degradation of physiological signals during reconstruction, enabling accurate
physiological modulation in the reconstructed video. Empirical results show
that our method preserves visual quality with an average PSNR of 38.96 dB and
SSIM of 0.98 on selected datasets, while achieving an average HR modulation
error of 10.00 bpm MAE and 10.09% MAPE using a state-of-the-art rPPG estimator.
Our design's controllable HR editing is useful for applications such as
anonymizing biometric signals in real videos or synthesizing realistic videos
with desired vital signs.

### [4] [SpinBench: Perspective and Rotation as a Lens on Spatial Reasoning in VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25390)
*Yuyou Zhang,Radu Corcodel,Chiori Hori,Anoop Cherian,Ding Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpinBench is a diagnostic benchmark for evaluating spatial reasoning in vision-language models, focusing on perspective-taking abilities across various transformations like translation, rotation, and viewpoint changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the core challenge of spatial reasoning in VLMs - perspective taking, which requires recognizing objects across views, relative position grounding, and mental simulation of transformations.

Method: Created a benchmark with fine-grained diagnostic categories targeting translation, rotation, object relative pose, and viewpoint change, progressively structured from single-object to multi-object perspective-taking tasks.

Result: Evaluation of 37 state-of-the-art VLMs revealed systematic weaknesses including strong egocentric bias, poor rotational understanding, and inconsistencies under symmetrical/syntactic reformulations. Human subjects achieved 91.2% accuracy, with human response time strongly correlating with VLM accuracy.

Conclusion: SpinBench provides critical insights into spatial reasoning gaps in VLMs and captures spatial reasoning challenges shared across humans and VLMs, highlighting key deficiencies in their ability to reason about physical space.

Abstract: We present SpinBench, a cognitively grounded diagnostic benchmark for
evaluating spatial reasoning in vision language models (VLMs). SpinBench is
designed around the core challenge of spatial reasoning: perspective taking,
the ability to reason about how scenes and object relations change under
viewpoint transformation. Since perspective taking requires multiple cognitive
capabilities, such as recognizing objects across views, relative positions
grounding, and mentally simulating transformations, SpinBench introduces a set
of fine-grained diagnostic categories. Our categories target translation,
rotation, object relative pose, and viewpoint change, and are progressively
structured so that single-object simpler tasks scaffold toward the most
demanding multi-object perspective-taking setting. We evaluate 37
state-of-the-art VLMs, both proprietary and open source. Results reveal
systematic weaknesses: strong egocentric bias, poor rotational understanding,
and inconsistencies under symmetrical and syntactic reformulations. Scaling
analysis shows both smooth improvements and emergent capabilities. While human
subjects achieve high accuracy (91.2\%), task difficulty as measured by human
response time shows strong correlation with VLM accuracy, indicating that
SpinBench captures spatial reasoning challenges shared across humans and VLMs.
We believe SpinBench provides critical insights into spatial reasoning in VLMs
and highlights key gaps in their ability to reason about physical space. Our

### [5] [A Deep Learning Approach for Spatio-Temporal Forecasting of InSAR Ground Deformation in Eastern Ireland](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25393)
*Wendong Yao,Binhua Huang,Soumyabrata Dev*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes MM-STT, a multi-modal transformer that fuses dynamic displacement data with static physical priors using joint spatio-temporal attention, achieving order-of-magnitude improvement in land subsidence forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard architectures fail to model long-range dependencies in land subsidence forecasting, and prior work is limited by uni-modal data paradigms that don't leverage multi-modal information effectively.

Method: Multi-Modal Spatio-Temporal Transformer (MM-STT) framework with joint spatio-temporal attention mechanism that processes dynamic displacement data and static physical priors in a unified manner.

Result: Establishes new state-of-the-art on EGMS dataset, reducing long-range forecast RMSE by an order of magnitude compared to all baselines including STGCN and STAEformer.

Conclusion: For land subsidence forecasting problems, an architecture's inherent capacity for deep multi-modal fusion is crucial for achieving transformative performance.

Abstract: Forecasting high-resolution land subsidence is a critical yet challenging
task due to its complex, non-linear dynamics. While standard architectures like
ConvLSTM often fail to model long-range dependencies, we argue that a more
fundamental limitation of prior work lies in the uni-modal data paradigm. To
address this, we propose the Multi-Modal Spatio-Temporal Transformer (MM-STT),
a novel framework that fuses dynamic displacement data with static physical
priors. Its core innovation is a joint spatio-temporal attention mechanism that
processes all multi-modal features in a unified manner. On the public EGMS
dataset, MM-STT establishes a new state-of-the-art, reducing the long-range
forecast RMSE by an order of magnitude compared to all baselines, including
SOTA methods like STGCN and STAEformer. Our results demonstrate that for this
class of problems, an architecture's inherent capacity for deep multi-modal
fusion is paramount for achieving transformative performance.

### [6] [DepthLM: Metric Depth From Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25413)
*Zhipeng Cai,Ching-Feng Yeh,Hu Xu,Zhuang Liu,Gregory Meyer,Xinjie Lei,Changsheng Zhao,Shang-Wen Li,Vikas Chandra,Yangyang Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision language models can achieve expert-level accuracy in 3D understanding tasks like metric depth estimation through simple text-based supervised fine-tuning with sparse labels, without needing task-specific architectures or complex losses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art VLMs struggle with 3D understanding from 2D inputs, while expert pure vision models achieve super-human accuracy in metric depth estimation but require specialized architectures and losses. This gap motivates exploring whether VLMs can reach expert-level accuracy without architectural or loss changes.

Method: Uses text-based supervised fine-tuning with sparse labels for per-pixel metric depth estimation. Addresses pixel reference and cross-dataset camera ambiguity through visual prompting and intrinsic-conditioned augmentation. No dense prediction head or complex regression/regularization loss needed.

Result: DepthLM surpasses accuracy of most advanced VLMs by over 2x, making VLMs for the first time comparable with pure vision models. VLMs trained with DepthLM naturally avoid over-smoothing and have fewer flying points at boundary regions than pure vision models.

Conclusion: VLMs can achieve expert-level 3D understanding accuracy through simple text-based fine-tuning. The method enables a single VLM to cover various 3D tasks beyond metric depth, demonstrating the potential for general 3D understanding without specialized architectures.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) can flexibly address various vision tasks
through text interactions. Although successful in semantic understanding,
state-of-the-art VLMs including GPT-5 still struggle in understanding 3D from
2D inputs. On the other hand, expert pure vision models achieve super-human
accuracy in metric depth estimation, a key 3D understanding task. However, they
require task-specific architectures and losses. Such difference motivates us to
ask: Can VLMs reach expert-level accuracy without architecture or loss change?
We take per-pixel metric depth estimation as the representative task and show
that the answer is yes! Surprisingly, comprehensive analysis shows that
text-based supervised-finetuning with sparse labels is sufficient for VLMs to
unlock strong 3D understanding, no dense prediction head or complex
regression/regularization loss is needed. The bottleneck for VLMs lies actually
in pixel reference and cross-dataset camera ambiguity, which we address through
visual prompting and intrinsic-conditioned augmentation. With much smaller
models, our method DepthLM surpasses the accuracy of most advanced VLMs by over
2x, making VLMs for the first time comparable with pure vision models.
Interestingly, without explicit enforcement during training, VLMs trained with
DepthLM naturally avoids over-smoothing, having much fewer flying points at
boundary regions than pure vision models. The simplicity of DepthLM also
enables a single VLM to cover various 3D tasks beyond metric depth. Our code
and model will be released at the link below.

### [7] [Bayesian Transformer for Pan-Arctic Sea Ice Concentration Mapping and Uncertainty Estimation using Sentinel-1, RCM, and AMSR2 Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25437)
*Mabel Heffring,Lincoln Linlin Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel Bayesian Transformer approach for Pan-Arctic sea ice concentration mapping and uncertainty quantification using multi-sensor satellite data fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution mapping of Pan-Arctic sea ice with reliable uncertainty is essential for operational sea ice concentration charting, but faces challenges including subtle ice signature features, model uncertainty, and data heterogeneity.

Method: 1) Designed a high-resolution Transformer model with global and local modules to better discern subtle sea ice pattern differences; 2) Developed Bayesian extension treating parameters as random variables for better uncertainty quantification; 3) Fused Sentinel-1, RCM, and AMSR2 data at decision-level to address data heterogeneity.

Result: Tested on Pan-Arctic datasets from September 2021, the model achieved both high-resolution sea ice concentration maps and robust uncertainty maps compared to other uncertainty quantification approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed Bayesian Transformer approach effectively addresses key challenges in sea ice mapping and provides improved uncertainty quantification for operational applications.

Abstract: Although high-resolution mapping of Pan-Arctic sea ice with reliable
corresponding uncertainty is essential for operational sea ice concentration
(SIC) charting, it is a difficult task due to some key challenges, e.g., the
subtle nature of ice signature features, model uncertainty, and data
heterogeneity. This letter presents a novel Bayesian Transformer approach for
Pan-Arctic SIC mapping and uncertainty quantification using Sentinel-1,
RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM), and Advanced Microwave Scanning
Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) data. First, to improve feature extraction, we design a
novel high-resolution Transformer model with both global and local modules that
can better discern the subtle differences in sea ice patterns. Second, to
improve uncertainty quantification, we design a Bayesian extension of the
proposed Transformer model, treating its parameters as random variables to more
effectively capture uncertainties. Third, to address data heterogeneity, we
fuse three different data types (Sentinel-1, RCM, and AMSR2) at decision-level
to improve both SIC mapping and uncertainty quantification. The proposed
approach is tested on Pan-Arctic datasets from September 2021, and the results
demonstrate that the proposed model can achieve both high-resolution SIC maps
and robust uncertainty maps compared to other uncertainty quantification
approaches.

*Suhala Rabab Saba,Sakib Khan,Minhaj Uddin Ahmad,Jiahe Cao,Mizanur Rahman,Li Zhao,Nathan Huynh,Eren Erman Ozguven*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Integration of roadside camera and LiDAR sensors with Kalman Filter fusion reduces vehicle localization errors by up to 70% in work zones, providing robust tracking despite sensor limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome practical deployment barriers in infrastructure-based sensing for work zone safety, including perspective distortion, complex geometry, occlusions, and cost constraints.

Method: Developed a cosimulation environment integrating roadside camera and LiDAR sensors, employing Kalman Filter-based late fusion strategy for enhanced trajectory consistency and accuracy.

Result: Fusion algorithm reduced longitudinal error by up to 70% compared to individual sensors while maintaining lateral accuracy within 1-3 meters. Field validation confirmed fused trajectories closely match real vehicle paths even with intermittent sensor data.

Conclusion: KF-based sensor fusion reliably compensates for individual sensor limitations, offering a practical pathway for deploying infrastructure-enabled multi-sensor systems for proactive safety in complex traffic environments.

Abstract: Infrastructure-based sensing and real-time trajectory generation show promise
for improving safety in high-risk roadway segments such as work zones, yet
practical deployments are hindered by perspective distortion, complex geometry,
occlusions, and costs. This study tackles these barriers by integrating
roadside camera and LiDAR sensors into a cosimulation environment to develop a
scalable, cost-effective vehicle detection and localization framework, and
employing a Kalman Filter-based late fusion strategy to enhance trajectory
consistency and accuracy. In simulation, the fusion algorithm reduced
longitudinal error by up to 70 percent compared to individual sensors while
preserving lateral accuracy within 1 to 3 meters. Field validation in an active
work zone, using LiDAR, a radar-camera rig, and RTK-GPS as ground truth,
demonstrated that the fused trajectories closely match real vehicle paths, even
when single-sensor data are intermittent or degraded. These results confirm
that KF based sensor fusion can reliably compensate for individual sensor
limitations, providing precise and robust vehicle tracking capabilities. Our
approach thus offers a practical pathway to deploy infrastructure-enabled
multi-sensor systems for proactive safety measures in complex traffic
environments.

### [9] [Seeing Before Reasoning: A Unified Framework for Generalizable and Explainable Fake Image Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25502)
*Kaiqing Lin,Zhiyuan Yan,Ruoxin Chen,Junyan Ye,Ke-Yue Zhang,Yue Zhou,Peng Jin,Bin Li,Taiping Yao,Shouhong Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLLMs perform poorly in AI-generated image detection due to vision encoders being optimized for semantic recognition rather than low-level forgery traces, and finetuning data causing catastrophic forgetting. The paper proposes Forensic-Chat with 'seeing before reasoning' paradigm and ExplainFake-Bench benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs fail at AI-generated image detection because they reason about fakes before truly perceiving them - their vision encoders miss subtle forgery traces and finetuning causes knowledge forgetting.

Method: Proposes Forensic-Chat with 'seeing before reasoning' paradigm: first train MLLMs to perceive artifacts (strengthen artifact-aware visual perception), then ground reasoning in actual observations. Also introduces ExplainFake-Bench benchmark.

Result: Extensive experiments show Forensic-Chat achieves superior generalization and genuinely reliable explainability for fake image detection across multiple evaluation aspects.

Conclusion: The 'seeing before reasoning' paradigm with artifact-aware visual perception enables MLLMs to become effective, generalizable, and explainable assistants for AI-generated image detection while maintaining conversational capabilities.

Abstract: Detecting AI-generated images with multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
has gained increasing attention, due to their rich world knowledge,
common-sense reasoning, and potential for explainability. However, naively
applying those MLLMs for detection often leads to suboptimal performance. We
argue that the root of this failure lies in a fundamental mismatch: MLLMs are
asked to reason about fakes before they can truly see them. First, they do not
really see: existing MLLMs' vision encoders are primarily optimized for
semantic-oriented recognition rather than the perception of low-level signals,
leaving them insensitive to subtle forgery traces. Without access to reliable
perceptual evidence, the model grounds its judgment on incomplete and limited
visual observations. Second, existing finetuning data for detection typically
uses narrow, instruction-style formats, which diverge sharply from the diverse,
heterogeneous distributions seen in pretraining. In the absence of meaningful
visual cues, the model therefore exploits these linguistic shortcuts, resulting
in catastrophic forgetting of pretrained knowledge (even the basic dialogue
capabilities). In response, we advocate for a new paradigm: seeing before
reasoning. We propose that MLLMs should first be trained to perceive
artifacts-strengthening their artifact-aware visual perception-so that
subsequent reasoning is grounded in actual observations. We therefore propose
Forensic-Chat, a generalizable, explainable, and still-conversational (for
multi-round dialogue) assistant for fake image detection. We also propose
ExplainFake-Bench, a benchmark tailored for the evaluation of the MLLM's
explainability for image forensics from five key aspects. Extensive experiments
show its superiority of generalization and genuinely reliable explainability.

### [10] [DeepFake Detection in Dyadic Video Calls using Point of Gaze Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25503)
*Odin Kohler,Rahul Vijaykumar,Masudul H. Imtiaz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Real-time deepfake detection using gaze tracking to identify phishing attacks in video meetings by analyzing subtle nonverbal communication patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Malicious actors are using real-time deepfake technology for phishing attacks during video calls, exploiting the inability of deepfakes to mimic authentic gaze patterns during conversations.

Method: Built model using explainable features from research on gaze patterns during dyadic conversations, utilizing point-of-gaze tracking to detect deepfakes based on their inability to replicate natural nonverbal communication.

Result: Achieved 82% accuracy on a novel dataset specifically created for this research.

Conclusion: This is the first method to utilize point-of-gaze tracking for deepfake detection, providing a novel biometric approach to identify real-time deepfake attacks in video meetings.

Abstract: With recent advancements in deepfake technology, it is now possible to
generate convincing deepfakes in real-time. Unfortunately, malicious actors
have started to use this new technology to perform real-time phishing attacks
during video meetings. The nature of a video call allows access to what the
deepfake is ``seeing,'' that is, the screen displayed to the malicious actor.
Using this with the estimated gaze from the malicious actors streamed video
enables us to estimate where the deepfake is looking on screen, the point of
gaze. Because the point of gaze during conversations is not random and is
instead used as a subtle nonverbal communicator, it can be used to detect
deepfakes, which are not capable of mimicking this subtle nonverbal
communication. This paper proposes a real-time deepfake detection method
adapted to this genre of attack, utilizing previously unavailable biometric
information. We built our model based on explainable features selected after
careful review of research on gaze patterns during dyadic conversations. We
then test our model on a novel dataset of our creation, achieving an accuracy
of 82\%. This is the first reported method to utilize point-of-gaze tracking
for deepfake detection.

TL;DR: A novel vision-based 6-DoF object pose estimation method for Mars Sample Return missions using custom renderer and edge-domain template matching with low-fidelity 3D models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable robotic arm operations in Mars Sample Return campaign requiring object localization for pickup and insertion under severe hardware constraints.

Method: Custom renderer combined with new template matching metric tailored to edge domain, using only low-fidelity textureless 3D models as inputs.

Result: Consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in compute and memory-constrained localization scenarios, showing improved robustness and accuracy.

Conclusion: Enables reliable localization on general-purpose hardware for space applications, opening new possibilities for cost-effective robotic operations.

Abstract: We consider the problem of vision-based 6-DoF object pose estimation in the
context of the notional Mars Sample Return campaign, in which a robotic arm
would need to localize multiple objects of interest for low-clearance pickup
and insertion, under severely constrained hardware. We propose a novel
localization algorithm leveraging a custom renderer together with a new
template matching metric tailored to the edge domain to achieve robust pose
estimation using only low-fidelity, textureless 3D models as inputs. Extensive
evaluations on synthetic datasets as well as from physical testbeds on Earth
and in situ Mars imagery shows that our method consistently beats the state of
the art in compute and memory-constrained localization, both in terms of
robustness and accuracy, in turn enabling new possibilities for cheap and
reliable localization on general-purpose hardware.

### [12] [LLM-RG: Referential Grounding in Outdoor Scenarios using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25528)
*Pranav Saxena,Avigyan Bhattacharya,Ji Zhang,Wenshan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLM-RG is a hybrid pipeline combining vision-language models and large language models for referential grounding in outdoor driving scenes, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the Talk2Car benchmark through zero-shot reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Referential grounding in outdoor driving scenes is challenging due to large scene variability, many visually similar objects, and dynamic elements that complicate resolving natural-language references like "the black car on the right".

Method: A hybrid pipeline that combines off-the-shelf vision-language models for fine-grained attribute extraction with large language models for symbolic reasoning. It processes images and referring expressions by extracting object types/attributes, detecting candidate regions, generating visual descriptors with VLM, and using LLM for chain-of-thought reasoning with spatial metadata.

Result: LLM-RG yields substantial gains over both LLM and VLM-based baselines on the Talk2Car benchmark. Adding 3D spatial cues further improves grounding performance.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate the complementary strengths of VLMs and LLMs, applied in a zero-shot manner, for robust outdoor referential grounding.

Abstract: Referential grounding in outdoor driving scenes is challenging due to large
scene variability, many visually similar objects, and dynamic elements that
complicate resolving natural-language references (e.g., "the black car on the
right"). We propose LLM-RG, a hybrid pipeline that combines off-the-shelf
vision-language models for fine-grained attribute extraction with large
language models for symbolic reasoning. LLM-RG processes an image and a
free-form referring expression by using an LLM to extract relevant object types
and attributes, detecting candidate regions, generating rich visual descriptors
with a VLM, and then combining these descriptors with spatial metadata into
natural-language prompts that are input to an LLM for chain-of-thought
reasoning to identify the referent's bounding box. Evaluated on the Talk2Car
benchmark, LLM-RG yields substantial gains over both LLM and VLM-based
baselines. Additionally, our ablations show that adding 3D spatial cues further
improves grounding. Our results demonstrate the complementary strengths of VLMs
and LLMs, applied in a zero-shot manner, for robust outdoor referential
grounding.

### [13] [VISOR++: Universal Visual Inputs based Steering for Large Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25533)
*Ravikumar Balakrishnan,Mansi Phute*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VISOR++ enables behavioral control of Vision Language Models through optimized visual inputs alone, eliminating need for runtime model access while achieving performance parity with steering vectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing behavioral control methods for VLMs have limitations - system prompting can be overridden, activation-based steering requires invasive runtime access, and cross-model transfer is challenging.

Method: Generate universal visual inputs (VISOR++ images) that induce target activation patterns across multiple VLMs, enabling behavioral steering through visual inputs alone without runtime model access.

Result: VISOR++ images achieve performance parity with steering vectors for refusal, sycophancy and survival instinct tasks, work on both open-access and closed-access models, and preserve 99.9% performance on unrelated MMLU tasks.

Conclusion: VISOR++ provides a deployment-agnostic approach for behavioral control of VLMs through visual inputs, enabling steering without runtime model access while maintaining model performance.

Abstract: As Vision Language Models (VLMs) are deployed across safety-critical
applications, understanding and controlling their behavioral patterns has
become increasingly important. Existing behavioral control methods face
significant limitations: system prompting approaches could easily be overridden
by user instructions, while applying activation-based steering vectors requires
invasive runtime access to model internals, precluding deployment with
API-based services and closed-source models. Finding steering methods that
transfer across multiple VLMs is still an open area of research. To this end,
we introduce universal visual input based steering for output redirection
(VISOR++), to achieve behavioral control through optimized visual inputs alone.
We demonstrate that a single VISOR++ image can be generated for an ensemble of
VLMs to emulate each of their steering vectors. By crafting universal visual
inputs that induce target activation patterns, VISOR++ eliminates the need for
runtime model access while remaining deployment-agnostic. This means that when
an underlying model supports multimodal capability, model behaviors can be
steered by inserting an image input replacing runtime steering vector based
interventions. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of the VISOR++ images on
open-access models such as LLaVA-1.5-7B and IDEFICS2-8B along three alignment
directions: refusal, sycophancy and survival instinct. Both the model-specific
steering images and the jointly optimized images achieve performance parity
closely following that of steering vectors for both positive and negative
steering tasks. We also show the promise of VISOR++ images in achieving
directional behavioral shifts for unseen models including both open-access and
closed-access ones. Furthermore, VISOR++ images are able to preserve 99.9%
performance on 14,000 unrelated MMLU evaluation tasks.

TL;DR: Vision-Zero is a domain-agnostic framework that enables vision-language models to self-improve through competitive visual games generated from arbitrary image pairs, eliminating the need for labor-intensive manual annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL methods for enhancing VLM reasoning capabilities heavily depend on labor-intensive datasets requiring extensive manual construction and verification, leading to high training costs and limiting practical deployment.

Method: Vision-Zero uses a strategic self-play framework where VLMs engage in "Who Is the Spy"-style games across multiple roles, generating training data autonomously. It introduces Iterative Self-Play Policy Optimization (Iterative-SPO) that alternates between self-play and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards.

Result: Vision-Zero achieves state-of-the-art performance on reasoning, chart question answering, and vision-centric understanding tasks, surpassing other annotation-based methods despite using label-free data.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates strong generalization across diverse domains using synthetic scenes, charts, and real-world images, achieving sustainable performance gains without human annotation.

Abstract: Although reinforcement learning (RL) can effectively enhance the reasoning
capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs), current methods remain heavily
dependent on labor-intensive datasets that require extensive manual
construction and verification, leading to extremely high training costs and
consequently constraining the practical deployment of VLMs. To address this
challenge, we propose Vision-Zero, a domain-agnostic framework enabling VLM
self-improvement through competitive visual games generated from arbitrary
image pairs. Specifically, Vision-Zero encompasses three main attributes: (1)
Strategic Self-Play Framework: Vision-Zero trains VLMs in "Who Is the
Spy"-style games, where the models engage in strategic reasoning and actions
across multiple roles. Through interactive gameplay, models autonomously
generate their training data without human annotation. (2) Gameplay from
Arbitrary Images: Unlike existing gamified frameworks, Vision-Zero can generate
games from arbitrary images, thereby enhancing the model's reasoning ability
across diverse domains and showing strong generalization to different tasks. We
demonstrate this versatility using three distinct types of image datasets:
CLEVR-based synthetic scenes, charts, and real-world images. (3) Sustainable
Performance Gain: We introduce Iterative Self-Play Policy Optimization
(Iterative-SPO), a novel training algorithm that alternates between Self-Play
and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), mitigating the
performance plateau often seen in self-play-only training and achieving
sustained long-term improvements. Despite using label-free data, Vision-Zero
achieves state-of-the-art performance on reasoning, chart question answering,
and vision-centric understanding tasks, surpassing other annotation-based
methods. Models and code has been released at

### [15] [Hybrid Approach for Enhancing Lesion Segmentation in Fundus Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25549)
*Mohammadmahdi Eshragh,Emad A. Mohammed,Behrouz Far,Ezekiel Weis,Carol L Shields,Sandor R Ferenczy,Trafford Crump*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid model combining mathematical/clustering segmentation with U-Net insights achieves superior choroidal nevus segmentation in fundus images, outperforming Attention U-Net with 89.7% Dice coefficient and 80.01% IoU.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of choroidal nevi is critical for preventing transformation to melanoma, but existing AI methods face challenges due to low-resolution datasets and inconsistent labeling. Current segmentation models either require extensive human input or depend heavily on large annotated datasets.

Method: Proposed a novel hybrid approach that combines mathematical/clustering segmentation models with insights from U-Net, leveraging strengths of both methods to reduce dependency on large training data while improving accuracy.

Result: Achieved Dice coefficient of 89.7% and IoU of 80.01% on 1024*1024 fundus images, significantly outperforming Attention U-Net (51.3% Dice, 34.2% IoU). Demonstrated better generalizability on external datasets.

Conclusion: The hybrid model provides an effective solution for choroidal nevus segmentation, forming a foundation for developing decision support systems to enhance diagnostic speed and accuracy in clinical practice.

Abstract: Choroidal nevi are common benign pigmented lesions in the eye, with a small
risk of transforming into melanoma. Early detection is critical to improving
survival rates, but misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis can lead to poor
outcomes. Despite advancements in AI-based image analysis, diagnosing choroidal
nevi in colour fundus images remains challenging, particularly for clinicians
without specialized expertise. Existing datasets often suffer from low
resolution and inconsistent labelling, limiting the effectiveness of
segmentation models. This paper addresses the challenge of achieving precise
segmentation of fundus lesions, a critical step toward developing robust
diagnostic tools. While deep learning models like U-Net have demonstrated
effectiveness, their accuracy heavily depends on the quality and quantity of
annotated data. Previous mathematical/clustering segmentation methods, though
accurate, required extensive human input, making them impractical for medical
applications. This paper proposes a novel approach that combines
mathematical/clustering segmentation models with insights from U-Net,
leveraging the strengths of both methods. This hybrid model improves accuracy,
reduces the need for large-scale training data, and achieves significant
performance gains on high-resolution fundus images. The proposed model achieves
a Dice coefficient of 89.7% and an IoU of 80.01% on 1024*1024 fundus images,
outperforming the Attention U-Net model, which achieved 51.3% and 34.2%,
respectively. It also demonstrated better generalizability on external
datasets. This work forms a part of a broader effort to develop a decision
support system for choroidal nevus diagnosis, with potential applications in
automated lesion annotation to enhance the speed and accuracy of diagnosis and
monitoring.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FishNet++, a large-scale multimodal benchmark for evaluating MLLMs in marine biology, specifically fish species recognition, where current models perform poorly (<10% accuracy).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs show impressive cross-domain capabilities but their proficiency in specialized scientific fields like marine biology remains underexplored, particularly for critical tasks like fish species recognition needed for monitoring marine ecosystems under anthropogenic pressure.

Method: The authors systematically evaluate state-of-the-art MLLMs and introduce FishNet++, a comprehensive multimodal benchmark with 35,133 textual descriptions, 706,426 key-point annotations, and 119,399 bounding boxes to facilitate development of specialized vision-language models.

Result: Current MLLMs show significant limitations in fine-grained fish species recognition, with best open-source models achieving less than 10% accuracy, indicating a lack of domain knowledge in specialized scientific fields.

Conclusion: FishNet++ addresses the gap in domain-specific knowledge for MLLMs and provides a comprehensive suite of annotations to facilitate the development and evaluation of specialized vision-language models capable of advancing aquatic science.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
cross-domain capabilities, yet their proficiency in specialized scientific
fields like marine biology remains underexplored. In this work, we
systematically evaluate state-of-the-art MLLMs and reveal significant
limitations in their ability to perform fine-grained recognition of fish
species, with the best open-source models achieving less than 10\% accuracy.
This task is critical for monitoring marine ecosystems under anthropogenic
pressure. To address this gap and investigate whether these failures stem from
a lack of domain knowledge, we introduce FishNet++, a large-scale, multimodal
benchmark. FishNet++ significantly extends existing resources with 35,133
textual descriptions for multimodal learning, 706,426 key-point annotations for
morphological studies, and 119,399 bounding boxes for detection. By providing
this comprehensive suite of annotations, our work facilitates the development

*Hakan Emre Gedik,Andrew Martin,Mustafa Munir,Oguzhan Baser,Radu Marculescu,Sandeep P. Chinchali,Alan C. Bovik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed AttentionViG with cross-attention-based aggregation for vision graph neural networks, achieving SOTA performance on ImageNet-1K and strong transferability to downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph convolution methods in ViGs lack versatile aggregation that captures complex node-neighbor relationships without architecture-specific refinements.

Method: Cross-attention-based aggregation where query projections come from nodes and key projections from neighbors, integrated into AttentionViG architecture for non-local message passing.

Result: Achieved SOTA performance on ImageNet-1K benchmark and demonstrated strong transferability to object detection, instance segmentation on MS COCO 2017, and semantic segmentation on ADE20K.

Conclusion: The proposed cross-attention aggregation method enables effective node-neighbor relationship modeling while maintaining efficiency, delivering competitive accuracy with comparable FLOPs to prior vision GNN architectures.

Abstract: Vision Graph Neural Networks (ViGs) have demonstrated promising performance
in image recognition tasks against Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and
Vision Transformers (ViTs). An essential part of the ViG framework is the
node-neighbor feature aggregation method. Although various graph convolution
methods, such as Max-Relative, EdgeConv, GIN, and GraphSAGE, have been
explored, a versatile aggregation method that effectively captures complex
node-neighbor relationships without requiring architecture-specific refinements
is needed. To address this gap, we propose a cross-attention-based aggregation
method in which the query projections come from the node, while the key
projections come from its neighbors. Additionally, we introduce a novel
architecture called AttentionViG that uses the proposed cross-attention
aggregation scheme to conduct non-local message passing. We evaluated the image
recognition performance of AttentionViG on the ImageNet-1K benchmark, where it
achieved SOTA performance. Additionally, we assessed its transferability to
downstream tasks, including object detection and instance segmentation on MS
COCO 2017, as well as semantic segmentation on ADE20K. Our results demonstrate
that the proposed method not only achieves strong performance, but also
maintains efficiency, delivering competitive accuracy with comparable FLOPs to
prior vision GNN architectures.

### [18] [MetaChest: Generalized few-shot learning of patologies from chest X-rays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25590)
*Berenice Montalvo-Lezama,Gibran Fuentes-Pineda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MetaChest is a large-scale chest X-ray dataset for few-shot learning, showing that transfer learning outperforms specialized few-shot methods like ProtoNet in medical image classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image analysis faces data scarcity issues, and few-shot learning methods need to handle both new classes while leveraging existing knowledge, which aligns with generalized few-shot classification scenarios common in medical applications.

Method: Created MetaChest dataset with 479,215 chest X-rays from four public databases, designed for standard few-shot classification with multi-label episodes. Evaluated transfer learning and ProtoNet extension across various few-shot multi-label classification tasks.

Result: Increasing classes per episode and training examples per class improves performance. Transfer learning consistently outperformed ProtoNet despite not being designed for few-shot learning. Higher-resolution images improve accuracy but require more computation, while efficient models achieve comparable performance with fewer resources.

Conclusion: Transfer learning is effective for few-shot medical image classification, and dataset design choices significantly impact performance in this domain.

Abstract: The limited availability of annotated data presents a major challenge for
applying deep learning methods to medical image analysis. Few-shot learning
methods aim to recognize new classes from only a small number of labeled
examples. These methods are typically studied under the standard few-shot
learning setting, where all classes in a task are new. However, medical
applications such as pathology classification from chest X-rays often require
learning new classes while simultaneously leveraging knowledge of previously
known ones, a scenario more closely aligned with generalized few-shot
classification. Despite its practical relevance, few-shot learning has been
scarcely studied in this context. In this work, we present MetaChest, a
large-scale dataset of 479,215 chest X-rays collected from four public
databases. MetaChest includes a meta-set partition specifically designed for
standard few-shot classification, as well as an algorithm for generating
multi-label episodes. We conduct extensive experiments evaluating both a
standard transfer learning approach and an extension of ProtoNet across a wide
range of few-shot multi-label classification tasks. Our results demonstrate
that increasing the number of classes per episode and the number of training
examples per class improves classification performance. Notably, the transfer
learning approach consistently outperforms the ProtoNet extension, despite not
being tailored for few-shot learning. We also show that higher-resolution
images improve accuracy at the cost of additional computation, while efficient
model architectures achieve comparable performance to larger models with
significantly reduced resource requirements.

### [19] [K-Prism: A Knowledge-Guided and Prompt Integrated Universal Medical Image Segmentation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25594)
*Bangwei Guo,Yunhe Gao,Meng Ye,Difei Gu,Yang Zhou,Leon Axel,Dimitris Metaxas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: K-Prism is a unified medical image segmentation framework that integrates three knowledge paradigms: semantic priors, in-context knowledge from reference examples, and interactive feedback, using a dual-prompt representation and Mixture-of-Experts decoder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical image segmentation models are fragmented, trained on single knowledge sources and specific to individual tasks/modalities/organs, which contrasts with clinical practice where experts integrate diverse knowledge sources seamlessly.

Method: The framework encodes heterogeneous knowledge sources into dual-prompt representation (1-D sparse prompts for 'what' and 2-D dense prompts for 'where'), then dynamically routes them through a Mixture-of-Experts decoder, enabling flexible switching between paradigms without architectural changes.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on 18 public datasets across diverse modalities (CT, MRI, X-ray, pathology, ultrasound) show K-Prism achieves state-of-the-art performance across semantic, in-context, and interactive segmentation settings.

Conclusion: K-Prism successfully mirrors clinical flexibility by systematically integrating multiple knowledge paradigms into a unified segmentation framework that performs well across diverse medical imaging tasks and settings.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is fundamental to clinical decision-making, yet
existing models remain fragmented. They are usually trained on single knowledge
sources and specific to individual tasks, modalities, or organs. This
fragmentation contrasts sharply with clinical practice, where experts
seamlessly integrate diverse knowledge: anatomical priors from training,
exemplar-based reasoning from reference cases, and iterative refinement through
real-time interaction. We present $\textbf{K-Prism}$, a unified segmentation
framework that mirrors this clinical flexibility by systematically integrating
three knowledge paradigms: (i) $\textit{semantic priors}$ learned from
annotated datasets, (ii) $\textit{in-context knowledge}$ from few-shot
reference examples, and (iii) $\textit{interactive feedback}$ from user inputs
like clicks or scribbles. Our key insight is that these heterogeneous knowledge
sources can be encoded into a dual-prompt representation: 1-D sparse prompts
defining $\textit{what}$ to segment and 2-D dense prompts indicating
$\textit{where}$ to attend, which are then dynamically routed through a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) decoder. This design enables flexible switching
between paradigms and joint training across diverse tasks without architectural
modifications. Comprehensive experiments on 18 public datasets spanning diverse
modalities (CT, MRI, X-ray, pathology, ultrasound, etc.) demonstrate that
K-Prism achieves state-of-the-art performance across semantic, in-context, and
interactive segmentation settings. Code will be released upon publication.

### [20] [GaussianLens: Localized High-Resolution Reconstruction via On-Demand Gaussian Densification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25603)
*Yijia Weng,Zhicheng Wang,Songyou Peng,Saining Xie,Howard Zhou,Leonidas J. Guibas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes GaussianLens for localized high-resolution 3D reconstruction via on-demand Gaussian densification, enabling fine detail capture in user-specified regions without full high-resolution reconstruction costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human perception focuses on regions of interest, but current 3D Gaussian Splatting methods either produce uniform resolution outputs with high computational costs or require dense observations and lengthy optimization. There's a need for scalable methods that can reconstruct fine details in critical regions on demand.

Method: GaussianLens - a feed-forward densification framework that fuses multi-modal information from initial low-resolution 3DGS and multi-view images, with a pixel-guided densification mechanism for effective detail capture under large resolution increases.

Result: Superior performance in local fine detail reconstruction with strong scalability to images up to 1024×1024 resolution, avoiding the high cost and redundancy of uniformly high-resolution reconstructions.

Conclusion: The proposed localized high-resolution reconstruction approach effectively bridges the gap between prohibitive holistic reconstruction costs and user needs for localized fine details, fully leveraging high-resolution captures in critical regions.

Abstract: We perceive our surroundings with an active focus, paying more attention to
regions of interest, such as the shelf labels in a grocery store. When it comes
to scene reconstruction, this human perception trait calls for spatially
varying degrees of detail ready for closer inspection in critical regions,
preferably reconstructed on demand. While recent works in 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) achieve fast, generalizable reconstruction from sparse views, their
uniform resolution output leads to high computational costs unscalable to
high-resolution training. As a result, they cannot leverage available images at
their original high resolution to reconstruct details. Per-scene optimization
methods reconstruct finer details with adaptive density control, yet require
dense observations and lengthy offline optimization. To bridge the gap between
the prohibitive cost of high-resolution holistic reconstructions and the user
needs for localized fine details, we propose the problem of localized
high-resolution reconstruction via on-demand Gaussian densification. Given a
low-resolution 3DGS reconstruction, the goal is to learn a generalizable
network that densifies the initial 3DGS to capture fine details in a
user-specified local region of interest (RoI), based on sparse high-resolution
observations of the RoI. This formulation avoids the high cost and redundancy
of uniformly high-resolution reconstructions and fully leverages
high-resolution captures in critical regions. We propose GaussianLens, a
feed-forward densification framework that fuses multi-modal information from
the initial 3DGS and multi-view images. We further design a pixel-guided
densification mechanism that effectively captures details under large
resolution increases. Experiments demonstrate our method's superior performance
in local fine detail reconstruction and strong scalability to images of up to
$1024\times1024$ resolution.

TL;DR: A large-scale multimodal ophthalmology benchmark dataset with 32,633 instances across 12 eye conditions and 5 imaging modalities, designed to evaluate generative AI models for medical image interpretation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address workforce shortages and limited access to specialized care for vision-threatening eye diseases by advancing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for ophthalmology, which is hindered by the lack of comprehensive benchmark datasets.

Method: Created a comprehensive multimodal dataset integrating imaging, anatomical structures, demographics, and free-text annotations. Extended previous LMOD benchmark with 50% dataset expansion, broadened task coverage (binary/multi-class diagnosis, severity classification, demographic prediction), and systematically evaluated 24 state-of-the-art MLLMs.

Result: Top-performing models achieved ~58% accuracy in disease screening under zero-shot settings, but performance remained suboptimal for challenging tasks like disease staging.

Conclusion: The dataset, curation pipeline, and leaderboard will be publicly released to advance ophthalmic AI applications and help reduce the global burden of vision-threatening diseases.

Abstract: Vision-threatening eye diseases pose a major global health burden, with
timely diagnosis limited by workforce shortages and restricted access to
specialized care. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise
for medical image interpretation, advancing MLLMs for ophthalmology is hindered
by the lack of comprehensive benchmark datasets suitable for evaluating
generative models. We present a large-scale multimodal ophthalmology benchmark
comprising 32,633 instances with multi-granular annotations across 12 common
ophthalmic conditions and 5 imaging modalities. The dataset integrates imaging,
anatomical structures, demographics, and free-text annotations, supporting
anatomical structure recognition, disease screening, disease staging, and
demographic prediction for bias evaluation. This work extends our preliminary
LMOD benchmark with three major enhancements: (1) nearly 50% dataset expansion
with substantial enlargement of color fundus photography; (2) broadened task
coverage including binary disease diagnosis, multi-class diagnosis, severity
classification with international grading standards, and demographic
prediction; and (3) systematic evaluation of 24 state-of-the-art MLLMs. Our
evaluations reveal both promise and limitations. Top-performing models achieved
~58% accuracy in disease screening under zero-shot settings, and performance
remained suboptimal for challenging tasks like disease staging. We will
publicly release the dataset, curation pipeline, and leaderboard to potentially
advance ophthalmic AI applications and reduce the global burden of
vision-threatening diseases.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AFGeo is an anchor-free cross-view object geo-localization method that directly predicts directional offsets to ground-truth boxes, eliminating dependency on predefined anchors through Gaussian Position Encoding and Cross-view Object Association Module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing anchor-based methods are constrained by predefined anchors, limiting their flexibility and performance in cross-view object geo-localization scenarios.

Method: Proposes AFGeo with anchor-free formulation that predicts four directional offsets per pixel, incorporates Gaussian Position Encoding for robust spatial priors, and uses Cross-view Object Association Module to relate objects across viewpoints.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets while being lightweight and computationally efficient with minimal parameter overhead.

Conclusion: Anchor-free paradigm with GPE and CVOAM enables effective cross-view object geo-localization without predefined anchors, overcoming limitations of traditional anchor-based approaches.

Abstract: Most existing cross-view object geo-localization approaches adopt
anchor-based paradigm. Although effective, such methods are inherently
constrained by predefined anchors. To eliminate this dependency, we first
propose an anchor-free formulation for cross-view object geo-localization,
termed AFGeo. AFGeo directly predicts the four directional offsets (left,
right, top, bottom) to the ground-truth box for each pixel, thereby localizing
the object without any predefined anchors. To obtain a more robust spatial
prior, AFGeo incorporates Gaussian Position Encoding (GPE) to model the click
point in the query image, mitigating the uncertainty of object position that
challenges object localization in cross-view scenarios. In addition, AFGeo
incorporates a Cross-view Object Association Module (CVOAM) that relates the
same object and its surrounding context across viewpoints, enabling reliable
localization under large cross-view appearance gaps. By adopting an anchor-free
localization paradigm that integrates GPE and CVOAM with minimal parameter
overhead, our model is both lightweight and computationally efficient,
achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.

*Jungsoo Lee,Janghoon Cho,Hyojin Park,Munawar Hayat,Kyuwoong Hwang,Fatih Porikli,Sungha Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Generalized Contrastive Learning (GCL) to improve multimodal retrieval without requiring new dataset curation, achieving consistent performance gains on existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-modal retrieval models like CLIP perform poorly on retrieving fused image-text modality keys, and existing approaches require careful dataset curation and fail to generalize to unseen modality combinations.

Method: GCL enforces contrastive learning across all modalities within mini-batches using existing image-caption paired datasets to learn a unified representation space.

Result: GCL demonstrates consistent performance improvements on off-the-shelf multimodal retrieval models (VISTA, CLIP, TinyCLIP) using M-BEIR, MMEB, and CoVR benchmarks.

Conclusion: GCL effectively addresses multimodal retrieval challenges without the need for burdensome new dataset curation, showing improved performance across various benchmarks.

Abstract: Despite their consistent performance improvements, cross-modal retrieval
models (e.g., CLIP) show degraded performances with retrieving keys composed of
fused image-text modality (e.g., Wikipedia pages with both images and text). To
address this critical challenge, multimodal retrieval has been recently
explored to develop a unified single retrieval model capable of retrieving keys
across diverse modality combinations. A common approach involves constructing
new composed sets of image-text triplets (e.g., retrieving a pair of image and
text given a query image). However, such an approach requires careful curation
to ensure the dataset quality and fails to generalize to unseen modality
combinations. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes Generalized
Contrastive Learning (GCL), a novel loss formulation that improves multimodal
retrieval performance without the burdensome need for new dataset curation.
Specifically, GCL operates by enforcing contrastive learning across all
modalities within a mini-batch, utilizing existing image-caption paired
datasets to learn a unified representation space. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of GCL by showing consistent performance improvements on
off-the-shelf multimodal retrieval models (e.g., VISTA, CLIP, and TinyCLIP)
using the M-BEIR, MMEB, and CoVR benchmarks.

TL;DR: Synthetic images from video games can effectively train CNNs for real-life truck axle detection, achieving 99% mAP and providing a low-cost alternative to real data collection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CNN training requires expensive real data collection. Synthetic images from video games offer a cost-effective alternative with realistic 3D models.

Method: Used three databases with real and synthetic trucks to train three YOLO architectures. Evaluated performance using recall, precision, F1-score, mAP, and Mann-Whitney U test for statistical significance.

Result: Synthetic images proved reliable for training, contributing to all networks' performance. Highest mAP reached 99%. Statistical tests confirmed significance.

Conclusion: Synthetic images from video games can successfully train neural networks, providing a reliable and low-cost data source for knowledge extraction.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) traditionally require large amounts of
data to train models with good performance. However, data collection is an
expensive process, both in time and resources. Generated synthetic images are a
good alternative, with video games producing realistic 3D models. This paper
aims to determine whether images extracted from a video game can be effectively
used to train a CNN to detect real-life truck axles. Three different databases
were created, with real-life and synthetic trucks, to provide training and
testing examples for three different You Only Look Once (YOLO) architectures.
Results were evaluated based on four metrics: recall, precision, F1-score, and
mean Average Precision (mAP). To evaluate the statistical significance of the
results, the Mann-Whitney U test was also applied to the resulting mAP of all
models. Synthetic images from trucks extracted from a video game proved to be a
reliable source of training data, contributing to the performance of all
networks. The highest mAP score reached 99\%. Results indicate that synthetic
images can be used to train neural networks, providing a reliable, low-cost
data source for extracting knowledge.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Geo-DLC, a novel object-level fine-grained image captioning task for remote sensing, along with a large-scale dataset (DE-Dataset), evaluation benchmark (DE-Benchmark), and a specialized MLLM model (DescribeEarth) that outperforms state-of-the-art general models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing remote sensing image captioning focuses only on image-level descriptions, lacking object-level fine-grained interpretation, which prevents full utilization of rich semantic and structural information in remote sensing images.

Method: Proposed DescribeEarth, a Multi-modal Large Language Model architecture with scale-adaptive focal strategy and domain-guided fusion module that leverages remote sensing vision-language model features to encode high-resolution details and category priors while maintaining global context.

Result: DescribeEarth consistently outperforms state-of-the-art general MLLMs on DE-Benchmark, demonstrating superior factual accuracy, descriptive richness, and grammatical soundness, particularly in capturing intrinsic object features and environmental attributes across various remote sensing scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed Geo-DLC task, DE-Dataset, DE-Benchmark, and DescribeEarth model successfully address the limitation of existing image-level captioning by enabling object-level fine-grained interpretation of remote sensing images.

Abstract: Automated textual description of remote sensing images is crucial for
unlocking their full potential in diverse applications, from environmental
monitoring to urban planning and disaster management. However, existing studies
in remote sensing image captioning primarily focus on the image level, lacking
object-level fine-grained interpretation, which prevents the full utilization
and transformation of the rich semantic and structural information contained in
remote sensing images. To address this limitation, we propose Geo-DLC, a novel
task of object-level fine-grained image captioning for remote sensing. To
support this task, we construct DE-Dataset, a large-scale dataset contains 25
categories and 261,806 annotated instances with detailed descriptions of object
attributes, relationships, and contexts. Furthermore, we introduce
DE-Benchmark, a LLM-assisted question-answering based evaluation suite designed
to systematically measure model capabilities on the Geo-DLC task. We also
present DescribeEarth, a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) architecture
explicitly designed for Geo-DLC, which integrates a scale-adaptive focal
strategy and a domain-guided fusion module leveraging remote sensing
vision-language model features to encode high-resolution details and remote
sensing category priors while maintaining global context. Our DescribeEarth
model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art general MLLMs on DE-Benchmark,
demonstrating superior factual accuracy, descriptive richness, and grammatical
soundness, particularly in capturing intrinsic object features and surrounding
environmental attributes across simple, complex, and even out-of-distribution
remote sensing scenarios. All data, code and weights are released at

TL;DR: A YOLO-based deep learning model with ConSinGAN data augmentation achieves 91.3% accuracy for automated defect detection in metal sheets, with YOLOv9 performing best among tested versions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve time-consuming and labor-intensive defect detection tasks in industrial manufacturing through automated optical inspection.

Method: Used YOLO models (v3, v4, v7, v9) combined with ConSinGAN for data augmentation to address limited metal sheet image dataset, then integrated into manufacturing hardware and SCADA system.

Result: YOLOv9 with ConSinGAN achieved 91.3% accuracy with 146 ms detection time, outperforming other YOLO versions.

Conclusion: The proposed YOLOv9 model with data augmentation successfully establishes a practical automated optical inspection system that can be easily applied to other industrial components.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a YOLO-based deep learning (DL) model for automatic
defect detection to solve the time-consuming and labor-intensive tasks in
industrial manufacturing. In our experiments, the images of metal sheets are
used as the dataset for training the YOLO model to detect the defects on the
surfaces and in the holes of metal sheets. However, the lack of metal sheet
images significantly degrades the performance of detection accuracy. To address
this issue, the ConSinGAN is used to generate a considerable amount of data.
Four versions of the YOLO model (i.e., YOLOv3, v4, v7, and v9) are combined
with the ConSinGAN for data augmentation. The proposed YOLOv9 model with
ConSinGAN outperforms the other YOLO models with an accuracy of 91.3%, and a
detection time of 146 ms. The proposed YOLOv9 model is integrated into
manufacturing hardware and a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)
system to establish a practical automated optical inspection (AOI) system.
Additionally, the proposed automated defect detection is easily applied to
other components in industrial manufacturing.

### [27] [OmniDFA: A Unified Framework for Open Set Synthesis Image Detection and Few-Shot Attribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25682)
*Shiyu Wu,Shuyan Li,Jing Li,Jing Liu,Yequan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes OmniDFA framework for AI-generated image detection and few-shot source attribution, addressing challenges of model diversity and data scarcity with a new open-set paradigm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI-generated image detection methods overfit to specific forgery traits, while source attribution faces limitations due to scarce well-categorized synthetic datasets, restricting practical applications.

Method: Introduces OmniDFA framework with open-set, few-shot source identification paradigm, and constructs OmniFake dataset with 1.17M images from 45 generative models to enable reliable identification of unseen generators using limited samples.

Result: OmniDFA demonstrates excellent capability in open-set attribution and achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance on AI-generated image detection.

Conclusion: The proposed framework and dataset provide effective solutions for real-world AI-generated image detection and source attribution, with promising generalization capabilities.

Abstract: AI-generated image (AIGI) detection and source model attribution remain
central challenges in combating deepfake abuses, primarily due to the
structural diversity of generative models. Current detection methods are prone
to overfitting specific forgery traits, whereas source attribution offers a
robust alternative through fine-grained feature discrimination. However,
synthetic image attribution remains constrained by the scarcity of large-scale,
well-categorized synthetic datasets, limiting its practicality and
compatibility with detection systems. In this work, we propose a new paradigm
for image attribution called open-set, few-shot source identification. This
paradigm is designed to reliably identify unseen generators using only limited
samples, making it highly suitable for real-world application. To this end, we
introduce OmniDFA (Omni Detector and Few-shot Attributor), a novel framework
for AIGI that not only assesses the authenticity of images, but also determines
the synthesis origins in a few-shot manner. To facilitate this work, we
construct OmniFake, a large class-aware synthetic image dataset that curates
$1.17$ M images from $45$ distinct generative models, substantially enriching
the foundational resources for research on both AIGI detection and attribution.
Experiments demonstrate that OmniDFA exhibits excellent capability in open-set
attribution and achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance on AIGI
detection. Our dataset and code will be made available.

*Xiping Li,Jianghong Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AIMCoT is an active information-driven multimodal chain-of-thought framework that improves vision-language reasoning through reliable attention maps, proactive visual selection, and dynamic triggering mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal CoT methods rely on unreliable attention maps and passive selection strategies that fail to capture the model's cognitive needs for information during reasoning.

Method: AIMCoT introduces three components: Context-enhanced Attention-map Generation for reliable attention maps, Active Visual Probing for goal-oriented image region selection using information theory, and Dynamic Attention-shifting Trigger for optimal timing of visual information insertion.

Result: Extensive experiments on three challenging benchmarks show AIMCoT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across different settings.

Conclusion: AIMCoT represents a critical step towards more robust, effective, and human-like multimodal reasoning by actively foraging for information and dynamically structuring the reasoning process.

Abstract: Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has emerged as a powerful technique for
enhancing the vision-language reasoning with interleaved information. However,
existing methods often rely on simplistic heuristics for constructing
interleaved CoT, typically depending on attention maps, which our empirical
analysis reveals can be unreliable. What's more, the shortcomings of their
passive and purposeless selection strategies and their arbitrary triggering
mechanisms in capturing the model's cognitive need for information are further
amplified. In this paper, we propose \textbf{AIMCoT}, an \textbf{A}ctive
\textbf{I}nformation-driven \textbf{M}ulti-modal
\textbf{C}hain-\textbf{o}f-\textbf{T}hought framework that addresses these
fundamental limitations. AIMCoT introduces three synergistic components: (1)
\textbf{Context-enhanced Attention-map Generation (CAG)}, which mitigates the
text-vision granularity imbalance, thereby producing more reliable attention
maps as a foundation. (2) \textbf{Active Visual Probing (AVP)}, which replaces
passive selection with a proactive, goal-oriented strategy grounded in
information theory to select image regions that help answer the questions
maximally. (3) \textbf{Dynamic Attention-shifting Trigger (DAT)}, which
intelligently determines the optimal moments to insert visual information by
monitoring the model's text-to-vision attention shifts. Extensive experiments
on three challenging benchmarks demonstrate that AIMCoT significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across different settings. By actively
foraging for information and dynamically structuring its reasoning process,
AIMCoT represents a critical step towards more robust, effective, and
human-like multimodal reasoning. Our code is available at

### [29] [How Diffusion Models Memorize](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25705)
*Juyeop Kim,Songkuk Kim,Jong-Seok Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diffusion models memorize training data due to early overestimation during denoising, which collapses trajectories and accelerates convergence toward memorized images, rather than just overfitting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why and how diffusion models memorize training data, addressing privacy and copyright concerns by analyzing the fundamental mechanisms behind memorization.

Method: Analyzed diffusion and denoising processes, latent space dynamics, and the effects of classifier-free guidance on predictions and trajectory convergence.

Result: Memorization is driven by overestimation of training samples early in denoising, which reduces diversity, collapses trajectories, and accelerates convergence, with deviations from theoretical schedules correlating with memorization severity.

Conclusion: Early overestimation is the central mechanism of memorization in diffusion models, not just overfitting, providing insights for mitigating privacy and copyright risks.

Abstract: Despite their success in image generation, diffusion models can memorize
training data, raising serious privacy and copyright concerns. Although prior
work has sought to characterize, detect, and mitigate memorization, the
fundamental question of why and how it occurs remains unresolved. In this
paper, we revisit the diffusion and denoising process and analyze latent space
dynamics to address the question: "How do diffusion models memorize?" We show
that memorization is driven by the overestimation of training samples during
early denoising, which reduces diversity, collapses denoising trajectories, and
accelerates convergence toward the memorized image. Specifically: (i)
memorization cannot be explained by overfitting alone, as training loss is
larger under memorization due to classifier-free guidance amplifying
predictions and inducing overestimation; (ii) memorized prompts inject training
images into noise predictions, forcing latent trajectories to converge and
steering denoising toward their paired samples; and (iii) a decomposition of
intermediate latents reveals how initial randomness is quickly suppressed and
replaced by memorized content, with deviations from the theoretical denoising
schedule correlating almost perfectly with memorization severity. Together,
these results identify early overestimation as the central underlying mechanism
of memorization in diffusion models.

*Yuan Gao,Sangwook Kim,Jianzhong You,Chris McIntosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProbMED is a probabilistic multimodal medical vision-language model that uses probabilistic contrastive learning to handle many-to-many modality mappings, outperforming current Med-VLPMs in cross-modality retrieval and classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical vision-language pretraining models fail to account for many-to-many mappings between medical modalities (imaging to clinical narratives), which is essential for comprehensive medical decision-making.

Method: Uses probabilistic contrastive learning with InfoNCE loss and Hellinger distance to model embedding distributions, aligns four modalities (chest X-rays, ECG, echocardiograms, clinical text) into unified probabilistic space, and introduces probabilistic synthetic sampling loss for intra-modality binding.

Result: Outperforms current Med-VLPMs across 13 medical datasets in cross-modality retrieval, zero-shot, and few-shot classification, with improved intra- and inter-medical modality binding for prognostication.

Conclusion: ProbMED successfully addresses the many-to-many modality mapping problem in medical AI through probabilistic embedding modeling, demonstrating superior performance and robust multimodal integration.

Abstract: Medical decision-making requires integrating diverse medical information,
from imaging to clinical narratives. These medical modalities are often
acquired in a many-to-many manner. However, current medical vision-language
pretraining models (Med-VLPMs) fail to directly account for this many-to-many
mapping in their model training and embeddings. To address this, we present
Probabilistic Modality-Enhanced Diagnosis (ProbMED), a multimodal Med-VLPM that
employs probabilistic contrastive learning to model distributions over
embeddings rather than deterministic estimates. ProbMED aligns four distinct
modalities -- chest X-rays, electrocardiograms, echocardiograms, and clinical
text -- into a unified probabilistic embedding space. We use InfoNCE loss with
Hellinger distance to integrate inter-modality distributions. We introduce a
probabilistic synthetic sampling loss that captures modality-specific mean and
variance to improve intra-modality binding. Extensive experiments across 13
medical datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms current Med-VLPMs in
cross-modality retrieval, zero-shot, and few-shot classification. We also
demonstrate the robust integration of multiple modalities for prognostication,
showing improved intra- and inter-medical modality binding.

*Xintong Li,Chuhan Wang,Junda Wu,Rohan Surana,Tong Yu,Julian McAuley,Jingbo Shang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MISP-DPO is a multimodal DPO framework that uses multiple semantically diverse negative images via Plackett-Luce model to address limitations of existing methods that rely on oversimplified pairwise comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal DPO methods use oversimplified pairwise comparisons with single negative images from basic perturbations or similarity-based retrieval, which fail to capture complex multimodal preferences and cause optimization bias and hallucinations.

Method: Embeds prompts and images in CLIP space, applies sparse autoencoder to uncover semantic deviations, selects negative samples based on reconstruction difficulty, semantic deviation from positive, and mutual diversity, and uses Plackett-Luce objective with importance sampling.

Result: Experiments across five benchmarks show MISP-DPO consistently improves multimodal alignment over prior methods.

Conclusion: Semantic-aware, multi-negative sampling is effective for preference-based learning in multimodal DPO.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently been extended from
text-only models to vision-language models. However, existing methods rely on
oversimplified pairwise comparisons, generating a single negative image via
basic perturbations or similarity-based retrieval, which fail to capture the
complex nature of multimodal preferences, inducing optimization bias and
hallucinations. To address this issue, we propose MISP-DPO, the first framework
to incorporate multiple, semantically diverse negative images in multimodal DPO
via the Plackett-Luce model. Our method embeds prompts and candidate images in
CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) space and applies a sparse
autoencoder to uncover semantic deviations into interpretable factors. Negative
samples are selected based on reconstruction difficulty, semantic deviation
from the positive, and mutual diversity, yielding broader and more informative
supervision. To handle multi-negative comparisons, we adopt a Plackett-Luce
objective and introduce an importance sampling strategy that improves training
efficiency. Experiments across five diverse benchmarks demonstrate that
MISP-DPO consistently improves multimodal alignment over prior methods,
validating the effectiveness of semantic-aware, multi-negative sampling in
preference-based learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAGE is a unified training pipeline for Visual Place Recognition that enhances spatial-visual discrimination through local feature aggregation, geo-visual graph reconstruction, and hard sample mining, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior VPR methods neglect the dynamic interplay between spatial context and visual similarity during training, focusing only on descriptor fine-tuning or fixed sampling strategies.

Method: SAGE introduces a Soft Probing module for patch descriptor weighting, reconstructs an online geo-visual graph that fuses geographic proximity and visual similarity, and uses greedy weighted clique expansion for hard sample mining with a frozen DINOv2 backbone and parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

Result: Achieves SOTA across eight benchmarks: 98.9% Recall@1 on SPED, 95.8% on Pitts30k-test, 94.5% on MSLS-val, and 96.0% on Nordland. Notably obtains 100% Recall@10 on SPED using only 4096D global descriptors.

Conclusion: SAGE demonstrates that jointly improving local feature aggregation, organizing samples during training, and hard sample mining through a unified pipeline significantly enhances VPR performance across diverse challenging benchmarks.

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) requires robust retrieval of geotagged images
despite large appearance, viewpoint, and environmental variation. Prior methods
focus on descriptor fine-tuning or fixed sampling strategies yet neglect the
dynamic interplay between spatial context and visual similarity during
training. We present SAGE (Spatial-visual Adaptive Graph Exploration), a
unified training pipeline that enhances granular spatial-visual discrimination
by jointly improving local feature aggregation, organize samples during
training, and hard sample mining. We introduce a lightweight Soft Probing
module that learns residual weights from training data for patch descriptors
before bilinear aggregation, boosting distinctive local cues. During training
we reconstruct an online geo-visual graph that fuses geographic proximity and
current visual similarity so that candidate neighborhoods reflect the evolving
embedding landscape. To concentrate learning on the most informative place
neighborhoods, we seed clusters from high-affinity anchors and iteratively
expand them with a greedy weighted clique expansion sampler. Implemented with a
frozen DINOv2 backbone and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, SAGE achieves SOTA
across eight benchmarks. It attains 98.9%, 95.8%, 94.5%, and 96.0% Recall@1 on
SPED, Pitts30k-test, MSLS-val, and Nordland, respectively. Notably, our method
obtains 100% Recall@10 on SPED only using 4096D global descriptors. Code and

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LaTo is a landmark-tokenized diffusion transformer for fine-grained, identity-preserving face editing that addresses limitations in precise attribute control and identity preservation through landmark tokenization, unified positional encoding, and improved landmark prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal models for instruction-based face editing struggle with precise attribute control and identity preservation, especially when conditional landmarks deviate significantly from the source due to large expression/pose changes or inaccurate landmark estimates.

Method: Proposes LaTo with three key innovations: (1) landmark tokenizer that quantizes raw landmark coordinates into discrete facial tokens, (2) location-mapping positional encoding that integrates facial and image tokens for unified processing, and (3) landmark predictor using vision-language models with structured chain-of-thought for accurate target landmark inference.

Result: LaTo outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 7.8% in identity preservation and 4.6% in semantic consistency. Created HFL-150K dataset with over 150K real face pairs for training.

Conclusion: LaTo enables fine-grained, identity-preserving face editing through landmark tokenization and unified processing, achieving superior performance in both identity preservation and semantic consistency compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Recent multimodal models for instruction-based face editing enable semantic
manipulation but still struggle with precise attribute control and identity
preservation. Structural facial representations such as landmarks are effective
for intermediate supervision, yet most existing methods treat them as rigid
geometric constraints, which can degrade identity when conditional landmarks
deviate significantly from the source (e.g., large expression or pose changes,
inaccurate landmark estimates). To address these limitations, we propose LaTo,
a landmark-tokenized diffusion transformer for fine-grained,
identity-preserving face editing. Our key innovations include: (1) a landmark
tokenizer that directly quantizes raw landmark coordinates into discrete facial
tokens, obviating the need for dense pixel-wise correspondence; (2) a
location-mapping positional encoding that integrates facial and image tokens
for unified processing, enabling flexible yet decoupled geometry-appearance
interactions with high efficiency and strong identity preservation; and (3) a
landmark predictor that leverages vision-language models to infer target
landmarks from instructions and source images, whose structured
chain-of-thought improves estimation accuracy and interactive control. To
mitigate data scarcity, we curate HFL-150K, to our knowledge the largest
benchmark for this task, containing over 150K real face pairs with fine-grained
instructions. Extensive experiments show that LaTo outperforms state-of-the-art
methods by 7.8% in identity preservation and 4.6% in semantic consistency. Code
and dataset will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

Motivation: Video Object Segmentation remains challenging in complex real-world scenarios with long-term object disappearances/reappearances and small objects. The MOSEv1 dataset specifically targets these robustness challenges.

Method: Freeze SAM2 feature extractor during training, fine-tune other components. Use confidence-guided fusion segmentation with pixel-check strategy during inference to progressively refine predictions by combining multiple models.

Result: Achieved J&F score of 86.37% on test set, ranking 1st in MOSEv1 Challenge at LSVOS 2025.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses VOS challenges in complex scenarios through confidence-guided fusion and multi-model complementary strengths.

Abstract: Video Object Segmentation (VOS) aims to track and segment specific objects
across entire video sequences, yet it remains highly challenging under complex
real-world scenarios. The MOSEv1 and LVOS dataset, adopted in the MOSEv1
challenge on LSVOS 2025, which is specifically designed to enhance the
robustness of VOS models in complex real-world scenarios, including long-term
object disappearances and reappearances, as well as the presence of small and
inconspicuous objects. In this paper, we present our improved method,
Confidence-Guided Fusion Segmentation (CGFSeg), for the VOS task in the MOSEv1
Challenge. During training, the feature extractor of SAM2 is frozen, while the
remaining components are fine-tuned to preserve strong feature extraction
ability and improve segmentation accuracy. In the inference stage, we introduce
a pixel-check strategy that progressively refines predictions by exploiting
complementary strengths of multiple models, thereby yielding robust final
masks. As a result, our method achieves a J&F score of 86.37% on the test set,
ranking 1st in the MOSEv1 Challenge at LSVOS 2025. These results highlight the
effectiveness of our approach in addressing the challenges of VOS task in
complex scenarios.

*Donghwan Kim,Tae-Kyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a novel SO(3) diffusion model for Human Mesh Recovery that generates pose probability distributions instead of single deterministic outputs, addressing the inherent ambiguity in 3D pose estimation from 2D images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HMR methods either produce single deterministic outputs that ignore the inherent ambiguity in 3D pose estimation from 2D images, or probabilistic methods that trade off accuracy for diversity. There's a need for methods that can model well-aligned distributions to 2D observations while maintaining competitive accuracy.

Method: Introduces SO(3) diffusion model that generates pose parameter distributions represented as 3D rotations, using conditioning dropout for both unconditional and image-conditional generation. Uses transformer to learn hierarchical joint structure and MLP-based denoising model for per-joint distribution learning.

Result: The model effectively predicts accurate pose probability distributions, addressing the accuracy-diversity trade-off in existing probabilistic methods.

Conclusion: The proposed SO(3) diffusion model successfully models well-aligned pose distributions to 2D observations, providing both accurate and diverse 3D human pose predictions from single RGB images.

Abstract: We tackle the problem of Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) from a single RGB image,
formulating it as an image-conditioned human pose and shape generation. While
recovering 3D human pose from 2D observations is inherently ambiguous, most
existing approaches have regressed a single deterministic output. Probabilistic
methods attempt to address this by generating multiple plausible outputs to
model the ambiguity. However, these methods often exhibit a trade-off between
accuracy and sample diversity, and their single predictions are not competitive
with state-of-the-art deterministic models. To overcome these limitations, we
propose a novel approach that models well-aligned distribution to 2D
observations. In particular, we introduce $SO(3)$ diffusion model, which
generates the distribution of pose parameters represented as 3D rotations
unconditional and conditional to image observations via conditioning dropout.
Our model learns the hierarchical structure of human body joints using the
transformer. Instead of using transformer as a denoising model, the
time-independent transformer extracts latent vectors for the joints and a small
MLP-based denoising model learns the per-joint distribution conditioned on the
latent vector. We experimentally demonstrate and analyze that our model
predicts accurate pose probability distribution effectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing drag-based image editing methods primarily operate on 2D pixel planes with limited 3D cues, leading to imprecise and inconsistent edits in geometry-intensive scenarios such as rotations and perspective transformations.

Method: Built upon a unified displacement field that jointly encodes 3D geometry and 2D spatial priors, with a conflict-free partitioning strategy to isolate editing regions and prevent interference.

Result: Extensive experiments show superior precision, structural consistency, and reliable multi-point editability across various editing scenarios.

Conclusion: GeoDrag enables coherent, high-fidelity, and structure-consistent editing in a single forward pass by effectively incorporating 3D geometric guidance while mitigating discontinuities and multi-point conflicts.

Abstract: Interactive point-based image editing serves as a controllable editor,
enabling precise and flexible manipulation of image content. However, most
drag-based methods operate primarily on the 2D pixel plane with limited use of
3D cues. As a result, they often produce imprecise and inconsistent edits,
particularly in geometry-intensive scenarios such as rotations and perspective
transformations. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
geometry-guided drag-based image editing method - GeoDrag, which addresses
three key challenges: 1) incorporating 3D geometric cues into pixel-level
editing, 2) mitigating discontinuities caused by geometry-only guidance, and 3)
resolving conflicts arising from multi-point dragging. Built upon a unified
displacement field that jointly encodes 3D geometry and 2D spatial priors,
GeoDrag enables coherent, high-fidelity, and structure-consistent editing in a
single forward pass. In addition, a conflict-free partitioning strategy is
introduced to isolate editing regions, effectively preventing interference and
ensuring consistency. Extensive experiments across various editing scenarios
validate the effectiveness of our method, showing superior precision,
structural consistency, and reliable multi-point editability. The code will be

TL;DR: IPDRecon is an image-plane decoding framework that reduces dependency on multi-view geometric constraints by exploiting rich spatial information within individual views for robust indoor scene reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing volume-based reconstruction methods rely heavily on multi-view pixel back-projection ray intersections, causing poor performance in overlapping regions and unobserved areas, especially when view density is low.

Method: Proposes IPDRecon with three core components: Pixel-level Confidence Encoder (PCE), Affine Compensation Module (ACM), and Image-Plane Spatial Decoder (IPSD) to decode 3D structural information from 2D images while preserving spatial geometric features.

Result: Achieves superior reconstruction stability on ScanNetV2, maintaining nearly identical quality with 40% fewer views, with coefficient of variation of 0.24%, performance retention rate of 99.7%, and maximum performance drop of only 0.42%.

Conclusion: Exploiting intra-view spatial information provides a robust solution for view-limited scenarios in practical applications, significantly enhancing view-invariant reconstruction.

Abstract: Volume-based indoor scene reconstruction methods demonstrate significant
research value due to their superior generalization capability and real-time
deployment potential. However, existing methods rely on multi-view pixel
back-projection ray intersections as weak geometric constraints to determine
spatial positions, causing reconstruction quality to depend heavily on input
view density with poor performance in overlapping regions and unobserved areas.
To address these issues, the key lies in reducing dependency on inter-view
geometric constraints while exploiting rich spatial information within
individual views. We propose IPDRecon, an image-plane decoding framework
comprising three core components: Pixel-level Confidence Encoder (PCE), Affine
Compensation Module (ACM), and Image-Plane Spatial Decoder (IPSD). These
modules collaboratively decode 3D structural information encoded in 2D images
through physical imaging processes, effectively preserving spatial geometric
features including edges, hollow structures, and complex textures while
significantly enhancing view-invariant reconstruction. Experiments on ScanNetV2
confirm that IPDRecon achieves superior reconstruction stability, maintaining
nearly identical quality when view count reduces by 40%. The method achieves a
coefficient of variation of only 0.24%, performance retention rate of 99.7%,
and maximum performance drop of merely 0.42%. This demonstrates that exploiting
intra-view spatial information provides a robust solution for view-limited
scenarios in practical applications.

Motivation: To establish baselines for financial short-form video captioning and understand how multimodal large language models can reason over different modality combinations for various financial topics.

Method: Tested all seven modality combinations (T, A, V, TA, TV, AV, TAV) across 624 annotated YouTube short-form videos for five financial topics using multimodal large language models.

Result: Video alone performs strongly on four of five topics. Selective modality pairs like TV or AV often surpass the full TAV combination, suggesting too many modalities may introduce noise.

Conclusion: Establishes first baselines for financial short-form video captioning, highlighting video's importance for visual context and the potential challenges of grounding complex visual cues in this domain.

Abstract: We evaluate multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for topic-aligned
captioning in financial short-form videos (SVs) by testing joint reasoning over
transcripts (T), audio (A), and video (V). Using 624 annotated YouTube SVs, we
assess all seven modality combinations (T, A, V, TA, TV, AV, TAV) across five
topics: main recommendation, sentiment analysis, video purpose, visual
analysis, and financial entity recognition. Video alone performs strongly on
four of five topics, underscoring its value for capturing visual context and
effective cues such as emotions, gestures, and body language. Selective pairs
such as TV or AV often surpass TAV, implying that too many modalities may
introduce noise. These results establish the first baselines for financial

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ultrasound faces challenges in AI integration due to operator dependence, image noise, and real-time scanning complexities. Existing large multimodal models struggle with ultrasound's unique characteristics, creating a need for specialized foundation models.

Method: Curated a 2-million-scale multimodal dataset combining textbook knowledge, public data, synthetic samples, and general corpora. Employed three-stage training: domain-specialized pretraining, instruction-driven alignment, and reinforcement-based refinement. Dolphin R1 specifically uses reinforcement learning with ultrasound-specific rewards.

Result: Dolphin R1 achieves a U2-score of 0.5835 on U2-Bench across eight ultrasound tasks - over twice the second-best model (0.2968). Dolphin v1.0 also performs competitively. Reasoning-enhanced training significantly improves diagnostic accuracy, consistency, and interpretability.

Conclusion: The Dolphin series establishes a new state-of-the-art for ultrasound AI, demonstrating that unified multimodal frameworks with reasoning enhancement are crucial for high-stakes medical AI applications, particularly in handling ultrasound's variability and noise challenges.

Abstract: Ultrasound is crucial in modern medicine but faces challenges like operator

employs a three-stage training strategy: domain-specialized pretraining,

### [40] [ART-VITON: Measurement-Guided Latent Diffusion for Artifact-Free Virtual Try-On](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25749)
*Junseo Park,Hyeryung Jang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ART-VITON is a measurement-guided diffusion framework for virtual try-on that preserves identity and background in non-try-on regions while eliminating boundary artifacts through trajectory-aligned solvers and frequency-level correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing virtual try-on methods using latent diffusion models struggle with preserving non-try-on regions and often produce boundary artifacts when directly replacing these regions with original content.

Method: Reformulates VITON as a linear inverse problem and uses trajectory-aligned solvers with residual prior-based initialization and artifact-free measurement-guided sampling that combines data consistency, frequency-level correction, and periodic standard denoising.

Result: Experiments on VITON-HD, DressCode, and SHHQ-1.0 show effective preservation of identity and background, elimination of boundary artifacts, and improved visual fidelity and robustness over state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: ART-VITON successfully addresses the challenges of preserving non-try-on regions in virtual try-on by ensuring measurement adherence while maintaining artifact-free synthesis through a novel diffusion framework.

Abstract: Virtual try-on (VITON) aims to generate realistic images of a person wearing
a target garment, requiring precise garment alignment in try-on regions and
faithful preservation of identity and background in non-try-on regions. While
latent diffusion models (LDMs) have advanced alignment and detail synthesis,
preserving non-try-on regions remains challenging. A common post-hoc strategy
directly replaces these regions with original content, but abrupt transitions
often produce boundary artifacts. To overcome this, we reformulate VITON as a
linear inverse problem and adopt trajectory-aligned solvers that progressively
enforce measurement consistency, reducing abrupt changes in non-try-on regions.
However, existing solvers still suffer from semantic drift during generation,
leading to artifacts. We propose ART-VITON, a measurement-guided diffusion
framework that ensures measurement adherence while maintaining artifact-free
synthesis. Our method integrates residual prior-based initialization to
mitigate training-inference mismatch and artifact-free measurement-guided
sampling that combines data consistency, frequency-level correction, and
periodic standard denoising. Experiments on VITON-HD, DressCode, and SHHQ-1.0
demonstrate that ART-VITON effectively preserves identity and background,
eliminates boundary artifacts, and consistently improves visual fidelity and
robustness over state-of-the-art baselines.

*Jia Jun Cheng Xian,Muchen Li,Haotian Yang,Xin Tao,Pengfei Wan,Leonid Sigal,Renjie Liao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TPO is a framework for aligning text-to-image models without needing paired image preference data by training models to prefer matched prompts over mismatched prompts generated by LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLHF methods for text-to-image alignment require costly human annotations and paired image preference data, limiting scalability. TPO addresses this by enabling alignment without such data.

Method: TPO trains models to prefer matched prompts over mismatched prompts constructed by perturbing original captions using large language models. The framework extends DPO and KTO to create TDPO and TKTO variants.

Result: Quantitative and qualitative evaluations across multiple benchmarks show TPO methods consistently outperform original counterparts, achieving better human preference scores and improved text-to-image alignment.

Conclusion: TPO provides a scalable 'free-lunch' alignment approach for text-to-image models that eliminates the need for costly human annotations while improving alignment performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models have led to
remarkable success in generating high-quality images from textual prompts.
However, ensuring accurate alignment between the text and the generated image
remains a significant challenge for state-of-the-art diffusion models. To
address this, existing studies employ reinforcement learning with human
feedback (RLHF) to align T2I outputs with human preferences. These methods,
however, either rely directly on paired image preference data or require a
learned reward function, both of which depend heavily on costly, high-quality
human annotations and thus face scalability limitations. In this work, we
introduce Text Preference Optimization (TPO), a framework that enables
"free-lunch" alignment of T2I models, achieving alignment without the need for
paired image preference data. TPO works by training the model to prefer matched
prompts over mismatched prompts, which are constructed by perturbing original
captions using a large language model. Our framework is general and compatible
with existing preference-based algorithms. We extend both DPO and KTO to our
setting, resulting in TDPO and TKTO. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations
across multiple benchmarks show that our methods consistently outperform their
original counterparts, delivering better human preference scores and improved
text-to-image alignment. Our Open-source code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: v-HUB is a visual-centric video humor understanding benchmark for evaluating multimodal large language models' ability to comprehend humor from visual cues alone, using minimally verbal short videos from silent films and online resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and diagnose the capacity of MLLMs for humor understanding, which has real-world applications like enhancing engagement in human-machine interactions.

Method: Created v-HUB benchmark with curated short videos from silent films and online resources, paired with rich annotations (captions, descriptions, explanations). Evaluated diverse MLLMs including specialized Video-LLMs and versatile OmniLLMs that can process audio.

Result: MLLMs struggle to comprehend humor from visual cues alone, with all models showing significant performance drop on caption matching when moving from text-based to video-based evaluation without audio. Audio incorporation helps with video humor understanding.

Conclusion: Current MLLMs face difficulties in visual humor comprehension, and incorporating audio shows promise for improving performance, highlighting the importance of richer modalities for complex video understanding tasks.

Abstract: AI models capable of comprehending humor hold real-world promise -- for
example, enhancing engagement in human-machine interactions. To gauge and
diagnose the capacity of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for humor
understanding, we introduce v-HUB, a novel visual-centric video humor
understanding benchmark. v-HUB comprises a curated collection of minimally
verbal short videos, sourced from classic silent films and online resources,
and reflecting real-world scenarios where humor can be appreciated purely
through visual cues. Each video clip is paired with rich annotations, including
captions, descriptions, and explanations, supporting evaluation tasks like
caption matching and humor explanation. To broaden its applicability, we
further construct an open-ended video QA task, making it readily integrable
into existing video understanding benchmarks. We evaluate a diverse set of
MLLMs, from specialized Video-LLMs to versatile OmniLLMs that can process
audio, covering both open-source and proprietary domains. The experimental
results expose the difficulties MLLMs face in comprehending humor from visual
cues alone. For example, all models exhibit a marked performance drop on
caption matching when moving from text-based to video-based evaluation (without
audio). Our findings also demonstrate that incorporating audio helps with video
humor understanding, highlighting the informativeness of sound and the promise
of integrating richer modalities for complex video understanding tasks.

*Jeongjae Lee,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PCPO addresses training instability in text-to-image model alignment by enforcing proportional credit assignment, leading to faster convergence and better image quality than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current policy gradient methods for text-to-image model alignment suffer from training instability and high variance due to disproportionate credit assignment in the generative sampler, which hampers convergence and image quality.

Method: Proportionate Credit Policy Optimization (PCPO) framework that enforces proportional credit assignment through stable objective reformulation and principled timestep reweighting.

Result: PCPO stabilizes training, accelerates convergence significantly, improves image quality by mitigating model collapse, and outperforms all existing policy gradient baselines including state-of-the-art DanceGRPO.

Conclusion: PCPO successfully addresses the fundamental issue of disproportionate credit assignment in text-to-image model alignment, providing a more stable and effective training approach that delivers superior performance across all metrics.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning has advanced the alignment of text-to-image
(T2I) models, state-of-the-art policy gradient methods are still hampered by
training instability and high variance, hindering convergence speed and
compromising image quality. Our analysis identifies a key cause of this
instability: disproportionate credit assignment, in which the mathematical
structure of the generative sampler produces volatile and non-proportional
feedback across timesteps. To address this, we introduce Proportionate Credit
Policy Optimization (PCPO), a framework that enforces proportional credit
assignment through a stable objective reformulation and a principled
reweighting of timesteps. This correction stabilizes the training process,
leading to significantly accelerated convergence and superior image quality.
The improvement in quality is a direct result of mitigating model collapse, a
common failure mode in recursive training. PCPO substantially outperforms
existing policy gradient baselines on all fronts, including the
state-of-the-art DanceGRPO.

*Mingyu Kang,Yong Suk Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ENM Inversion is a novel noise map inversion technique for text-guided image editing that ensures both content preservation and editability by searching for optimal noise maps and refining them to align with desired edits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous inversion methods for text-guided image editing struggle to adhere closely to target text prompts because inverted noise maps, while enabling faithful reconstruction of source images, restrict the flexibility needed for desired edits.

Method: The method analyzes properties of noise maps for enhanced editability and introduces an editable noise refinement that minimizes the difference between reconstructed and edited noise maps to align with desired edits.

Result: Extensive experiments show that ENM Inversion outperforms existing approaches across a wide range of image editing tasks in both preservation and edit fidelity with target prompts. The approach can also be applied to video editing with temporal consistency.

Conclusion: ENM Inversion successfully overcomes the limitations of previous inversion methods by providing optimal noise maps that balance content preservation and editability, enabling effective text-guided image and video editing.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating
high-quality and diverse images. Building on these advancements, diffusion
models have also demonstrated exceptional performance in text-guided image
editing. A key strategy for effective image editing involves inverting the
source image into editable noise maps associated with the target image.
However, previous inversion methods face challenges in adhering closely to the
target text prompt. The limitation arises because inverted noise maps, while
enabling faithful reconstruction of the source image, restrict the flexibility
needed for desired edits. To overcome this issue, we propose Editable Noise Map
Inversion (ENM Inversion), a novel inversion technique that searches for
optimal noise maps to ensure both content preservation and editability. We
analyze the properties of noise maps for enhanced editability. Based on this
analysis, our method introduces an editable noise refinement that aligns with
the desired edits by minimizing the difference between the reconstructed and
edited noise maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ENM Inversion
outperforms existing approaches across a wide range of image editing tasks in
both preservation and edit fidelity with target prompts. Our approach can also
be easily applied to video editing, enabling temporal consistency and content
manipulation across frames.

*Wen Wen,Tianwu Zhi,Kanglong Fan,Yang Li,Xinge Peng,Yabin Zhang,Yiting Liao,Junlin Li,Li Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EvoQuality is a self-supervised framework that enables vision-language models to autonomously improve image quality assessment capabilities without ground-truth labels, using self-consistency and iterative evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for improving VLMs require costly human-annotated data, and self-supervised techniques haven't been well-explored for perceptual domains like image quality assessment.

Method: Adapts self-consistency to ranking-based IQA by generating pseudo-labels through pairwise majority voting on the VLM's own outputs, then uses these pseudo-rankings as fidelity rewards to guide iterative evolution via group relative policy optimization (GRPO).

Result: Boosts base VLM's zero-shot performance by 31.8% on PLCC across diverse IQA benchmarks, and achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art supervised VLM-based IQA models on 5 out of 7 benchmarks.

Conclusion: EvoQuality demonstrates that VLMs can autonomously refine their perceptual capabilities through self-supervised learning, achieving remarkable performance without requiring ground-truth labels.

Abstract: Improving vision-language models (VLMs) in the post-training stage typically
relies on supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, methods that
necessitate costly, human-annotated data. While self-supervised techniques such
as self-consistency have proven effective for enhancing reasoning capabilities,
their application to perceptual domains such as image quality assessment (IQA)
remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce EvoQuality, a novel
framework that enables a VLM to autonomously refine its quality perception
capabilities without any ground-truth labels. EvoQuality adapts the principle
of self-consistency to the ranking-based nature of IQA. It generates
pseudo-labels by performing pairwise majority voting on the VLM's own outputs
to establish a consensus on relative quality. These pseudo-rankings are then
formulated into a fidelity reward that guides the model's iterative evolution
through group relative policy optimization (GRPO). By iteratively leveraging
its own predictions, EvoQuality progressively refines the VLM's perceptual
capability. Extensive experiments show that EvoQuality boosts the base VLM's
zero-shot performance by 31.8\% on PLCC across diverse IQA benchmarks.
Remarkably, despite being entirely self-supervised, EvoQuality achieves
performance that is competitive with, or even surpasses, state-of-the-art
supervised VLM-based IQA models, outperforming these models on 5 out of 7 IQA
benchmarks.

TL;DR: EchoingECG is a probabilistic student-teacher model that uses ECG data to predict cardiac function measurements traditionally derived from echocardiograms, outperforming state-of-the-art ECG foundation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ECGs are low-cost and accessible, while echocardiograms require considerable hospital resources but are crucial for cardiac assessment. The goal is to use ECGs as a more accessible alternative to predict cardiac function measurements.

Method: A probabilistic student-teacher model that integrates Probabilistic Cross-Modal Embeddings (PCME++) with ECHO-CLIP (vision-language pre-trained model on ECHO-text pairs) to distill ECHO knowledge into ECG representations.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art foundation ECG models in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tune settings for ECHO predictions based on ECG. Variance estimation helps identify regions of uncertainty within ECGs.

Conclusion: EchoingECG successfully enables ECG-based prediction of cardiac function measurements traditionally requiring echocardiograms, with uncertainty estimation providing better performance understanding.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a widely used tool for assessing cardiac function
due to its low cost and accessibility. Emergent research shows that ECGs can
help make predictions on key outcomes traditionally derived from more complex
modalities such as echocardiograms (ECHO), enabling the use of ECGs as a more
accessible method to predict broader measurements of cardiac function. ECHO, in
particular, are of great importance because they require considerable hospital
resources while playing a key role in clinical cardiac assessment. To aid this
use case, we introduce EchoingECG, a probabilistic student-teacher model that
leverages uncertainty-aware ECG embeddings and ECHO supervision to improve
ECG-based cardiac function prediction. Our approach integrates Probabilistic
Cross-Modal Embeddings (PCME++), a probabilistic contrastive framework, with
ECHO-CLIP, a vision-language pre-trained model trained on ECHO-text pairs, to
distill ECHO knowledge into ECG representations. Through experiments and
external validation, we showed that EchoingECG outperforms state-of-the-art
foundation ECG models in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tune settings for ECHO
predictions based on ECG. We also highlighted that variance estimation (enabled
through our method) enhanced our understanding of model performance by
identifying underlying regions of uncertainty within ECGs. The code is

TL;DR: The Point-It-Out (PIO) benchmark evaluates Vision-Language Models' embodied reasoning through precise visual grounding across three stages: object localization, task-driven pointing, and visual trace prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks primarily use multiple-choice questions based on image annotations, which don't adequately assess embodied reasoning abilities through precise visual grounding.

Method: Proposed hierarchical evaluation protocol with three stages (S1: referred-object localization, S2: task-driven pointing, S3: visual trace prediction) using data from indoor, kitchen, driving, and robotic manipulation scenarios.

Result: Extensive experiments with 10+ VLMs reveal that strong general-purpose models like GPT-4o underperform in precise visual grounding compared to some open-source models, and models like MoLMO perform well in S1/S2 but struggle with S3's visual trace planning.

Conclusion: The PIO benchmark provides systematic assessment of VLMs' embodied reasoning through precise visual grounding, revealing important performance gaps in current models.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive world knowledge
across a wide range of tasks, making them promising candidates for embodied
reasoning applications. However, existing benchmarks primarily evaluate the
embodied reasoning ability of VLMs through multiple-choice questions based on
image annotations -- for example, selecting which trajectory better describes
an event in the image. In this work, we introduce the Point-It-Out (PIO)
benchmark, a novel benchmark designed to systematically assess the embodied
reasoning abilities of VLMs through precise visual grounding. We propose a
hierarchical evaluation protocol spanning three stages (S1: referred-object
localization, S2: task-driven pointing, and S3: visual trace prediction), with
data collected from critical domains for embodied intelligence, including
indoor, kitchen, driving, and robotic manipulation scenarios. Extensive
experiments with over ten state-of-the-art VLMs reveal several interesting
findings. For example, strong general-purpose models such as GPT-4o, while
excelling on many benchmarks (e.g., language, perception, and reasoning),
underperform compared to some open-source models in precise visual grounding;
models such as MoLMO perform well in S1 and S2 but struggle in S3, where
requires grounding combined with visual trace planning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DSGA, a dynamic similarity-based graph adaptation module that enables efficient fine-tuning of SAM for agricultural vision tasks with limited data, achieving superior segmentation performance for small dense objects like chickpea pods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning of foundation models for agricultural computer vision is challenging due to limited training data and complex field conditions, requiring methods that work under extreme data constraints.

Method: Proposes DSGA module with dynamic similarity graph construction using learnable polynomial decay-initialized weight ranking and adaptive local feature aggregation, combined with LoRA for complementary optimization of local and global dependencies.

Result: Achieved 17.31% improvement in Structure-measure and 62.36% gain in adaptive F-measure compared to baseline SAM fine-tuning, with only 4.00M trainable parameters (4.26% of original SAM). Demonstrated accurate pod-counting with adjusted R-squared of 0.8987.

Conclusion: The DSGA with LoRA framework provides effective parameter-efficient adaptation for agricultural monitoring, achieving robust performance in challenging field conditions with limited data.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of foundation models for agricultural
computer vision tasks remains challenging due to limited training data and
complex field conditions. This study introduces a Dynamic Similarity-based
Graph Adaptation (DSGA) module to adapt the Segment Anything Model (SAM) under
extreme data constraints for precise foreground and instance segmentation of
small dense objects in complex agricultural environments. Through dynamic
similarity graph construction with a learnable polynomial decay-initialized
weight ranking mechanism and adaptive local feature aggregation, DSGA
establishes robust spatial and dynamic similarity representation with only
4.00M trainable parameters, which is 4.26% of the original SAM. Integrating
this graph-based feature adaptation with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) creates a
complementary optimization framework that effectively captures both local and
global dependencies in image embeddings while preserving model stability and
parameter efficiency. Experimental results on a challenging chickpea pod
dataset demonstrated that DSGA with LoRA achieved superior performance across
multiple metrics evaluated under 2, 4, 8 and 10 shots, with progressive
performance gains as shot count increased. Quantitative metrics showed a 17.31%
improvement in Structure-measure and a 62.36% gain in adaptive F-measure
compared to the baseline SAM fine-tuning. Comprehensive ablation studies and
visualization analyses through Grad-CAM and t-SNE validated the framework's
effectiveness in feature discrimination. The proposed adaptation demonstrated
practical utility for automated agricultural monitoring applications, achieving
accurate pod-counting with an adjusted R-squared of 0.8987 for images with 10
to 120 pods under challenging field conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Logo-VGR introduces a new paradigm for open-world logo recognition by reformulating it as a comparison-based task rather than direct brand label generation, enabling generalization to large-scale brand recognition with minimal supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal large language models are primarily evaluated on general-purpose benchmarks, leaving domain-specific applications like product moderation underexplored. Traditional logo recognition methods are impractical for real-world settings as they require memorizing representations of tens of thousands of brands.

Method: Logo-VGR reformulates logo recognition as a comparison-based task where models match product images with candidate logos. It introduces Logo Perception Grounding to inject domain knowledge and Logo-Guided Visual Grounded Reasoning to enhance multimodal reasoning capabilities, preventing overfitting to brand distributions.

Result: Logo-VGR outperforms strong baselines by nearly 10 points in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, demonstrating superior generalization performance compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed Logo-VGR method effectively addresses the limitations of traditional logo recognition by enabling robust generalization to unseen brands through domain-specific multimodal reasoning, making it practical for real-world product moderation applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been
primarily evaluated on general-purpose benchmarks, while their applications in
domain-specific scenarios, such as intelligent product moderation, remain
underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce an open-world logo recognition
benchmark, a core challenge in product moderation. Unlike traditional logo
recognition methods that rely on memorizing representations of tens of
thousands of brands-an impractical approach in real-world settings-our proposed
method, Logo-VGR, enables generalization to large-scale brand recognition with
supervision from only a small subset of brands. Specifically, we reformulate
logo recognition as a comparison-based task, requiring the model to match
product images with candidate logos rather than directly generating brand
labels. We further observe that existing models tend to overfit by memorizing
brand distributions instead of learning robust multimodal reasoning, which
results in poor performance on unseen brands. To overcome this limitation,
Logo-VGR introduces a new paradigm of domain-specific multimodal reasoning:
Logo Perception Grounding injects domain knowledge, and Logo-Guided Visual
Grounded Reasoning enhances the model's reasoning capability. Experimental
results show that Logo-VGR outperforms strong baselines by nearly 10 points in
OOD settings, demonstrating superior generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance species distribution modeling using deep learning and remote sensing data, and understand spatio-temporal species distribution patterns for ecological and conservation purposes.

Method: Organized an open machine learning challenge using 5 million plant species observations with single positive labels, combined with high-resolution remote sensing imagery, land cover, elevation, and coarse-resolution climate, soil, and human footprint data. Evaluated models on multi-label classification of species composition in 22,000 small plots.

Result: Identified biases in methods trained with single positive labels when evaluated on multi-label tasks, and discovered effective learning strategies that combine both single and multi-label data during training.

Conclusion: The competition successfully advanced species distribution modeling techniques, highlighting important methodological considerations for handling single positive label biases in multi-label classification contexts and demonstrating effective hybrid training approaches.

Abstract: Understanding the spatio-temporal distribution of species is a cornerstone of
ecology and conservation. By pairing species observations with geographic and
environmental predictors, researchers can model the relationship between an
environment and the species which may be found there. To advance the
state-of-the-art in this area with deep learning models and remote sensing
data, we organized an open machine learning challenge called GeoLifeCLEF 2023.
The training dataset comprised 5 million plant species observations (single
positive label per sample) distributed across Europe and covering most of its
flora, high-resolution rasters: remote sensing imagery, land cover, elevation,
in addition to coarse-resolution data: climate, soil and human footprint
variables. In this multi-label classification task, we evaluated models ability
to predict the species composition in 22 thousand small plots based on
standardized surveys. This paper presents an overview of the competition,
synthesizes the approaches used by the participating teams, and analyzes the
main results. In particular, we highlight the biases faced by the methods
fitted to single positive labels when it comes to the multi-label evaluation,
and the new and effective learning strategy combining single and multi-label
data in training.

TL;DR: VELA is a new automatic evaluation metric for long image captions that outperforms existing metrics and achieves superhuman performance on the LongCap-Arena benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automatic evaluation metrics for image captioning are designed for short captions and are unsuitable for long captions. LLM-as-a-Judge approaches also suffer from slow inference due to autoregressive inference and early visual fusion.

Method: Proposed VELA, an automatic evaluation metric for long captions developed within a novel LLM-Hybrid-as-a-Judge framework. Also created LongCap-Arena benchmark with 7,805 images, reference captions, candidate captions, and 32,246 human judgments from three perspectives.

Result: VELA outperformed existing metrics and achieved superhuman performance on LongCap-Arena benchmark.

Conclusion: VELA effectively addresses the limitations of existing metrics for evaluating long image captions and demonstrates superior performance compared to current approaches.

Abstract: In this study, we focus on the automatic evaluation of long and detailed
image captions generated by multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Most
existing automatic evaluation metrics for image captioning are primarily
designed for short captions and are not suitable for evaluating long captions.
Moreover, recent LLM-as-a-Judge approaches suffer from slow inference due to
their reliance on autoregressive inference and early fusion of visual
information. To address these limitations, we propose VELA, an automatic
evaluation metric for long captions developed within a novel
LLM-Hybrid-as-a-Judge framework. Furthermore, we propose LongCap-Arena, a
benchmark specifically designed for evaluating metrics for long captions. This
benchmark comprises 7,805 images, the corresponding human-provided long
reference captions and long candidate captions, and 32,246 human judgments from
three distinct perspectives: Descriptiveness, Relevance, and Fluency. We
demonstrated that VELA outperformed existing metrics and achieved superhuman
performance on LongCap-Arena.

TL;DR: A training-free framework for reward-guided image editing using trajectory optimal control, treating diffusion model reverse process as controllable trajectory with adjoint state updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reward-guided approaches focus on generation but not editing, which requires preserving source image semantics while enhancing target rewards.

Method: Formulates editing as trajectory optimal control problem, using diffusion model reverse process as controllable trajectory with iterative adjoint state updates.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing inversion-based training-free guidance baselines across distinct editing tasks.

Conclusion: Achieves superior balance between reward maximization and source image fidelity without reward hacking.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion and flow-matching models have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in high-fidelity image synthesis. A prominent line of
research involves reward-guided guidance, which steers the generation process
during inference to align with specific objectives. However, leveraging this
reward-guided approach to the task of image editing, which requires preserving
the semantic content of the source image while enhancing a target reward, is
largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for
training-free, reward-guided image editing. We formulate the editing process as
a trajectory optimal control problem where the reverse process of a diffusion
model is treated as a controllable trajectory originating from the source
image, and the adjoint states are iteratively updated to steer the editing
process. Through extensive experiments across distinct editing tasks, we
demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing
inversion-based training-free guidance baselines, achieving a superior balance
between reward maximization and fidelity to the source image without reward
hacking.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Multimodal reasoning in Vision-Language Models enhances logical inference but can impair perceptual grounding through visual forgetting. The paper proposes Vision-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO) to anchor reasoning to visual inputs, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>

Motivation: While multimodal reasoning improves performance on complex visual tasks, it can paradoxically degrade basic visual recognition due to visual forgetting - where models increasingly disregard visual input during prolonged reasoning.

Method: Proposes Vision-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO), a method that explicitly steers the reasoning process toward visually grounded trajectories to maintain visual grounding.

Result: VAPO-Thinker-7B significantly strengthens visual information reliance and achieves new state-of-the-art results across multiple established benchmarks.

Conclusion: VAPO effectively addresses visual forgetting in multimodal reasoning, balancing enhanced logical inference with maintained perceptual grounding, leading to superior performance on diverse visual tasks.

Abstract: Reasoning has emerged as a pivotal capability in Large Language Models
(LLMs). Through Reinforcement Learning (RL), typically Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), these models are able to solve complex tasks such as
mathematics and code generation. Building on these advances, recent research
has sought to extend reasoning to Vision-Language Models (VLMs), yielding
promising results across diverse visual tasks. Despite this progress, our study
uncovers the dual nature of multimodal reasoning: while it substantially
enhances logical inference and facilitates performance on challenging problems,
it may gradually impair perceptual grounding, leading to recognition failures
on otherwise basic visual questions. Through further analysis, we attribute
this phenomenon to visual forgetting, wherein prolonged reasoning causes the
model to increasingly disregard visual input. To address this, we propose
Vision-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO), a simple yet effective method that
explicitly steers the reasoning process toward visually grounded trajectories.
Our result model, VAPO-Thinker-7B, significantly strengthens the model's
reliance on visual information and achieves new state-of-the-art results on a
wide range of established benchmarks. Project page:

*Jundong Xu,Hao Fei,Yuhui Zhang,Liangming Pan,Qijun Huang,Qian Liu,Preslav Nakov,Min-Yen Kan,William Yang Wang,Mong-Li Lee,Wynne Hsu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MuSLR is the first benchmark for multimodal symbolic logical reasoning, evaluating VLMs' ability to apply formal logic rules to multimodal inputs. Current VLMs struggle significantly, with GPT-4.1 achieving only 46.8% accuracy. The proposed LogiCAM framework improves performance by 14.13% through modular application of logical rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal symbolic logical reasoning is critical for high-stakes applications like autonomous driving and medical diagnosis, where rigorous, deterministic reasoning can prevent serious consequences. Current VLMs lack proper evaluation for such capabilities.

Method: Created MuSLR benchmark with 1,093 instances across 7 domains, including 35 atomic symbolic logic and 976 logical combinations with reasoning depths from 2 to 9. Proposed LogiCAM framework that applies formal logical rules to multimodal inputs in a modular fashion.

Result: 7 state-of-the-art VLMs all struggle with multimodal symbolic reasoning, with GPT-4.1 achieving only 46.8% accuracy. LogiCAM boosts GPT-4.1's Chain-of-Thought performance by 14.13%, with larger gains on complex logics like first-order logic. Error analysis shows 70% of failures stem from logical misalignment between modalities.

Conclusion: Current VLMs have significant limitations in multimodal symbolic logical reasoning. The LogiCAM framework demonstrates substantial improvements, and the error analysis provides key insights for future model development in this critical area.

Abstract: Multimodal symbolic logical reasoning, which aims to deduce new facts from
multimodal input via formal logic, is critical in high-stakes applications such
as autonomous driving and medical diagnosis, as its rigorous, deterministic
reasoning helps prevent serious consequences. To evaluate such capabilities of
current state-of-the-art vision language models (VLMs), we introduce the first
benchmark MuSLR for multimodal symbolic logical reasoning grounded in formal
logical rules. MuSLR comprises 1,093 instances across 7 domains, including 35
atomic symbolic logic and 976 logical combinations, with reasoning depths
ranging from 2 to 9. We evaluate 7 state-of-the-art VLMs on MuSLR and find that
they all struggle with multimodal symbolic reasoning, with the best model,
GPT-4.1, achieving only 46.8%. Thus, we propose LogiCAM, a modular framework
that applies formal logical rules to multimodal inputs, boosting GPT-4.1's
Chain-of-Thought performance by 14.13%, and delivering even larger gains on
complex logics such as first-order logic. We also conduct a comprehensive error
analysis, showing that around 70% of failures stem from logical misalignment
between modalities, offering key insights to guide future improvements. All

TL;DR: PatchEAD is a unified patch-focused framework for training-free anomaly detection that works with diverse foundation models using visual prompting techniques, achieving superior few-shot and zero-shot performance without textual features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation that past studies primarily focused on textual prompt tuning while leaving visual counterpart fragmented across different foundation models, aiming for a unified approach compatible with diverse models.

Method: Proposes Patch-Exclusive Anomaly Detection (PatchEAD) framework with visual prompting techniques including alignment module and foreground masking, enabling training-free anomaly detection that works with various foundation models without textual features.

Result: Superior few-shot and batch zero-shot performance compared to prior work, despite absence of textual features. The study also examines how backbone structure and pretrained characteristics affect patch-similarity robustness.

Conclusion: A well-unified patch-only framework can enable quick, calibration-light deployment without the need for carefully engineered textual prompts, providing actionable guidance for selecting and configuring foundation models for real-world visual inspection.

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection is increasingly relying on foundation models,
aiming for strong out-of-distribution generalization and rapid adaptation in
real-world deployments. Notably, past studies have primarily focused on textual
prompt tuning, leaving the intrinsic visual counterpart fragmented into
processing steps specific to each foundation model. We aim to address this
limitation by proposing a unified patch-focused framework, Patch-Exclusive
Anomaly Detection (PatchEAD), enabling training-free anomaly detection that is
compatible with diverse foundation models. The framework constructs visual
prompting techniques, including an alignment module and foreground masking. Our
experiments show superior few-shot and batch zero-shot performance compared to
prior work, despite the absence of textual features. Our study further examines
how backbone structure and pretrained characteristics affect patch-similarity
robustness, providing actionable guidance for selecting and configuring
foundation models for real-world visual inspection. These results confirm that
a well-unified patch-only framework can enable quick, calibration-light
deployment without the need for carefully engineered textual prompts.

*Pasindu Ranasinghe,Dibyayan Patra,Bikram Banerjee,Simit Raval*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hardware-agnostic method for generating colorized 360° point clouds from mechanical LiDAR using multiple cameras, featuring robust low-light performance through integrated image enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance spatial understanding by fusing camera data with LiDAR measurements, particularly addressing the challenge of reliable colorization under low-light conditions.

Method: Uses multiple camera inputs for 360° coverage, integrates low-light image enhancement module, requires initial camera calibration followed by automatic LiDAR-camera geometric transformation computation, and applies color correction before fusion.

Result: Achieved real-time performance and reliable colorization even under very low illumination, successfully recovering scene details that would otherwise remain undetectable.

Conclusion: The proposed system provides robust, hardware-agnostic LiDAR colorization with excellent low-light performance, eliminating the need for specialized calibration targets while maintaining real-time operation.

Abstract: In recent years, the fusion of camera data with LiDAR measurements has
emerged as a powerful approach to enhance spatial understanding. This study
introduces a novel, hardware-agnostic methodology that generates colourised
point clouds from mechanical LiDAR using multiple camera inputs, providing
complete 360-degree coverage. The primary innovation lies in its robustness
under low-light conditions, achieved through the integration of a low-light
image enhancement module within the fusion pipeline. The system requires
initial calibration to determine intrinsic camera parameters, followed by
automatic computation of the geometric transformation between the LiDAR and
cameras, removing the need for specialised calibration targets and streamlining
the setup. The data processing framework uses colour correction to ensure
uniformity across camera feeds before fusion. The algorithm was tested using a
Velodyne Puck Hi-Res LiDAR and a four-camera configuration. The optimised
software achieved real-time performance and reliable colourisation even under
very low illumination, successfully recovering scene details that would
otherwise remain undetectable.

*Junjie Zhou,Wei Shao,Yagao Yue,Wei Mu,Peng Wan,Qi Zhu,Daoqiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAPLE is a hierarchical prompt learning framework for few-shot whole slide image classification that integrates multi-scale visual semantics and performs predictions at both entity and slide levels using LLM-generated prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt learning methods for WSI classification rely on slide-level prompts and fail to capture subtype-specific phenotypic variations of histological entities (nuclei, glands) that are critical for cancer diagnosis.

Method: MAPLE uses LLMs to generate entity-level and slide-level prompts, employs entity-guided cross-attention for entity-level features, develops cross-scale entity graph learning to enrich representations, and combines entity-level and slide-level predictions.

Result: The approach achieves effective performance on three cancer cohorts for few-shot pathology diagnosis tasks.

Conclusion: MAPLE provides an effective hierarchical framework that captures fine-grained histological entity variations for improved few-shot WSI classification in cancer diagnosis.

Abstract: Prompt learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for adapting pre-trained
vision-language models (VLMs) to few-shot whole slide image (WSI)
classification by aligning visual features with textual representations,
thereby reducing annotation cost and enhancing model generalization.
Nevertheless, existing methods typically rely on slide-level prompts and fail
to capture the subtype-specific phenotypic variations of histological entities
(\emph{e.g.,} nuclei, glands) that are critical for cancer diagnosis. To
address this gap, we propose Multi-scale Attribute-enhanced Prompt Learning
(\textbf{MAPLE}), a hierarchical framework for few-shot WSI classification that
jointly integrates multi-scale visual semantics and performs prediction at both
the entity and slide levels. Specifically, we first leverage large language
models (LLMs) to generate entity-level prompts that can help identify
multi-scale histological entities and their phenotypic attributes, as well as
slide-level prompts to capture global visual descriptions. Then, an
entity-guided cross-attention module is proposed to generate entity-level
features, followed by aligning with their corresponding subtype-specific
attributes for fine-grained entity-level prediction. To enrich entity
representations, we further develop a cross-scale entity graph learning module
that can update these representations by capturing their semantic correlations
within and across scales. The refined representations are then aggregated into
a slide-level representation and aligned with the corresponding prompts for
slide-level prediction. Finally, we combine both entity-level and slide-level
outputs to produce the final prediction results. Results on three cancer
cohorts confirm the effectiveness of our approach in addressing few-shot
pathology diagnosis tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepSketcher introduces a comprehensive suite with an image-text interleaved dataset and a model for "thinking with images" paradigm, enabling tool-free multimodal reasoning through visual embedding space operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance the emerging "thinking with images" paradigm in Vision Language Models by addressing limitations in data construction accuracy, structural design, and application scenarios for multimodal reasoning.

Method: Created a 31k chain-of-thought reasoning dataset with diverse tool calls and edited images, then designed a model that performs interleaved image-text reasoning by generating "visual thoughts" directly in visual embedding space without external tools.

Result: Extensive experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate strong performance, validating both the dataset's utility and the model design's effectiveness.

Conclusion: DeepSketcher successfully advances the "thinking with images" paradigm by providing high-quality data resources and a tool-free model that enables more flexible multimodal reasoning through native visual thought generation.

Abstract: The "thinking with images" paradigm represents a pivotal shift in the
reasoning of Vision Language Models (VLMs), moving from text-dominant
chain-of-thought to image-interactive reasoning. By invoking visual tools or
generating intermediate visual representations, VLMs can iteratively attend to
fine-grained regions, enabling deeper image understanding and more faithful
multimodal reasoning. As an emerging paradigm, however, it still leaves
substantial room for exploration in data construction accuracy, structural
design, and broader application scenarios, which offer rich opportunities for
advancing multimodal reasoning. To further advance this line of work, we
present DeepSketcher, a comprehensive suite comprising both an image-text
interleaved dataset and a self-contained model. The dataset contains 31k
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning trajectories with diverse tool calls and
resulting edited images, covering a wide range of data types and manipulation
instructions with high annotation accuracy. Building on this resource, we
design a model that performs interleaved image-text reasoning and natively
generates "visual thoughts" by operating directly in the visual embedding
space, rather than invoking external tools and repeatedly re-encoding generated
images. This design enables tool-free and more flexible "thinking with images".
Extensive experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate strong
performance, validating both the utility of the dataset and the effectiveness
of the model design.

TL;DR: This paper addresses safety risks in multimodal multi-turn dialogues by introducing MMDS dataset and LLaVAShield tool for joint risk detection in user inputs and assistant responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models moving into interactive multi-turn use create new safety risks where malicious intent can be spread across turns and images, requiring context-sensitive moderation that single-turn approaches miss.

Method: Developed MMDS dataset with 4,484 annotated multimodal dialogue samples, created automated red-teaming framework using Monte Carlo Tree Search to generate unsafe dialogues, and built LLaVAShield tool for joint risk detection.

Result: LLaVAShield consistently outperforms strong baselines on multimodal multi-turn content moderation tasks and under dynamic policy configurations, establishing new state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: The work provides the first systematic study of multimodal multi-turn dialogue safety and releases dataset and model to support future research in this emerging area.

Abstract: As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) move into interactive, multi-turn use, new
safety risks arise that single-turn or single-modality moderation misses. In
Multimodal Multi-Turn (MMT) dialogues, malicious intent can be spread across
turns and images, while context-sensitive replies may still advance harmful
content. To address this challenge, we present the first systematic definition
and study of MMT dialogue safety. Building on this formulation, we introduce
the Multimodal Multi-turn Dialogue Safety (MMDS) dataset. We further develop an
automated multimodal multi-turn red-teaming framework based on Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) to generate unsafe multimodal multi-turn dialogues for MMDS. MMDS
contains 4,484 annotated multimodal dialogue samples with fine-grained safety
ratings, policy dimension labels, and evidence-based rationales for both users
and assistants. Leveraging MMDS, we present LLaVAShield, a powerful tool that
jointly detects and assesses risk in user inputs and assistant responses.
Across comprehensive experiments, LLaVAShield consistently outperforms strong
baselines on MMT content moderation tasks and under dynamic policy
configurations, establishing new state-of-the-art results. We will publicly
release the dataset and model to support future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLM-FO1 reframes object-centric perception from coordinate generation to feature retrieval, achieving state-of-the-art performance in fine-grained visual grounding tasks without compromising general visual understanding capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models excel at high-level scene understanding but struggle with fine-grained perception tasks requiring precise localization due to the challenge of generating exact numerical coordinates with language-centric architectures.

Method: Uses a plug-and-play module with Hybrid Fine-grained Region Encoder (HFRE) featuring dual vision encoder to generate region tokens rich in semantic and spatial detail, and a token-based referencing system for LLM reasoning. Employs two-stage training strategy.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks, demonstrating exceptional capabilities in object grounding, region generational understanding, and visual region reasoning.

Conclusion: VLM-FO1 establishes an effective paradigm for building perception-aware VLMs, bridging the gap between high-level reasoning and fine-grained visual grounding.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at high-level scene understanding but
falter on fine-grained perception tasks requiring precise localization. This
failure stems from a fundamental mismatch, as generating exact numerical
coordinates is a challenging task for language-centric architectures. In this
paper, we introduce VLM-FO1, a novel framework that overcomes this limitation
by reframing object-centric perception from a brittle coordinate generation
problem into a robust feature retrieval task. Our method operates as a
plug-and-play module that integrates with any pre-trained VLM. It leverages a
Hybrid Fine-grained Region Encoder (HFRE), featuring a dual vision encoder, to
generate powerful region tokens rich in both semantic and spatial detail. A
token-based referencing system then enables the LLM to seamlessly reason about
and ground language in these specific visual regions. Experiments show that
VLM-FO1 achieves state-of-the-art performance across a diverse suite of
benchmarks, demonstrating exceptional capabilities in object grounding, region
generational understanding, and visual region reasoning. Crucially, our
two-stage training strategy ensures that these perception gains are achieved
without compromising the base model's general visual understanding
capabilities. VLM-FO1 establishes an effective and flexible paradigm for
building perception-aware VLMs, bridging the gap between high-level reasoning
and fine-grained visual grounding.

*Marco Zimmerli,Andreas Plesner,Till Aczel,Roger Wattenhofer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Training data quality and model architecture are more important than raw scale for adversarial robustness, with logarithmic scaling laws showing diminishing returns from data volume compared to model size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how training data characteristics affect adversarial robustness across different vision models and training paradigms, challenging the assumption that scale alone drives robustness.

Method: Evaluated 36 state-of-the-art vision models (supervised, self-supervised, contrastive learning) on datasets from 1.2M to 22B images under six black-box attack categories including random perturbations, geometric masks, object manipulations, corruptions, and style shifts.

Result: Robustness follows logarithmic scaling: 10x data increase reduces attack success rate by ~3.2%, while 10x model size reduces it by ~13.4%. Self-supervised models on curated datasets (like DINOv2) outperform those on larger but less curated datasets. Adversarial fine-tuning improves generalization for structural but not color variations.

Conclusion: While scaling improves robustness, data quality, architecture, and training objectives play a more decisive role than raw scale in achieving broad-spectrum adversarial resilience, with persistent gaps between human and machine vision.

Abstract: Deep neural networks remain vulnerable to adversarial examples despite
advances in architectures and training paradigms. We investigate how training
data characteristics affect adversarial robustness across 36 state-of-the-art
vision models spanning supervised, self-supervised, and contrastive learning
approaches, trained on datasets from 1.2M to 22B images. Models were evaluated
under six black-box attack categories: random perturbations, two types of
geometric masks, COCO object manipulations, ImageNet-C corruptions, and
ImageNet-R style shifts. Robustness follows a logarithmic scaling law with both
data volume and model size: a tenfold increase in data reduces attack success
rate (ASR) on average by ~3.2%, whereas a tenfold increase in model size
reduces ASR on average by ~13.4%. Notably, some self-supervised models trained
on curated datasets, such as DINOv2, outperform others trained on much larger
but less curated datasets, challenging the assumption that scale alone drives
robustness. Adversarial fine-tuning of ResNet50s improves generalization across
structural variations but not across color distributions. Human evaluation
reveals persistent gaps between human and machine vision. These results show
that while scaling improves robustness, data quality, architecture, and
training objectives play a more decisive role than raw scale in achieving
broad-spectrum adversarial resilience.

*Yuan Zhao,Youwei Pang,Lihe Zhang,Hanqi Liu,Jiaming Zuo,Huchuan Lu,Xiaoqi Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniMMAD is a unified framework for multi-modal and multi-class anomaly detection that uses Mixture-of-Experts for adaptive feature decompression, achieving state-of-the-art performance across 9 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing anomaly detection methods treat modality and class as independent factors, leading to fragmented solutions, excessive memory overhead, and poor performance in reconstruction-based multi-class approaches due to shared decoding paths that struggle with domain variations.

Method: Uses Mixture-of-Experts-driven feature decompression with a 'general to specific' paradigm. Multi-modal inputs are compressed into general features, then decompressed via sparsely-gated cross MoE that dynamically selects expert pathways based on input modality and class. Includes grouped dynamic filtering and MoE-in-MoE structure for efficiency.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on 9 anomaly detection datasets spanning 3 fields, 12 modalities, and 66 classes, while reducing parameter usage by 75% and maintaining sparse activation with fast inference.

Conclusion: UniMMAD provides a unified solution that overcomes limitations of fragmented approaches in multi-modal multi-class anomaly detection, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency through its adaptive MoE-based architecture.

Abstract: Existing anomaly detection (AD) methods often treat the modality and class as
independent factors. Although this paradigm has enriched the development of AD
research branches and produced many specialized models, it has also led to
fragmented solutions and excessive memory overhead. Moreover,
reconstruction-based multi-class approaches typically rely on shared decoding
paths, which struggle to handle large variations across domains, resulting in
distorted normality boundaries, domain interference, and high false alarm
rates. To address these limitations, we propose UniMMAD, a unified framework
for multi-modal and multi-class anomaly detection. At the core of UniMMAD is a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-driven feature decompression mechanism, which enables
adaptive and disentangled reconstruction tailored to specific domains. This
process is guided by a ``general to specific'' paradigm. In the encoding stage,
multi-modal inputs of varying combinations are compressed into compact,
general-purpose features. The encoder incorporates a feature compression module
to suppress latent anomalies, encourage cross-modal interaction, and avoid
shortcut learning. In the decoding stage, the general features are decompressed
into modality-specific and class-specific forms via a sparsely-gated cross MoE,
which dynamically selects expert pathways based on input modality and class. To
further improve efficiency, we design a grouped dynamic filtering mechanism and
a MoE-in-MoE structure, reducing parameter usage by 75\% while maintaining
sparse activation and fast inference. UniMMAD achieves state-of-the-art
performance on 9 anomaly detection datasets, spanning 3 fields, 12 modalities,
and 66 classes.

*Debottam Dutta,Jianchong Chen,Rajalaxmi Rajagopalan,Yu-Lin Wei,Romit Roy Choudhury*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CO3 improves multi-concept prompt fidelity in text-to-image diffusion models by introducing corrective sampling that steers away from regions where joint prompt behavior overlaps too strongly with any single concept, ensuring balanced visual presence of all concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address common failure cases in multi-concept prompts where one concept may be missing, faint, or awkwardly colliding with others due to diffusion model drift into mixed modes that over-emphasize strongly learned single concepts.

Method: Introduces a plug-and-play corrective sampling strategy that steers away from regions with strong single-concept overlap and adapts sampling to remain within favorable weight regimes, complementing standard classifier-free guidance without model retraining.

Result: Experiments show improvements in concept coverage, balance, and robustness with fewer dropped or distorted concepts compared to standard baselines and prior compositional methods across diverse multi-concept prompts.

Conclusion: Lightweight corrective guidance can substantially mitigate brittle semantic alignment behavior in modern diffusion systems, improving multi-concept prompt fidelity without requiring model tuning.

Abstract: We propose to improve multi-concept prompt fidelity in text-to-image
diffusion models. We begin with common failure cases-prompts like "a cat and a
dog" that sometimes yields images where one concept is missing, faint, or
colliding awkwardly with another. We hypothesize that this happens when the
diffusion model drifts into mixed modes that over-emphasize a single concept it
learned strongly during training. Instead of re-training, we introduce a
corrective sampling strategy that steers away from regions where the joint
prompt behavior overlaps too strongly with any single concept in the prompt.
The goal is to steer towards "pure" joint modes where all concepts can coexist
with balanced visual presence. We further show that existing multi-concept
guidance schemes can operate in unstable weight regimes that amplify imbalance;
we characterize favorable regions and adapt sampling to remain within them. Our
approach, CO3, is plug-and-play, requires no model tuning, and complements
standard classifier-free guidance. Experiments on diverse multi-concept prompts
indicate improvements in concept coverage, balance and robustness, with fewer
dropped or distorted concepts compared to standard baselines and prior
compositional methods. Results suggest that lightweight corrective guidance can
substantially mitigate brittle semantic alignment behavior in modern diffusion
systems.

*Longzhen Yang,Zhangkai Ni,Ying Wen,Yihang Liu,Lianghua He,Heng Tao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SS-ACL is an annotation-free framework that generates clinically accurate medical reports by aligning generated text with anatomical regions using textual prompts and hierarchical anatomical graphs, outperforming state-of-the-art methods without expert annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical report generation methods require extensive expert annotations for detection modules, leading to high labeling costs and limited generalizability due to pathology distribution bias across datasets.

Method: SS-ACL uses self-supervised anatomical consistency learning with hierarchical anatomical graphs that organize entities by spatial location. It enforces intra-sample spatial alignment through recursive reconstruction of anatomical regions and inter-sample semantic alignment through region-level contrastive learning.

Result: SS-ACL outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 10% in lexical accuracy and 25% in clinical efficacy, and achieves 8% improvement in zero-shot visual grounding compared to leading visual foundation models.

Conclusion: The proposed SS-ACL framework successfully generates accurate and visually grounded medical reports without requiring expert annotations, demonstrating strong performance in both report generation and downstream visual tasks.

Abstract: Vision-grounded medical report generation aims to produce clinically accurate
descriptions of medical images, anchored in explicit visual evidence to improve
interpretability and facilitate integration into clinical workflows. However,
existing methods often rely on separately trained detection modules that
require extensive expert annotations, introducing high labeling costs and
limiting generalizability due to pathology distribution bias across datasets.
To address these challenges, we propose Self-Supervised Anatomical Consistency
Learning (SS-ACL) -- a novel and annotation-free framework that aligns
generated reports with corresponding anatomical regions using simple textual
prompts. SS-ACL constructs a hierarchical anatomical graph inspired by the
invariant top-down inclusion structure of human anatomy, organizing entities by
spatial location. It recursively reconstructs fine-grained anatomical regions
to enforce intra-sample spatial alignment, inherently guiding attention maps
toward visually relevant areas prompted by text. To further enhance
inter-sample semantic alignment for abnormality recognition, SS-ACL introduces
a region-level contrastive learning based on anatomical consistency. These
aligned embeddings serve as priors for report generation, enabling attention
maps to provide interpretable visual evidence. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SS-ACL, without relying on expert annotations, (i) generates
accurate and visually grounded reports -- outperforming state-of-the-art
methods by 10\% in lexical accuracy and 25\% in clinical efficacy, and (ii)
achieves competitive performance on various downstream visual tasks, surpassing
current leading visual foundation models by 8\% in zero-shot visual grounding.

Motivation: Current CV methods for salmon welfare monitoring focus on single indicators, require separate calculations for each indicator, and struggle with underwater challenges like occlusion and similar appearance/motion.

Method: Uses pose estimation network to extract bounding boxes around salmon and body parts, then employs specialized modules to handle underwater challenges, with high-detail body part tracks used for welfare indicator calculation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art pedestrian tracker BoostTrack on salmon tracking challenges, and demonstrates suitability for automated welfare monitoring through tail beat analysis.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses underwater salmon tracking challenges and enables automated welfare monitoring through body part tracking and analysis.

Abstract: Computer Vision (CV)-based continuous, automated and precise salmon welfare
monitoring is a key step toward reduced salmon mortality and improved salmon
welfare in industrial aquaculture net pens. Available CV methods for
determining welfare indicators focus on single indicators and rely on object
detectors and trackers from other application areas to aid their welfare
indicator calculation algorithm. This comes with a high resource demand for
real-world applications, since each indicator must be calculated separately. In
addition, the methods are vulnerable to difficulties in underwater salmon
scenes, such as object occlusion, similar object appearance, and similar object
motion. To address these challenges, we propose a flexible tracking framework
that uses a pose estimation network to extract bounding boxes around salmon and
their corresponding body parts, and exploits information about the body parts,
through specialized modules, to tackle challenges specific to underwater salmon
scenes. Subsequently, the high-detail body part tracks are employed to
calculate welfare indicators. We construct two novel datasets assessing two
salmon tracking challenges: salmon ID transfers in crowded scenes and salmon ID
switches during turning. Our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art
pedestrian tracker, BoostTrack, for both salmon tracking challenges.
Additionally, we create a dataset for calculating salmon tail beat wavelength,
demonstrating that our body part tracking method is well-suited for automated
welfare monitoring based on tail beat analysis. Datasets and code are available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing interactive segmentation methods are limited to coarse instance-level targets, while non-interactive approaches struggle with sparse real-world scans and lack annotated data for fine-grained part segmentation.

Method: Developed a novel interactive framework with a new 3D data synthesis pipeline to create large-scale scene-level datasets with dense part annotations, enabling fine-grained segmentation from few point clicks.

Result: Achieved average IoU of 55.8% on each object part under first-click settings and surpassed 71.3% IoU with few additional clicks, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by up to 16% improvement in IoU and precision.

Conclusion: PinPoint3D represents a significant advancement towards more nuanced and precise machine perception and interaction in complex 3D environments, overcoming critical data bottleneck in fine-grained 3D segmentation.

Abstract: Fine-grained 3D part segmentation is crucial for enabling embodied AI systems
to perform complex manipulation tasks, such as interacting with specific
functional components of an object. However, existing interactive segmentation
methods are largely confined to coarse, instance-level targets, while
non-interactive approaches struggle with sparse, real-world scans and suffer
from a severe lack of annotated data. To address these limitations, we
introduce PinPoint3D, a novel interactive framework for fine-grained,
multi-granularity 3D segmentation, capable of generating precise part-level
masks from only a few user point clicks. A key component of our work is a new
3D data synthesis pipeline that we developed to create a large-scale,
scene-level dataset with dense part annotations, overcoming a critical
bottleneck that has hindered progress in this field. Through comprehensive
experiments and user studies, we demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms existing approaches, achieving an average IoU of around 55.8% on
each object part under first-click settings and surpassing 71.3% IoU with only
a few additional clicks. Compared to current state-of-the-art baselines,
PinPoint3D yields up to a 16% improvement in IoU and precision, highlighting
its effectiveness on challenging, sparse point clouds with high efficiency. Our
work represents a significant step towards more nuanced and precise machine
perception and interaction in complex 3D environments.

TL;DR: RH-Partial2Global improves VICL by using jackknife conformal prediction for reliable alternative sets and covering design-based sampling for comprehensive pairwise preference coverage, outperforming Partial2Global.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VICL methods rely on the similarity-priority assumption without sufficient justification and use random sampling for pairwise preferences, leading to incomplete coverage and redundant comparisons that adversely affect global ranking.

Method: RH-Partial2Global uses jackknife conformal prediction to construct reliable alternative sets and a covering design-based sampling approach to ensure comprehensive and uniform coverage of pairwise preferences.

Result: Extensive experiments show that RH-Partial2Global achieves excellent performance and outperforms Partial2Global across diverse visual tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed RH-Partial2Global method provides a more reliable and holistic approach for selecting in-context examples in VICL, addressing limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Visual In-Context Learning (VICL) has emerged as a prominent approach for
adapting visual foundation models to novel tasks, by effectively exploiting
contextual information embedded in in-context examples, which can be formulated
as a global ranking problem of potential candidates. Current VICL methods, such
as Partial2Global and VPR, are grounded in the similarity-priority assumption
that images more visually similar to a query image serve as better in-context
examples. This foundational assumption, while intuitive, lacks sufficient
justification for its efficacy in selecting optimal in-context examples.
Furthermore, Partial2Global constructs its global ranking from a series of
randomly sampled pairwise preference predictions. Such a reliance on random
sampling can lead to incomplete coverage and redundant samplings of
comparisons, thus further adversely impacting the final global ranking. To
address these issues, this paper introduces an enhanced variant of
Partial2Global designed for reliable and holistic selection of in-context
examples in VICL. Our proposed method, dubbed RH-Partial2Global, leverages a
jackknife conformal prediction-guided strategy to construct reliable
alternative sets and a covering design-based sampling approach to ensure
comprehensive and uniform coverage of pairwise preferences. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that RH-Partial2Global achieves excellent performance
and outperforms Partial2Global across diverse visual tasks.

*Abdelilah Aitrouga,Youssef Hmamouche,Amal El Fallah Seghrouchni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VRWKV-Editor is a novel video editing model that uses linear spatio-temporal aggregation with RWKV transformer to achieve linear complexity, enabling 3.7x speedup and 60% lower memory usage while maintaining competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video editing models suffer from quadratic computational complexity of attention mechanisms, making them impractical for long-duration and high-resolution videos in real-time applications.

Method: Integrates linear spatio-temporal aggregation module using bidirectional weighted key-value recurrence mechanism of RWKV transformer into video-based diffusion models.

Result: Achieves up to 3.7x speedup and 60% lower memory usage compared to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining competitive frame consistency and text alignment. Performance gap widens with longer videos.

Conclusion: VRWKV-Editor successfully addresses computational complexity limitations in video editing, making it suitable for practical real-time applications with long videos.

Abstract: In light of recent progress in video editing, deep learning models focusing
on both spatial and temporal dependencies have emerged as the primary method.
However, these models suffer from the quadratic computational complexity of
traditional attention mechanisms, making them difficult to adapt to
long-duration and high-resolution videos. This limitation restricts their
applicability in practical contexts such as real-time video processing. To
tackle this challenge, we introduce a method to reduce both time and space
complexity of these systems by proposing VRWKV-Editor, a novel video editing
model that integrates a linear spatio-temporal aggregation module into
video-based diffusion models. VRWKV-Editor leverages bidirectional weighted
key-value recurrence mechanism of the RWKV transformer to capture global
dependencies while preserving temporal coherence, achieving linear complexity
without sacrificing quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves up to 3.7x speedup and 60% lower memory usage compared
to state-of-the-art diffusion-based video editing methods, while maintaining
competitive performance in frame consistency and text alignment. Furthermore, a
comparative analysis we conducted on videos with different sequence lengths
confirms that the gap in editing speed between our approach and architectures
with self-attention becomes more significant with long videos.

*Nicola Messina,Rosario Leonardi,Luca Ciampi,Fabio Carrara,Giovanni Maria Farinella,Fabrizio Falchi,Antonino Furnari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes NS-iHOS, a novel task for segmenting in-hand objects using natural language narrations as weak supervision, and introduces WISH, an end-to-end model that learns from narrations without using them at inference time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pixel-level object recognition from egocentric images is important for assistive technologies and activity monitoring, but progress is hindered by scarce annotated datasets. Manual labeling is costly, while narrations provide cheap weak supervision readily available in existing datasets.

Method: Proposes WISH (Weakly-Supervised In-hand Object Segmentation from Human Narrations), an end-to-end model that distills knowledge from natural language narrations to learn hand-object associations and enable in-hand object segmentation without using narrations at test time.

Result: WISH surpasses all baselines based on open-vocabulary object detectors and vision-language models on EPIC-Kitchens and Ego4D datasets, recovering more than 50% of the performance of fully supervised methods without using pixel-wise annotations.

Conclusion: Natural language narrations provide effective weak supervision for learning human-object interaction detection, enabling significant progress in in-hand object segmentation without costly manual annotations.

Abstract: Pixel-level recognition of objects manipulated by the user from egocentric
images enables key applications spanning assistive technologies, industrial
safety, and activity monitoring. However, progress in this area is currently
hindered by the scarcity of annotated datasets, as existing approaches rely on
costly manual labels. In this paper, we propose to learn human-object
interaction detection leveraging narrations -- natural language descriptions of
the actions performed by the camera wearer which contain clues about
manipulated objects (e.g., "I am pouring vegetables from the chopping board to
the pan"). Narrations provide a form of weak supervision that is cheap to
acquire and readily available in state-of-the-art egocentric datasets. We
introduce Narration-Supervised in-Hand Object Segmentation (NS-iHOS), a novel
task where models have to learn to segment in-hand objects by learning from
natural-language narrations. Narrations are then not employed at inference
time. We showcase the potential of the task by proposing Weakly-Supervised
In-hand Object Segmentation from Human Narrations (WISH), an end-to-end model
distilling knowledge from narrations to learn plausible hand-object
associations and enable in-hand object segmentation without using narrations at
test time. We benchmark WISH against different baselines based on
open-vocabulary object detectors and vision-language models, showing the
superiority of its design. Experiments on EPIC-Kitchens and Ego4D show that
WISH surpasses all baselines, recovering more than 50% of the performance of
fully supervised methods, without employing fine-grained pixel-wise
annotations.

*Hanwei Zhu,Yu Tian,Keyan Ding,Baoliang Chen,Bolin Chen,Shiqi Wang,Weisi Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AgenticIQA is a modular framework that uses vision-language models and traditional IQA tools to dynamically assess image quality through four subtasks: distortion detection, analysis, tool selection, and execution, producing accurate scores with human-aligned explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional IQA methods use fixed models that limit adaptability to diverse distortions, user queries, and interpretability needs. They treat scoring and interpretation as separate processes despite their interdependence.

Method: AgenticIQA decomposes IQA into four subtasks coordinated by planner, executor, and summarizer components. It integrates VLMs with traditional IQA tools in a query-aware manner and uses a large-scale instruction dataset (AgenticIQA-200K) for training.

Result: Extensive experiments show AgenticIQA consistently surpasses strong baselines in both scoring accuracy and explanatory alignment across diverse IQA datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed agentic framework effectively addresses limitations of conventional IQA methods by providing dynamic, interpretable quality assessment that integrates scoring and interpretation processes.

Abstract: Image quality assessment (IQA) is inherently complex, as it reflects both the
quantification and interpretation of perceptual quality rooted in the human
visual system. Conventional approaches typically rely on fixed models to output
scalar scores, limiting their adaptability to diverse distortions,
user-specific queries, and interpretability needs. Furthermore, scoring and
interpretation are often treated as independent processes, despite their
interdependence: interpretation identifies perceptual degradations, while
scoring abstracts them into a compact metric. To address these limitations, we
propose AgenticIQA, a modular agentic framework that integrates vision-language
models (VLMs) with traditional IQA tools in a dynamic, query-aware manner.
AgenticIQA decomposes IQA into four subtasks -- distortion detection,
distortion analysis, tool selection, and tool execution -- coordinated by a
planner, executor, and summarizer. The planner formulates task-specific
strategies, the executor collects perceptual evidence via tool invocation, and
the summarizer integrates this evidence to produce accurate scores with
human-aligned explanations. To support training and evaluation, we introduce
AgenticIQA-200K, a large-scale instruction dataset tailored for IQA agents, and
AgenticIQA-Eval, the first benchmark for assessing the planning, execution, and
summarization capabilities of VLM-based IQA agents. Extensive experiments
across diverse IQA datasets demonstrate that AgenticIQA consistently surpasses
strong baselines in both scoring accuracy and explanatory alignment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PFDepth is the first pinhole-fisheye framework for heterogeneous multi-view depth estimation that leverages complementary characteristics of both camera types through a unified architecture with 3D volumetric feature lifting and novel 3D Gaussian representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To exploit the complementary characteristics of pinhole and fisheye imagery (undistorted vs. distorted, small vs. large FOV, far vs. near field) for joint optimization in multi-view depth estimation.

Method: Uses a unified architecture that lifts 2D features into canonical 3D volumetric space, employs Heterogeneous Spatial Fusion for distortion-aware volumetric feature fusion, and reformulates voxel fusion into a novel 3D Gaussian representation with learnable latent Gaussian spheres that adapt to local image textures.

Result: Sets state-of-the-art performance on KITTI-360 and RealHet datasets, outperforming current mainstream depth networks.

Conclusion: This is the first systematic study of heterogeneous pinhole-fisheye depth estimation, offering both technical novelty and valuable empirical insights for multi-view depth estimation with mixed camera types.

Abstract: In this paper, we present the first pinhole-fisheye framework for
heterogeneous multi-view depth estimation, PFDepth. Our key insight is to
exploit the complementary characteristics of pinhole and fisheye imagery
(undistorted vs. distorted, small vs. large FOV, far vs. near field) for joint
optimization. PFDepth employs a unified architecture capable of processing
arbitrary combinations of pinhole and fisheye cameras with varied intrinsics
and extrinsics. Within PFDepth, we first explicitly lift 2D features from each
heterogeneous view into a canonical 3D volumetric space. Then, a core module
termed Heterogeneous Spatial Fusion is designed to process and fuse
distortion-aware volumetric features across overlapping and non-overlapping
regions. Additionally, we subtly reformulate the conventional voxel fusion into
a novel 3D Gaussian representation, in which learnable latent Gaussian spheres
dynamically adapt to local image textures for finer 3D aggregation. Finally,
fused volume features are rendered into multi-view depth maps. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that PFDepth sets a state-of-the-art
performance on KITTI-360 and RealHet datasets over current mainstream depth
networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic study of
heterogeneous pinhole-fisheye depth estimation, offering both technical novelty
and valuable empirical insights.

*Rajendra K. Ray,Manish Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed a fourth-order nonlinear PDE model combining diffusion and wave properties for multiplicative noise reduction, outperforming second-order models while preserving fine details and textures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Second-order PDE models for multiplicative noise suppression often introduce blocky artifacts during early denoising stages, requiring a more effective approach.

Method: Developed a fourth-order nonlinear PDE model integrating diffusion (guided by Laplacian and intensity values) and wave properties, with independent channel processing for color images.

Result: Better performance than second-order anisotropic diffusion models across PSNR, MSSIM, and SI metrics for both grayscale and color images, with preserved structure and color consistency.

Conclusion: The fourth-order PDE model effectively suppresses multiplicative noise while avoiding blocky artifacts and maintaining fine details, making it superior to existing second-order approaches.

Abstract: Second-order PDE models have been widely used for suppressing multiplicative
noise, but they often introduce blocky artifacts in the early stages of
denoising. To resolve this, we propose a fourth-order nonlinear PDE model that
integrates diffusion and wave properties. The diffusion process, guided by both
the Laplacian and intensity values, reduces noise better than gradient-based
methods, while the wave part keeps fine details and textures. The effectiveness
of the proposed model is evaluated against two second-order anisotropic
diffusion approaches using the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Mean
Structural Similarity Index (MSSIM) for images with available ground truth. For
SAR images, where a noise-free reference is unavailable, the Speckle Index (SI)
is used to measure noise reduction. Additionally, we extend the proposed model
to study color images by applying the denoising process independently to each
channel, preserving both structure and color consistency. The same quantitative
metrics PSNR and MSSIM are used for performance evaluation, ensuring a fair
comparison across grayscale and color images. In all the cases, our computed
results produce better results compared to existing models in this genre.

### [74] [SETR: A Two-Stage Semantic-Enhanced Framework for Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26012)
*Yuqi Xiao,Yingying Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SETR proposes a two-stage retrieval method for zero-shot composed image retrieval that uses intersection-driven coarse retrieval and LLM-based fine-grained re-ranking to overcome CLIP's limitations in handling fine-grained semantic relations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CLIP-based methods for zero-shot composed image retrieval have two main problems: union-based feature fusion carries irrelevant background details, and global cosine similarity cannot resolve fine-grained semantic relations.

Method: SETR uses a two-stage approach: (1) coarse retrieval with intersection-driven strategy to filter out distractors, and (2) fine-grained re-ranking using a pretrained multimodal LLM with Low-Rank Adaptation for binary semantic relevance judgments.

Result: SETR achieves state-of-the-art performance on CIRR, Fashion-IQ, and CIRCO datasets, improving Recall@1 on CIRR by up to 15.15 points.

Conclusion: Two-stage reasoning is established as a general paradigm for robust and portable zero-shot composed image retrieval.

Abstract: Zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) aims to retrieve a target image
given a reference image and a relative text, without relying on costly triplet
annotations. Existing CLIP-based methods face two core challenges: (1)
union-based feature fusion indiscriminately aggregates all visual cues,
carrying over irrelevant background details that dilute the intended
modification, and (2) global cosine similarity from CLIP embeddings lacks the
ability to resolve fine-grained semantic relations. To address these issues, we
propose SETR (Semantic-enhanced Two-Stage Retrieval). In the coarse retrieval
stage, SETR introduces an intersection-driven strategy that retains only the
overlapping semantics between the reference image and relative text, thereby
filtering out distractors inherent to union-based fusion and producing a
cleaner, high-precision candidate set. In the fine-grained re-ranking stage, we
adapt a pretrained multimodal LLM with Low-Rank Adaptation to conduct binary
semantic relevance judgments ("Yes/No"), which goes beyond CLIP's global
feature matching by explicitly verifying relational and attribute-level
consistency. Together, these two stages form a complementary pipeline: coarse
retrieval narrows the candidate pool with high recall, while re-ranking ensures
precise alignment with nuanced textual modifications. Experiments on CIRR,
Fashion-IQ, and CIRCO show that SETR achieves new state-of-the-art performance,
improving Recall@1 on CIRR by up to 15.15 points. Our results establish
two-stage reasoning as a general paradigm for robust and portable ZS-CIR.

*Lubian Bai,Xiuyuan Zhang,Siqi Zhang,Zepeng Zhang,Haoyu Wang,Wei Qin,Shihong Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoLink is a multimodal framework that integrates OpenStreetMap (OSM) data with remote sensing foundation models to enhance geospatial intelligence through cross-modal spatial correlations and multi-granularity learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a significant modality gap between remote sensing and OSM data in terms of data structure, content, and spatial granularity, making effective synergy challenging. Most existing RS foundation models focus only on imagery, limiting their capability for comprehensive geospatial analysis.

Method: GeoLink enhances RS self-supervised pretraining using multi-granularity learning signals from OSM data guided by cross-modal spatial correlations. It employs image mask-reconstruction for efficient pretraining and generates both unimodal and multimodal fine-grained encodings for downstream tasks.

Result: Extensive experiments show that incorporating OSM data during pretraining improves RS image encoder performance, while fusing RS and OSM data in downstream tasks enhances the model's adaptability to complex geographic scenarios. Spatial correlation is identified as crucial for effective multimodal integration.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of multimodal synergy in advancing high-level geospatial artificial intelligence, with spatial correlation playing a key role in enabling effective integration of geospatial data modalities.

Abstract: Integrating ground-level geospatial data with rich geographic context, like
OpenStreetMap (OSM), into remote sensing (RS) foundation models (FMs) is
essential for advancing geospatial intelligence and supporting a broad spectrum
of tasks. However, modality gap between RS and OSM data, including differences
in data structure, content, and spatial granularity, makes effective synergy
highly challenging, and most existing RS FMs focus on imagery alone. To this
end, this study presents GeoLink, a multimodal framework that leverages OSM
data to enhance RS FM during both the pretraining and downstream task stages.
Specifically, GeoLink enhances RS self-supervised pretraining using
multi-granularity learning signals derived from OSM data, guided by cross-modal
spatial correlations for information interaction and collaboration. It also
introduces image mask-reconstruction to enable sparse input for efficient
pretraining. For downstream tasks, GeoLink generates both unimodal and
multimodal fine-grained encodings to support a wide range of applications, from
common RS interpretation tasks like land cover classification to more
comprehensive geographic tasks like urban function zone mapping. Extensive
experiments show that incorporating OSM data during pretraining enhances the
performance of the RS image encoder, while fusing RS and OSM data in downstream
tasks improves the FM's adaptability to complex geographic scenarios. These
results underscore the potential of multimodal synergy in advancing high-level
geospatial artificial intelligence. Moreover, we find that spatial correlation
plays a crucial role in enabling effective multimodal geospatial data
integration. Code, checkpoints, and using examples are released at

TL;DR: PatchVSR enables efficient 4K video super-resolution using patch-wise processing with a dual-stream adapter and location-aware patch synthesis, overcoming computational limitations of full-attention methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-trained video generation models have potential for video super-resolution, but existing full-size methods suffer from intensive computation and fixed output resolution. Patch-wise processing can address these limitations.

Method: Proposed PatchVSR with dual-stream adapter: patch branch for content fidelity and global branch for context features. Includes location information injection and multi-patch joint modulation for visual consistency.

Result: Achieves high-fidelity, high-resolution details at patch level. Enables 4K VSR using 512x512 base model with high efficiency and competitive performance.

Conclusion: Patch-based paradigm provides flexible and efficient video super-resolution, overcoming computational bottlenecks while maintaining visual quality and consistency.

Abstract: Pre-trained video generation models hold great potential for generative video
super-resolution (VSR). However, adapting them for full-size VSR, as most
existing methods do, suffers from unnecessary intensive full-attention
computation and fixed output resolution. To overcome these limitations, we make
the first exploration into utilizing video diffusion priors for patch-wise VSR.
This is non-trivial because pre-trained video diffusion models are not native
for patch-level detail generation. To mitigate this challenge, we propose an
innovative approach, called PatchVSR, which integrates a dual-stream adapter
for conditional guidance. The patch branch extracts features from input patches
to maintain content fidelity while the global branch extracts context features
from the resized full video to bridge the generation gap caused by incomplete
semantics of patches. Particularly, we also inject the patch's location
information into the model to better contextualize patch synthesis within the
global video frame. Experiments demonstrate that our method can synthesize
high-fidelity, high-resolution details at the patch level. A tailor-made
multi-patch joint modulation is proposed to ensure visual consistency across
individually enhanced patches. Due to the flexibility of our patch-based
paradigm, we can achieve highly competitive 4K VSR based on a 512x512
resolution base model, with extremely high efficiency.

*Haoran Pei,Yuguang Yang,Kexin Liu,Baochang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Causally-Guided Gaussian Perturbations (CGP) is a lightweight framework that improves out-of-distribution generalization by injecting spatially varying noise guided by causal masks from Vision Transformers, encouraging models to focus on causally relevant features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OOD generalization methods often overlook causal mechanisms and rely on complex approaches that may not capture the underlying reasons for generalization, particularly in domains like biomedical imaging where distribution shifts are subtle.

Method: CGP applies spatially varying Gaussian noise to input images, with stronger perturbations in background regions and weaker ones in foreground areas, using soft causal masks derived from Vision Transformers to guide the noise injection.

Result: Experimental results on the WILDS benchmark Camelyon17 show consistent performance improvements over state-of-the-art OOD baselines.

Conclusion: Causal perturbation through CGP framework provides a promising approach for reliable and interpretable out-of-distribution generalization in deep learning models.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization remains a central challenge in
deploying deep learning models to real-world scenarios, particularly in domains
such as biomedical images, where distribution shifts are both subtle and
pervasive. While existing methods often pursue domain invariance through
complex generative models or adversarial training, these approaches may
overlook the underlying causal mechanisms of generalization.In this work, we
propose Causally-Guided Gaussian Perturbations (CGP)-a lightweight framework
that enhances OOD generalization by injecting spatially varying noise into
input images, guided by soft causal masks derived from Vision Transformers. By
applying stronger perturbations to background regions and weaker ones to
foreground areas, CGP encourages the model to rely on causally relevant
features rather than spurious correlations.Experimental results on the
challenging WILDS benchmark Camelyon17 demonstrate consistent performance gains
over state-of-the-art OOD baselines, highlighting the potential of causal
perturbation as a tool for reliable and interpretable generalization.

*Christoph Timmermann,Hyunse Lee,Woojin Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeMoBridge addresses CLIP's intra-modal misalignment in few-shot classification by mapping images to text modality while preserving semantics, outperforming existing methods especially in low-data scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP's performance in few-shot classification is limited by intra-modal misalignment caused by modality gap and inter-modal training, making direct image comparisons unreliable.

Method: SeMoBridge uses a Semantic Modality Bridge to map images into text modality while preserving semantic content. It's closed-form and can be trained with multi-modal supervision combining image and text-alignment losses.

Result: SeMoBridge-T (trained version) requires minimal training time and outperforms other methods, particularly in 1, 2, and 4-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: SeMoBridge effectively addresses CLIP's intra-modal misalignment issue through semantic modality bridging, achieving superior few-shot classification performance with efficient training.

Abstract: While Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) excels at zero-shot tasks
by aligning image and text embeddings, its performance in few-shot
classification is hindered by a critical limitation: intra-modal misalignment.
This issue, caused by a persistent modality gap and CLIP's exclusively
inter-modal training objective, leaves the embedding spaces uncalibrated,
making direct image-to-image comparisons unreliable. Existing methods attempt
to address this by refining similarity logits or by computationally expensive
per-sample optimization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce SeMoBridge,
a lightweight yet powerful approach that directly addresses the misalignment.
Our method maps images into the text modality, while keeping their semantic
content intact through what we call a Semantic Modality Bridge. SeMoBridge is
closed-form and can optionally be trained through multi-modal supervision,
combining image and text-alignment losses to optimize the projection.
Experiments show that the trained version, SeMoBridge-T, requires only a
fraction of the training time while overall outperforming other methods,
particularly in low-data scenarios (1, 2, and 4 shots). The code is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HAMMER performs well on DGM4 dataset but fails when main subjects are placed in implausible backgrounds due to label-space bias, local attention focus, and spurious text-foreground alignment.

Method: Proposed segmentation-guided scoring (SGS) pipeline using person/face segmentation masks to separate foreground/background, extract embeddings with vision-language model, compute region-aware coherence scores, and fuse with HAMMER's predictions.

Result: Significantly enhanced robustness to global manipulations with negligible computational overhead, improving binary detection, grounding, and token-level explanations.

Conclusion: Demonstrates importance of region-aware reasoning in multimodal disinformation detection; SGS is inference-only and effective for handling global scene inconsistencies.

Abstract: We extend HAMMER, a state-of-the-art model for multimodal manipulation
detection, to handle global scene inconsistencies such as foreground-background
(FG-BG) mismatch. While HAMMER achieves strong performance on the DGM4 dataset,
it consistently fails when the main subject is contextually misplaced into an
implausible background. We diagnose this limitation as a combination of
label-space bias, local attention focus, and spurious text-foreground
alignment. To remedy this without retraining, we propose a lightweight
segmentation-guided scoring (SGS) pipeline. SGS uses person/face segmentation
masks to separate foreground and background regions, extracts embeddings with a
joint vision-language model, and computes region-aware coherence scores. These
scores are fused with HAMMER's original prediction to improve binary detection,
grounding, and token-level explanations. SGS is inference-only, incurs
negligible computational overhead, and significantly enhances robustness to
global manipulations. This work demonstrates the importance of region-aware
reasoning in multimodal disinformation detection. We release scripts for
segmentation and scoring at https://github.com/Gaganx0/HAMMER-sgs

### [80] [DGM4+: Dataset Extension for Global Scene Inconsistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26047)
*Gagandeep Singh,Samudi Amarsinghe,Priyanka Singh,Xue Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper extends the DGM4 dataset with 5,000 new samples featuring foreground-background mismatches and their hybrids with text manipulations to address global inconsistencies in multimodal disinformation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current datasets like DGM4 only cover local manipulations (face swaps, attribute edits, caption changes), leaving a critical gap for global inconsistencies such as mismatched foregrounds and backgrounds that are prevalent in real-world forgeries.

Method: Used OpenAI's gpt-image-1 with carefully designed prompts to generate human-centric news-style images with authentic figures in absurd/impossible backdrops. Created captions under three conditions (literal, text attribute, text split) yielding three manipulation categories: FG-BG, FG-BG+TA, and FG-BG+TS. Implemented quality control pipelines for face visibility, deduplication, text scrubbing, and realistic headlines.

Result: Created DGM4+ dataset extension with 5,000 high-quality samples that introduce foreground-background mismatches and their hybrids with text manipulations, creating a comprehensive benchmark for testing detectors on both local and global reasoning.

Conclusion: The DGM4+ dataset extension addresses the critical gap in global manipulation detection, providing a resource to strengthen evaluation of multimodal models that currently struggle with foreground-background inconsistencies.

Abstract: The rapid advances in generative models have significantly lowered the
barrier to producing convincing multimodal disinformation. Fabricated images
and manipulated captions increasingly co-occur to create persuasive false
narratives. While the Detecting and Grounding Multi-Modal Media Manipulation
(DGM4) dataset established a foundation for research in this area, it is
restricted to local manipulations such as face swaps, attribute edits, and
caption changes. This leaves a critical gap: global inconsistencies, such as
mismatched foregrounds and backgrounds, which are now prevalent in real-world
forgeries. To address this, we extend DGM4 with 5,000 high-quality samples that
introduce Foreground-Background (FG-BG) mismatches and their hybrids with text
manipulations. Using OpenAI's gpt-image-1 and carefully designed prompts, we
generate human-centric news-style images where authentic figures are placed
into absurd or impossible backdrops (e.g., a teacher calmly addressing students
on the surface of Mars). Captions are produced under three conditions: literal,
text attribute, and text split, yielding three new manipulation categories:
FG-BG, FG-BG+TA, and FG-BG+TS. Quality control pipelines enforce one-to-three
visible faces, perceptual hash deduplication, OCR-based text scrubbing, and
realistic headline length. By introducing global manipulations, our extension
complements existing datasets, creating a benchmark DGM4+ that tests detectors
on both local and global reasoning. This resource is intended to strengthen
evaluation of multimodal models such as HAMMER, which currently struggle with
FG-BG inconsistencies. We release our DGM4+ dataset and generation script at

*Ioana Ciuclea,Giorgio Longari,Alice Barbara Tumpach*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A geometric learning method using principal fiber bundle sections to mod out symmetries in classification tasks, avoiding data augmentation and enabling direct orbit comparison.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address symmetries in computer vision and medical datasets without relying on data augmentation, creating more sustainable algorithms that directly account for rotational, scaling, and other symmetries.

Method: Uses the mathematical framework of principal fiber bundle sections to quotient out symmetry groups, allowing measurement of dissimilarities between object orbits. Introduces a 2-parameter family of canonical curve parameterizations.

Result: Successfully demonstrated on object contour datasets with translation, rotation, scaling, and reparameterization symmetries. Provides optimized sections for class separation and offers publicly available code.

Conclusion: The geometric framework provides a principled alternative to data augmentation for handling symmetries, with broad applicability across domains. The method enables direct orbit comparison and section optimization for improved classification.

Abstract: Most datasets encountered in computer vision and medical applications present
symmetries that should be taken into account in classification tasks. A typical
example is the symmetry by rotation and/or scaling in object detection. A
common way to build neural networks that learn the symmetries is to use data
augmentation. In order to avoid data augmentation and build more sustainable
algorithms, we present an alternative method to mod out symmetries based on the
notion of section of a principal fiber bundle. This framework allows the use of
simple metrics on the space of objects in order to measure dissimilarities
between orbits of objects under the symmetry group. Moreover, the section used
can be optimized to maximize separation of classes. We illustrate this
methodology on a dataset of contours of objects for the groups of translations,
rotations, scalings and reparameterizations. In particular, we present a
$2$-parameter family of canonical parameterizations of curves, containing the
constant-speed parameterization as a special case, which we believe is
interesting in its own right. We hope that this simple application will serve
to convey the geometric concepts underlying this method, which have a wide
range of possible applications. The code is available at the following link:

### [82] [EasyOcc: 3D Pseudo-Label Supervision for Fully Self-Supervised Semantic Occupancy Prediction Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26087)
*Seamie Hayes,Ganesh Sistu,Ciarán Eising*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes 3D pseudo-ground-truth labels using foundation models (Grounded-SAM and Metric3Dv2) with temporal densification to improve self-supervised semantic occupancy prediction, achieving significant performance gains and enabling a streamlined model that avoids complex rendering strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational costs and memory usage of existing self-supervised techniques like novel view synthesis, cross-view rendering, and depth estimation in semantic occupancy prediction.

Method: Generates 3D pseudo-ground-truth labels using foundation models Grounded-SAM and Metric3Dv2, leverages temporal information for label densification, and proposes EasyOcc model that learns solely from these labels without complex rendering.

Result: 45% mIoU improvement (9.73 to 14.09) when integrated into OccNeRF; EasyOcc achieves 13.86 mIoU and 7.71 mIoU on full scene without camera mask, outperforming previous best by 31%.

Conclusion: Foundation models, temporal context, and loss computation space choice are critical for self-supervised learning in comprehensive scene understanding.

Abstract: Self-supervised models have recently achieved notable advancements,
particularly in the domain of semantic occupancy prediction. These models
utilize sophisticated loss computation strategies to compensate for the absence
of ground-truth labels. For instance, techniques such as novel view synthesis,
cross-view rendering, and depth estimation have been explored to address the
issue of semantic and depth ambiguity. However, such techniques typically incur
high computational costs and memory usage during the training stage, especially
in the case of novel view synthesis. To mitigate these issues, we propose 3D
pseudo-ground-truth labels generated by the foundation models Grounded-SAM and
Metric3Dv2, and harness temporal information for label densification. Our 3D
pseudo-labels can be easily integrated into existing models, which yields
substantial performance improvements, with mIoU increasing by 45\%, from 9.73
to 14.09, when implemented into the OccNeRF model. This stands in contrast to
earlier advancements in the field, which are often not readily transferable to
other architectures. Additionally, we propose a streamlined model, EasyOcc,
achieving 13.86 mIoU. This model conducts learning solely from our labels,
avoiding complex rendering strategies mentioned previously. Furthermore, our
method enables models to attain state-of-the-art performance when evaluated on
the full scene without applying the camera mask, with EasyOcc achieving 7.71
mIoU, outperforming the previous best model by 31\%. These findings highlight
the critical importance of foundation models, temporal context, and the choice
of loss computation space in self-supervised learning for comprehensive scene
understanding.

TL;DR: A real-time deep learning framework predicts penalty kick direction using RGB frames and pose keypoints with 89% accuracy before ball contact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Penalty kicks often decide championships, and goalkeepers need to anticipate kicker's intent from subtle biomechanical cues within very short time windows.

Method: Dual-branch architecture: MobileNetV2 CNN for RGB frames and LSTM with attention for 2D keypoints. Pose-derived keypoints guide visual focus. Distance-based thresholding segments input sequences before ball contact.

Result: 89% accuracy on held-out test set, outperforming visual-only and pose-only baselines by 14-22%. Inference time of 22 milliseconds.

Conclusion: Lightweight and interpretable design suitable for goalkeeper training, tactical analysis, and real-time game analytics.

Abstract: Penalty kicks often decide championships, yet goalkeepers must anticipate the
kicker's intent from subtle biomechanical cues within a very short time window.
This study introduces a real-time, multi-modal deep learning framework to
predict the direction of a penalty kick (left, middle, or right) before ball
contact. The model uses a dual-branch architecture: a MobileNetV2-based CNN
extracts spatial features from RGB frames, while 2D keypoints are processed by
an LSTM network with attention mechanisms. Pose-derived keypoints further guide
visual focus toward task-relevant regions. A distance-based thresholding method
segments input sequences immediately before ball contact, ensuring consistent
input across diverse footage. A custom dataset of 755 penalty kick events was
created from real match videos, with frame-level annotations for object
detection, shooter keypoints, and final ball placement. The model achieved 89%
accuracy on a held-out test set, outperforming visual-only and pose-only
baselines by 14-22%. With an inference time of 22 milliseconds, the lightweight
and interpretable design makes it suitable for goalkeeper training, tactical
analysis, and real-time game analytics.

TL;DR: Reason-3D is a text-to-scene model that uses large reasoning models to generate 3D environments from text descriptions, improving on complex geometries and instruction adherence through object retrieval and spatial reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-scene methods struggle with complex geometries, object transformations, and weak adherence to complex instructions, limiting their practical application.

Method: Integrates object retrieval using captions covering physical, functional, and contextual attributes, places objects based on implicit and explicit layout constraints, and refines positions with collision-aware spatial reasoning.

Result: Significantly outperforms previous methods in human-rated visual fidelity, adherence to constraints, and asset retrieval quality across simple to complex indoor configurations.

Conclusion: Demonstrates advanced spatial reasoning abilities of modern LRMs and contributes to text-to-scene generation, with codebase released to advance research in object retrieval and placement.

Abstract: Prompt-driven scene synthesis allows users to generate complete 3D
environments from textual descriptions. Current text-to-scene methods often
struggle with complex geometries and object transformations, and tend to show
weak adherence to complex instructions. We address these limitations by
introducing Reason-3D, a text-to-scene model powered by large reasoning models
(LRMs). Reason-3D integrates object retrieval using captions covering physical,
functional, and contextual attributes. Reason-3D then places the selected
objects based on implicit and explicit layout constraints, and refines their
positions with collision-aware spatial reasoning. Evaluated on instructions
ranging from simple to complex indoor configurations, Reason-3D significantly
outperforms previous methods in human-rated visual fidelity, adherence to
constraints, and asset retrieval quality. Beyond its contribution to the field
of text-to-scene generation, our work showcases the advanced spatial reasoning
abilities of modern LRMs. Additionally, we release the codebase to further the
research in object retrieval and placement with LRMs.

### [85] [EVODiff: Entropy-aware Variance Optimized Diffusion Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26096)
*Shigui Li,Wei Chen,Delu Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EVODiff is an entropy-aware variance optimized method for diffusion models that improves inference efficiency by optimizing conditional entropy during denoising, achieving significant performance gains over state-of-the-art solvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models suffer from slow inference and training-inference discrepancies, and existing gradient-based solvers lack theoretical foundations in information transmission efficiency.

Method: Proposed an information-theoretic perspective revealing that successful denoising reduces conditional entropy, leading to EVODiff - an entropy-aware variance optimized method that systematically reduces uncertainty by optimizing conditional variance during denoising.

Result: EVODiff significantly outperforms SOTA solvers: reduces reconstruction error by 45.5% (FID improves from 5.10 to 2.78) at 10 NFE on CIFAR-10, cuts NFE cost by 25% (20 to 15) for high-quality samples on ImageNet-256, and improves text-to-image generation with reduced artifacts.

Conclusion: The information-theoretic perspective provides fundamental insights into diffusion model inference, and EVODiff demonstrates that optimizing conditional entropy during denoising leads to substantial improvements in inference efficiency and generation quality.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) excel in image generation, but suffer from slow
inference and the training-inference discrepancies. Although gradient-based
solvers like DPM-Solver accelerate the denoising inference, they lack
theoretical foundations in information transmission efficiency. In this work,
we introduce an information-theoretic perspective on the inference processes of
DMs, revealing that successful denoising fundamentally reduces conditional
entropy in reverse transitions. This principle leads to our key insights into
the inference processes: (1) data prediction parameterization outperforms its
noise counterpart, and (2) optimizing conditional variance offers a
reference-free way to minimize both transition and reconstruction errors. Based
on these insights, we propose an entropy-aware variance optimized method for
the generative process of DMs, called EVODiff, which systematically reduces
uncertainty by optimizing conditional entropy during denoising. Extensive
experiments on DMs validate our insights and demonstrate that our method
significantly and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA)
gradient-based solvers. For example, compared to the DPM-Solver++, EVODiff
reduces the reconstruction error by up to 45.5\% (FID improves from 5.10 to
2.78) at 10 function evaluations (NFE) on CIFAR-10, cuts the NFE cost by 25\%
(from 20 to 15 NFE) for high-quality samples on ImageNet-256, and improves
text-to-image generation while reducing artifacts. Code is available at

### [86] [EchoGen: Generating Visual Echoes in Any Scene via Feed-Forward Subject-Driven Auto-Regressive Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26127)
*Ruixiao Dong,Zhendong Wang,Keli Liu,Li Li,Ying Chen,Kai Li,Daowen Li,Houqiang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EchoGen is a novel feed-forward subject-driven generation framework built on Visual Auto-Regressive (VAR) models that achieves high fidelity and fast inference by using dual-path injection to separate semantic identity from fine-grained details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current subject-driven generation methods face a trade-off between computational efficiency and quality - either requiring expensive per-subject fine-tuning or suffering from slow inference speeds in diffusion models. VAR models offer fast sampling but lack subject-driven capabilities.

Method: EchoGen employs a dual-path injection strategy with: 1) a semantic encoder that extracts abstract identity and injects via decoupled cross-attention for composition guidance, and 2) a content encoder that captures visual details and integrates via multi-modal attention for texture/structure preservation.

Result: EchoGen achieves subject fidelity and image quality comparable to state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods while significantly reducing sampling latency, making it the first feed-forward subject-driven framework on VAR models.

Conclusion: EchoGen successfully bridges the gap between efficiency and quality in subject-driven generation by leveraging VAR models' fast sampling while adding effective subject control through dual-path injection, offering a promising alternative to current approaches.

Abstract: Subject-driven generation is a critical task in creative AI; yet current
state-of-the-art methods present a stark trade-off. They either rely on
computationally expensive, per-subject fine-tuning, sacrificing efficiency and
zero-shot capability, or employ feed-forward architectures built on diffusion
models, which are inherently plagued by slow inference speeds. Visual
Auto-Regressive (VAR) models are renowned for their rapid sampling speeds and
strong generative quality, making them an ideal yet underexplored foundation
for resolving this tension. To bridge this gap, we introduce EchoGen, a
pioneering framework that empowers VAR models with subject-driven generation
capabilities. The core design of EchoGen is an effective dual-path injection
strategy that disentangles a subject's high-level semantic identity from its
low-level fine-grained details, enabling enhanced controllability and fidelity.
We employ a semantic encoder to extract the subject's abstract identity, which
is injected through decoupled cross-attention to guide the overall composition.
Concurrently, a content encoder captures intricate visual details, which are
integrated via a multi-modal attention mechanism to ensure high-fidelity
texture and structural preservation. To the best of our knowledge, EchoGen is
the first feed-forward subject-driven framework built upon VAR models. Both
quantitative and qualitative results substantiate our design, demonstrating
that EchoGen achieves subject fidelity and image quality comparable to
state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods with significantly lower sampling
latency. Code and models will be released soon.

*Sachith Abeywickrama,Emadeldeen Eldele,Min Wu,Xiaoli Li,Chau Yuen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EntroPE is a novel framework that uses entropy-guided dynamic patching to preserve temporal coherence in time series forecasting, improving both accuracy and efficiency over existing patch-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing patch-based transformer approaches use temporally-agnostic patch construction that fractures temporal coherence by splitting natural transitions across boundaries, disrupting short-term dependencies and weakening representation learning.

Method: EntroPE consists of two modules: Entropy-based Dynamic Patcher (EDP) that uses conditional entropy to detect transition points and determine patch boundaries, and Adaptive Patch Encoder (APE) that uses pooling and cross-attention to capture intra-patch dependencies and produce fixed-size latent representations, followed by a global transformer for inter-patch dynamics.

Result: Experiments across long-term forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that EntroPE improves both accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Entropy-guided dynamic patching establishes a promising new paradigm for time series modeling that preserves temporal structure while maintaining computational benefits.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have significantly advanced time series forecasting,
with patch-based input strategies offering efficiency and improved long-horizon
modeling. Yet, existing approaches rely on temporally-agnostic patch
construction, where arbitrary starting positions and fixed lengths fracture
temporal coherence by splitting natural transitions across boundaries. This
naive segmentation often disrupts short-term dependencies and weakens
representation learning. In response, we propose EntroPE (Entropy-Guided
Dynamic Patch Encoder), a novel, temporally informed framework that dynamically
detects transition points via conditional entropy and dynamically places patch
boundaries. This preserves temporal structure while retaining the computational
benefits of patching. EntroPE consists of two key modules, namely an
Entropy-based Dynamic Patcher (EDP) that applies information-theoretic criteria
to locate natural temporal shifts and determine patch boundaries, and an
Adaptive Patch Encoder (APE) that employs pooling and cross-attention to
capture intra-patch dependencies and produce fixed-size latent representations.
These embeddings are then processed by a global transformer to model
inter-patch dynamics. Experiments across long-term forecasting benchmarks
demonstrate that EntroPE improves both accuracy and efficiency, establishing
entropy-guided dynamic patching as a promising new paradigm for time series
modeling. Code is available at: https://github.com/Sachithx/EntroPE.

Abstract: The performance of deep neural networks is strongly influenced by the quality

an automated pipeline for text-guided edge-case synthesis. Our approach employs
a Large Language Model, fine-tuned via preference learning, to rephrase image

generating difficult visual scenarios. Evaluated on the FishEye8K object

TL;DR: Human-MME is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on human-centric scene understanding, featuring diverse human scenes, progressive evaluation dimensions, and high-quality annotations across 19,945 image-question pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs lack comprehensive evaluation for human-centric scenes due to absence of benchmarks that consider human-oriented granular level and higher-dimensional causal reasoning, compounded by the physical complexity of human body and annotation difficulties.

Method: Created a curated benchmark with: 1) Diverse human scenes across 4 primary domains, 15 secondary domains, and 43 sub-fields; 2) Progressive evaluation from granular perception to higher-dimensional reasoning across eight dimensions; 3) Automated annotation pipeline and human-annotation platform with multiple question types (choice, short-answer, grounding, ranking, judgment).

Result: Extensive experiments on 17 state-of-the-art MLLMs effectively exposed limitations in human-centric understanding and provided guidance for future research. The benchmark successfully extends single-target understanding to multi-person and multi-image mutual understanding.

Conclusion: Human-MME provides a holistic evaluation framework for MLLMs in human-centric scene understanding, addressing current gaps and guiding future development of MLLMs toward better human-centric image comprehension. All data and code are publicly available.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
advances in visual understanding tasks. However, their capacity to comprehend
human-centric scenes has rarely been explored, primarily due to the absence of
comprehensive evaluation benchmarks that take into account both the
human-oriented granular level and higher-dimensional causal reasoning ability.
Such high-quality evaluation benchmarks face tough obstacles, given the
physical complexity of the human body and the difficulty of annotating granular
structures. In this paper, we propose Human-MME, a curated benchmark designed
to provide a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs in human-centric scene
understanding. Compared with other existing benchmarks, our work provides three
key features: 1. Diversity in human scene, spanning 4 primary visual domains
with 15 secondary domains and 43 sub-fields to ensure broad scenario coverage.
2. Progressive and diverse evaluation dimensions, evaluating the human-based
activities progressively from the human-oriented granular perception to the
higher-dimensional reasoning, consisting of eight dimensions with 19,945
real-world image question pairs and an evaluation suite. 3. High-quality
annotations with rich data paradigms, constructing the automated annotation
pipeline and human-annotation platform, supporting rigorous manual labeling to
facilitate precise and reliable model assessment. Our benchmark extends the
single-target understanding to the multi-person and multi-image mutual
understanding by constructing the choice, short-answer, grounding, ranking and
judgment question components, and complex questions of their combination. The
extensive experiments on 17 state-of-the-art MLLMs effectively expose the
limitations and guide future MLLMs research toward better human-centric image
understanding. All data and code are available at

*Mohammad Khoshkdahan,Arman Akbari,Arash Akbari,Xuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates fairness in pedestrian detection for autonomous driving, examining how pedestrian pose variations and joint occlusions affect detection performance across multiple models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While pedestrian detection focuses on reducing miss-rates for safety in autonomous driving, fairness across different pedestrian poses and occlusions remains underexplored but equally important for reliable performance.

Method: Evaluated five pedestrian-specific detectors (F2DNet, MGAN, ALFNet, CSP, Cascade R-CNN) and three YOLOv12 variants on ECP-DP dataset, using Equal Opportunity Difference metric and Z-test for statistical significance across pose attributes and joint occlusions.

Result: Found biases against pedestrians with parallel legs, straight elbows, and lateral views. Lower body joint occlusions had more negative impact than upper body/head. Cascade R-CNN achieved lowest miss-rate and smallest bias.

Conclusion: This is the first comprehensive pose- and occlusion-aware fairness evaluation in pedestrian detection for autonomous driving, revealing systematic biases that need addressing for equitable performance.

Abstract: Pedestrian detection plays a critical role in autonomous driving (AD), where
ensuring safety and reliability is important. While many detection models aim
to reduce miss-rates and handle challenges such as occlusion and long-range
recognition, fairness remains an underexplored yet equally important concern.
In this work, we systematically investigate how variations in the pedestrian
pose -- including leg status, elbow status, and body orientation -- as well as
individual joint occlusions, affect detection performance. We evaluate five
pedestrian-specific detectors (F2DNet, MGAN, ALFNet, CSP, and Cascade R-CNN)
alongside three general-purpose models (YOLOv12 variants) on the EuroCity
Persons Dense Pose (ECP-DP) dataset. Fairness is quantified using the Equal
Opportunity Difference (EOD) metric across various confidence thresholds. To
assess statistical significance and robustness, we apply the Z-test. Our
findings highlight biases against pedestrians with parallel legs, straight
elbows, and lateral views. Occlusion of lower body joints has a more negative
impact on the detection rate compared to the upper body and head. Cascade R-CNN
achieves the lowest overall miss-rate and exhibits the smallest bias across all
attributes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive pose-
and occlusion-aware fairness evaluation in pedestrian detection for AD.

Conclusion: AttriGen establishes a new paradigm that can be extended to other computer vision classification tasks by effectively automating the expansion of multi-attribute labels.

Abstract: We introduce AttriGen, a novel framework for automated, fine-grained
multi-attribute annotation in computer vision, with a particular focus on cell
microscopy where multi-attribute classification remains underrepresented
compared to traditional cell type categorization. Using two complementary
datasets: the Peripheral Blood Cell (PBC) dataset containing eight distinct
cell types and the WBC Attribute Dataset (WBCAtt) that contains their
corresponding 11 morphological attributes, we propose a dual-model architecture
that combines a CNN for cell type classification, as well as a Vision
Transformer (ViT) for multi-attribute classification achieving a new benchmark
of 94.62\% accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that AttriGen significantly
enhances model interpretability and offers substantial time and cost efficiency
relative to conventional full-scale human annotation. Thus, our framework
establishes a new paradigm that can be extended to other computer vision
classification tasks by effectively automating the expansion of multi-attribute
labels.

Conclusion: TSalV360 successfully enables text-driven saliency detection in 360-degree videos, allowing users to customize which objects/events are highlighted based on textual descriptions.

Abstract: In this paper, we deal with the task of text-driven saliency detection in
360-degrees videos. For this, we introduce the TSV360 dataset which includes
16,000 triplets of ERP frames, textual descriptions of salient objects/events
in these frames, and the associated ground-truth saliency maps. Following, we
extend and adapt a SOTA visual-based approach for 360-degrees video saliency
detection, and develop the TSalV360 method that takes into account a
user-provided text description of the desired objects and/or events. This
method leverages a SOTA vision-language model for data representation and
integrates a similarity estimation module and a viewport spatio-temporal
cross-attention mechanism, to discover dependencies between the different data
modalities. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations using the TSV360 dataset,
showed the competitiveness of TSalV360 compared to a SOTA visual-based approach
and documented its competency to perform customized text-driven saliency
detection in 360-degrees videos.

*Chenyang Jiang,Zhengcen Li,Hang Zhao,Qiben Shan,Shaocong Wu,Jingyong Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GSDD proposes a sparse dataset distillation method using 2D Gaussians instead of dense pixel representations, achieving state-of-the-art performance with high efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the redundancy and scalability issues of conventional dense pixel-level dataset distillation methods, which introduce computational and storage burdens.

Method: Uses sparse 2D Gaussian primitives to encode critical discriminative information, adapting CUDA-based splatting operators for parallel inference and training with minimal overhead.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet subsets while maintaining high efficiency in encoding and decoding.

Conclusion: GSDD provides an effective, scalable, and broadly applicable sparse representation for dataset distillation that outperforms conventional methods.

Abstract: Dataset distillation has emerged as a promising paradigm that synthesizes
compact, informative datasets capable of retaining the knowledge of large-scale
counterparts, thereby addressing the substantial computational and storage
burdens of modern model training. Conventional approaches typically rely on
dense pixel-level representations, which introduce redundancy and are difficult
to scale up. In this work, we propose GSDD, a novel and efficient sparse
representation for dataset distillation based on 2D Gaussians. Instead of
representing all pixels equally, GSDD encodes critical discriminative
information in a distilled image using only a small number of Gaussian
primitives. This sparse representation could improve dataset diversity under
the same storage budget, enhancing coverage of difficult samples and boosting
distillation performance. To ensure both efficiency and scalability, we adapt
CUDA-based splatting operators for parallel inference and training, enabling
high-quality rendering with minimal computational and memory overhead. Our
method is simple yet effective, broadly applicable to different distillation
pipelines, and highly scalable. Experiments show that GSDD achieves
state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet subsets,
while remaining highly efficient encoding and decoding cost. Our code is

*Thomas Eleftheriadis,Evlampios Apostolidis,Vasileios Mezaris*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Experimental study on generating plausible textual explanations for video summarization outcomes using LLaVA-OneVision model and evaluating plausibility through semantic overlap between visual explanations and video summaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for explainable AI in video summarization by generating natural language explanations that align with human reasoning and expectations.

Method: Extended existing framework by integrating LLaVA-OneVision to generate textual descriptions of visual explanations, then evaluated plausibility using semantic overlap metrics with SBERT and SimCSE sentence embeddings.

Result: Conducted experiments using CA-SUM method on SumMe and TVSum datasets to examine relationship between explanation faithfulness and plausibility, and identify best approaches for generating plausible textual explanations.

Conclusion: The study provides a framework for generating and evaluating plausible textual explanations for video summarization, helping bridge the gap between AI explanations and human understanding.

Abstract: In this paper, we present our experimental study on generating plausible
textual explanations for the outcomes of video summarization. For the needs of
this study, we extend an existing framework for multigranular explanation of
video summarization by integrating a SOTA Large Multimodal Model
(LLaVA-OneVision) and prompting it to produce natural language descriptions of
the obtained visual explanations. Following, we focus on one of the most
desired characteristics for explainable AI, the plausibility of the obtained
explanations that relates with their alignment with the humans' reasoning and
expectations. Using the extended framework, we propose an approach for
evaluating the plausibility of visual explanations by quantifying the semantic
overlap between their textual descriptions and the textual descriptions of the
corresponding video summaries, with the help of two methods for creating
sentence embeddings (SBERT, SimCSE). Based on the extended framework and the
proposed plausibility evaluation approach, we conduct an experimental study
using a SOTA method (CA-SUM) and two datasets (SumMe, TVSum) for video
summarization, to examine whether the more faithful explanations are also the
more plausible ones, and identify the most appropriate approach for generating
plausible textual explanations for video summarization.

*Haiyang Zheng,Nan Pu,Wenjing Li,Nicu Sebe,Zhun Zhong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MGCE is a framework for Generalized Category Discovery that addresses limitations of existing methods by using multi-granularity conceptual experts to automatically discover categories without needing to know the number of categories in advance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GCD approaches fail to exploit multi-granularity conceptual information and assume the number of unlabeled categories is known, which is impractical for real-world open-world scenarios.

Method: Proposes Multi-Granularity Conceptual Experts (MGCE) with two modules: Dynamic Conceptual Contrastive Learning (DCCL) for concept mining and dual-level representation learning, and Multi-Granularity Experts Collaborative Learning (MECL) using multiple experts at different granularities with concept alignment for cross-expert collaboration.

Result: MGCE achieves state-of-the-art results on nine fine-grained visual recognition benchmarks, with 3.6% average improvement over parametric approaches that require knowing exact category numbers, particularly excelling in novel-class accuracy.

Conclusion: MGCE effectively addresses key limitations in GCD by adaptively mining multi-granularity concepts and automatically estimating category numbers, making it suitable for practical open-world applications.

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) is an open-world problem that clusters
unlabeled data by leveraging knowledge from partially labeled categories. A key
challenge is that unlabeled data may contain both known and novel categories.
Existing approaches suffer from two main limitations. First, they fail to
exploit multi-granularity conceptual information in visual data, which limits
representation quality. Second, most assume that the number of unlabeled
categories is known during training, which is impractical in real-world
scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Granularity Conceptual
Experts (MGCE) framework that adaptively mines visual concepts and integrates
multi-granularity knowledge for accurate category discovery. MGCE consists of
two modules: (1) Dynamic Conceptual Contrastive Learning (DCCL), which
alternates between concept mining and dual-level representation learning to
jointly optimize feature learning and category discovery; and (2)
Multi-Granularity Experts Collaborative Learning (MECL), which extends the
single-expert paradigm by introducing additional experts at different
granularities and by employing a concept alignment matrix for effective
cross-expert collaboration. Importantly, MGCE can automatically estimate the
number of categories in unlabeled data, making it suitable for practical
open-world settings. Extensive experiments on nine fine-grained visual
recognition benchmarks demonstrate that MGCE achieves state-of-the-art results,
particularly in novel-class accuracy. Notably, even without prior knowledge of
category numbers, MGCE outperforms parametric approaches that require knowing
the exact number of categories, with an average improvement of 3.6\%. Code is

### [96] [IMG: Calibrating Diffusion Models via Implicit Multimodal Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26231)
*Jiayi Guo,Chuanhao Yan,Xingqian Xu,Yulin Wang,Kai Wang,Gao Huang,Humphrey Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IMG is a re-generation-based multimodal alignment framework that uses MLLMs to identify misalignments and an Implicit Aligner to manipulate diffusion features, achieving superior alignment without extra data or editing operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multimodal alignment face limitations: finetuning requires scarce high-quality preference data, while editing-based methods may compromise overall image quality.

Method: IMG uses MLLMs to detect misalignments, an Implicit Aligner to manipulate diffusion conditioning features, and an Iteratively Updated Preference Objective for training.

Result: Extensive evaluations on SDXL, SDXL-DPO, and FLUX show IMG outperforms existing alignment methods and works as a plug-and-play adapter to enhance prior methods.

Conclusion: IMG provides an effective data-free solution for multimodal alignment that can be flexibly integrated with existing diffusion models and alignment techniques.

Abstract: Ensuring precise multimodal alignment between diffusion-generated images and
input prompts has been a long-standing challenge. Earlier works finetune
diffusion weight using high-quality preference data, which tends to be limited
and difficult to scale up. Recent editing-based methods further refine local
regions of generated images but may compromise overall image quality. In this
work, we propose Implicit Multimodal Guidance (IMG), a novel
re-generation-based multimodal alignment framework that requires no extra data
or editing operations. Specifically, given a generated image and its prompt,
IMG a) utilizes a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to identify
misalignments; b) introduces an Implicit Aligner that manipulates diffusion
conditioning features to reduce misalignments and enable re-generation; and c)
formulates the re-alignment goal into a trainable objective, namely Iteratively
Updated Preference Objective. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
evaluations on SDXL, SDXL-DPO, and FLUX show that IMG outperforms existing
alignment methods. Furthermore, IMG acts as a flexible plug-and-play adapter,
seamlessly enhancing prior finetuning-based alignment methods. Our code will be
available at https://github.com/SHI-Labs/IMG-Multimodal-Diffusion-Alignment.

*Adnan Ben Mansour,Ayoub Karine,David Naccache*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Donut-MINT, a compressed version of the Donut model for document understanding that uses mechanistic interpretability to guide knowledge distillation and pruning, reducing inference time and memory usage while maintaining performance on DocVQA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Vision-Language Models like Donut are effective for document understanding but too costly for real-time or resource-constrained applications, necessitating model compression.

Method: Uses knowledge distillation with mechanistic interpretability to analyze internal computations, identify essential subcomponents, and guide pruning decisions (approximate, skip, or reparametrize components).

Result: Developed Donut-MINT, a pruned Donut variant that reduces inference time and memory usage while maintaining strong performance on DocVQA benchmark.

Conclusion: The method reframes compression as circuit discovery, bridging interpretability research and practical Vision-Language Model deployment.

Abstract: Recent advances in Visually-rich Document Understanding rely on large
Vision-Language Models like Donut, which perform document-level Visual Question
Answering without Optical Character Recognition. Despite their effectiveness,
these models are too costly for real-time or resource-constrained applications.
We investigate model compression through knowledge distillation, training
compact student models from a larger teacher. We leverage mechanistic
interpretability to drive student architecture design within this framework. By
analyzing internal computations, we identify essential subcomponents to retain,
while having a clear view of which subcomponents should be approximated,
skipped, or reparametrized based on their function. This approach yields
Donut-MINT (Mechanistic Interpretability-based Network Trimming), a pruned
Donut variant that reduces inference time and memory usage while maintaining
strong performance on DocVQA, a standard benchmark for document Visual Question
Answering. Our method reframes compression as circuit discovery, bridging
interpretability research and practical Vision-Language Model deployment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Farsighted-LAM improves latent action models with geometry-aware spatial encoding and multi-scale temporal modeling, while SSM-VLA integrates this with explicit reasoning via visual Chain-of-Thought for enhanced VLA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Latent Action Models (LAMs) suffer from poor spatial understanding and limited temporal perception when input frames are distant, hindering stable action modeling.

Method: Proposed Farsighted-LAM with geometry-aware spatial encoding and multi-scale temporal modeling, and SSM-VLA framework that integrates structured perception with visual Chain-of-Thought for explicit reasoning.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on multiple VLA tasks in both simulation and real-world settings, demonstrating enhanced robustness and generalizability.

Conclusion: Combining geometry-aware modeling, temporal coherence, and explicit reasoning effectively enhances the robustness and generalizability of embodied intelligence.

Abstract: Latent Action Models (LAMs) enable Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems to
learn semantic action representations from large-scale unannotated data. Yet,
we identify two bottlenecks of LAMs: 1) the commonly adopted end-to-end trained
image encoder suffers from poor spatial understanding; 2) LAMs can be fragile
when input frames are distant, leading to limited temporal perception. Such
factors inevitably hinder stable and clear action modeling. To this end, we
propose Farsighted-LAM, a latent action framework with geometry-aware spatial
encoding and multi-scale temporal modeling, capturing structural priors and
dynamic motion patterns from consecutive frames. We further propose SSM-VLA, an
end-to-end VLA framework built upon Farsighted-LAM, which integrates structured
perception with a visual Chain-of-Thought module to explicitly reason about
environmental dynamics, enhancing decision consistency and interpretability. We
validate SSM-VLA on multiple VLA tasks in both simulation and real-world
settings, and achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our results demonstrate
that our strategy of combining geometry-aware modeling, temporal coherence, and
explicit reasoning is effective in enhancing the robustness and
generalizability of embodied intelligence.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRPO improves deepfake detection by aligning LLM reasoning with visual evidence through paragraph-level reinforcement learning, achieving high accuracy and reasoning scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of current multimodal LLMs in deepfake detection, which produce misaligned explanations and hallucinations due to lack of visual grounding.

Method: Introduce reasoning-annotated dataset and Paragraph-level Relative Policy Optimization (PRPO), a reinforcement learning algorithm that aligns LLM reasoning with image content at paragraph level.

Result: PRPO improves detection accuracy significantly and achieves highest reasoning score of 4.55/5.0, outperforming GRPO in ablation studies.

Conclusion: Grounding multimodal reasoning in visual evidence is crucial for reliable and interpretable deepfake detection.

Abstract: The rapid rise of synthetic media has made deepfake detection a critical
challenge for online safety and trust. Progress remains constrained by the
scarcity of large, high-quality datasets. Although multimodal large language
models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning capabilities, their performance on
deepfake detection is poor, often producing explanations that are misaligned
with visual evidence or hallucinatory. To address this limitation, we introduce
a reasoning-annotated dataset for deepfake detection and propose
Paragraph-level Relative Policy Optimization (PRPO), a reinforcement learning
algorithm that aligns LLM reasoning with image content at the paragraph level.
Experiments show that PRPO improves detection accuracy by a wide margin and
achieves the highest reasoning score of 4.55/5.0. Ablation studies further
demonstrate that PRPO significantly outperforms GRPO under test-time
conditions. These results underscore the importance of grounding multimodal
reasoning in visual evidence to enable more reliable and interpretable deepfake
detection.

*Ali Zoljodi,Radu Timofte,Masoud Daneshtalab*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Cluster-based Affine Transformation (CAT) for low-bit post-training quantization, using cluster-specific parameters to align quantized outputs with full-precision counterparts without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard affine transformation worsens results in low-bit PTQ by applying uniform parameters to all outputs, leading to accuracy degradation under low-bit quantization regimes.

Method: CAT employs cluster-specific affine parameters to refine low-bit quantized outputs, requiring only negligible additional parameters without model or quantization parameter fine-tuning.

Result: Achieves up to 53.18% Top-1 accuracy on W2A2 ResNet-18 on ImageNet-1K, consistently outperforming prior PTQ methods and enhancing existing baselines by over 3% when used as a plug-in.

Conclusion: CAT provides an effective error-reduction framework for low-bit PTQ that improves accuracy with minimal overhead, demonstrating superior performance across diverse architectures and quantization settings.

Abstract: Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) reduces the memory footprint and
computational overhead of deep neural networks by converting full-precision
(FP) values into quantized and compressed data types. While PTQ is more
cost-efficient than Quantization-Aware Training (QAT), it is highly susceptible
to accuracy degradation under a low-bit quantization (LQ) regime (e.g., 2-bit).
Affine transformation is a classical technique used to reduce the discrepancy
between the information processed by a quantized model and that processed by
its full-precision counterpart; however, we find that using plain affine
transformation, which applies a uniform affine parameter set for all outputs,
worsens the results in low-bit PTQ. To address this, we propose Cluster-based
Affine Transformation (CAT), an error-reduction framework that employs
cluster-specific parameters to align LQ outputs with FP counterparts. CAT
refines LQ outputs with only a negligible number of additional parameters,
without requiring fine-tuning of the model or quantization parameters. We
further introduce a novel PTQ framework integrated with CAT. Experiments on
ImageNet-1K show that this framework consistently outperforms prior PTQ methods
across diverse architectures and LQ settings, achieving up to 53.18% Top-1
accuracy on W2A2 ResNet-18. Moreover, CAT enhances existing PTQ baselines by
more than 3% when used as a plug-in. We plan to release our implementation
alongside the publication of this paper.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing skill proficiency estimation methods rely on black-box video classifiers that ignore multi-view context and lack explainability, limiting their practical utility and transparency.

Method: ProfVLM uses an AttentiveGatedProjector to dynamically fuse multi-view features from a frozen TimeSformer backbone into a language model tuned for feedback generation, reformulating skill assessment as generative reasoning.

Result: ProfVLM surpasses state-of-the-art methods while using up to 20x fewer parameters and reducing training time by up to 60%, achieving superior accuracy across diverse activities with natural language critiques aligned with performance.

Conclusion: Generative vision-language modeling represents a powerful new direction for skill assessment, offering both accurate proficiency estimation and transparent reasoning through natural language feedback.

Abstract: Existing approaches to skill proficiency estimation often rely on black-box
video classifiers, ignoring multi-view context and lacking explainability. We
present ProfVLM, a compact vision-language model that reformulates this task as
generative reasoning: it jointly predicts skill level and generates expert-like
feedback from egocentric and exocentric videos. Central to our method is an
AttentiveGatedProjector that dynamically fuses multi-view features, projected
from a frozen TimeSformer backbone into a language model tuned for feedback
generation. Trained on EgoExo4D with expert commentaries, ProfVLM surpasses
state-of-the-art methods while using up to 20x fewer parameters and reducing
training time by up to 60%. Our approach not only achieves superior accuracy
across diverse activities, but also outputs natural language critiques aligned
with performance, offering transparent reasoning. These results highlight

TL;DR: Point2RBox-v3 improves weakly-supervised oriented object detection using progressive label assignment and prior-guided dynamic mask loss to address inefficient pseudo label utilization and poor quality issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address deficiencies in existing point-supervised methods: inefficient utilization and poor quality of pseudo labels for oriented object detection.

Method: 1) Progressive Label Assignment (PLA) - dynamically estimates instance sizes at different training stages. 2) Prior-Guided Dynamic Mask Loss (PGDM-Loss) - enhances Voronoi Watershed Loss by combining SAM model advantages with watershed algorithm.

Result: Achieves 66.09%/56.86%/41.28%/46.40%/19.60%/45.96% on DOTA-v1.0/DOTA-v1.5/DOTA-v2.0/DIOR/STAR/RSAR datasets, with excellent performance in scenarios with large object size variations or sparse occurrences.

Conclusion: First model to use dynamic pseudo labels for label assignment, creatively combines SAM model with watershed algorithm, achieving strong performance across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Driven by the growing need for Oriented Object Detection (OOD), learning from
point annotations under a weakly-supervised framework has emerged as a
promising alternative to costly and laborious manual labeling. In this paper,
we discuss two deficiencies in existing point-supervised methods: inefficient
utilization and poor quality of pseudo labels. Therefore, we present
Point2RBox-v3. At the core are two principles: 1) Progressive Label Assignment
(PLA). It dynamically estimates instance sizes in a coarse yet intelligent
manner at different stages of the training process, enabling the use of label
assignment methods. 2) Prior-Guided Dynamic Mask Loss (PGDM-Loss). It is an
enhancement of the Voronoi Watershed Loss from Point2RBox-v2, which overcomes
the shortcomings of Watershed in its poor performance in sparse scenes and
SAM's poor performance in dense scenes. To our knowledge, Point2RBox-v3 is the
first model to employ dynamic pseudo labels for label assignment, and it
creatively complements the advantages of SAM model with the watershed
algorithm, which achieves excellent performance in both sparse and dense
scenes. Our solution gives competitive performance, especially in scenarios
with large variations in object size or sparse object occurrences:
66.09%/56.86%/41.28%/46.40%/19.60%/45.96% on
DOTA-v1.0/DOTA-v1.5/DOTA-v2.0/DIOR/STAR/RSAR.

TL;DR: Flower is a solver for inverse problems that uses pre-trained flow models to produce consistent reconstructions through an iterative three-step process, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal hyperparameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an inverse problem solver that unifies perspectives from plug-and-play methods and generative inverse solvers while providing theoretical guarantees and practical performance.

Method: Iterative three-step procedure: (1) flow-consistent destination estimation using velocity network, (2) refinement via projection onto feasible set defined by forward operator, (3) time-progression step re-projecting along flow trajectory.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality across various inverse problems while using nearly identical hyperparameters.

Conclusion: Flower successfully approximates Bayesian posterior sampling, unifying theoretical perspectives from different approaches and demonstrating strong practical performance with minimal hyperparameter tuning.

Abstract: We introduce Flower, a solver for inverse problems. It leverages a
pre-trained flow model to produce reconstructions that are consistent with the
observed measurements. Flower operates through an iterative procedure over
three steps: (i) a flow-consistent destination estimation, where the velocity
network predicts a denoised target; (ii) a refinement step that projects the
estimated destination onto a feasible set defined by the forward operator; and
(iii) a time-progression step that re-projects the refined destination along
the flow trajectory. We provide a theoretical analysis that demonstrates how
Flower approximates Bayesian posterior sampling, thereby unifying perspectives
from plug-and-play methods and generative inverse solvers. On the practical
side, Flower achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality while using
nearly identical hyperparameters across various inverse problems.

*Alexander Becker,Julius Erbach,Dominik Narnhofer,Konrad Schindler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel continuous space-time video super-resolution method using 3D Video Fourier Field representation that enables flexible sampling, captures spatial detail and temporal dynamics, and provides aliasing-free reconstruction at arbitrary scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional video super-resolution methods decouple spatial and temporal components and rely on brittle explicit frame warping for motion compensation, which has limitations in handling complex motion and maintaining temporal consistency.

Method: Encode video as a continuous 3D Video Fourier Field (VFF) using Fourier-like sinusoidal basis coefficients predicted by a neural encoder with large spatio-temporal receptive field, conditioned on low-resolution input. Includes analytical Gaussian point spread function for aliasing-free reconstruction.

Result: Substantially improves both spatial and temporal super-resolution, sets new state-of-the-art across multiple benchmarks with sharper and more temporally consistent reconstructions across wide range of upscaling factors, while being computationally more efficient.

Conclusion: Joint modeling through continuous VFF representation offers superior performance in video super-resolution compared to decoupled approaches, providing flexible sampling and high-quality reconstruction without explicit motion compensation.

Abstract: We introduce a novel formulation for continuous space-time video
super-resolution. Instead of decoupling the representation of a video sequence
into separate spatial and temporal components and relying on brittle, explicit
frame warping for motion compensation, we encode video as a continuous,
spatio-temporally coherent 3D Video Fourier Field (VFF). That representation
offers three key advantages: (1) it enables cheap, flexible sampling at
arbitrary locations in space and time; (2) it is able to simultaneously capture
fine spatial detail and smooth temporal dynamics; and (3) it offers the
possibility to include an analytical, Gaussian point spread function in the
sampling to ensure aliasing-free reconstruction at arbitrary scale. The
coefficients of the proposed, Fourier-like sinusoidal basis are predicted with
a neural encoder with a large spatio-temporal receptive field, conditioned on
the low-resolution input video. Through extensive experiments, we show that our
joint modeling substantially improves both spatial and temporal
super-resolution and sets a new state of the art for multiple benchmarks:
across a wide range of upscaling factors, it delivers sharper and temporally
more consistent reconstructions than existing baselines, while being
computationally more efficient. Project page: https://v3vsr.github.io.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SQUARE is a two-stage training-free framework for zero-shot composed image retrieval that uses MLLMs to enhance query embeddings and perform efficient batch reranking, achieving strong performance without task-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training-free zero-shot CIR approaches are desirable but struggle to accurately capture user intent when combining reference images with textual modifications.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) SQAF stage enriches CLIP embeddings with MLLM-generated target captions for better intent capture, 2) EBR stage uses MLLM to perform joint visual-semantic reasoning on top candidates in a single pass.

Result: SQUARE delivers strong performance on four standard CIR benchmarks and maintains high performance even with lightweight pre-trained models.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates simplicity and effectiveness in zero-shot CIR, showing potential for practical applicability with its training-free approach.

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) aims to retrieve target images that preserve
the visual content of a reference image while incorporating user-specified
textual modifications. Training-free zero-shot CIR (ZS-CIR) approaches, which
require no task-specific training or labeled data, are highly desirable, yet
accurately capturing user intent remains challenging. In this paper, we present
SQUARE, a novel two-stage training-free framework that leverages Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) to enhance ZS-CIR. In the Semantic
Query-Augmented Fusion (SQAF) stage, we enrich the query embedding derived from
a vision-language model (VLM) such as CLIP with MLLM-generated captions of the
target image. These captions provide high-level semantic guidance, enabling the
query to better capture the user's intent and improve global retrieval quality.
In the Efficient Batch Reranking (EBR) stage, top-ranked candidates are
presented as an image grid with visual marks to the MLLM, which performs joint
visual-semantic reasoning across all candidates. Our reranking strategy
operates in a single pass and yields more accurate rankings. Experiments show
that SQUARE, with its simplicity and effectiveness, delivers strong performance
on four standard CIR benchmarks. Notably, it maintains high performance even
with lightweight pre-trained, demonstrating its potential applicability.

Result: \mname achieves state-of-the-art human correlation on benchmarks (GenAI-Bench, AURORA-Bench, ImagenHub, \benchname), outperforming VLM-as-judge models, and successfully selects high-quality data for training Step1X-Edit.

Conclusion: \mname effectively serves as a reward model to scale up high-quality training data for image editing and will be released to help the community build better datasets.

Abstract: Recently, we have witnessed great progress in image editing with natural
language instructions. Several closed-source models like GPT-Image-1, Seedream,
and Google-Nano-Banana have shown highly promising progress. However, the
open-source models are still lagging. The main bottleneck is the lack of a
reliable reward model to scale up high-quality synthetic training data. To
address this critical bottleneck, we built \mname, trained with our new
large-scale human preference dataset, meticulously annotated by trained experts
following a rigorous protocol containing over 200K preference pairs. \mname
demonstrates superior alignment with human preferences in instruction-guided
image editing tasks. Experiments show that \mname achieves state-of-the-art
human correlation on established benchmarks such as GenAI-Bench, AURORA-Bench,
ImagenHub, and our new \benchname, outperforming a wide range of VLM-as-judge
models. Furthermore, we use \mname to select a high-quality subset from the
existing noisy ShareGPT-4o-Image dataset. We train Step1X-Edit on the selected
subset, which shows significant improvement over training on the full set. This
demonstrates \mname's ability to serve as a reward model to scale up
high-quality training data for image editing. Furthermore, its strong alignment
suggests potential for advanced applications like reinforcement learning-based
post-training and test-time scaling of image editing models. \mname with its
training dataset will be released to help the community build more high-quality
image editing training datasets.

### [107] [TimeScope: Towards Task-Oriented Temporal Grounding In Long Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26360)
*Xiangrui Liu,Minghao Qin,Yan Shu,Zhengyang Liang,Yang Tian,Chen Jason Zhang,Bo Zhao,Zheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Task-oriented Temporal Grounding (ToTG) to localize time intervals in long videos based on task descriptions, presents ToTG Bench benchmark, and proposes TimeScope framework with progressive reasoning for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional approaches struggle with identifying key moments in long videos due to limited generalizability and difficulty handling long video content, necessitating a new approach for task-oriented temporal grounding.

Method: Proposes TimeScope framework using progressive reasoning: first identifies coarse-grained temporal scope in long videos, then refines through fine-grained moment partitioning. Also creates ToTG Pile dataset to enhance progressive temporal grounding.

Result: Extensive experiments show TimeScope consistently outperforms existing temporal-grounding methods and popular MLLMs across various settings.

Conclusion: TimeScope effectively addresses the challenging problem of task-oriented temporal grounding in long videos through its progressive reasoning approach.

Abstract: Identifying key moments in long videos is essential for downstream
understanding and reasoning tasks. In this paper, we introduce a new problem,
Taskoriented Temporal Grounding ToTG, which aims to localize time intervals
containing the necessary information based on a task's natural description.
Along with the definition, we also present ToTG Bench, a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating the performance on ToTG. ToTG is particularly
challenging for traditional approaches due to their limited generalizability
and difficulty in handling long videos. To address these challenges, we propose
TimeScope, a novel framework built upon progressive reasoning. TimeScope first
identifies a coarse-grained temporal scope in the long video that likely
contains the key moments, and then refines this scope through finegrained
moment partitioning. Additionally, we curate a highquality dataset, namely ToTG
Pile, to enhance TimeScope's ability to perform progressive temporal grounding
effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeScope consistently
outperforms both existing temporalgrounding methods and popular MLLMs across
various settings, highlighting its effectiveness in addressing this new
challenging problem.

### [108] [Go with Your Gut: Scaling Confidence for Autoregressive Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26376)
*Harold Haodong Chen,Xianfeng Wu,Wen-Jie Shu,Rongjin Guo,Disen Lan,Harry Yang,Ying-Cong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ScalingAR is the first test-time scaling framework for next-token prediction autoregressive image generation that uses token entropy to improve generation quality and efficiency without early decoding or external rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time scaling approaches for visual autoregressive models rely on frequent partial decoding and external reward models, which are unsuitable for next-token prediction based image generation due to incomplete intermediate results.

Method: ScalingAR uses token entropy as a novel signal and operates at two levels: Profile Level streams calibrated confidence states by fusing intrinsic and conditional signals, while Policy Level adaptively terminates low-confidence trajectories and dynamically schedules guidance for appropriate conditioning strength.

Result: ScalingAR improves base models by 12.5% on GenEval and 15.2% on TIIF-Bench, reduces visual token consumption by 62.0% while outperforming baselines, and enhances robustness by mitigating performance drops by 26.0% in challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: ScalingAR successfully bridges the gap in test-time scaling for next-token prediction autoregressive image generation, demonstrating significant improvements in quality, efficiency, and robustness without requiring early decoding or auxiliary rewards.

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) has demonstrated remarkable success in enhancing
large language models, yet its application to next-token prediction (NTP)
autoregressive (AR) image generation remains largely uncharted. Existing TTS
approaches for visual AR (VAR), which rely on frequent partial decoding and
external reward models, are ill-suited for NTP-based image generation due to
the inherent incompleteness of intermediate decoding results. To bridge this
gap, we introduce ScalingAR, the first TTS framework specifically designed for
NTP-based AR image generation that eliminates the need for early decoding or
auxiliary rewards. ScalingAR leverages token entropy as a novel signal in
visual token generation and operates at two complementary scaling levels: (i)
Profile Level, which streams a calibrated confidence state by fusing intrinsic
and conditional signals; and (ii) Policy Level, which utilizes this state to
adaptively terminate low-confidence trajectories and dynamically schedule
guidance for phase-appropriate conditioning strength. Experiments on both
general and compositional benchmarks show that ScalingAR (1) improves base
models by 12.5% on GenEval and 15.2% on TIIF-Bench, (2) efficiently reduces
visual token consumption by 62.0% while outperforming baselines, and (3)
successfully enhances robustness, mitigating performance drops by 26.0% in
challenging scenarios.

### [109] [PANDA: Towards Generalist Video Anomaly Detection via Agentic AI Engineer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26386)
*Zhiwei Yang,Chen Gao,Mike Zheng Shou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PANDA is an agentic AI engineer based on MLLMs that achieves generalist video anomaly detection without training data or human involvement, handling any scene and anomaly types through self-adaptive strategy planning, heuristic reasoning, tool-augmented reflection, and chain-of-memory mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video anomaly detection methods require domain-specific training data and manual adjustments for new scenarios, leading to high labor costs and limited generalization. The goal is to create a generalist system that automatically handles any scene and anomaly types without training or human involvement.

Method: PANDA uses four key capabilities: (1) self-adaptive scene-aware strategy planning with RAG mechanism for anomaly-specific knowledge retrieval, (2) goal-driven heuristic reasoning with latent anomaly-guided prompts, (3) tool-augmented self-reflection with progressive reflection mechanism, and (4) self-improving chain-of-memory for leveraging historical experiences.

Result: Extensive experiments show PANDA achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-scenario, open-set, and complex scenario settings without training and manual involvement, demonstrating generalizable and robust anomaly detection capability.

Conclusion: PANDA successfully addresses the limitations of traditional VAD methods by providing a training-free, human-free generalist solution that can handle diverse scenarios and anomaly types through its agentic AI engineering approach.

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a critical yet challenging task due to the
complex and diverse nature of real-world scenarios. Previous methods typically
rely on domain-specific training data and manual adjustments when applying to
new scenarios and unseen anomaly types, suffering from high labor costs and
limited generalization. Therefore, we aim to achieve generalist VAD, i.e.,
automatically handle any scene and any anomaly types without training data or
human involvement. In this work, we propose PANDA, an agentic AI engineer based
on MLLMs. Specifically, we achieve PANDA by comprehensively devising four key
capabilities: (1) self-adaptive scene-aware strategy planning, (2) goal-driven
heuristic reasoning, (3) tool-augmented self-reflection, and (4) self-improving
chain-of-memory. Concretely, we develop a self-adaptive scene-aware RAG
mechanism, enabling PANDA to retrieve anomaly-specific knowledge for anomaly
detection strategy planning. Next, we introduce a latent anomaly-guided
heuristic prompt strategy to enhance reasoning precision. Furthermore, PANDA
employs a progressive reflection mechanism alongside a suite of context-aware
tools to iteratively refine decision-making in complex scenarios. Finally, a
chain-of-memory mechanism enables PANDA to leverage historical experiences for
continual performance improvement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PANDA
achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-scenario, open-set, and complex
scenario settings without training and manual involvement, validating its
generalizable and robust anomaly detection capability. Code is released at

*Chenhui Zhu,Yilu Wu,Shuai Wang,Gangshan Wu,Limin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MotionRAG is a retrieval-augmented framework that enhances video generation realism by adapting motion priors from reference videos using Context-Aware Motion Adaptation, achieving improved motion quality across domains with minimal inference overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image-to-video generation struggles with realistic motion due to the complexity of modeling physical constraints, object interactions, and domain-specific dynamics that don't generalize well across scenarios.

Method: Proposes MotionRAG with three key innovations: (i) retrieval pipeline extracting motion features using video encoder and resamplers, (ii) in-context learning for motion adaptation via causal transformer, (iii) attention-based motion injection adapter that integrates motion features into pretrained video diffusion models.

Result: Extensive experiments show significant improvements across multiple domains and base models with negligible computational overhead during inference. The modular design enables zero-shot generalization to new domains by updating the retrieval database without retraining.

Conclusion: MotionRAG enhances video generation systems by enabling effective retrieval and transfer of motion priors, facilitating the synthesis of realistic motion dynamics through a modular and efficient framework.

Abstract: Image-to-video generation has made remarkable progress with the advancements
in diffusion models, yet generating videos with realistic motion remains highly
challenging. This difficulty arises from the complexity of accurately modeling
motion, which involves capturing physical constraints, object interactions, and
domain-specific dynamics that are not easily generalized across diverse
scenarios. To address this, we propose MotionRAG, a retrieval-augmented
framework that enhances motion realism by adapting motion priors from relevant
reference videos through Context-Aware Motion Adaptation (CAMA). The key
technical innovations include: (i) a retrieval-based pipeline extracting
high-level motion features using video encoder and specialized resamplers to
distill semantic motion representations; (ii) an in-context learning approach
for motion adaptation implemented through a causal transformer architecture;
(iii) an attention-based motion injection adapter that seamlessly integrates
transferred motion features into pretrained video diffusion models. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements
across multiple domains and various base models, all with negligible
computational overhead during inference. Furthermore, our modular design
enables zero-shot generalization to new domains by simply updating the
retrieval database without retraining any components. This research enhances
the core capability of video generation systems by enabling the effective
retrieval and transfer of motion priors, facilitating the synthesis of
realistic motion dynamics.

*Atakan Topaloglu,Ahmet Bilican,Cansu Korkmaz,A. Murat Tekalp*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes difficulty-aware evaluation for super-resolution models using high-frequency and rotation-invariant edge indices to better differentiate models that produce visually different results despite similar average scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current average score evaluation fails to reflect model performance on images of varying difficulty and doesn't capture artifacts on difficult images, making it hard to distinguish between models with similar average performance but different visual quality.

Method: Introduces two image-difficulty measures: high-frequency index and rotation-invariant edge index to identify test images where models show significant visual differences, and develops an evaluation method that reflects these visual differences in objective measures.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed image-difficulty measures and evaluation methodology in better differentiating between super-resolution models.

Conclusion: The proposed difficulty-aware evaluation framework provides more meaningful performance assessment for super-resolution models by accounting for image difficulty and visual quality differences that are missed by traditional average score metrics.

Abstract: Image super-resolution models are commonly evaluated by average scores (over
some benchmark test sets), which fail to reflect the performance of these
models on images of varying difficulty and that some models generate artifacts
on certain difficult images, which is not reflected by the average scores. We
propose difficulty-aware performance evaluation procedures to better
differentiate between SISR models that produce visually different results on
some images but yield close average performance scores over the entire test
set. In particular, we propose two image-difficulty measures, the
high-frequency index and rotation-invariant edge index, to predict those test
images, where a model would yield significantly better visual results over
another model, and an evaluation method where these visual differences are
reflected on objective measures. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed image-difficulty measures and evaluation
methodology.

*Pengze Xue,Shanwen Wang,Fei Zhou,Yan Cui,Xin Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRISM is a progressive three-stage framework for image deraining that combines multi-scale feature aggregation with hybrid attention and state-space modeling to remove rain streaks while preserving structural details and global consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current single-scale image deraining models struggle with fine-grained recovery and global consistency, limiting their effectiveness for critical vision tasks like autonomous driving.

Method: Progressive three-stage framework: 1) Coarse Extraction Network (CENet) with Hybrid Attention UNet for multi-scale feature aggregation, 2) Frequency Fusion Network (SFNet) with Hybrid Domain Mamba for joint spatial and wavelet domain modeling, 3) Refine Network (RNet) for fine-grained structure recovery using original-resolution subnetwork.

Result: The method achieves competitive results on multiple datasets against recent deraining methods, learning high-frequency rain characteristics while preserving structural details and maintaining global context.

Conclusion: PRISM effectively addresses the limitations of single-scale deraining models through progressive processing and hybrid domain modeling, leading to improved image quality for vision applications.

Abstract: Image deraining is an essential vision technique that removes rain streaks
and water droplets, enhancing clarity for critical vision tasks like autonomous
driving. However, current single-scale models struggle with fine-grained
recovery and global consistency. To address this challenge, we propose
Progressive Rain removal with Integrated State-space Modeling (PRISM), a
progressive three-stage framework: Coarse Extraction Network (CENet), Frequency
Fusion Network (SFNet), and Refine Network (RNet). Specifically, CENet and
SFNet utilize a novel Hybrid Attention UNet (HA-UNet) for multi-scale feature
aggregation by combining channel attention with windowed spatial transformers.
Moreover, we propose Hybrid Domain Mamba (HDMamba) for SFNet to jointly model
spatial semantics and wavelet domain characteristics. Finally, RNet recovers
the fine-grained structures via an original-resolution subnetwork. Our model
learns high-frequency rain characteristics while preserving structural details
and maintaining global context, leading to improved image quality. Our method
achieves competitive results on multiple datasets against recent deraining
methods.

*Donghoon Kim,Dongyoung Lee,Ik Joon Chang,Sung-Ho Bae*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QuaRTZ enables 4-bit quantization for diffusion models by combining 8-bit min-max quantization for outliers with leading-zero suppression to preserve fine texture details, achieving better performance than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models have high computational requirements that limit deployment. While 8-bit quantization works well, extending to 4 bits is challenging due to amplified rounding errors that destroy fine-grained textures in images.

Method: Proposes QuaRTZ (Quantization via Residual Truncation and Zero Suppression) - applies 8-bit min-max quantization for outlier handling and compresses to 4 bits via leading-zero suppression to retain least significant bits (LSBs) for texture preservation.

Result: Achieves FID of 6.98 on FLUX.1-schnell with 4-bit quantization, outperforming SVDQuant which requires auxiliary FP16 branches. Reduces rounding errors and improves quantization efficiency.

Conclusion: QuaRTZ successfully enables 4-bit quantization for diffusion models by balancing outlier preservation and LSB precision, demonstrating generalizability across diverse activation distributions.

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve high-quality image generation but face deployment
challenges due to their high computational requirements. Although 8-bit
outlier-aware post-training quantization (PTQ) matches full-precision
performance, extending PTQ to 4 bits remains challenging. Larger step sizes in
4-bit quantization amplify rounding errors in dense, low-magnitude activations,
leading to the loss of fine-grained textures. We hypothesize that not only
outliers but also small activations are critical for texture fidelity. To this
end, we propose Quantization via Residual Truncation and Zero Suppression
(QuaRTZ), a 4-bit PTQ scheme for diffusion models. QuaRTZ applies 8-bit min-max
quantization for outlier handling and compresses to 4 bits via leading-zero
suppression to retain LSBs, thereby preserving texture details. Our approach
reduces rounding errors and improves quantization efficiency by balancing
outlier preservation and LSB precision. Both theoretical derivations and
empirical evaluations demonstrate the generalizability of QuaRTZ across diverse
activation distributions. Notably, 4-bit QuaRTZ achieves an FID of 6.98 on
FLUX.1-schnell, outperforming SVDQuant that requires auxiliary FP16 branches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring every vehicle leaving production lines meets correct variant specifications and is free from visible defects is increasingly complex, requiring automated quality control solutions.

Method: Uses 11 synchronized cameras for 360° vehicle capture, specialized modules (YOLOv8 for part detection, EfficientNet for ICE/EV classification, Gemini-1.5 Flash for OCR, YOLOv8-Seg for segmentation), view-aware fusion layer, and VIN-conditioned rule engine for real-time comparison against expected manifests.

Result: Achieves 93% verification accuracy, 86% defect-detection recall, and sustains 3.3 vehicles/min processing speed, significantly outperforming single-view or no segmentation baselines.

Conclusion: This is the first publicly reported system that unifies multi-camera feature validation with defect detection in a deployable automotive industry setting, providing real-time interpretable quality reports.

Abstract: Ensuring that every vehicle leaving a modern production line is built to the
correct \emph{variant} specification and is free from visible defects is an
increasingly complex challenge. We present the \textbf{Automated Vehicle
Inspection (AVI)} platform, an end-to-end, \emph{multi-view} perception system
that couples deep-learning detectors with a semantic rule engine to deliver
\emph{variant-aware} quality control in real time. Eleven synchronized cameras
capture a full 360{\deg} sweep of each vehicle; task-specific views are then
routed to specialised modules: YOLOv8 for part detection, EfficientNet for
ICE/EV classification, Gemini-1.5 Flash for mascot OCR, and YOLOv8-Seg for
scratch-and-dent segmentation. A view-aware fusion layer standardises evidence,
while a VIN-conditioned rule engine compares detected features against the
expected manifest, producing an interpretable pass/fail report in \(\approx\!
300\,\text{ms}\). On a mixed data set of Original Equipment Manufacturer(OEM)
vehicle data sets of four distinct models plus public scratch/dent images, AVI
achieves \textbf{ 93 \%} verification accuracy, \textbf{86 \%} defect-detection
recall, and sustains \(\mathbf{3.3}\) vehicles/min, surpassing single-view or
no segmentation baselines by large margins. To our knowledge, this is the first
publicly reported system that unifies multi-camera feature validation with
defect detection in a deployable automotive setting in industry.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Stylos is a single-forward 3D Gaussian framework for 3D style transfer that works on unposed content from single images to multi-view collections, using reference style images without per-scene optimization or precomputed poses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve geometry-aware, view-consistent 3D stylization that generalizes to unseen categories, scenes, and styles without requiring per-scene optimization or precomputed poses.

Method: Uses a Transformer backbone with two pathways: geometry predictions with self-attention for geometric fidelity, and style injection via global cross-attention for visual consistency. Includes a voxel-based 3D style loss that aligns aggregated scene features to style statistics.

Result: Demonstrates high-quality zero-shot stylization across multiple datasets, showing effectiveness of global style-content coupling and the proposed 3D style loss.

Conclusion: Stylos provides scalable 3D style transfer from single view to large-scale multi-view settings while preserving geometry and ensuring view consistency.

Abstract: We present Stylos, a single-forward 3D Gaussian framework for 3D style
transfer that operates on unposed content, from a single image to a multi-view
collection, conditioned on a separate reference style image. Stylos synthesizes
a stylized 3D Gaussian scene without per-scene optimization or precomputed
poses, achieving geometry-aware, view-consistent stylization that generalizes
to unseen categories, scenes, and styles. At its core, Stylos adopts a
Transformer backbone with two pathways: geometry predictions retain
self-attention to preserve geometric fidelity, while style is injected via
global cross-attention to enforce visual consistency across views. With the
addition of a voxel-based 3D style loss that aligns aggregated scene features
to style statistics, Stylos enforces view-consistent stylization while
preserving geometry. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that
Stylos delivers high-quality zero-shot stylization, highlighting the
effectiveness of global style-content coupling, the proposed 3D style loss, and
the scalability of our framework from single view to large-scale multi-view
settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ASGRA is a novel framework for indoor scene classification and sensitive content analysis using scene graphs and graph attention networks, achieving better performance than image-based methods while providing explainability and privacy preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Indoor scene classification is challenging due to complex object relationships and spatial layouts, with important applications in robotics and sensitive content analysis like CSAI classification.

Method: Proposes ASGRA framework that converts images into Scene Graphs and uses Graph Attention Networks for inference, directly modeling interactions between scene components.

Result: Achieved 81.27% balanced accuracy on Places8 (surpassing image-based methods) and 74.27% balanced accuracy in real-world CSAI evaluation with law enforcement.

Conclusion: Structured scene representations using scene graphs are a robust paradigm for indoor scene classification and CSAI classification, offering explainability and privacy benefits.

Abstract: Indoor scene classification is a critical task in computer vision, with
wide-ranging applications that go from robotics to sensitive content analysis,
such as child sexual abuse imagery (CSAI) classification. The problem is
particularly challenging due to the intricate relationships between objects and
complex spatial layouts. In this work, we propose the Attention over Scene
Graphs for Sensitive Content Analysis (ASGRA), a novel framework that operates
on structured graph representations instead of raw pixels. By first converting
images into Scene Graphs and then employing a Graph Attention Network for
inference, ASGRA directly models the interactions between a scene's components.
This approach offers two key benefits: (i) inherent explainability via object
and relationship identification, and (ii) privacy preservation, enabling model
training without direct access to sensitive images. On Places8, we achieve
81.27% balanced accuracy, surpassing image-based methods. Real-world CSAI
evaluation with law enforcement yields 74.27% balanced accuracy. Our results
establish structured scene representations as a robust paradigm for indoor
scene classification and CSAI classification. Code is publicly available at

TL;DR: A lightweight CBAM-CNN model with 2.13M parameters achieves 95.58% accuracy for betel leaf disease classification using attention mechanisms and explainable AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Betel leaf diseases threaten crop security and are difficult to detect early. AI can help increase output by predicting diseases in this economically important crop.

Method: Proposed a lightweight CBAM-CNN model with Convolutional Block Attention Module to focus on important spatial and channel features. Used enriched dataset of 10,185 images across three classes (Healthy Leaf, Leaf Rot, Leaf Spot) with balanced distribution.

Result: Achieved 97% precision, 94% recall, 95% F1 score, and 95.58% accuracy on test set, outperforming traditional pre-trained CNN models. Used Grad-CAM for explainable AI visualization.

Conclusion: The lightweight CBAM-CNN model effectively classifies betel leaf diseases with high accuracy and interpretability, demonstrating practical value for agricultural applications.

Abstract: Betel leaf is an important crop because of its economic advantages and
widespread use. Its betel vines are susceptible to a number of illnesses that
are commonly referred to as betel leaf disease. Plant diseases are the largest
threat to the food supply's security, and they are challenging to identify in
time to stop possible financial damage. Interestingly, artificial intelligence
can leave a big mark on the betel leaf industry since it helps with output
growth by forecasting sickness. This paper presents a lightweight CBAM-CNN
model with just 2.13 million parameters (8.13 MB), incorporating CBAM
(Convolutional Block Attention Module) to improve feature emphasis without
depending on heavy pre-trained networks. The model's capacity to discern minute
variations among leaf disease classes is improved by the integrated attention
mechanism, which allows it to adaptively focus on significant spatial and
channel-wise information. In order to ensure class balance and diversity for
efficient model training and validation, this work makes use of an enriched
dataset of 10,185 images divided into three categories: Healthy Leaf, Leaf Rot,
and Leaf Spot. The proposed model achieved a precision of 97%, recall of 94%,
and F1 score of 95%, and 95.58% accuracy on the test set demonstrating strong
and balanced classification performance outperforming traditional pre trained
CNN models. The model's focus regions were visualized and interpreted using
Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping), an explainable AI
technique.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoGuide reconstructs floorplans from movement trajectories using diffusion-based posterior sampling with a contrastive embedding space to handle the non-differentiable forward operator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct inversion from movement trajectories to floorplans is ill-posed since many layouts can explain the same movements. The path-planning process is non-invertible and non-differentiable, causing optimization instability.

Method: Uses diffusion-based posterior sampling with a reformulated likelihood score in a contrastive embedding space. Trains embeddings to bring compatible floorplan-trajectory pairs close and push mismatched pairs apart.

Result: CoGuide produces more consistent floorplans from trajectories and is more robust than differentiable-planner baselines and guided-diffusion methods across extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The surrogate likelihood score in the embedding space effectively approximates the true likelihood, enabling successful steering of the denoising process toward the posterior distribution.

Abstract: We consider the inverse problem of reconstructing the spatial layout of a
place, a home floorplan for example, from a user`s movements inside that
layout. Direct inversion is ill-posed since many floorplans can explain the
same movement trajectories. We adopt a diffusion-based posterior sampler to
generate layouts consistent with the measurements. While active research is in
progress on generative inverse solvers, we find that the forward operator in
our problem poses new challenges. The path-planning process inside a floorplan
is a non-invertible, non-differentiable function, and causes instability while
optimizing using the likelihood score. We break-away from existing approaches
and reformulate the likelihood score in a smoother embedding space. The
embedding space is trained with a contrastive loss which brings compatible
floorplans and trajectories close to each other, while pushing mismatched pairs
far apart. We show that a surrogate form of the likelihood score in this
embedding space is a valid approximation of the true likelihood score, making
it possible to steer the denoising process towards the posterior. Across
extensive experiments, our model CoGuide produces more consistent floorplans
from trajectories, and is more robust than differentiable-planner baselines and
guided-diffusion methods.

TL;DR: A systematic post-training pipeline enhances small language models for edge deployment through curriculum-based supervised fine-tuning and offline on-policy knowledge distillation, achieving state-of-the-art performance among billion-parameter models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models are too computationally expensive for resource-constrained edge environments, creating a need for high-performance small models that can operate efficiently at the edge.

Method: A post-training pipeline consisting of curriculum-based supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and offline on-policy knowledge distillation.

Result: The resulting instruction-tuned model achieves state-of-the-art performance among billion-parameter models with strong generalization under strict hardware constraints while maintaining competitive accuracy across various tasks.

Conclusion: This work provides a practical and efficient solution for developing high-performance language models on Ascend edge devices.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
advanced the capabilities of artificial intelligence across various domains.
However, their massive scale and high computational costs render them
unsuitable for direct deployment in resource-constrained edge environments.
This creates a critical need for high-performance small models that can operate
efficiently at the edge. Yet, after pre-training alone, these smaller models
often fail to meet the performance requirements of complex tasks. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a systematic post-training pipeline that efficiently
enhances small model accuracy. Our post training pipeline consists of
curriculum-based supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and offline on-policy knowledge
distillation. The resulting instruction-tuned model achieves state-of-the-art
performance among billion-parameter models, demonstrating strong generalization
under strict hardware constraints while maintaining competitive accuracy across

*Jijun Xiang,Longliang Liu,Xuan Zhu,Xianqi Wang,Min Lin,Xin Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DEPTHOR++ is a novel depth completion framework that enhances robustness to noisy direct Time-of-Flight (dToF) inputs through realistic simulation, anomaly detection, and RGB-guided completion, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing depth enhancement methods assume ideal dToF inputs and perfect alignment, overlooking real-world calibration errors and anomalies, which limits their practical applicability in high-precision tasks like 3D reconstruction and SLAM.

Method: Proposes DEPTHOR++ framework with three key components: 1) Realistic simulation method using synthetic datasets for robust training, 2) Learnable-parameter-free anomaly detection to remove erroneous dToF measurements, 3) Depth completion network integrating RGB images and monocular depth priors for challenging regions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance: 22% RMSE and 11% Rel improvement on ZJU-L5 dataset, 37% improvement in mirror regions on Mirror3D-NYU dataset, and 22% average gain over RealSense L515 measurements on Hammer dataset, enabling low-cost sensors to outperform higher-end devices.

Conclusion: The proposed DEPTHOR++ framework effectively addresses real-world dToF noise challenges through systematic noise analysis and robust design, demonstrating significant performance improvements and generalizability across diverse real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Depth enhancement, which converts raw dToF signals into dense depth maps
using RGB guidance, is crucial for improving depth perception in high-precision
tasks such as 3D reconstruction and SLAM. However, existing methods often
assume ideal dToF inputs and perfect dToF-RGB alignment, overlooking
calibration errors and anomalies, thus limiting real-world applicability. This
work systematically analyzes the noise characteristics of real-world
lightweight dToF sensors and proposes a practical and novel depth completion
framework, DEPTHOR++, which enhances robustness to noisy dToF inputs from three
key aspects. First, we introduce a simulation method based on synthetic
datasets to generate realistic training samples for robust model training.
Second, we propose a learnable-parameter-free anomaly detection mechanism to
identify and remove erroneous dToF measurements, preventing misleading
propagation during completion. Third, we design a depth completion network
tailored to noisy dToF inputs, which integrates RGB images and pre-trained
monocular depth estimation priors to improve depth recovery in challenging
regions. On the ZJU-L5 dataset and real-world samples, our training strategy
significantly boosts existing depth completion models, with our model achieving
state-of-the-art performance, improving RMSE and Rel by 22% and 11% on average.
On the Mirror3D-NYU dataset, by incorporating the anomaly detection method, our
model improves upon the previous SOTA by 37% in mirror regions. On the Hammer
dataset, using simulated low-cost dToF data from RealSense L515, our method
surpasses the L515 measurements with an average gain of 22%, demonstrating its
potential to enable low-cost sensors to outperform higher-end devices.
Qualitative results across diverse real-world datasets further validate the
effectiveness and generalizability of our approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Stable Cinemetrics (SCINE) is a structured evaluation framework for professional video generation that introduces four hierarchical taxonomies (Setup, Event, Lighting, Camera) with 76 fine-grained controls, enabling systematic assessment of video models through automated pipelines and expert human studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation models and benchmarks fail to capture the complexity and requirements of professional video generation, lacking formal evaluation frameworks grounded in filmmaking practices.

Method: Developed four disentangled hierarchical taxonomies (Setup, Event, Lighting, Camera) with 76 control nodes, created a benchmark with professional prompts, built automated pipeline for prompt categorization, conducted large-scale human study with 80+ film professionals across 10+ models and 20K videos, and trained an automatic evaluator aligned with expert annotations.

Result: Even the strongest current models show significant gaps, particularly in Events and Camera-related controls. The trained automatic evaluator outperforms existing zero-shot baselines and enables scalable evaluation.

Conclusion: SCINE is the first approach to situate professional video generation within video generative models, providing structured evaluation pipelines and detailed analyses to guide future research in cinematic controls.

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have enabled high-fidelity video
synthesis from user provided prompts. However, existing models and benchmarks
fail to capture the complexity and requirements of professional video
generation. Towards that goal, we introduce Stable Cinemetrics, a structured
evaluation framework that formalizes filmmaking controls into four
disentangled, hierarchical taxonomies: Setup, Event, Lighting, and Camera.
Together, these taxonomies define 76 fine-grained control nodes grounded in
industry practices. Using these taxonomies, we construct a benchmark of prompts
aligned with professional use cases and develop an automated pipeline for
prompt categorization and question generation, enabling independent evaluation
of each control dimension. We conduct a large-scale human study spanning 10+
models and 20K videos, annotated by a pool of 80+ film professionals. Our
analysis, both coarse and fine-grained reveal that even the strongest current
models exhibit significant gaps, particularly in Events and Camera-related
controls. To enable scalable evaluation, we train an automatic evaluator, a
vision-language model aligned with expert annotations that outperforms existing
zero-shot baselines. SCINE is the first approach to situate professional video
generation within the landscape of video generative models, introducing
taxonomies centered around cinematic controls and supporting them with
structured evaluation pipelines and detailed analyses to guide future research.

*Gary B Huang,William M Katz,Stuart Berg,Louis Scheffer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Machine learning approach uses existing manual annotation data to automate EM connectome proofreading, reducing costs by 80% while maintaining 90% of workflow value and automatically merging 200k fragments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual proofreading is the bottleneck in scaling electron microscopy connectomics and comparative connectomics, requiring significant human effort and cost.

Method: Use available ground-truth data from manual annotation to train machine learning models that automate proofreading workflows and merge segmentation fragments.

Result: Achieved 80% cost reduction while maintaining 90% of guided proofreading value; automatically merged 200,000 fragments (equivalent to 4 proofreader years) and increased connectivity completion by 1.3%.

Conclusion: Machine learning can significantly reduce the manual annotation burden in EM connectomics while maintaining reconstruction quality, enabling scaling and comparative studies.

Abstract: Producing connectomes from electron microscopy (EM) images has historically
required a great deal of human proofreading effort. This manual annotation cost
is the current bottleneck in scaling EM connectomics, for example, in making
larger connectome reconstructions feasible, or in enabling comparative
connectomics where multiple related reconstructions are produced. In this work,
we propose using the available ground-truth data generated by this manual
annotation effort to learn a machine learning model to automate or optimize
parts of the required proofreading workflows. We validate our approach on a
recent complete reconstruction of the \emph{Drosophila} male central nervous
system. We first show our method would allow for obtaining 90\% of the value of
a guided proofreading workflow while reducing required cost by 80\%. We then
demonstrate a second application for automatically merging many segmentation
fragments to proofread neurons. Our system is able to automatically attach 200
thousand fragments, equivalent to four proofreader years of manual work, and
increasing the connectivity completion rate of the connectome by 1.3\% points.

### [124] [DiffCamera: Arbitrary Refocusing on Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26599)
*Yiyang Wang,Xi Chen,Xiaogang Xu,Yu Liu,Hengshuang Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffCamera enables flexible refocusing of images by allowing users to specify arbitrary focus points and blur levels, using a diffusion transformer framework trained on simulated data with a novel stacking constraint.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Depth-of-field effects are fixed after image creation, making it problematic when the applied blur is undesirable (e.g., subject out of focus). There's a need for flexible refocusing capabilities in photography.

Method: Uses a diffusion transformer framework trained on simulated image pairs with varying focus planes and bokeh levels. Introduces a stacking constraint based on photographic principles that different focus planes can be linearly blended into multi-focus images.

Result: Extensive experiments show DiffCamera supports stable refocusing across various scenes, providing unprecedented control over DoF adjustments for photography and generative AI applications.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully enables flexible image refocusing with precise DoF manipulation, overcoming data acquisition challenges through simulation and physical constraints.

Abstract: The depth-of-field (DoF) effect, which introduces aesthetically pleasing
blur, enhances photographic quality but is fixed and difficult to modify once
the image has been created. This becomes problematic when the applied blur is
undesirable~(e.g., the subject is out of focus). To address this, we propose
DiffCamera, a model that enables flexible refocusing of a created image
conditioned on an arbitrary new focus point and a blur level. Specifically, we
design a diffusion transformer framework for refocusing learning. However, the
training requires pairs of data with different focus planes and bokeh levels in
the same scene, which are hard to acquire. To overcome this limitation, we
develop a simulation-based pipeline to generate large-scale image pairs with
varying focus planes and bokeh levels. With the simulated data, we find that
training with only a vanilla diffusion objective often leads to incorrect DoF
behaviors due to the complexity of the task. This requires a stronger
constraint during training. Inspired by the photographic principle that photos
of different focus planes can be linearly blended into a multi-focus image, we
propose a stacking constraint during training to enforce precise DoF
manipulation. This constraint enhances model training by imposing physically
grounded refocusing behavior that the focusing results should be faithfully
aligned with the scene structure and the camera conditions so that they can be
combined into the correct multi-focus image. We also construct a benchmark to
evaluate the effectiveness of our refocusing model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that DiffCamera supports stable refocusing across a wide range of
scenes, providing unprecedented control over DoF adjustments for photography
and generative AI applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal audio generation models lack precise user control for professional Foley workflows, often generating unnecessary background sounds or focusing on wrong objects without object-level prioritization.

Method: SAGANet leverages visual segmentation masks along with video and textual cues for controllable audio generation, providing fine-grained and visually localized control.

Result: The method demonstrates substantial improvements over current state-of-the-art methods and sets a new standard for controllable, high-fidelity Foley synthesis.

Conclusion: SAGANet enables controllable audio generation with object-level precision and introduces Segmented Music Solos benchmark dataset to advance segmentation-aware Foley research.

Abstract: Existing multimodal audio generation models often lack precise user control,
which limits their applicability in professional Foley workflows. In
particular, these models focus on the entire video and do not provide precise
methods for prioritizing a specific object within a scene, generating
unnecessary background sounds, or focusing on the wrong objects. To address
this gap, we introduce the novel task of video object segmentation-aware audio
generation, which explicitly conditions sound synthesis on object-level
segmentation maps. We present SAGANet, a new multimodal generative model that
enables controllable audio generation by leveraging visual segmentation masks
along with video and textual cues. Our model provides users with fine-grained
and visually localized control over audio generation. To support this task and
further research on segmentation-aware Foley, we propose Segmented Music Solos,
a benchmark dataset of musical instrument performance videos with segmentation
information. Our method demonstrates substantial improvements over current
state-of-the-art methods and sets a new standard for controllable,
high-fidelity Foley synthesis. Code, samples, and Segmented Music Solos are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hy-Facial is a hybrid framework combining deep learning (VGG19) and traditional features (SIFT, ORB) with UMAP dimensionality reduction, achieving 83.3% accuracy in facial expression recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Facial expression classification is challenging due to high dimensionality and complexity of facial image data, requiring robust feature extraction and dimensionality reduction methods.

Method: Hybrid approach fusing VGG19 deep features with SIFT and ORB handcrafted features, followed by K-means clustering and UMAP dimensionality reduction for feature optimization.

Result: Achieved 83.3% classification accuracy on facial expression recognition dataset, with UMAP identified as the most effective dimensionality reduction technique.

Conclusion: Dimensionality reduction is crucial not just for preprocessing but as an essential component for improving feature quality and overall classification performance in facial expression recognition.

Abstract: Facial expression classification remains a challenging task due to the high
dimensionality and inherent complexity of facial image data. This paper
presents Hy-Facial, a hybrid feature extraction framework that integrates both
deep learning and traditional image processing techniques, complemented by a
systematic investigation of dimensionality reduction strategies. The proposed
method fuses deep features extracted from the Visual Geometry Group 19-layer
network (VGG19) with handcrafted local descriptors and the scale-invariant
feature transform (SIFT) and Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) algorithms,
to obtain rich and diverse image representations. To mitigate feature
redundancy and reduce computational complexity, we conduct a comprehensive
evaluation of dimensionality reduction techniques and feature extraction. Among
these, UMAP is identified as the most effective, preserving both local and
global structures of the high-dimensional feature space. The Hy-Facial pipeline
integrated VGG19, SIFT, and ORB for feature extraction, followed by K-means
clustering and UMAP for dimensionality reduction, resulting in a classification
accuracy of 83. 3\% in the facial expression recognition (FER) dataset. These
findings underscore the pivotal role of dimensionality reduction not only as a
pre-processing step but as an essential component in improving feature quality
and overall classification performance.

*Haodong Li,Wangguangdong Zheng,Jing He,Yuhao Liu,Xin Lin,Xin Yang,Ying-Cong Chen,Chunchao Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DA² is a zero-shot generalizable panoramic depth estimator that addresses data scarcity and spherical distortion challenges through data curation and SphereViT architecture, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 38% improvement over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Panoramic depth estimation faces challenges due to limited panoramic data (leading to poor zero-shot generalization) and spherical distortions that cause suboptimal efficiency in existing methods that use perspective splitting approaches.

Method: Proposed DA² with two key components: 1) Data curation engine generating ~543K panoramic RGB-depth pairs from perspective data (total ~607K), and 2) SphereViT architecture that explicitly uses spherical coordinates to enforce geometric consistency in panoramic features.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance with 38% average improvement on AbsRel metric over strongest zero-shot baseline. Surprisingly outperformed prior in-domain methods and showed higher efficiency than fusion-based approaches as an end-to-end solution.

Conclusion: DA² provides an accurate, zero-shot generalizable, and fully end-to-end panoramic depth estimation solution that effectively addresses data scarcity and spherical distortion challenges through data scaling and spherical geometric modeling.

Abstract: Panorama has a full FoV (360$^\circ\times$180$^\circ$), offering a more
complete visual description than perspective images. Thanks to this
characteristic, panoramic depth estimation is gaining increasing traction in 3D
vision. However, due to the scarcity of panoramic data, previous methods are
often restricted to in-domain settings, leading to poor zero-shot
generalization. Furthermore, due to the spherical distortions inherent in
panoramas, many approaches rely on perspective splitting (e.g., cubemaps),
which leads to suboptimal efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose
$\textbf{DA}$$^{\textbf{2}}$: $\textbf{D}$epth $\textbf{A}$nything in
$\textbf{A}$ny $\textbf{D}$irection, an accurate, zero-shot generalizable, and
fully end-to-end panoramic depth estimator. Specifically, for scaling up
panoramic data, we introduce a data curation engine for generating high-quality
panoramic depth data from perspective, and create $\sim$543K panoramic
RGB-depth pairs, bringing the total to $\sim$607K. To further mitigate the
spherical distortions, we present SphereViT, which explicitly leverages
spherical coordinates to enforce the spherical geometric consistency in
panoramic image features, yielding improved performance. A comprehensive
benchmark on multiple datasets clearly demonstrates DA$^{2}$'s SoTA
performance, with an average 38% improvement on AbsRel over the strongest
zero-shot baseline. Surprisingly, DA$^{2}$ even outperforms prior in-domain
methods, highlighting its superior zero-shot generalization. Moreover, as an
end-to-end solution, DA$^{2}$ exhibits much higher efficiency over fusion-based
approaches. Both the code and the curated panoramic data will be released.

*Xiyi Chen,Shaofei Wang,Marko Mihajlovic,Taewon Kang,Sergey Prokudin,Ming Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HART is a unified framework for sparse-view human reconstruction that outputs watertight clothed meshes, aligned SMPL-X body meshes, and Gaussian-splat representations from a small set of uncalibrated RGB images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods either optimize parametric templates (overlooking loose garments and human-object interactions) or train implicit functions under simplified camera assumptions, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: HART predicts per-pixel 3D point maps, normals, and body correspondences, uses occlusion-aware Poisson reconstruction for complete geometry, aligns with SMPL-X body model, and initializes Gaussian splats for rendering.

Result: State-of-the-art performance: 18-23% Chamfer Distance improvement for clothed-mesh reconstruction, 6-27% PA-V2V drop for SMPL-X estimation, 15-27% LPIPS decrease for novel-view synthesis across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: Feed-forward transformers can serve as scalable models for robust human reconstruction in real-world settings, achieving strong results despite being trained on only 2.3K synthetic scans.

Abstract: We introduce HART, a unified framework for sparse-view human reconstruction.
Given a small set of uncalibrated RGB images of a person as input, it outputs a
watertight clothed mesh, the aligned SMPL-X body mesh, and a Gaussian-splat
representation for photorealistic novel-view rendering. Prior methods for
clothed human reconstruction either optimize parametric templates, which
overlook loose garments and human-object interactions, or train implicit
functions under simplified camera assumptions, limiting applicability in real
scenes. In contrast, HART predicts per-pixel 3D point maps, normals, and body
correspondences, and employs an occlusion-aware Poisson reconstruction to
recover complete geometry, even in self-occluded regions. These predictions
also align with a parametric SMPL-X body model, ensuring that reconstructed
geometry remains consistent with human structure while capturing loose clothing
and interactions. These human-aligned meshes initialize Gaussian splats to
further enable sparse-view rendering. While trained on only 2.3K synthetic
scans, HART achieves state-of-the-art results: Chamfer Distance improves by
18-23 percent for clothed-mesh reconstruction, PA-V2V drops by 6-27 percent for
SMPL-X estimation, LPIPS decreases by 15-27 percent for novel-view synthesis on
a wide range of datasets. These results suggest that feed-forward transformers
can serve as a scalable model for robust human reconstruction in real-world
settings. Code and models will be released.

*Yuqing Wang,Zhaiyu Chen,Xiao Xiang Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the first SIM(3)-equivariant shape completion network that maintains robustness to pose and scale variations, outperforming existing methods on benchmarks through canonicalized feature processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D shape completion methods rely on pre-aligned scans, which leak pose and scale cues, causing performance collapse when alignment is absent in real data. Robust generalization requires architectural equivariance to the similarity group SIM(3).

Method: Developed a SIM(3)-equivariant shape completion network with modular layers that successively canonicalize features, reason over similarity-invariant geometry, and restore the original frame.

Result: Outperforms both equivariant and augmentation baselines on PCN benchmark under de-biased evaluation. Sets new cross-domain records on real driving (KITTI) and indoor scans (OmniObject3D), lowering minimal matching distance by 17% and Chamfer distance by 14%.

Conclusion: Full SIM(3) equivariance is an effective route to truly generalizable shape completion, with the model performing better even under stricter protocols than competitors under biased settings.

Abstract: 3D shape completion methods typically assume scans are pre-aligned to a
canonical frame. This leaks pose and scale cues that networks may exploit to
memorize absolute positions rather than inferring intrinsic geometry. When such
alignment is absent in real data, performance collapses. We argue that robust
generalization demands architectural equivariance to the similarity group,
SIM(3), so the model remains agnostic to pose and scale. Following this
principle, we introduce the first SIM(3)-equivariant shape completion network,
whose modular layers successively canonicalize features, reason over
similarity-invariant geometry, and restore the original frame. Under a
de-biased evaluation protocol that removes the hidden cues, our model
outperforms both equivariant and augmentation baselines on the PCN benchmark.
It also sets new cross-domain records on real driving and indoor scans,
lowering minimal matching distance on KITTI by 17% and Chamfer distance $\ell1$
on OmniObject3D by 14%. Perhaps surprisingly, ours under the stricter protocol
still outperforms competitors under their biased settings. These results
establish full SIM(3) equivariance as an effective route to truly generalizable
shape completion. Project page: https://sime-completion.github.io.

*Anusha Krishnan,Shaohui Liu,Paul-Edouard Sarlin,Oscar Gentilhomme,David Caruso,Maurizio Monge,Richard Newcombe,Jakob Engel,Marc Pollefeys*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new dataset and benchmark for visual-inertial SLAM with egocentric, multi-modal data, addressing challenges in wearable devices with extreme trajectories and accurate ground truth poses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SLAM benchmarks don't reflect real-world challenges of wearable devices, such as diverse motions, dynamic content, and long sessions with varying sensor calibration. There's a need for accurate ground truth poses at city scale.

Method: Recorded hours of trajectories through a city center using glasses-like devices with various sensors. Used surveying tools to obtain control points as indirect pose annotations that are metric and centimeter-accurate at city scale.

Result: State-of-the-art academic SLAM systems are not robust to the challenges presented by extreme trajectories (walking at night, vehicle travel). Identified specific components responsible for this lack of robustness.

Conclusion: The dataset enables evaluation of SLAM systems under realistic wearable device conditions and provides tracks with varying difficulty levels for in-depth analysis of less mature approaches.

Abstract: Precise 6-DoF simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) from onboard
sensors is critical for wearable devices capturing egocentric data, which
exhibits specific challenges, such as a wider diversity of motions and
viewpoints, prevalent dynamic visual content, or long sessions affected by
time-varying sensor calibration. While recent progress on SLAM has been swift,
academic research is still driven by benchmarks that do not reflect these
challenges or do not offer sufficiently accurate ground truth poses. In this
paper, we introduce a new dataset and benchmark for visual-inertial SLAM with
egocentric, multi-modal data. We record hours and kilometers of trajectories
through a city center with glasses-like devices equipped with various sensors.
We leverage surveying tools to obtain control points as indirect pose
annotations that are metric, centimeter-accurate, and available at city scale.
This makes it possible to evaluate extreme trajectories that involve walking at
night or traveling in a vehicle. We show that state-of-the-art systems
developed by academia are not robust to these challenges and we identify
components that are responsible for this. In addition, we design tracks with
different levels of difficulty to ease in-depth analysis and evaluation of less
mature approaches. The dataset and benchmark are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Query-Kontext is a novel approach that bridges vision-language models and diffusion models using multimodal context tokens, separating generative reasoning from high-fidelity synthesis to improve text-to-image generation and editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unified multimodal models entangle multimodal generative reasoning (instruction understanding, grounding, image referring) with high-fidelity synthesis, limiting their effectiveness. The authors aim to decouple these capabilities.

Method: Proposes Query-Kontext with multimodal context tokens composed of semantic cues and coarse image conditions. Uses three-stage training: 1) Connect VLM to lightweight diffusion head, 2) Scale to pre-trained diffusion model, 3) Add low-level image encoder and instruction tuning.

Result: The approach matches strong unified baselines and outperforms task-specific state-of-the-art methods in several cases across image generation, instruction-driven editing, customized generation, and multi-subject composition.

Conclusion: Query-Kontext successfully decouples multimodal generative reasoning from visual synthesis, enabling more effective unified multimodal models that leverage the strengths of both VLMs and diffusion models.

Abstract: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
text-to-image generation (T2I) and editing (TI2I), whether instantiated as
assembled unified frameworks which couple powerful vision-language model (VLM)
with diffusion-based generator, or as naive Unified Multimodal Models with an
early fusion of understanding and generation modalities. We contend that in
current unified frameworks, the crucial capability of multimodal generative
reasoning which encompasses instruction understanding, grounding, and image
referring for identity preservation and faithful reconstruction, is
intrinsically entangled with high-fidelity synthesis. In this work, we
introduce Query-Kontext, a novel approach that bridges the VLM and diffusion
model via a multimodal ``kontext'' composed of semantic cues and coarse-grained
image conditions encoded from multimodal inputs. This design delegates the
complex ability of multimodal generative reasoning to powerful VLM while
reserving diffusion model's role for high-quality visual synthesis. To achieve
this, we propose a three-stage progressive training strategy. First, we connect
the VLM to a lightweight diffusion head via multimodal kontext tokens to
unleash the VLM's generative reasoning ability. Second, we scale this head to a
large, pre-trained diffusion model to enhance visual detail and realism.
Finally, we introduce a low-level image encoder to improve image fidelity and
perform instruction tuning on downstream tasks. Furthermore, we build a
comprehensive data pipeline integrating real, synthetic, and open-source
datasets, covering diverse multimodal reference-to-image scenarios, including
image generation, instruction-driven editing, customized generation, and
multi-subject composition. Experiments show that our approach matches strong
unified baselines and even outperforms task-specific state-of-the-art methods
in several cases.

*Jessica Bader,Mateusz Pach,Maria A. Bravo,Serge Belongie,Zeynep Akata*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Stitch is a training-free method that enhances spatial relationship accuracy in text-to-image generation by using automatically-generated bounding boxes to isolate and stitch objects together during generation, achieving state-of-the-art results on position-based tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing T2I models struggle with accurately capturing spatial relationships like 'above' or 'to the right of', and previous position control methods are incompatible with modern architectures like Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (MMDiT).

Method: Stitch automatically generates bounding boxes, isolates individual objects within them using targeted attention heads mid-generation, and seamlessly stitches them together without requiring full image completion or additional training.

Result: Stitch consistently improves base models, enhancing FLUX by 218% on GenEval's Position task and 206% on PosEval benchmark. It achieves 54% improvement over previous models with Qwen-Image on PosEval, setting new state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: Stitch successfully integrates position control into leading T2I models training-free, demonstrating that targeted attention manipulation can effectively capture spatial relationships while maintaining visual quality.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models have advanced rapidly in recent years,
but accurately capturing spatial relationships like "above" or "to the right
of" poses a persistent challenge. Earlier methods improved spatial relationship
following with external position control. However, as architectures evolved to
enhance image quality, these techniques became incompatible with modern models.
We propose Stitch, a training-free method for incorporating external position
control into Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (MMDiT) via
automatically-generated bounding boxes. Stitch produces images that are both
spatially accurate and visually appealing by generating individual objects
within designated bounding boxes and seamlessly stitching them together. We
find that targeted attention heads capture the information necessary to isolate
and cut out individual objects mid-generation, without needing to fully
complete the image. We evaluate Stitch on PosEval, our benchmark for
position-based T2I generation. Featuring five new tasks that extend the concept
of Position beyond the basic GenEval task, PosEval demonstrates that even top
models still have significant room for improvement in position-based
generation. Tested on Qwen-Image, FLUX, and SD3.5, Stitch consistently enhances
base models, even improving FLUX by 218% on GenEval's Position task and by 206%
on PosEval. Stitch achieves state-of-the-art results with Qwen-Image on
PosEval, improving over previous models by 54%, all accomplished while
integrating position control into leading models training-free. Code is

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recurrent Neural Networks for 3D reconstruction suffer from performance degradation beyond training context length due to limited length generalization.

Method: Framed 3D reconstruction as test-time training, using alignment confidence between memory state and observations to derive closed-form learning rates for memory updates, balancing historical retention and new adaptation.

Result: Achieved 2× improvement in global pose estimation over baselines, operating at 20 FPS with 6 GB GPU memory for thousands of images.

Conclusion: TTT3R effectively addresses length generalization in 3D reconstruction through training-free test-time adaptation, significantly improving performance while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Modern Recurrent Neural Networks have become a competitive architecture for
3D reconstruction due to their linear-time complexity. However, their
performance degrades significantly when applied beyond the training context
length, revealing limited length generalization. In this work, we revisit the
3D reconstruction foundation models from a Test-Time Training perspective,
framing their designs as an online learning problem. Building on this
perspective, we leverage the alignment confidence between the memory state and
incoming observations to derive a closed-form learning rate for memory updates,
to balance between retaining historical information and adapting to new
observations. This training-free intervention, termed TTT3R, substantially
improves length generalization, achieving a $2\times$ improvement in global
pose estimation over baselines, while operating at 20 FPS with just 6 GB of GPU
memory to process thousands of images. Code available in
