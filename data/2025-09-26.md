### [1] [Leveraging NTPs for Efficient Hallucination Detection in VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20379)
*Ofir Azachi,Kfir Eliyahu,Eyal El Ani,Rom Himelstein,Roi Reichart,Yuval Pinter,Nitay Calderon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes an efficient on-the-fly method for detecting hallucinations in vision-language models (VLMs) using next-token probabilities (NTPs) as features for lightweight ML models, achieving comparable performance to strong VLMs while being computationally efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in VLMs undermine their reliability, and current detection methods using VLMs themselves are computationally intensive and increase model latency. The authors aim to develop a more efficient detection approach.

Method: The method trains traditional ML models using features based on the VLM's next-token probabilities (NTPs), which quantify model uncertainty. They also explore augmenting visual NTPs with linguistic NTPs and integrating VLM-based hallucination prediction scores.

Result: NTP-based features proved valuable predictors of hallucinations, enabling simple ML models to achieve performance comparable to strong VLMs. Augmenting with linguistic NTPs enhanced detection performance, and combining NTP-based models with VLM scores outperformed using either approach alone.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that lightweight NTP-based solutions can effectively detect VLM hallucinations, paving the way for simple, efficient methods to enhance VLM reliability without significant computational overhead.

Abstract: Hallucinations of vision-language models (VLMs), which are misalignments
between visual content and generated text, undermine the reliability of VLMs.
One common approach for detecting them employs the same VLM, or a different
one, to assess generated outputs. This process is computationally intensive and
increases model latency. In this paper, we explore an efficient on-the-fly
method for hallucination detection by training traditional ML models over
signals based on the VLM's next-token probabilities (NTPs). NTPs provide a
direct quantification of model uncertainty. We hypothesize that high
uncertainty (i.e., a low NTP value) is strongly associated with hallucinations.
To test this, we introduce a dataset of 1,400 human-annotated statements
derived from VLM-generated content, each labeled as hallucinated or not, and
use it to test our NTP-based lightweight method. Our results demonstrate that
NTP-based features are valuable predictors of hallucinations, enabling fast and
simple ML models to achieve performance comparable to that of strong VLMs.
Furthermore, augmenting these NTPs with linguistic NTPs, computed by feeding
only the generated text back into the VLM, enhances hallucination detection
performance. Finally, integrating hallucination prediction scores from VLMs
into the NTP-based models led to better performance than using either VLMs or
NTPs alone. We hope this study paves the way for simple, lightweight solutions
that enhance the reliability of VLMs.

### [2] [Quasi-Synthetic Riemannian Data Generation for Writer-Independent Offline Signature Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20420)
*Elias N. Zois,Moises Diaz,Salem Said,Miguel A. Ferrer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A quasi-synthetic data generation framework using Riemannian geometry of SPD matrices for writer-independent offline signature verification, achieving low error rates on real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline handwritten signature verification is challenging in writer-independent settings, and existing methods depend on real-world datasets. The paper aims to overcome this limitation by generating synthetic data in Riemannian spaces.

Method: Uses Riemannian Gaussian Mixture on SPD matrices to generate synthetic writers and their properties. A metric learning framework trains on similar/dissimilar SPD pairs from synthetic data and tests on real datasets.

Result: Experiments on Western and Asian signature datasets show low error rates under intra- and cross-dataset evaluation protocols.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates the potential of generating synthetic data in Riemannian spaces for effective writer-independent signature verification systems.

Abstract: Offline handwritten signature verification remains a challenging task,
particularly in writer-independent settings where models must generalize across
unseen individuals. Recent developments have highlighted the advantage of
geometrically inspired representations, such as covariance descriptors on
Riemannian manifolds. However, past or present, handcrafted or data-driven
methods usually depend on real-world signature datasets for classifier
training. We introduce a quasi-synthetic data generation framework leveraging
the Riemannian geometry of Symmetric Positive Definite matrices (SPD). A small
set of genuine samples in the SPD space is the seed to a Riemannian Gaussian
Mixture which identifies Riemannian centers as synthetic writers and variances
as their properties. Riemannian Gaussian sampling on each center generates
positive as well as negative synthetic SPD populations. A metric learning
framework utilizes pairs of similar and dissimilar SPD points, subsequently
testing it over on real-world datasets. Experiments conducted on two popular
signature datasets, encompassing Western and Asian writing styles, demonstrate
the efficacy of the proposed approach under both intra- and cross- dataset
evaluation protocols. The results indicate that our quasi-synthetic approach
achieves low error rates, highlighting the potential of generating synthetic
data in Riemannian spaces for writer-independent signature verification
systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Seedream 4.0 is an efficient multimodal image generation system that unifies text-to-image synthesis, image editing, and multi-image composition in a single framework using a diffusion transformer with optimized VAE and training strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified system that extends traditional text-to-image systems into an interactive multidimensional creative tool for both creativity and professional applications, pushing the boundaries of generative AI.

Method: Developed a highly efficient diffusion transformer with powerful VAE that reduces image tokens, enabling efficient training and fast generation of high-resolution images. Uses comprehensive data collection across vertical scenarios, multi-modal post-training with fine-tuned VLM, and inference acceleration techniques including adversarial distillation, distribution matching, quantization, and speculative decoding.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on both T2I and multimodal image editing, with inference time of up to 1.8 seconds for 2K images. Demonstrates exceptional multimodal capabilities in complex tasks including precise image editing, in-context reasoning, multi-image reference, and multiple output image generation.

Conclusion: Seedream 4.0 successfully extends traditional T2I systems into a more interactive and multidimensional creative tool, pushing the boundary of generative AI for both creativity and professional applications.

Abstract: We introduce Seedream 4.0, an efficient and high-performance multimodal image
generation system that unifies text-to-image (T2I) synthesis, image editing,
and multi-image composition within a single framework. We develop a highly
efficient diffusion transformer with a powerful VAE which also can reduce the
number of image tokens considerably. This allows for efficient training of our
model, and enables it to fast generate native high-resolution images (e.g.,
1K-4K). Seedream 4.0 is pretrained on billions of text-image pairs spanning
diverse taxonomies and knowledge-centric concepts. Comprehensive data
collection across hundreds of vertical scenarios, coupled with optimized
strategies, ensures stable and large-scale training, with strong
generalization. By incorporating a carefully fine-tuned VLM model, we perform
multi-modal post-training for training both T2I and image editing tasks
jointly. For inference acceleration, we integrate adversarial distillation,
distribution matching, and quantization, as well as speculative decoding. It
achieves an inference time of up to 1.8 seconds for generating a 2K image
(without a LLM/VLM as PE model). Comprehensive evaluations reveal that Seedream
4.0 can achieve state-of-the-art results on both T2I and multimodal image
editing. In particular, it demonstrates exceptional multimodal capabilities in
complex tasks, including precise image editing and in-context reasoning, and
also allows for multi-image reference, and can generate multiple output images.
This extends traditional T2I systems into an more interactive and
multidimensional creative tool, pushing the boundary of generative AI for both
creativity and professional applications. Seedream 4.0 is now accessible on
https://www.volcengine.com/experience/ark?launch=seedream.

### [4] [A Contrastive Learning Framework for Breast Cancer Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20474)
*Samia Saeed,Khuram Naveed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Contrastive Learning framework using ResNet-50 achieves 96.7% accuracy in breast cancer detection on mammograms, addressing limited labeled data through semi-supervised training with unlabeled data and augmentation techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Breast cancer is a leading cause of cancer deaths globally, and early detection is crucial. Deep learning methods show promise but struggle with accuracy due to limited labeled datasets. The study aims to overcome this limitation using contrastive learning with smaller labeled datasets.

Method: The study introduces a Contrastive Learning framework using ResNet-50 trained in a semi-supervised approach with similarity index on large unlabeled mammogram data. Various augmentation and transformation techniques are employed to improve performance, followed by fine-tuning on a small labeled dataset.

Result: The proposed method achieves 96.7% accuracy in breast cancer detection on benchmark datasets INbreast and MIAS, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The contrastive learning framework effectively addresses the challenge of limited labeled data in medical imaging, demonstrating superior performance in breast cancer detection and offering a promising approach for early diagnosis with smaller labeled datasets.

Abstract: Breast cancer, the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally,
accounts for a quarter of all cancer cases [1]. To lower this death rate, it is
crucial to detect tumors early, as early-stage detection significantly improves
treatment outcomes. Advances in non-invasive imaging techniques have made early
detection possible through computer-aided detection (CAD) systems which rely on
traditional image analysis to identify malignancies. However, there is a
growing shift towards deep learning methods due to their superior
effectiveness. Despite their potential, deep learning methods often struggle
with accuracy due to the limited availability of large-labeled datasets for
training. To address this issue, our study introduces a Contrastive Learning
(CL) framework, which excels with smaller labeled datasets. In this regard, we
train Resnet-50 in semi supervised CL approach using similarity index on a
large amount of unlabeled mammogram data. In this regard, we use various
augmentation and transformations which help improve the performance of our
approach. Finally, we tune our model on a small set of labelled data that
outperforms the existing state of the art. Specifically, we observed a 96.7%
accuracy in detecting breast cancer on benchmark datasets INbreast and MIAS.

### [5] [Are Foundation Models Ready for Industrial Defect Recognition? A Reality Check on Real-World Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20479)
*Simon Baeuerle,Pratik Khanna,Nils Friederich,Angelo Jovin Yamachui Sitcheu,Damir Shakirov,Andreas Steimer,Ralf Mikut*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Foundation Models fail on real-world industrial quality inspection despite strong zero-shot performance on public benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To replace tedious labeling tasks in manufacturing quality inspection by using Foundation Models with simple text prompts, saving effort compared to supervised AI models.

Method: Tested multiple recent Foundation Models on both custom real-world industrial image data and public image datasets.

Result: All tested Foundation Models failed on real-world industrial data while performing well on public benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Foundation Models show limitations in practical industrial applications despite their promising zero-shot capabilities on standard benchmarks.

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) have shown impressive performance on various text and
image processing tasks. They can generalize across domains and datasets in a
zero-shot setting. This could make them suitable for automated quality
inspection during series manufacturing, where various types of images are being
evaluated for many different products. Replacing tedious labeling tasks with a
simple text prompt to describe anomalies and utilizing the same models across
many products would save significant efforts during model setup and
implementation. This is a strong advantage over supervised Artificial
Intelligence (AI) models, which are trained for individual applications and
require labeled training data. We test multiple recent FMs on both custom
real-world industrial image data and public image data. We show that all of
those models fail on our real-world data, while the very same models perform
well on public benchmark datasets.

### [6] [Shared Neural Space: Unified Precomputed Feature Encoding for Multi-Task and Cross Domain Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20481)
*Jing Li,Oskar Bartosz,Chengyu Wang,Michal Wnuczynski,Dilshan Godaliyadda,Michael Polley*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a universal Neural Space (NS) with encoder-decoder framework for multi-task vision pipelines, enabling shared feature space across different vision tasks to reduce redundancy and improve generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI models are inefficient for applications with multiple modular tasks, as each task requires mapping to different latent domains, leading to redundancy and poor generalization across domain shifts.

Method: Uses a lightweight CNN-based encoder-decoder framework that pre-computes transformation-aware, generalizable representations across vision tasks, allowing multiple downstream AI modules to share the same feature space.

Result: The proposed Neural Space enables efficient performance of various imaging and vision tasks (demosaicing, denoising, depth estimation, semantic segmentation) with reduced redundancy and improved generalization compared to task-specific models.

Conclusion: The universal Neural Space establishes an efficient foundation for multi-task vision pipelines, offering better generalization and hardware compatibility than larger transformer backbones while supporting diverse vision applications.

Abstract: The majority of AI models in imaging and vision are customized to perform on
specific high-precision task. However, this strategy is inefficient for
applications with a series of modular tasks, since each requires a mapping into
a disparate latent domain. To address this inefficiency, we proposed a
universal Neural Space (NS), where an encoder-decoder framework pre-computes
features across vision and imaging tasks. Our encoder learns transformation
aware, generalizable representations, which enable multiple downstream AI
modules to share the same feature space. This architecture reduces redundancy,
improves generalization across domain shift, and establishes a foundation for
effecient multi-task vision pipelines. Furthermore, as opposed to larger
transformer backbones, our backbone is lightweight and CNN-based, allowing for
wider across hardware. We furthur demonstrate that imaging and vision modules,
such as demosaicing, denoising, depth estimation and semantic segmentation can
be performed efficiently in the NS.

### [7] [Data-Efficient Stream-Based Active Distillation for Scalable Edge Model Deployment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20484)
*Dani Manjah,Tim Bary,Benoît Gérin,Benoît Macq,Christophe de Vleeschouwer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores image selection strategies for training edge models using teacher-student framework, showing that combining high-confidence stream-based selection with diversity approaches produces high-quality models with minimal data queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge camera systems need regular model updates but face computational constraints. Current practice uses complex teacher models on servers to annotate data for training smaller edge models, but selecting the most useful images efficiently is challenging.

Method: Proposes a high-confidence stream-based strategy combined with diversity-based approach for selecting training images, focusing on minimizing dataset queries while maintaining model quality.

Result: For similar training iterations, the proposed approach produces high-quality models with minimal dataset queries compared to other selection strategies.

Conclusion: The combination of high-confidence stream-based selection with diversity considerations is an effective strategy for training edge models efficiently while minimizing transmission costs.

Abstract: Edge camera-based systems are continuously expanding, facing ever-evolving
environments that require regular model updates. In practice, complex teacher
models are run on a central server to annotate data, which is then used to
train smaller models tailored to the edge devices with limited computational
power. This work explores how to select the most useful images for training to
maximize model quality while keeping transmission costs low. Our work shows
that, for a similar training load (i.e., iterations), a high-confidence
stream-based strategy coupled with a diversity-based approach produces a
high-quality model with minimal dataset queries.

### [8] [InstructVTON: Optimal Auto-Masking and Natural-Language-Guided Interactive Style Control for Inpainting-Based Virtual Try-On](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20524)
*Julien Han,Shuwen Qiu,Qi Li,Xingzi Xu,Mehmet Saygin Seyfioglu,Kavosh Asadi,Karim Bouyarmane*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstructVTON is an instruction-following virtual try-on system that uses natural language instructions for fine-grained styling control, eliminating the need for manual mask creation by leveraging Vision Language Models and image segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional masking-based virtual try-on approaches are difficult to use, require background knowledge, and cannot handle complex styling scenarios like changing sleeve positions without covering entire garment sections.

Method: Uses Vision Language Models and image segmentation models to automatically generate binary masks based on user images and free-text style instructions, enabling complex styling control without manual mask drawing.

Result: The system achieves state-of-the-art results with styling control and is interoperable with existing virtual try-on models, automating multiple rounds of image generation for complex scenarios.

Conclusion: InstructVTON simplifies the virtual try-on experience by removing mask-drawing requirements and enabling complex styling instructions that traditional masking-based approaches cannot handle.

Abstract: We present InstructVTON, an instruction-following interactive virtual try-on
system that allows fine-grained and complex styling control of the resulting
generation, guided by natural language, on single or multiple garments. A
computationally efficient and scalable formulation of virtual try-on formulates
the problem as an image-guided or image-conditioned inpainting task. These
inpainting-based virtual try-on models commonly use a binary mask to control
the generation layout. Producing a mask that yields desirable result is
difficult, requires background knowledge, might be model dependent, and in some
cases impossible with the masking-based approach (e.g. trying on a long-sleeve
shirt with "sleeves rolled up" styling on a person wearing long-sleeve shirt
with sleeves down, where the mask will necessarily cover the entire sleeve).
InstructVTON leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) and image segmentation
models for automated binary mask generation. These masks are generated based on
user-provided images and free-text style instructions. InstructVTON simplifies
the end-user experience by removing the necessity of a precisely drawn mask,
and by automating execution of multiple rounds of image generation for try-on
scenarios that cannot be achieved with masking-based virtual try-on models
alone. We show that InstructVTON is interoperable with existing virtual try-on
models to achieve state-of-the-art results with styling control.

### [9] [Innovative Deep Learning Architecture for Enhanced Altered Fingerprint Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20537)
*Dana A Abdullah,Dana Rasul Hamad,Bishar Rasheed Ibrahim,Sirwan Abdulwahid Aula,Aso Khaleel Ameen,Sabat Salih Hamadamin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepAFRNet is a deep learning model for recognizing altered fingerprints using VGG16 backbone and cosine similarity, achieving high accuracy (up to 99.54%) on real altered fingerprint datasets with strict thresholds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Altered fingerprint recognition is crucial for security applications like border control and forensics, as adversaries can deliberately modify ridge patterns to evade detection systems.

Method: Uses VGG16 backbone for feature extraction and cosine similarity for comparing embeddings, evaluated on SOCOFing Real-Altered subset with three difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard).

Result: Achieves accuracies of 96.7%, 98.76%, and 99.54% for Easy, Medium, and Hard levels respectively with strict thresholds. Threshold sensitivity study shows accuracy drops sharply (to 7.86-29.51%) when threshold is relaxed from 0.92 to 0.72.

Conclusion: DeepAFRNet addresses limitations of prior work by using real altered samples and demonstrates readiness for real-world deployments where both security and recognition resilience are critical.

Abstract: Altered fingerprint recognition (AFR) is challenging for biometric
verification in applications such as border control, forensics, and fiscal
admission. Adversaries can deliberately modify ridge patterns to evade
detection, so robust recognition of altered prints is essential. We present
DeepAFRNet, a deep learning recognition model that matches and recognizes
distorted fingerprint samples. The approach uses a VGG16 backbone to extract
high-dimensional features and cosine similarity to compare embeddings. We
evaluate on the SOCOFing Real-Altered subset with three difficulty levels
(Easy, Medium, Hard). With strict thresholds, DeepAFRNet achieves accuracies of
96.7 percent, 98.76 percent, and 99.54 percent for the three levels. A
threshold-sensitivity study shows that relaxing the threshold from 0.92 to 0.72
sharply degrades accuracy to 7.86 percent, 27.05 percent, and 29.51 percent,
underscoring the importance of threshold selection in biometric systems. By
using real altered samples and reporting per-level metrics, DeepAFRNet
addresses limitations of prior work based on synthetic alterations or limited
verification protocols, and indicates readiness for real-world deployments
where both security and recognition resilience are critical.

Transformer into voxel representations to enhance bimanual robotic
manipulation. Specifically, we extract attention maps from DINOv2, a
self-supervised ViT model, and interpret them as pixel-level saliency scores
over RGB images. These maps are lifted into a 3D voxel grid, resulting in
voxel-level semantic cues that are incorporated into a behavior cloning policy.
When integrated into a state-of-the-art voxel-based policy, our
attention-guided featurization yields an average absolute improvement of 8.2%
and a relative gain of 21.9% across all tasks in the RLBench bimanual
benchmark.

*Xinyang Mu,Yuzhen Lu,Boyang Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Comparative benchmark analysis of 36 real-time object detectors (YOLO v8-v12 and RT-DETR v1-v2 variants) for blueberry detection, evaluated on a new dataset of 661 canopy images with 85,879 labeled instances. RT-DETR-v2-X achieved best performance (94.8% mAP@50) after semi-supervised learning fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Blueberry detection in natural environments is challenging due to variable lighting, occlusions, and motion blur. Deep learning detectors need large-scale datasets and optimal accuracy/speed/memory trade-offs for practical deployment.

Method: Evaluated 36 model variants on a curated dataset of 661 canopy images (85,879 labeled blueberries). Applied Unbiased Mean Teacher-based semi-supervised learning on 1,035 unlabeled images for fine-tuning. Compared YOLO (v8-v12) and RT-DETR (v1-v2) families.

Result: YOLOv12m achieved 93.3% mAP@50 (best among YOLO models). RT-DETRv2-X achieved 93.6% mAP@50 (best among RT-DETR variants). After SSL fine-tuning, RT-DETR-v2-X reached 94.8% mAP@50. Mid-sized models offered good accuracy-speed balance.

Conclusion: RT-DETR-v2-X performed best overall after semi-supervised learning. More research needed to better leverage cross-domain unlabeled data. Dataset and software made publicly available to support further research.

Abstract: Blueberry detection in natural environments remains challenging due to
variable lighting, occlusions, and motion blur due to environmental factors and
imaging devices. Deep learning-based object detectors promise to address these
challenges, but they demand a large-scale, diverse dataset that captures the
real-world complexities. Moreover, deploying these models in practical
scenarios often requires the right accuracy/speed/memory trade-off in model
selection. This study presents a novel comparative benchmark analysis of
advanced real-time object detectors, including YOLO (You Only Look Once)
(v8-v12) and RT-DETR (Real-Time Detection Transformers) (v1-v2) families,
consisting of 36 model variants, evaluated on a newly curated dataset for
blueberry detection. This dataset comprises 661 canopy images collected with
smartphones during the 2022-2023 seasons, consisting of 85,879 labelled
instances (including 36,256 ripe and 49,623 unripe blueberries) across a wide
range of lighting conditions, occlusions, and fruit maturity stages. Among the
YOLO models, YOLOv12m achieved the best accuracy with a mAP@50 of 93.3%, while
RT-DETRv2-X obtained a mAP@50 of 93.6%, the highest among all the RT-DETR
variants. The inference time varied with the model scale and complexity, and
the mid-sized models appeared to offer a good accuracy-speed balance. To
further enhance detection performance, all the models were fine-tuned using
Unbiased Mean Teacher-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) on a separate set of
1,035 unlabeled images acquired by a ground-based machine vision platform in
2024. This resulted in accuracy gains ranging from -1.4% to 2.9%, with
RT-DETR-v2-X achieving the best mAP@50 of 94.8%. More in-depth research into
SSL is needed to better leverage cross-domain unlabeled data. Both the dataset
and software programs of this study are made publicly available to support
further research.

### [12] [Region-of-Interest Augmentation for Mammography Classification under Patient-Level Cross-Validation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20585)
*Farbod Bigdeli,Mohsen Mohammadagha,Ali Bigdeli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight ROI augmentation strategy for mammography classification that probabilistically replaces full images with random ROI crops during training, showing modest performance gains without increasing inference cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Breast cancer screening with mammography is crucial for early detection, but deep learning approaches are limited by small datasets and low resolution. The paper aims to improve performance through simple data-centric augmentation without requiring additional labels or architectural changes.

Method: Introduces ROI augmentation where full mammogram images are probabilistically replaced with random ROI crops from a precomputed bounding-box bank during training. Uses Mini-DDSM dataset (9,684 images; 2,414 patients) with patient-level cross-validation.

Result: ROI augmentation (best parameters: p_roi = 0.10, alpha = 0.10) yields modest ROC-AUC gains with performance varying across folds. PR-AUC remains flat to slightly lower. Training efficiency metrics (throughput and GPU memory) are reported.

Conclusion: Simple ROI augmentation strategies can enhance mammography classification in constrained settings without requiring additional labels or architectural modifications, maintaining unchanged inference-time cost.

Abstract: Breast cancer screening with mammography remains central to early detection
and mortality reduction. Deep learning has shown strong potential for
automating mammogram interpretation, yet limited-resolution datasets and small
sample sizes continue to restrict performance. We revisit the Mini-DDSM dataset
(9,684 images; 2,414 patients) and introduce a lightweight region-of-interest
(ROI) augmentation strategy. During training, full images are probabilistically
replaced with random ROI crops sampled from a precomputed, label-free
bounding-box bank, with optional jitter to increase variability. We evaluate
under strict patient-level cross-validation and report ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, and
training-time efficiency metrics (throughput and GPU memory). Because ROI
augmentation is training-only, inference-time cost remains unchanged. On
Mini-DDSM, ROI augmentation (best: p_roi = 0.10, alpha = 0.10) yields modest
average ROC-AUC gains, with performance varying across folds; PR-AUC is flat to
slightly lower. These results demonstrate that simple, data-centric ROI
strategies can enhance mammography classification in constrained settings
without requiring additional labels or architectural modifications.

*Jing Wu,Zirui Wang,Iro Laina,Victor Adrian Prisacariu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Using mirror reflections as auxiliary views to enable single-image multi-view stereo for 3D reconstruction by treating reflections as virtual cameras and leveraging geometric symmetry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mirror reflections provide stereo information within a single capture, allowing simplification of the imaging process and compatibility with feed-forward reconstruction models for robust 3D reconstruction.

Method: Design a transformation that constructs physically valid virtual cameras from mirror reflections, enabling direct pixel-domain generation of virtual views. Propose symmetric-aware loss for pose refinement and extend to dynamic scenes with per-frame geometry recovery.

Result: Framework enables multi-view stereo from single images, works with generalizable reconstruction models, and handles dynamic scenes. Created synthetic dataset with ground-truth for evaluation.

Conclusion: Method effectively exploits mirror reflections for 3D reconstruction, simplifying imaging setup while maintaining robustness and generalizability across static and dynamic scenes.

Abstract: Mirror reflections are common in everyday environments and can provide stereo
information within a single capture, as the real and reflected virtual views
are visible simultaneously. We exploit this property by treating the reflection
as an auxiliary view and designing a transformation that constructs a
physically valid virtual camera, allowing direct pixel-domain generation of the
virtual view while adhering to the real-world imaging process. This enables a
multi-view stereo setup from a single image, simplifying the imaging process,
making it compatible with powerful feed-forward reconstruction models for
generalizable and robust 3D reconstruction. To further exploit the geometric
symmetry introduced by mirrors, we propose a symmetric-aware loss to refine
pose estimation. Our framework also naturally extends to dynamic scenes, where
each frame contains a mirror reflection, enabling efficient per-frame geometry
recovery. For quantitative evaluation, we provide a fully customizable
synthetic dataset of 16 Blender scenes, each with ground-truth point clouds and
camera poses. Extensive experiments on real-world data and synthetic data are
conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of our method.

Motivation: Current methods using overhead imagery miss critical facade details that determine habitability, while street-view imagery is sparse and hard to align with parcels. There's a need for scalable, interpretable occupancy assessment for disaster response.

Method: A language-guided framework that links panoramic video to parcels, rectifies views to facades, and extracts interpretable attributes. Uses two decision strategies: a transparent one-stage rule and a two-stage design separating perception from conservative reasoning.

Result: The two-stage approach achieved precision of 0.927, recall of 0.781, and F-1 score of 0.848, outperforming the one-stage baseline (precision: 0.943, recall: 0.728, F-1: 0.822) in post-Hurricane Helene surveys.

Conclusion: FacadeTrack provides auditable, scalable occupancy assessments with interpretable intermediate attributes and spatial diagnostics, enabling targeted quality control and integration into emergency management workflows.

Abstract: Building-level occupancy after disasters is vital for triage, inspections,
utility re-energization, and equitable resource allocation. Overhead imagery
provides rapid coverage but often misses facade and access cues that determine
habitability, while street-view imagery captures those details but is sparse
and difficult to align with parcels. We present FacadeTrack, a street-level,
language-guided framework that links panoramic video to parcels, rectifies
views to facades, and elicits interpretable attributes (for example, entry
blockage, temporary coverings, localized debris) that drive two decision
strategies: a transparent one-stage rule and a two-stage design that separates
perception from conservative reasoning. Evaluated across two post-Hurricane
Helene surveys, the two-stage approach achieves a precision of 0.927, a recall
of 0.781, and an F-1 score of 0.848, compared with the one-stage baseline at a
precision of 0.943, a recall of 0.728, and an F-1 score of 0.822. Beyond
accuracy, intermediate attributes and spatial diagnostics reveal where and why
residual errors occur, enabling targeted quality control. The pipeline provides
auditable, scalable occupancy assessments suitable for integration into
geospatial and emergency-management workflows.

*Yiling Yun,Hongjing Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Humans use semantic representations alongside visual features to recognize social interactions in moving shapes. Semantic models, especially verb-based embeddings, complement visual features in explaining human similarity judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand what semantic representations humans use to complement visual features when recognizing social interactions from simple moving shapes, bridging visual and abstract representations.

Method: Study 1: Direct labeling of animations by human participants. Study 2: Measuring representational geometry of 27 social interactions through human similarity judgments, comparing with model predictions based on visual features, labels, and semantic embeddings from descriptions.

Result: Human responses were distributed in Study 1. In Study 2, semantic models provided complementary information to visual features, with verb-based embeddings from descriptions accounting for human similarity judgments the best.

Conclusion: Social perception in simple displays reflects the semantic structure of social interactions, suggesting humans use semantic representations that bridge visual and abstract understanding.

Abstract: Humans are social creatures who readily recognize various social interactions
from simple display of moving shapes. While previous research has often focused
on visual features, we examine what semantic representations that humans employ
to complement visual features. In Study 1, we directly asked human participants
to label the animations based on their impression of moving shapes. We found
that human responses were distributed. In Study 2, we measured the
representational geometry of 27 social interactions through human similarity
judgments and compared it with model predictions based on visual features,
labels, and semantic embeddings from animation descriptions. We found that
semantic models provided complementary information to visual features in
explaining human judgments. Among the semantic models, verb-based embeddings
extracted from descriptions account for human similarity judgments the best.
These results suggest that social perception in simple displays reflects the
semantic structure of social interactions, bridging visual and abstract
representations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EGS is a novel cross-view geo-localization framework that addresses robustness to severe appearance variations and establishes reliable global-local correspondences using E(2)-Steerable CNN and graph-based super-node architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CVGL methods struggle with severe appearance variations from different UAV orientations/fields of view, which hinders cross-domain generalization, and lack reliable global-local correspondence establishment.

Method: Proposes EGS framework with E(2)-Steerable CNN encoder for rotation/viewpoint-invariant features, and graph architecture with virtual super-node that connects to all local nodes to aggregate global semantics and enforce global-local consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments on University-1652 and SUES-200 benchmarks show EGS achieves substantial performance gains and establishes new state-of-the-art in cross-domain CVGL.

Conclusion: EGS effectively enhances cross-domain generalization in cross-view geo-localization by addressing appearance variation robustness and global-local correspondence challenges through innovative steerable CNN and graph-based architecture.

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) aims to match images of the same location
captured from drastically different viewpoints. Despite recent progress,
existing methods still face two key challenges: (1) achieving robustness under
severe appearance variations induced by diverse UAV orientations and fields of
view, which hinders cross-domain generalization, and (2) establishing reliable
correspondences that capture both global scene-level semantics and fine-grained
local details. In this paper, we propose EGS, a novel CVGL framework designed
to enhance cross-domain generalization. Specifically, we introduce an
E(2)-Steerable CNN encoder to extract stable and reliable features under
rotation and viewpoint shifts. Furthermore, we construct a graph with a virtual
super-node that connects to all local nodes, enabling global semantics to be
aggregated and redistributed to local regions, thereby enforcing global-local
consistency. Extensive experiments on the University-1652 and SUES-200
benchmarks demonstrate that EGS consistently achieves substantial performance
gains and establishes a new state of the art in cross-domain CVGL.

*Jiayi Zuo,Songwei Pei,Qian Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Dual-Path Edge Network for infrared small target detection that decouples edge enhancement and semantic modeling to address feature misalignment between high-resolution spatial details and robust semantic context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infrared small targets lack distinctive features and blend into cluttered backgrounds, creating a conflict between capturing spatial details for minute targets and extracting semantic context for larger targets, which existing methods fail to address adequately.

Method: Proposes a Dual-Path Edge Network with: 1) Bidirectional Interaction Module using Local and Global Self-Attention for multi-scale feature dependencies, and 2) Multi-Edge Refiner using cascaded Taylor finite difference operators with attention-driven gating for precise edge localization.

Result: The method provides precise infrared small target detection and localization by effectively combining structural semantics and edge refinement while suppressing noise.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a promising solution for infrared small target detection by unifying edge enhancement and semantic modeling to overcome the limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection is crucial for remote sensing applications
like disaster warning and maritime surveillance. However, due to the lack of
distinctive texture and morphological features, infrared small targets are
highly susceptible to blending into cluttered and noisy backgrounds. A
fundamental challenge in designing deep models for this task lies in the
inherent conflict between capturing high-resolution spatial details for minute
targets and extracting robust semantic context for larger targets, often
leading to feature misalignment and suboptimal performance. Existing methods
often rely on fixed gradient operators or simplistic attention mechanisms,
which are inadequate for accurately extracting target edges under low contrast
and high noise. In this paper, we propose a novel Dual-Path Edge Network that
explicitly addresses this challenge by decoupling edge enhancement and semantic
modeling into two complementary processing paths. The first path employs a
Bidirectional Interaction Module, which uses both Local Self-Attention and
Global Self-Attention to capture multi-scale local and global feature
dependencies. The global attention mechanism, based on a Transformer
architecture, integrates long-range semantic relationships and contextual
information, ensuring robust scene understanding. The second path introduces
the Multi-Edge Refiner, which enhances fine-grained edge details using cascaded
Taylor finite difference operators at multiple scales. This mathematical
approach, along with an attention-driven gating mechanism, enables precise edge
localization and feature enhancement for targets of varying sizes, while
effectively suppressing noise. Our method provides a promising solution for
precise infrared small target detection and localization, combining structural
semantics and edge refinement in a unified framework.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces group intention forecasting (GIF) as a novel task to predict when collective intentions emerge from individual actions, proposes the SHOT dataset for basketball scenarios, and presents the GIFT framework for forecasting group intention emergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional intention recognition focuses on individual intentions but overlooks the complexities of collective intentions in group settings, creating a need to understand how shared goals emerge through multiple individuals' actions.

Method: The authors propose SHOT (a large-scale basketball dataset with 1,979 video clips from 5 camera views) and GIFT (a framework that extracts individual features and models group dynamics to forecast intention emergence).

Result: Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of both SHOT and GIFT, establishing a strong foundation for future research in group intention forecasting.

Conclusion: The work successfully addresses the gap in collective intention recognition by introducing GIF as a novel task and providing both dataset and framework for studying emerging group intentions.

Abstract: Intention recognition has traditionally focused on individual intentions,
overlooking the complexities of collective intentions in group settings. To
address this limitation, we introduce the concept of group intention, which
represents shared goals emerging through the actions of multiple individuals,
and Group Intention Forecasting (GIF), a novel task that forecasts when group
intentions will occur by analyzing individual actions and interactions before
the collective goal becomes apparent. To investigate GIF in a specific
scenario, we propose SHOT, the first large-scale dataset for GIF, consisting of
1,979 basketball video clips captured from 5 camera views and annotated with 6
types of individual attributes. SHOT is designed with 3 key characteristics:
multi-individual information, multi-view adaptability, and multi-level
intention, making it well-suited for studying emerging group intentions.
Furthermore, we introduce GIFT (Group Intention ForecasTer), a framework that
extracts fine-grained individual features and models evolving group dynamics to
forecast intention emergence. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of
SHOT and GIFT, establishing a strong foundation for future research in group
intention forecasting. The dataset is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Neptune-X is a data-centric generative-selection framework that addresses maritime object detection challenges by generating diverse synthetic maritime data and intelligently selecting task-relevant samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Maritime object detection faces two key challenges: scarcity of annotated maritime data and poor generalization across various maritime attributes (object category, viewpoint, location, imaging environment), especially in underrepresented scenarios like open-sea environments.

Method: Proposes Neptune-X framework with two components: 1) X-to-Maritime generative model with Bidirectional Object-Water Attention module for realistic maritime scene synthesis, and 2) Attribute-correlated Active Sampling for dynamic selection of task-relevant synthetic samples. Also constructs Maritime Generation Dataset for benchmarking.

Result: The approach sets new benchmark in maritime scene synthesis and significantly improves detection accuracy, particularly in challenging and previously underrepresented settings.

Conclusion: Neptune-X effectively addresses maritime data scarcity and generalization issues through synthetic data generation with intelligent sample selection, demonstrating superior performance in maritime object detection tasks.

Abstract: Maritime object detection is essential for navigation safety, surveillance,
and autonomous operations, yet constrained by two key challenges: the scarcity
of annotated maritime data and poor generalization across various maritime
attributes (e.g., object category, viewpoint, location, and imaging
environment). % In particular, models trained on existing datasets often
underperform in underrepresented scenarios such as open-sea environments. To
address these challenges, we propose Neptune-X, a data-centric
generative-selection framework that enhances training effectiveness by
leveraging synthetic data generation with task-aware sample selection. From the
generation perspective, we develop X-to-Maritime, a multi-modality-conditioned
generative model that synthesizes diverse and realistic maritime scenes. A key
component is the Bidirectional Object-Water Attention module, which captures
boundary interactions between objects and their aquatic surroundings to improve
visual fidelity. To further improve downstream tasking performance, we propose
Attribute-correlated Active Sampling, which dynamically selects synthetic
samples based on their task relevance. To support robust benchmarking, we
construct the Maritime Generation Dataset, the first dataset tailored for
generative maritime learning, encompassing a wide range of semantic conditions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach sets a new benchmark in
maritime scene synthesis, significantly improving detection accuracy,
particularly in challenging and previously underrepresented settings.The code

*Sofia McLeod,Chee-Kheng Chng,Matthew Rodda,Tat-Jun Chin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STELLA is the first end-to-end Crater-Based Navigation pipeline for long-duration lunar mapping missions, achieving metre-level position and sub-degree attitude accuracy under challenging conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Crater-Based Navigation (CBN) systems work well for short-duration landing missions but fail in long-duration mapping missions with sparse, oblique imagery and varying illumination conditions typical of year-long campaigns.

Method: STELLA combines Mask R-CNN-based crater detection, descriptor-less crater identification, robust perspective-n-crater pose solver, and batch orbit determination back-end. Tested on CRESENT-365 dataset simulating year-long lunar mapping.

Result: STELLA maintains metre-level position accuracy and sub-degree attitude accuracy across wide ranges of viewing angles, illumination conditions, and lunar latitudes.

Conclusion: This represents the first comprehensive assessment of CBN in true lunar mapping settings, providing operational guidelines for future missions.

Abstract: Crater-Based Navigation (CBN) uses the ubiquitous impact craters of the Moon
observed on images as natural landmarks to determine the six degrees of freedom
pose of a spacecraft. To date, CBN has primarily been studied in the context of
powered descent and landing. These missions are typically short in duration,
with high-frequency imagery captured from a nadir viewpoint over well-lit
terrain. In contrast, lunar mapping missions involve sparse, oblique imagery
acquired under varying illumination conditions over potentially year-long
campaigns, posing significantly greater challenges for pose estimation. We
bridge this gap with STELLA - the first end-to-end CBN pipeline for
long-duration lunar mapping. STELLA combines a Mask R-CNN-based crater
detector, a descriptor-less crater identification module, a robust
perspective-n-crater pose solver, and a batch orbit determination back-end. To
rigorously test STELLA, we introduce CRESENT-365 - the first public dataset
that emulates a year-long lunar mapping mission. Each of its 15,283 images is
rendered from high-resolution digital elevation models with SPICE-derived Sun
angles and Moon motion, delivering realistic global coverage, illumination
cycles, and viewing geometries. Experiments on CRESENT+ and CRESENT-365 show
that STELLA maintains metre-level position accuracy and sub-degree attitude
accuracy on average across wide ranges of viewing angles, illumination
conditions, and lunar latitudes. These results constitute the first
comprehensive assessment of CBN in a true lunar mapping setting and inform
operational conditions that should be considered for future missions.

### [21] [Seeing Through Words, Speaking Through Pixels: Deep Representational Alignment Between Vision and Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20751)
*Zoe Wanying He,Sean Trott,Meenakshi Khosla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unimodal vision and language models develop partially aligned semantic representations in mid-to-late layers, with alignment robust to appearance changes but sensitive to semantic alterations, and this alignment mirrors human preferences in image-text matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically investigate where alignment emerges in unimodal networks, what cues support it, whether it captures human preferences in many-to-many image-text scenarios, and how exemplar aggregation affects alignment.

Method: Analyzed alignment patterns across layers of vision-only and language-only models, tested robustness to appearance vs. semantic changes, conducted forced-choice "Pick-a-Pic" task to compare with human preferences, and examined effects of averaging embeddings across exemplars.

Result: Alignment peaks in mid-to-late layers, is robust to appearance changes but collapses with semantic alterations, mirrors human preferences bidirectionally in many-to-many matching, and strengthens with exemplar aggregation rather than blurring detail.

Conclusion: Unimodal networks converge on a shared semantic code that aligns with human judgments and is enhanced by exemplar aggregation, demonstrating emergent cross-modal alignment without explicit multimodal training.

Abstract: Recent studies show that deep vision-only and language-only models--trained
on disjoint modalities--nonetheless project their inputs into a partially
aligned representational space. Yet we still lack a clear picture of where in
each network this convergence emerges, what visual or linguistic cues support
it, whether it captures human preferences in many-to-many image-text scenarios,
and how aggregating exemplars of the same concept affects alignment. Here, we
systematically investigate these questions. We find that alignment peaks in
mid-to-late layers of both model types, reflecting a shift from
modality-specific to conceptually shared representations. This alignment is
robust to appearance-only changes but collapses when semantics are altered
(e.g., object removal or word-order scrambling), highlighting that the shared
code is truly semantic. Moving beyond the one-to-one image-caption paradigm, a
forced-choice "Pick-a-Pic" task shows that human preferences for image-caption
matches are mirrored in the embedding spaces across all vision-language model
pairs. This pattern holds bidirectionally when multiple captions correspond to
a single image, demonstrating that models capture fine-grained semantic
distinctions akin to human judgments. Surprisingly, averaging embeddings across
exemplars amplifies alignment rather than blurring detail. Together, our
results demonstrate that unimodal networks converge on a shared semantic code
that aligns with human judgments and strengthens with exemplar aggregation.

*Yuhong Zhang,Han Wang,Yiwen Wang,Rong Xie,Li Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreeInsert is a training-free framework that enables personalized object insertion into images with geometric control and style consistency by leveraging 3D generation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image editing methods lack geometric control over inserted objects (limited to 2D space) and struggle with style consistency between objects and backgrounds, while requiring extensive training.

Method: Convert 2D objects to 3D using existing 3D generation models, perform interactive editing in 3D space, then re-render to 2D from specified views. Combine geometric control with diffusion adapters for style and content control.

Result: The framework produces geometrically controlled, style-consistent edited images without requiring training.

Conclusion: FreeInsert successfully addresses limitations in personalized image composition by introducing 3D geometric control while maintaining style consistency through a training-free approach.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have made significant progress in image
generation, allowing for effortless customized generation. However, existing
image editing methods still face certain limitations when dealing with
personalized image composition tasks. First, there is the issue of lack of
geometric control over the inserted objects. Current methods are confined to 2D
space and typically rely on textual instructions, making it challenging to
maintain precise geometric control over the objects. Second, there is the
challenge of style consistency. Existing methods often overlook the style
consistency between the inserted object and the background, resulting in a lack
of realism. In addition, the challenge of inserting objects into images without
extensive training remains significant. To address these issues, we propose
\textit{FreeInsert}, a novel training-free framework that customizes object
insertion into arbitrary scenes by leveraging 3D geometric information.
Benefiting from the advances in existing 3D generation models, we first convert
the 2D object into 3D, perform interactive editing at the 3D level, and then
re-render it into a 2D image from a specified view. This process introduces
geometric controls such as shape or view. The rendered image, serving as
geometric control, is combined with style and content control achieved through
diffusion adapters, ultimately producing geometrically controlled,
style-consistent edited images via the diffusion model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CustomEnhancer is a zero-shot enhancement framework that improves text-to-image diffusion models for human photo synthesis by leveraging face swapping and triple-flow fusion to achieve better scene diversity, identity fidelity, and training-free control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image diffusion models for human photo synthesis face issues with degraded scenes, insufficient control, and suboptimal perceptual identity. The authors aim to overcome these limitations while providing better control and efficiency.

Method: The framework uses face swapping techniques and pretrained diffusion models to obtain additional representations in a zero-shot manner. It introduces triple-flow fused PerGeneration that combines two counter-directional latent spaces to manipulate personalized models, and ResInversion for efficient noise rectification via pre-diffusion, reducing inversion time by 129x compared to NTI.

Result: Experiments show CustomEnhancer achieves state-of-the-art results in scene diversity, identity fidelity, and training-free controls. The proposed ResInversion method demonstrates significant efficiency improvements over null-text inversion.

Conclusion: CustomEnhancer provides an effective solution for enhancing identity customization models with superior performance in multiple aspects while offering efficient training-free control over personalized generation processes.

Abstract: Recently remarkable progress has been made in synthesizing realistic human
photos using text-to-image diffusion models. However, current approaches face
degraded scenes, insufficient control, and suboptimal perceptual identity. We
introduce CustomEnhancer, a novel framework to augment existing identity
customization models. CustomEnhancer is a zero-shot enhancement pipeline that
leverages face swapping techniques, pretrained diffusion model, to obtain
additional representations in a zeroshot manner for encoding into personalized
models. Through our proposed triple-flow fused PerGeneration approach, which
identifies and combines two compatible counter-directional latent spaces to
manipulate a pivotal space of personalized model, we unify the generation and
reconstruction processes, realizing generation from three flows. Our pipeline
also enables comprehensive training-free control over the generation process of
personalized models, offering precise controlled personalization for them and
eliminating the need for controller retraining for per-model. Besides, to
address the high time complexity of null-text inversion (NTI), we introduce
ResInversion, a novel inversion method that performs noise rectification via a
pre-diffusion mechanism, reducing the inversion time by 129 times. Experiments
demonstrate that CustomEnhancer reach SOTA results at scene diversity, identity
fidelity, training-free controls, while also showing the efficiency of our
ResInversion over NTI. The code will be made publicly available upon paper
acceptance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's growing need for video compression technology optimized for computer vision tasks, but no consolidated platform exists to implement and evaluate compression methods that retain task accuracy while efficiently compressing vision network inputs.

Method: The platform provides a common ground to evaluate compression tools in two inference scenarios (remote and split inferencing), incorporating standard codecs and examining compression gain on various datasets through bit-rate versus task accuracy analysis.

### [25] [Dual-supervised Asymmetric Co-training for Semi-supervised Medical Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20785)
*Jincai Song,Haipeng Chen,Jun Qin,Na Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a dual-supervised asymmetric co-training (DAC) framework for cross-domain semi-supervised domain generalization (CD-SSDG) in medical image segmentation, addressing domain shifts between labeled/unlabeled training data and training/testing sets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional SSDG methods assume labeled and unlabeled data are available for each source domain, which is impractical. Real-world scenarios involve domain shifts between labeled and unlabeled training data, requiring more robust solutions.

Method: DAC framework builds on co-training with two sub-models providing cross pseudo supervision, integrating feature-level supervision and asymmetric auxiliary self-supervised tasks to address inaccurate pseudolabels and enhance domain-invariant feature learning.

Result: Extensive experiments on Fundus, Polyp, and SCGM medical image datasets demonstrate robust generalizability of the proposed DAC framework.

Conclusion: The DAC framework effectively handles the challenging CD-SSDG scenario by mitigating domain shift issues through dual supervision and asymmetric auxiliary tasks, showing superior performance in medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG) in medical image segmentation
offers a promising solution for generalizing to unseen domains during testing,
addressing domain shift challenges and minimizing annotation costs. However,
conventional SSDG methods assume labeled and unlabeled data are available for
each source domain in the training set, a condition that is not always met in
practice. The coexistence of limited annotation and domain shift in the
training set is a prevalent issue. Thus, this paper explores a more practical
and challenging scenario, cross-domain semi-supervised domain generalization
(CD-SSDG), where domain shifts occur between labeled and unlabeled training
data, in addition to shifts between training and testing sets. Existing SSDG
methods exhibit sub-optimal performance under such domain shifts because of
inaccurate pseudolabels. To address this issue, we propose a novel
dual-supervised asymmetric co-training (DAC) framework tailored for CD-SSDG.
Building upon the co-training paradigm with two sub-models offering cross
pseudo supervision, our DAC framework integrates extra feature-level
supervision and asymmetric auxiliary tasks for each sub-model. This
feature-level supervision serves to address inaccurate pseudo supervision
caused by domain shifts between labeled and unlabeled data, utilizing
complementary supervision from the rich feature space. Additionally, two
distinct auxiliary self-supervised tasks are integrated into each sub-model to
enhance domain-invariant discriminative feature learning and prevent model
collapse. Extensive experiments on real-world medical image segmentation
datasets, i.e., Fundus, Polyp, and SCGM, demonstrate the robust
generalizability of the proposed DAC framework.

TL;DR: DEIMv2 extends the DEIM framework with DINOv3 features, creating a scalable object detection system that outperforms YOLO series across eight model sizes from X to Atto, achieving state-of-the-art performance with superior parameter efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To build upon the success of DEIM's Dense O2O and MAL framework by integrating DINOv3 features, creating a unified detection system that spans from GPU to mobile deployment while maintaining superior performance-cost trade-offs.

Method: For larger models (X, L, M, S): use DINOv3-pretrained backbones with Spatial Tuning Adapter (STA) to convert single-scale to multi-scale features. For ultra-lightweight models (Nano, Pico, Femto, Atto): employ HGNetv2 with depth/width pruning, simplified decoder, and upgraded Dense O2O.

Result: DEIMv2-X achieves 57.8 AP with 50.3M parameters (better than 56.5 AP with 60M+ parameters). DEIMv2-S is first sub-10M model (9.71M) to exceed 50 AP (50.9 AP). DEIMv2-Pico (1.5M parameters) delivers 38.5 AP, matching YOLOv10-Nano (2.3M) with 50% fewer parameters.

Conclusion: DEIMv2 establishes new state-of-the-art results across all model scales, demonstrating superior parameter efficiency and performance-cost trade-off, making it suitable for diverse deployment scenarios from GPU to mobile devices.

Abstract: Benefiting from the simplicity and effectiveness of Dense O2O and MAL, DEIM
has become the mainstream training framework for real-time DETRs, significantly
outperforming the YOLO series. In this work, we extend it with DINOv3 features,
resulting in DEIMv2. DEIMv2 spans eight model sizes from X to Atto, covering
GPU, edge, and mobile deployment. For the X, L, M, and S variants, we adopt
DINOv3-pretrained or distilled backbones and introduce a Spatial Tuning Adapter
(STA), which efficiently converts DINOv3's single-scale output into multi-scale
features and complements strong semantics with fine-grained details to enhance
detection. For ultra-lightweight models (Nano, Pico, Femto, and Atto), we
employ HGNetv2 with depth and width pruning to meet strict resource budgets.
Together with a simplified decoder and an upgraded Dense O2O, this unified
design enables DEIMv2 to achieve a superior performance-cost trade-off across
diverse scenarios, establishing new state-of-the-art results. Notably, our
largest model, DEIMv2-X, achieves 57.8 AP with only 50.3 million parameters,
surpassing prior X-scale models that require over 60 million parameters for
just 56.5 AP. On the compact side, DEIMv2-S is the first sub-10 million model
(9.71 million) to exceed the 50 AP milestone on COCO, reaching 50.9 AP. Even
the ultra-lightweight DEIMv2-Pico, with just 1.5 million parameters, delivers
38.5 AP, matching YOLOv10-Nano (2.3 million) with around 50 percent fewer
parameters.

Motivation: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are critical for safety-sensitive applications but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. CLIP, as a backbone for many VLMs, is a high-value target whose vulnerabilities can cascade across the multimodal AI ecosystem.

Method: Proposes Dynamic Adversarial Curriculum (DAC-LoRA) framework that uses an intelligent curriculum of progressively challenging attacks guided by First-Order Stationary Condition (FOSC) and TRADES-inspired loss. The method can be integrated into standard PEFT pipelines.

Result: DAC-LoRA achieves substantial improvements in adversarial robustness without significantly compromising clean accuracy. It provides an effective, lightweight, and broadly applicable solution.

Conclusion: The DAC-LoRA framework demonstrates that adversarial robustness can be effectively integrated into parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, offering a practical approach to secure Vision-Language Models in safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are foundational to critical applications like
autonomous driving, medical diagnosis, and content moderation. While
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA enable their efficient
adaptation to specialized tasks, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial
attacks that can compromise safety-critical decisions. CLIP, the backbone for
numerous downstream VLMs, is a high-value target whose vulnerabilities can
cascade across the multimodal AI ecosystem. We propose Dynamic Adversarial
Curriculum DAC-LoRA, a novel framework that integrates adversarial training
into PEFT. The core principle of our method i.e. an intelligent curriculum of
progressively challenging attack, is general and can potentially be applied to
any iterative attack method. Guided by the First-Order Stationary Condition
(FOSC) and a TRADES-inspired loss, DAC-LoRA achieves substantial improvements
in adversarial robustness without significantly compromising clean accuracy.
Our work presents an effective, lightweight, and broadly applicable method to
demonstrate that the DAC-LoRA framework can be easily integrated into a
standard PEFT pipeline to significantly enhance robustness.

*Jianhan Wu,Xiaoyang Qu,Zhangcheng Huang,Jianzong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedDSPG is a federated domain generalization method that generates domain-specific soft prompts from a generative perspective to handle unseen target domains, outperforming existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated domain generalization methods based on prompt learning have limited diversity and ignore information from unknown domains, posing challenges for downstream-task adaptation with domain shifts among clients.

Method: Proposes federated domain generalization with domain-specific soft prompts generation (FedDSPG), which introduces domain-specific soft prompts for each domain and integrates content and domain knowledge into a generative model among clients, then uses the generator to obtain prompts for unseen domains during inference.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations across several public datasets confirm that the method outperforms existing strong baselines in federated domain generalization, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: FedDSPG provides an effective generative approach for federated domain generalization by generating domain-specific soft prompts, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing prompt learning methods in handling unknown domains.

Abstract: Prompt learning has become an efficient paradigm for adapting CLIP to
downstream tasks. Compared with traditional fine-tuning, prompt learning
optimizes a few parameters yet yields highly competitive results, especially
appealing in federated learning for computational efficiency. engendering
domain shift among clients and posing a formidable challenge for
downstream-task adaptation. Existing federated domain generalization (FDG)
methods based on prompt learning typically learn soft prompts from training
samples, replacing manually designed prompts to enhance the generalization
ability of federated models. However, these learned prompts exhibit limited
diversity and tend to ignore information from unknown domains. We propose a
novel and effective method from a generative perspective for handling FDG
tasks, namely federated domain generalization with domain-specific soft prompts
generation (FedDSPG). Specifically, during training, we introduce
domain-specific soft prompts (DSPs) for each domain and integrate content and
domain knowledge into the generative model among clients. In the inference
phase, the generator is utilized to obtain DSPs for unseen target domains, thus
guiding downstream tasks in unknown domains. Comprehensive evaluations across
several public datasets confirm that our method outperforms existing strong
baselines in FDG, achieving state-of-the-art results.

TL;DR: LumbarCLIP is a multimodal framework that uses contrastive language-image pretraining to align lumbar spine MRI scans with radiological reports, achieving state-of-the-art performance in medical image classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low back pain affects millions worldwide, creating a need for robust diagnostic models that can analyze both medical images and accompanying text reports jointly.

Abstract: Low back pain affects millions worldwide, driving the need for robust
diagnostic models that can jointly analyze complex medical images and
accompanying text reports. We present LumbarCLIP, a novel multimodal framework
that leverages contrastive language-image pretraining to align lumbar spine MRI
scans with corresponding radiological descriptions. Built upon a curated
dataset containing axial MRI views paired with expert-written reports,
LumbarCLIP integrates vision encoders (ResNet-50, Vision Transformer, Swin
Transformer) with a BERT-based text encoder to extract dense representations.
These are projected into a shared embedding space via learnable projection
heads, configurable as linear or non-linear, and normalized to facilitate
stable contrastive training using a soft CLIP loss. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance on downstream classification, reaching up to
95.00% accuracy and 94.75% F1-score on the test set, despite inherent class

*Yuxin Cao,Wei Song,Jingling Xue,Jin Song Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PoisonVID is a black-box poisoning attack that compromises prompt-guided sampling in VideoLLMs by using closed-loop optimization to suppress harmful frame relevance scores, achieving 82-99% attack success rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While vulnerabilities have been identified in earlier frame sampling strategies for VideoLLMs, the safety of the latest prompt-guided sampling approach remains unexplored.

Method: PoisonVID uses a closed-loop optimization strategy that iteratively optimizes a universal perturbation to suppress harmful frame relevance scores, guided by a depiction set constructed from paraphrased harmful descriptions using a shadow VideoLLM and GPT-4o-mini.

Result: The attack achieves 82% - 99% success rate across three prompt-guided sampling strategies and three advanced VideoLLMs.

Conclusion: The high success rate highlights the importance of developing more secure advanced sampling strategies for VideoLLMs in the future.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
understanding videos, supporting tasks such as summarization, captioning, and
question answering. Their performance has been driven by advances in frame
sampling, progressing from uniform-based to semantic-similarity-based and, most
recently, prompt-guided strategies. While vulnerabilities have been identified
in earlier sampling strategies, the safety of prompt-guided sampling remains
unexplored. We close this gap by presenting PoisonVID, the first black-box
poisoning attack that undermines prompt-guided sampling in VideoLLMs. PoisonVID
compromises the underlying prompt-guided sampling mechanism through a
closed-loop optimization strategy that iteratively optimizes a universal
perturbation to suppress harmful frame relevance scores, guided by a depiction
set constructed from paraphrased harmful descriptions leveraging a shadow
VideoLLM and a lightweight language model, i.e., GPT-4o-mini. Comprehensively
evaluated on three prompt-guided sampling strategies and across three advanced
VideoLLMs, PoisonVID achieves 82% - 99% attack success rate, highlighting the
importance of developing future advanced sampling strategies for VideoLLMs.

TL;DR: GoR is a novel learnable regularization method that adaptively balances task-specific and knowledge distillation losses in quantization-aware training, improving performance of small quantized models across various AI tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing QAT-KD methods struggle to balance task-specific and distillation losses due to heterogeneous gradient magnitudes, especially under low-bit quantization, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: Proposes Game of Regularizer (GoR) using only two trainable parameters for dynamic loss weighting, and introduces QAT-EKD-GoR ensemble distillation framework with multiple heterogeneous teacher models.

Result: GoR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art QAT-KD methods on image classification, object detection, and LLM compression, delivering faster inference on edge devices while maintaining full-precision accuracy.

Conclusion: GoR provides a robust solution for real-world deployment, with EKD-GoR potentially outperforming full-precision models under optimal conditions.

Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) combined with knowledge distillation (KD)
is a promising strategy for compressing Artificial Intelligence (AI) models for
deployment on resource-constrained hardware. However, existing QAT-KD methods
often struggle to balance task-specific (TS) and distillation losses due to
heterogeneous gradient magnitudes, especially under low-bit quantization. We
propose Game of Regularizer (GoR), a novel learnable regularization method that
adaptively balances TS and KD objectives using only two trainable parameters
for dynamic loss weighting. GoR reduces conflict between supervision signals,
improves convergence, and boosts the performance of small quantized models
(SQMs). Experiments on image classification, object detection (OD), and large
language model (LLM) compression show that GoR consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art QAT-KD methods. On low-power edge devices, it delivers faster
inference while maintaining full-precision accuracy. We also introduce
QAT-EKD-GoR, an ensemble distillation framework that uses multiple
heterogeneous teacher models. Under optimal conditions, the proposed EKD-GoR
can outperform full-precision models, providing a robust solution for
real-world deployment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The LifeCLEF 2017 plant identification challenge compared web-collected noisy training data vs expert-verified smaller datasets for automated plant identification across 10,000 species using 1.1M images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether large-scale web-collected training datasets with labeling errors can compete with smaller, expert-verified datasets for plant identification, addressing the challenge of limited expert-curated botanical imagery.

Method: Used two training strategies: (1) large noisy dataset from web sources (blogs, hosting sites, retailers) and (2) smaller trusted dataset from expert-checked sources. Tested on data from Pl@ntNet mobile application as independent validation.

Result: The challenge provided comparative evaluation of both training approaches, with participating research groups developing various systems to address the plant identification task across continental-scale flora.

Conclusion: The study demonstrated the feasibility of using web-scale noisy data for automated plant identification systems, highlighting the trade-offs between data quantity and quality in large-scale biodiversity informatics.

Abstract: The 2017-th edition of the LifeCLEF plant identification challenge is an
important milestone towards automated plant identification systems working at
the scale of continental floras with 10.000 plant species living mainly in
Europe and North America illustrated by a total of 1.1M images. Nowadays, such
ambitious systems are enabled thanks to the conjunction of the dazzling recent
progress in image classification with deep learning and several outstanding
international initiatives, such as the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL), aggregating
the visual knowledge on plant species coming from the main national botany
institutes. However, despite all these efforts the majority of the plant
species still remain without pictures or are poorly illustrated. Outside the
institutional channels, a much larger number of plant pictures are available
and spread on the web through botanist blogs, plant lovers web-pages, image
hosting websites and on-line plant retailers. The LifeCLEF 2017 plant challenge
presented in this paper aimed at evaluating to what extent a large noisy
training dataset collected through the web and containing a lot of labelling
errors can compete with a smaller but trusted training dataset checked by
experts. To fairly compare both training strategies, the test dataset was
created from a third data source, i.e. the Pl@ntNet mobile application that
collects millions of plant image queries all over the world. This paper
presents more precisely the resources and assessments of the challenge,
summarizes the approaches and systems employed by the participating research
groups, and provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

*Xiaonan Hu,Xuebing Li,Jinyu Xu,Abdulkadir Duran Adan,Letian Zhou,Xuhui Zhu,Yanan Li,Wei Guo,Shouyang Liu,Wenzhong Liu,Hao Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TasselNetV4 is a vision foundation model for cross-species plant counting that combines local counting with extract-and-match paradigm, achieving superior performance and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art class-agnostic counting models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional plant counting models are species-specific, but plant biodiversity and new cultivars make it impossible to build all species-dependent models. Current class-agnostic counting models perform poorly on plants due to their dynamic, non-rigid nature that changes with time and space.

Method: TasselNetV4 inherits TasselNet's local counting approach and marries it with the extract-and-match paradigm from class-agnostic counting. It uses a plain vision transformer with novel multi-branch box-aware local counters to enhance cross-scale robustness.

Result: Extensive experiments on PAC-105 and PAC-Somalia datasets show TasselNetV4 achieves superior counting performance and high efficiency compared to state-of-the-art CAC models.

Conclusion: TasselNetV4 emerges as a vision foundation model capable of cross-scene, cross-scale, and cross-species plant counting, shifting from species-specific to general plant counting approaches.

Abstract: Accurate plant counting provides valuable information for agriculture such as
crop yield prediction, plant density assessment, and phenotype quantification.
Vision-based approaches are currently the mainstream solution. Prior art
typically uses a detection or a regression model to count a specific plant.
However, plants have biodiversity, and new cultivars are increasingly bred each
year. It is almost impossible to exhaust and build all species-dependent
counting models. Inspired by class-agnostic counting (CAC) in computer vision,
we argue that it is time to rethink the problem formulation of plant counting,
from what plants to count to how to count plants. In contrast to most daily
objects with spatial and temporal invariance, plants are dynamic, changing with
time and space. Their non-rigid structure often leads to worse performance than
counting rigid instances like heads and cars such that current CAC and
open-world detection models are suboptimal to count plants. In this work, we
inherit the vein of the TasselNet plant counting model and introduce a new
extension, TasselNetV4, shifting from species-specific counting to
cross-species counting. TasselNetV4 marries the local counting idea of
TasselNet with the extract-and-match paradigm in CAC. It builds upon a plain
vision transformer and incorporates novel multi-branch box-aware local counters
used to enhance cross-scale robustness. Two challenging datasets, PAC-105 and
PAC-Somalia, are harvested. Extensive experiments against state-of-the-art CAC
models show that TasselNetV4 achieves not only superior counting performance
but also high efficiency.Our results indicate that TasselNetV4 emerges to be a
vision foundation model for cross-scene, cross-scale, and cross-species plant
counting.

TL;DR: A novel semi-supervised model for retinal OCT segmentation that introduces a differentiable biomarker topology engine to enforce anatomically correct segmentation of layers and lesions, improving performance while ensuring topological correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semi-supervised learning methods for retinal OCT segmentation often produce anatomically implausible results, fail to model layer-lesion interactions effectively, and lack guarantees on topological correctness.

Method: Proposes a semi-supervised model with a fully differentiable biomarker topology engine that enables joint learning with bidirectional influence between layers and lesions. Uses disentangled representation separating spatial and style factors, and enforces lesion locations relative to segmented layers.

Result: Outperforms current state-of-the-art in both lesion and layer segmentation on public and internal OCT datasets, demonstrating ability to generalize layer segmentation to pathological cases using partially annotated data.

Conclusion: The approach shows potential for using anatomical constraints in semi-supervised learning to achieve accurate, robust, and trustworthy retinal biomarker segmentation.

Abstract: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is widely used for diagnosing and
monitoring retinal diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
The segmentation of biomarkers such as layers and lesions is essential for
patient diagnosis and follow-up. Recently, semi-supervised learning has shown
promise in improving retinal segmentation performance. However, existing
methods often produce anatomically implausible segmentations, fail to
effectively model layer-lesion interactions, and lack guarantees on topological
correctness.
  To address these limitations, we propose a novel semi-supervised model that
introduces a fully differentiable biomarker topology engine to enforce
anatomically correct segmentation of lesions and layers. This enables joint
learning with bidirectional influence between layers and lesions, leveraging
unlabeled and diverse partially labeled datasets. Our model learns a
disentangled representation, separating spatial and style factors. This
approach enables more realistic layer segmentations and improves lesion
segmentation, while strictly enforcing lesion location in their anatomically
plausible positions relative to the segmented layers.
  We evaluate the proposed model on public and internal datasets of OCT scans
and show that it outperforms the current state-of-the-art in both lesion and
layer segmentation, while demonstrating the ability to generalize layer
segmentation to pathological cases using partially annotated training data. Our
results demonstrate the potential of using anatomical constraints in
semi-supervised learning for accurate, robust, and trustworthy retinal
biomarker segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop plant identification methods that work in real-world biodiversity monitoring scenarios where systems must be robust to unknown species not present in the training data.

Method: Used a dataset of over 110,000 images covering 1000 plant species from West Europe, collected through participatory sensing since 2011. The challenge was framed as an open-set recognition problem requiring systems to classify known species while rejecting unknown ones.

Result: The challenge evaluated various approaches from participating research groups for large-scale plant identification with open-set recognition capabilities.

Conclusion: The overview provided analysis of the challenge outcomes, highlighting the importance of open-set recognition for practical biodiversity monitoring applications where unknown species are frequently encountered.

Abstract: The LifeCLEF plant identification challenge aims at evaluating plant
identification methods and systems at a very large scale, close to the
conditions of a real-world biodiversity monitoring scenario. The 2016-th
edition was actually conducted on a set of more than 110K images illustrating
1000 plant species living in West Europe, built through a large-scale
participatory sensing platform initiated in 2011 and which now involves tens of
thousands of contributors. The main novelty over the previous years is that the
identification task was evaluated as an open-set recognition problem, i.e. a
problem in which the recognition system has to be robust to unknown and never
seen categories. Beyond the brute-force classification across the known classes
of the training set, the big challenge was thus to automatically reject the
false positive classification hits that are caused by the unknown classes. This
overview presents more precisely the resources and assessments of the
challenge, summarizes the approaches and systems employed by the participating
research groups, and provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCRA-VQA is a method that improves Knowledge-Based VQA by using summarized and reordered captions to help LLMs better understand images and questions, achieving state-of-the-art results without expensive training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods use LLMs with noisy image captions that contain irrelevant information, and LLMs don't properly understand VQA tasks, limiting their reasoning capabilities.

Method: Uses pre-trained visual language model to generate captions, then summarizes and reorders them to exclude unrelated information, creating contextual examples to enhance LLM understanding.

Result: Achieved 38.8% accuracy on OK-VQA and 34.6% on A-OKVQA using a 6.7B parameter LLM, demonstrating excellent performance without end-to-end training.

Conclusion: The caption-rerank process significantly improves LLMs' ability to understand image information and questions, enhancing reasoning capability and task adaptability in KB-VQA.

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality knowledge is a central focus in Knowledge-Based Visual
Question Answering (KB-VQA). Recent methods use large language models (LLMs) as
knowledge engines for answering. These methods generally employ image captions
as visual text descriptions to assist LLMs in interpreting images. However, the
captions frequently include excessive noise irrelevant to the question, and
LLMs generally do not comprehend VQA tasks, limiting their reasoning
capabilities. To address this issue, we propose the Summarized Caption-Rerank
Augmented VQA (SCRA-VQA), which employs a pre-trained visual language model to
convert images into captions. Moreover, SCRA-VQA generates contextual examples
for the captions while simultaneously summarizing and reordering them to
exclude unrelated information. The caption-rerank process enables LLMs to
understand the image information and questions better, thus enhancing the
model's reasoning ability and task adaptability without expensive end-to-end
training. Based on an LLM with 6.7B parameters, SCRA-VQA performs excellently
on two challenging knowledge-based VQA datasets: OK-VQA and A-OKVQA, achieving
accuracies of 38.8% and 34.6%. Our code is available at

*Jiabei Zhang,Qi Wang,Siyu Wu,Du Chen,Tianhe Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper reveals an asymmetry between perceptual optimization and image quality assessment (IQA) - fidelity metrics that work well for IQA don't necessarily work for optimization, especially under adversarial training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The correlation between optimization objectives' effectiveness and their capability as IQA metrics remains underexplored, despite their central role in perceptual optimization.

Method: Systematic analysis comparing fidelity metrics and adversarial objectives for both perceptual optimization and IQA, examining discriminator design and transferability.

Result: Fidelity metrics that excel in IQA are not effective for perceptual optimization, with misalignment more distinct under adversarial training. Discriminator design (patch-level and convolutional architectures) plays decisive role in optimization quality.

Conclusion: The findings advance understanding of loss function design and IQA transferability, paving way for more principled approaches to perceptual optimization.

Abstract: Perceptual optimization is primarily driven by the fidelity objective, which
enforces both semantic consistency and overall visual realism, while the
adversarial objective provides complementary refinement by enhancing perceptual
sharpness and fine-grained detail. Despite their central role, the correlation
between their effectiveness as optimization objectives and their capability as
image quality assessment (IQA) metrics remains underexplored. In this work, we
conduct a systematic analysis and reveal an unanticipated asymmetry between
perceptual optimization and assessment: fidelity metrics that excel in IQA are
not necessarily effective for perceptual optimization, with this misalignment
emerging more distinctly under adversarial training. In addition, while
discriminators effectively suppress artifacts during optimization, their
learned representations offer only limited benefits when reused as backbone
initializations for IQA models. Beyond this asymmetry, our findings further
demonstrate that discriminator design plays a decisive role in shaping
optimization, with patch-level and convolutional architectures providing more
faithful detail reconstruction than vanilla or Transformer-based alternatives.
These insights advance the understanding of loss function design and its
connection to IQA transferability, paving the way for more principled
approaches to perceptual optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VQA models struggle with biases from training data, leading to over-reliance on superficial patterns and poor generalization to diverse questions and images.

Method: The model uses Object Interaction Self-Attention to capture complex interactions between objects, and GAN-Based Debiasing to generate unbiased data distributions for learning robust features.

Result: Extensive experiments on VQA-CP v1 and VQA-CP v2 datasets show excellent performance compared to existing methods, particularly in handling biased and imbalanced data distributions.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the importance of addressing both object interactions and dataset biases for advancing VQA tasks, demonstrating that IOG-VQA effectively combines visual and textual information to overcome inherent biases.

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) presents a unique challenge by requiring
models to understand and reason about visual content to answer questions
accurately. Existing VQA models often struggle with biases introduced by the
training data, leading to over-reliance on superficial patterns and inadequate
generalization to diverse questions and images. This paper presents a novel
model, IOG-VQA, which integrates Object Interaction Self-Attention and
GAN-Based Debiasing to enhance VQA model performance. The self-attention
mechanism allows our model to capture complex interactions between objects
within an image, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the visual
context. Meanwhile, the GAN-based debiasing framework generates unbiased data
distributions, helping the model to learn more robust and generalizable
features. By leveraging these two components, IOG-VQA effectively combines
visual and textual information to address the inherent biases in VQA datasets.
Extensive experiments on the VQA-CP v1 and VQA-CP v2 datasets demonstrate that
our model shows excellent performance compared with the existing methods,
particularly in handling biased and imbalanced data distributions highlighting

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional robust principal component analysis (RPCA) methods fail to capture the rich variability in real video data due to their sparsity assumption, particularly in handling structured noise and background artifacts that obscure dynamic content.

Method: Proposes Nuclear Diffusion, which integrates low-rank temporal modeling with diffusion posterior sampling to better handle video noise and artifacts.

Result: Evaluated on cardiac ultrasound dehazing, the method demonstrates improved performance in contrast enhancement (gCNR) and signal preservation (KS statistic) compared to traditional RPCA.

Conclusion: Combining model-based temporal models with deep generative priors shows strong potential for high-fidelity video restoration applications.

Abstract: Video sequences often contain structured noise and background artifacts that
obscure dynamic content, posing challenges for accurate analysis and
restoration. Robust principal component methods address this by decomposing
data into low-rank and sparse components. Still, the sparsity assumption often
fails to capture the rich variability present in real video data. To overcome
this limitation, a hybrid framework that integrates low-rank temporal modeling
with diffusion posterior sampling is proposed. The proposed method, Nuclear
Diffusion, is evaluated on a real-world medical imaging problem, namely cardiac
ultrasound dehazing, and demonstrates improved dehazing performance compared to
traditional RPCA concerning contrast enhancement (gCNR) and signal preservation
(KS statistic). These results highlight the potential of combining model-based
temporal models with deep generative priors for high-fidelity video
restoration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing realism of synthetic images from advanced models like VAEs, GANs, and LDMs creates challenges for detection, requiring methods to identify subtle generation artifacts.

Method: Uses local pixel dependencies based on Markov Random Fields to reconstruct images and expose texture/edge inconsistencies. Proposes FerretNet, a 1.1M parameter network trained on ProGAN dataset.

Result: Achieves 97.1% average accuracy on open-world benchmark with 22 generative models, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 10.6%.

Conclusion: FerretNet provides efficient and robust synthetic image detection by leveraging generation artifacts, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse generative models.

Abstract: The increasing realism of synthetic images generated by advanced models such
as VAEs, GANs, and LDMs poses significant challenges for synthetic image
detection. To address this issue, we explore two artifact types introduced
during the generation process: (1) latent distribution deviations and (2)
decoding-induced smoothing effects, which manifest as inconsistencies in local
textures, edges, and color transitions. Leveraging local pixel dependencies
(LPD) properties rooted in Markov Random Fields, we reconstruct synthetic
images using neighboring pixel information to expose disruptions in texture
continuity and edge coherence. Building upon LPD, we propose FerretNet, a
lightweight neural network with only 1.1M parameters that delivers efficient
and robust synthetic image detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FerretNet, trained exclusively on the 4-class ProGAN dataset, achieves an
average accuracy of 97.1% on an open-world benchmark comprising across 22
generative models, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by 10.6%.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending interpretable concept-based models from static images to video data is challenging due to temporal dependencies essential for capturing actions and events in sequences.

Method: MoTIF is a transformer-inspired architecture that adapts concept bottleneck framework for video classification, handling sequences of arbitrary length and capturing recurring semantic concepts (motifs) across time.

Result: The concept-based modeling paradigm can be effectively transferred to video data, enabling better understanding of concept contributions in temporal contexts while maintaining competitive performance.

Conclusion: MoTIF successfully extends interpretable concept modeling to video classification, providing three complementary interpretability perspectives (global, local, temporal) for analyzing video actions and events.

Abstract: Conceptual models such as Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have driven
substantial progress in improving interpretability for image classification by
leveraging human-interpretable concepts. However, extending these models from
static images to sequences of images, such as video data, introduces a
significant challenge due to the temporal dependencies inherent in videos,
which are essential for capturing actions and events. In this work, we
introduce MoTIF (Moving Temporal Interpretable Framework), an architectural
design inspired by a transformer that adapts the concept bottleneck framework
for video classification and handles sequences of arbitrary length. Within the
video domain, concepts refer to semantic entities such as objects, attributes,
or higher-level components (e.g., 'bow', 'mount', 'shoot') that reoccur across
time - forming motifs collectively describing and explaining actions. Our
design explicitly enables three complementary perspectives: global concept
importance across the entire video, local concept relevance within specific
windows, and temporal dependencies of a concept over time. Our results
demonstrate that the concept-based modeling paradigm can be effectively
transferred to video data, enabling a better understanding of concept
contributions in temporal contexts while maintaining competitive performance.

*Julius Pesonen,Arno Solin,Eija Honkavaara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Particle filter-based 3D object localization using camera sequences for drone-based wildfire monitoring, overcoming limitations of traditional depth estimation methods in resource-constrained scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3D object localization methods like dense depth estimation or 3D scene reconstruction fail for distant objects or in computationally limited environments, particularly in safety-critical applications like drone-based wildfire monitoring.

Method: Proposes using particle filters for 3D object localization with camera pose estimates and image segments, tested in both single and multiple target scenarios using 3D simulation and drone-based image segmentation sequences with GNSS camera pose data.

Result: The particle filter successfully solved practical localization tasks where other methods failed, demonstrating flexibility across different detection methods and applicability to drone-based wildfire monitoring with existing segmentation models.

Conclusion: Particle filters provide an effective solution for 3D object localization in resource-constrained scenarios, particularly suitable for drone-based surveillance tasks like wildfire monitoring, offering independence from specific detection methods.

Abstract: 3D object localisation based on a sequence of camera measurements is
essential for safety-critical surveillance tasks, such as drone-based wildfire
monitoring. Localisation of objects detected with a camera can typically be
solved with dense depth estimation or 3D scene reconstruction. However, in the
context of distant objects or tasks limited by the amount of available
computational resources, neither solution is feasible. In this paper, we show
that the task can be solved using particle filters for both single and multiple
target scenarios. The method was studied using a 3D simulation and a
drone-based image segmentation sequence with global navigation satellite system
(GNSS)-based camera pose estimates. The results showed that a particle filter
can be used to solve practical localisation tasks based on camera poses and
image segments in these situations where other solutions fail. The particle
filter is independent of the detection method, making it flexible for new
tasks. The study also demonstrates that drone-based wildfire monitoring can be
conducted using the proposed method paired with a pre-existing image
segmentation model.

*Qinfeng Zhu,Han Li,Liang He,Lei Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SwinMamba is a novel framework that combines Vision Mamba's global receptive field with Swin Transformer's local window attention to improve semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery by capturing both local details and global context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Mamba has limitations in capturing local features like textures and edges that are crucial for accurate remote sensing segmentation, despite its global receptive field and computational efficiency.

Method: SwinMamba integrates localized Mamba-style scanning within shifted windows (first two stages for local details) with global scanning (last two stages for contextual fusion), using overlapping shifted windows to enhance inter-region information exchange.

Result: Extensive experiments on LoveDA and ISPRS Potsdam datasets show SwinMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods in semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery.

Conclusion: SwinMamba demonstrates superior effectiveness as a solution for semantic segmentation of remotely sensed imagery by effectively balancing local and global feature perception.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery is a fundamental task in
computer vision, supporting a wide range of applications such as land use
classification, urban planning, and environmental monitoring. However, this
task is often challenged by the high spatial resolution, complex scene
structures, and diverse object scales present in remote sensing data. To
address these challenges, various deep learning architectures have been
proposed, including convolutional neural networks, Vision Transformers, and the
recently introduced Vision Mamba. Vision Mamba features a global receptive
field and low computational complexity, demonstrating both efficiency and
effectiveness in image segmentation. However, its reliance on global scanning
tends to overlook critical local features, such as textures and edges, which
are essential for achieving accurate segmentation in remote sensing contexts.
To tackle this limitation, we propose SwinMamba, a novel framework inspired by
the Swin Transformer. SwinMamba integrates localized Mamba-style scanning
within shifted windows with a global receptive field, to enhance the model's
perception of both local and global features. Specifically, the first two
stages of SwinMamba perform local scanning to capture fine-grained details,
while its subsequent two stages leverage global scanning to fuse broader
contextual information. In our model, the use of overlapping shifted windows
enhances inter-region information exchange, facilitating more robust feature
integration across the entire image. Extensive experiments on the LoveDA and
ISPRS Potsdam datasets demonstrate that SwinMamba outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, underscoring its effectiveness and potential as a superior solution
for semantic segmentation of remotely sensed imagery.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PackMIL is a pack-based multiple instance learning framework that addresses computational pathology challenges by packing variable-length feature sequences into fixed-length ones for efficient batched training, with residual branches and attention-driven downsampling to preserve data heterogeneity and reduce redundancy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Whole slide images (WSIs) in computational pathology have extreme sequence length variations (200-200K), high data heterogeneity, redundancy, and limited supervision, which conventional methods struggle to handle efficiently while preserving data characteristics.

Method: Proposes a pack-based MIL framework that packs sampled variable-length feature sequences into fixed-length ones for batched training. Includes a residual branch that composes discarded features into hyperslides with tailored labels, and an attention-driven downsampler to compress features and reduce redundancy.

Result: Achieves up to 8% accuracy improvement while using only 12% of the training time in PANDA(UNI) benchmark. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant potential for addressing data challenges in computational pathology.

Conclusion: Focusing on data challenges in computational pathology holds significant potential in the foundation model era. The proposed PackMIL framework effectively addresses sequence length variations, data heterogeneity, and limited supervision while improving efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Computational pathology (CPath) digitizes pathology slides into whole slide
images (WSIs), enabling analysis for critical healthcare tasks such as cancer
diagnosis and prognosis. However, WSIs possess extremely long sequence lengths
(up to 200K), significant length variations (from 200 to 200K), and limited
supervision. These extreme variations in sequence length lead to high data
heterogeneity and redundancy. Conventional methods often compromise on training
efficiency and optimization to preserve such heterogeneity under limited
supervision. To comprehensively address these challenges, we propose a
pack-based MIL framework. It packs multiple sampled, variable-length feature
sequences into fixed-length ones, enabling batched training while preserving
data heterogeneity. Moreover, we introduce a residual branch that composes
discarded features from multiple slides into a hyperslide which is trained with
tailored labels. It offers multi-slide supervision while mitigating feature
loss from sampling. Meanwhile, an attention-driven downsampler is introduced to
compress features in both branches to reduce redundancy. By alleviating these
challenges, our approach achieves an accuracy improvement of up to 8% while
using only 12% of the training time in the PANDA(UNI). Extensive experiments
demonstrate that focusing data challenges in CPath holds significant potential
in the era of foundation models. The code is

*Akihisa Watanabe,Jiawei Ren,Li Siyao,Yichen Peng,Erwin Wu,Edgar Simo-Serra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SimDiff is a Simulator-constrained Diffusion Model that generates physically plausible human motion by integrating environment parameters directly into the denoising process, eliminating the need for computationally expensive simulator calls during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for generating physically plausible human motion use simulator-based motion projection layers that are computationally expensive due to their sequential nature, preventing parallelization and efficient inference.

Method: The paper proposes SimDiff, which interprets simulator-based motion projection as guidance within the diffusion process and conditions the denoising process directly on environment parameters (e.g., gravity, wind) to generate physically plausible motions without repeated simulator calls.

Result: SimDiff generates physically plausible motions efficiently without simulator calls at inference, provides fine-grained control over physical coefficients, and demonstrates compositional generalization to unseen combinations of environmental parameters.

Conclusion: By integrating environment parameters directly into the diffusion process, SimDiff achieves efficient and controllable generation of physically plausible human motion while maintaining the ability to generalize to new environmental conditions.

Abstract: Generating physically plausible human motion is crucial for applications such
as character animation and virtual reality. Existing approaches often
incorporate a simulator-based motion projection layer to the diffusion process
to enforce physical plausibility. However, such methods are computationally
expensive due to the sequential nature of the simulator, which prevents
parallelization. We show that simulator-based motion projection can be
interpreted as a form of guidance, either classifier-based or classifier-free,
within the diffusion process. Building on this insight, we propose SimDiff, a
Simulator-constrained Diffusion Model that integrates environment parameters
(e.g., gravity, wind) directly into the denoising process. By conditioning on
these parameters, SimDiff generates physically plausible motions efficiently,
without repeated simulator calls at inference, and also provides fine-grained
control over different physical coefficients. Moreover, SimDiff successfully
generalizes to unseen combinations of environmental parameters, demonstrating
compositional generalization.

*Bum Jun Kim,Makoto Kawano,Yusuke Iwasawa,Yutaka Matsuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper identifies four key architectural design patterns that improve vision model robustness to Gaussian noise: larger stem kernels, smaller input resolutions, average pooling, and supervised ViTs over CLIP ViTs, with theoretical explanations for each mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While vision model robustness is often measured, the specific architectural design choices that contribute to robustness are rarely analyzed. The paper aims to understand why certain architectures are inherently more robust and convert these insights into actionable design rules.

Method: Extensive evaluation of 1,174 pretrained vision models to identify robust design patterns, followed by theoretical analysis including proofs about low-pass stem kernels, anti-aliased downsampling, pooling mechanisms, and pixel-space Lipschitz bounds for CLIP ViTs.

Result: Identified four design patterns that yield up to 506 rank improvements and 21.6% accuracy gains against Gaussian noise. Theoretically proved that larger stem kernels attenuate noise quadratically, average pooling suppresses noise better than max pooling, and CLIP ViTs are more vulnerable due to smaller normalization standard deviations.

Conclusion: The research disentangles robustness into interpretable modules, provides theoretical explanations for observed trends, and offers practical plug-and-play guidelines for designing more robust vision models against Gaussian noise.

Abstract: While the robustness of vision models is often measured, their dependence on
specific architectural design choices is rarely dissected. We investigate why
certain vision architectures are inherently more robust to additive Gaussian
noise and convert these empirical insights into simple, actionable design
rules. Specifically, we performed extensive evaluations on 1,174 pretrained
vision models, empirically identifying four consistent design patterns for
improved robustness against Gaussian noise: larger stem kernels, smaller input
resolutions, average pooling, and supervised vision transformers (ViTs) rather
than CLIP ViTs, which yield up to 506 rank improvements and 21.6\%p accuracy
gains. We then develop a theoretical analysis that explains these findings,
converting observed correlations into causal mechanisms. First, we prove that
low-pass stem kernels attenuate noise with a gain that decreases quadratically
with kernel size and that anti-aliased downsampling reduces noise energy
roughly in proportion to the square of the downsampling factor. Second, we
demonstrate that average pooling is unbiased and suppresses noise in proportion
to the pooling window area, whereas max pooling incurs a positive bias that
grows slowly with window size and yields a relatively higher mean-squared error
and greater worst-case sensitivity. Third, we reveal and explain the
vulnerability of CLIP ViTs via a pixel-space Lipschitz bound: The smaller
normalization standard deviations used in CLIP preprocessing amplify worst-case
sensitivity by up to 1.91 times relative to the Inception-style preprocessing
common in supervised ViTs. Our results collectively disentangle robustness into
interpretable modules, provide a theory that explains the observed trends, and
build practical, plug-and-play guidelines for designing vision models more
robust against Gaussian noise.

Methodological advancements show specialized foundation models now significantly outperform generalist models in surgical contexts.

Conclusion: Surgical scene graphs are maturing into an essential semantic bridge that enables intelligent systems for improving surgical safety, efficiency, and training, despite ongoing challenges in data annotation and real-time implementation.

Abstract: Scene graphs (SGs) provide structured relational representations crucial for
decoding complex, dynamic surgical environments. This PRISMA-ScR-guided scoping
review systematically maps the evolving landscape of SG research in surgery,
charting its applications, methodological advancements, and future directions.
Our analysis reveals rapid growth, yet uncovers a critical 'data divide':
internal-view research (e.g., triplet recognition) almost exclusively uses
real-world 2D video, while external-view 4D modeling relies heavily on
simulated data, exposing a key translational research gap. Methodologically,
the field has advanced from foundational graph neural networks to specialized
foundation models that now significantly outperform generalist large

as a cornerstone technology for both analysis, such as workflow recognition and
automated safety monitoring, and generative tasks like controllable surgical

Motivation: To address the challenge of extracting insights from lengthy (30-40 minute) multimodal financial advisory content on social media, making financial advisory content more accessible and actionable.

Method: Uses BLIP for semantic visual descriptions, OCR for textual patterns, Whisper-based transcription with speaker diarization, modified DPO-based loss function with fact-checking, and ranker-based retrieval for keyframe alignment.

Result: Comprehensive cross-domain experiments confirm FASTER's strong performance, robustness, and generalizability compared to LLMs and VLMs.

Conclusion: FASTER establishes a new standard for multimodal summarization and opens new avenues for research, with the Fin-APT dataset (470 financial advisory videos) addressing data scarcity in multimodal financial research.

Abstract: The dynamic propagation of social media has broadened the reach of financial
advisory content through podcast videos, yet extracting insights from lengthy,
multimodal segments (30-40 minutes) remains challenging. We introduce FASTER
(Financial Advisory Summariser with Textual Embedded Relevant images), a
modular framework that tackles three key challenges: (1) extracting
modality-specific features, (2) producing optimized, concise summaries, and (3)
aligning visual keyframes with associated textual points. FASTER employs BLIP
for semantic visual descriptions, OCR for textual patterns, and Whisper-based
transcription with Speaker diarization as BOS features. A modified Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO)-based loss function, equipped with BOS-specific
fact-checking, ensures precision, relevance, and factual consistency against
the human-aligned summary. A ranker-based retrieval mechanism further aligns
keyframes with summarized content, enhancing interpretability and cross-modal
coherence. To acknowledge data resource scarcity, we introduce Fin-APT, a
dataset comprising 470 publicly accessible financial advisory pep-talk videos
for robust multimodal research. Comprehensive cross-domain experiments confirm
FASTER's strong performance, robustness, and generalizability when compared to
Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By establishing

TL;DR: ASD is an adaptor that enables cold-start SSL learners for deep image clustering without pretraining or prerequisites, achieving near-ground-truth performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SSL-integrated deep clustering methods require pretraining, clustering learning, or trained models as prerequisites, limiting flexible out-of-box application.

Method: Randomly sample pseudo-labeled data, use instance-level classifier to learn them, track class transitions to extract similarities, assign cluster-level labels, and trigger SSL learner for clustering.

Result: Superior performance across benchmarks against latest deep image clustering methods, with only 1.33% gap on CIFAR-10 compared to SSL using ground-truth labels.

Conclusion: ASD enables effective cold-start SSL for image clustering without prerequisites and can boost existing SSL-embedded clustering methods.

Abstract: Recently, some works integrate SSL techniques into deep clustering frameworks
to enhance image clustering performance. However, they all need pretraining,
clustering learning, or a trained clustering model as prerequisites, limiting
the flexible and out-of-box application of SSL learners in the image clustering
task. This work introduces ASD, an adaptor that enables the cold-start of SSL
learners for deep image clustering without any prerequisites. Specifically, we
first randomly sample pseudo-labeled data from all unlabeled data, and set an
instance-level classifier to learn them with semantically aligned
instance-level labels. With the ability of instance-level classification, we
track the class transitions of predictions on unlabeled data to extract
high-level similarities of instance-level classes, which can be utilized to
assign cluster-level labels to pseudo-labeled data. Finally, we use the
pseudo-labeled data with assigned cluster-level labels to trigger a general SSL
learner trained on the unlabeled data for image clustering. We show the
superior performance of ASD across various benchmarks against the latest deep
image clustering approaches and very slight accuracy gaps compared to SSL
methods using ground-truth, e.g., only 1.33% on CIFAR-10. Moreover, ASD can
also further boost the performance of existing SSL-embedded deep image
clustering methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SiNGER is a novel distillation framework that suppresses high-norm artifacts in Vision Transformers while preserving informative signals during knowledge distillation, improving student model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers produce high-norm artifacts that degrade representation quality. When these features are transferred to students via knowledge distillation, artifacts dominate the objective, causing students to overfit to artifacts and underweight informative signals.

Method: Singular Nullspace-Guided Energy Reallocation (SiNGER) uses principled teacher feature refinement with nullspace-guided perturbation to preserve information while suppressing artifacts. Implemented efficiently with a LoRA-based adapter requiring minimal structural modification.

Result: Extensive experiments show SiNGER consistently improves student models, achieving state-of-the-art performance in multiple downstream tasks and producing clearer, more interpretable representations.

Conclusion: SiNGER effectively addresses the trade-off between artifact suppression and signal preservation in knowledge distillation, enabling better transfer of knowledge from teacher to student models.

Abstract: Vision Transformers are widely adopted as the backbone of vision foundation
models, but they are known to produce high-norm artifacts that degrade
representation quality. When knowledge distillation transfers these features to
students, high-norm artifacts dominate the objective, so students overfit to
artifacts and underweight informative signals, diminishing the gains from
larger models. Prior work attempted to remove artifacts but encountered an
inherent trade-off between artifact suppression and preserving informative
signals from teachers. To address this, we introduce Singular Nullspace-Guided
Energy Reallocation (SiNGER), a novel distillation framework that suppresses
artifacts while preserving informative signals. The key idea is principled
teacher feature refinement: during refinement, we leverage the nullspace-guided
perturbation to preserve information while suppressing artifacts. Then, the
refined teacher's features are distilled to a student. We implement this
perturbation efficiently with a LoRA-based adapter that requires minimal
structural modification. Extensive experiments show that \oursname consistently
improves student models, achieving state-of-the-art performance in multiple
downstream tasks and producing clearer and more interpretable representations.

TL;DR: SNCE is a novel method for precise harmful concept erasure in text-to-image models by manipulating only a single neuron, achieving surgical precision while preserving image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image models pose safety risks by generating harmful content, and existing concept erasure methods struggle with precise removal while maintaining image quality.

Method: Train a Sparse Autoencoder to map text embeddings into a sparse latent space, identify harmful concept-specific neurons using modulated frequency scoring, and suppress activations of those neurons.

Result: SNCE achieves state-of-the-art results in target concept erasure while preserving generation capabilities for non-target concepts, with strong robustness against adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: The proposed SNCE method enables precise and effective concept erasure with minimal disruption to image quality, significantly outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Text-to-image models exhibit remarkable capabilities in image generation.
However, they also pose safety risks of generating harmful content. A key
challenge of existing concept erasure methods is the precise removal of target
concepts while minimizing degradation of image quality. In this paper, we
propose Single Neuron-based Concept Erasure (SNCE), a novel approach that can
precisely prevent harmful content generation by manipulating only a single
neuron. Specifically, we train a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to map text
embeddings into a sparse, disentangled latent space, where individual neurons
align tightly with atomic semantic concepts. To accurately locate neurons
responsible for harmful concepts, we design a novel neuron identification
method based on the modulated frequency scoring of activation patterns. By
suppressing activations of the harmful concept-specific neuron, SNCE achieves
surgical precision in concept erasure with minimal disruption to image quality.
Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that SNCE achieves
state-of-the-art results in target concept erasure, while preserving the
model's generation capabilities for non-target concepts. Additionally, our
method exhibits strong robustness against adversarial attacks, significantly
outperforming existing methods.

TL;DR: KD-SS is a lightweight sub-sampling algorithm for plant point clouds that enables full-resolution segmentation without down-sampling, working across different plant species and sensor modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing plant point cloud segmentation methods are problem-specific, require extensive pre-processing and down-sampling, and are limited to certain plant species or sensor types.

Method: Proposes KD-SS algorithm for biological point cloud sub-sampling that is sensor-agnostic and species-agnostic, allowing segmentation of full-resolution point clouds without down-sampling.

Result: KD-SS combined with state-of-the-art segmentation models achieves satisfying results across different modalities (photogrammetry, laser triangulation, LiDAR) for various plant species.

Conclusion: KD-SS serves as a lightweight, resolution-retaining alternative to intensive pre-processing and down-sampling methods for plant organ segmentation, regardless of species and sensor modality.

Abstract: Accurate point cloud segmentation for plant organs is crucial for 3D plant
phenotyping. Existing solutions are designed problem-specific with a focus on
certain plant species or specified sensor-modalities for data acquisition.
Furthermore, it is common to use extensive pre-processing and down-sample the
plant point clouds to meet hardware or neural network input size requirements.
We propose a simple, yet effective algorithm KDSS for sub-sampling of
biological point clouds that is agnostic to sensor data and plant species. The
main benefit of this approach is that we do not need to down-sample our input
data and thus, enable segmentation of the full-resolution point cloud.
Combining KD-SS with current state-of-the-art segmentation models shows
satisfying results evaluated on different modalities such as photogrammetry,
laser triangulation and LiDAR for various plant species. We propose KD-SS as
lightweight resolution-retaining alternative to intensive pre-processing and
down-sampling methods for plant organ segmentation regardless of used species
and sensor modality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mambo is a new FG-BG decomposition framework for few-shot out-of-distribution detection that addresses limitations of previous methods by learning background prompts and using patch self-calibrated tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FG-BG decomposition methods suffer from low robustness due to over-reliance on local class similarity and fixed background patch extraction strategies.

Method: Proposes learning background prompts to obtain local background similarity containing both background and image semantic information, then refines it using local class similarity. Uses patch self-calibrated tuning to flexibly select background patches based on sample diversity.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show Mambo achieves state-of-the-art performance in OOD detection and near OOD detection settings.

Conclusion: Mambo effectively addresses the limitations of previous methods and demonstrates superior performance in FS-OOD detection tasks.

Abstract: Existing foreground-background (FG-BG) decomposition methods for the few-shot
out-of-distribution (FS-OOD) detection often suffer from low robustness due to
over-reliance on the local class similarity and a fixed background patch
extraction strategy. To address these challenges, we propose a new FG-BG
decomposition framework, namely Mambo, for FS-OOD detection. Specifically, we
propose to first learn a background prompt to obtain the local background
similarity containing both the background and image semantic information, and
then refine the local background similarity using the local class similarity.
As a result, we use both the refined local background similarity and the local
class similarity to conduct background extraction, reducing the dependence of
the local class similarity in previous methods. Furthermore, we propose the
patch self-calibrated tuning to consider the sample diversity to flexibly
select numbers of background patches for different samples, and thus exploring
the issue of fixed background extraction strategies in previous methods.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed
Mambo achieves the best performance, compared to SOTA methods in terms of OOD
detection and near OOD detection setting. The source code will be released at

*Naga Venkata Sai Jitin Jami,Thomas Altstidl,Jonas Mueller,Jindong Li,Dario Zanca,Bjoern Eskofier,Heike Leutheuser*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Iterative Pixel Stratification (IPS) and Wasserstein-Driven Evolutionary Stratification (WDES) to address dataset splitting bias in image segmentation, proving WDES is globally optimal and showing it produces more representative splits with lower performance variance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Random dataset splitting in image segmentation leads to unrepresentative test sets, biased evaluations, and poor model generalization. While stratified sampling works for classification, extending it to segmentation is challenging due to multi-label structure and class imbalance.

Method: Two methods: 1) Iterative Pixel Stratification (IPS) - a label-aware sampling method for segmentation tasks; 2) Wasserstein-Driven Evolutionary Stratification (WDES) - a genetic algorithm that minimizes Wasserstein distance to optimize label distribution similarity across dataset splits.

Result: WDES consistently produces more representative splits than random sampling, leading to lower performance variance and improved model evaluation across diverse segmentation tasks (street scenes, medical imaging, satellite imagery). WDES is particularly valuable for small, imbalanced, and low-diversity datasets.

Conclusion: WDES is a globally optimal method for dataset stratification in segmentation tasks that effectively addresses bias in conventional splitting strategies, especially for challenging datasets with class imbalance and limited diversity.

Abstract: Random splitting of datasets in image segmentation often leads to
unrepresentative test sets, resulting in biased evaluations and poor model
generalization. While stratified sampling has proven effective for addressing
label distribution imbalance in classification tasks, extending these ideas to
segmentation remains challenging due to the multi-label structure and class
imbalance typically present in such data. Building on existing stratification
concepts, we introduce Iterative Pixel Stratification (IPS), a straightforward,
label-aware sampling method tailored for segmentation tasks. Additionally, we
present Wasserstein-Driven Evolutionary Stratification (WDES), a novel genetic
algorithm designed to minimize the Wasserstein distance, thereby optimizing the
similarity of label distributions across dataset splits. We prove that WDES is
globally optimal given enough generations. Using newly proposed statistical
heterogeneity metrics, we evaluate both methods against random sampling and
find that WDES consistently produces more representative splits. Applying WDES
across diverse segmentation tasks, including street scenes, medical imaging,
and satellite imagery, leads to lower performance variance and improved model
evaluation. Our results also highlight the particular value of WDES in handling
small, imbalanced, and low-diversity datasets, where conventional splitting
strategies are most prone to bias.

*Riccardo La Grassa,Ignazio Gallo,Nicola Landro*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EnGraf-Net is a fine-grained classification model that uses semantic associations structured as a taxonomy as supervised signals in an end-to-end deep neural network, achieving competitive performance without requiring cropping techniques or manual annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fine-grained classification models rely on part annotations or automatic cropping methods, which suffer from incomplete representation of local features. The authors propose leveraging semantic associations through taxonomy to better distinguish similar objects, similar to how humans recognize objects.

Method: The paper introduces EnGraf-Net, an end-to-end deep neural network that uses semantic associations structured as a hierarchy (taxonomy) as supervised signals. The model does not require part annotations, bounding boxes, or cropping techniques.

Result: Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, CUB-200-2011, and FGVC-Aircraft datasets demonstrate EnGraf-Net's superiority over many existing fine-grained models, showing competitive performance with state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: EnGraf-Net effectively leverages semantic taxonomy as supervised signals for fine-grained classification, achieving strong performance without the need for manual annotations or cropping techniques, providing a more holistic approach to distinguishing highly similar classes.

Abstract: Fine-grained classification models are designed to focus on the relevant
details necessary to distinguish highly similar classes, particularly when
intra-class variance is high and inter-class variance is low. Most existing
models rely on part annotations such as bounding boxes, part locations, or
textual attributes to enhance classification performance, while others employ
sophisticated techniques to automatically extract attention maps. We posit that
part-based approaches, including automatic cropping methods, suffer from an
incomplete representation of local features, which are fundamental for
distinguishing similar objects. While fine-grained classification aims to
recognize the leaves of a hierarchical structure, humans recognize objects by
also forming semantic associations. In this paper, we leverage semantic
associations structured as a hierarchy (taxonomy) as supervised signals within
an end-to-end deep neural network model, termed EnGraf-Net. Extensive
experiments on three well-known datasets CIFAR-100, CUB-200-2011, and
FGVC-Aircraft demonstrate the superiority of EnGraf-Net over many existing
fine-grained models, showing competitive performance with the most recent
state-of-the-art approaches, without requiring cropping techniques or manual
annotations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision Transformers (ViTs) show varying vulnerability to adversarial patch attacks, with success rates ranging from 40.04% to 99.97% across different models, confirming transferability of CNN attack techniques to ViT architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the security vulnerabilities of Vision Transformers against evasion attacks, particularly adversarial patches, and examine the transferability of attack techniques from CNNs to ViTs.

Method: Used Creases Transformation (CT) technique to create realistic adversarial patches with geometric distortions, tested on four fine-tuned ViT models for binary person classification tasks.

Result: Significant vulnerability variations observed: 40.04% success on google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k, 99.97% on facebook/dino-vitb16, 66.40% on google/vit-base-patch16-224, and 65.17% on facebook/dinov3-vitb16.

Conclusion: Adversarial patches can successfully transfer from CNNs to ViTs, with pre-training dataset scale and methodology strongly influencing model resilience to attacks.

Abstract: The increasing reliance on machine learning systems has made their security a
critical concern. Evasion attacks enable adversaries to manipulate the
decision-making processes of AI systems, potentially causing security breaches
or misclassification of targets. Vision Transformers (ViTs) have gained
significant traction in modern machine learning due to increased 1) performance
compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and 2) robustness against
adversarial perturbations. However, ViTs remain vulnerable to evasion attacks,
particularly to adversarial patches, unique patterns designed to manipulate AI
classification systems. These vulnerabilities are investigated by designing
realistic adversarial patches to cause misclassification in person vs.
non-person classification tasks using the Creases Transformation (CT)
technique, which adds subtle geometric distortions similar to those occurring
naturally when wearing clothing. This study investigates the transferability of
adversarial attack techniques used in CNNs when applied to ViT classification
models. Experimental evaluation across four fine-tuned ViT models on a binary
person classification task reveals significant vulnerability variations: attack
success rates ranged from 40.04% (google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k) to 99.97%
(facebook/dino-vitb16), with google/vit-base-patch16-224 achieving 66.40% and
facebook/dinov3-vitb16 reaching 65.17%. These results confirm the
cross-architectural transferability of adversarial patches from CNNs to ViTs,
with pre-training dataset scale and methodology strongly influencing model
resilience to adversarial attacks.

TL;DR: UniTransfer is a novel architecture for precise video concept transfer using spatial and diffusion timestep decomposition with a progressive paradigm, achieving superior control and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve precise and controllable video concept transfer by decomposing videos into key components (foreground, background, motion) and diffusion timesteps for fine-grained control.

Method: Uses spatial decomposition into foreground, background, and motion flow; dual-to-single-stream DiT-based architecture; self-supervised pretraining with random masking; Chain-of-Prompt mechanism for timestep decomposition; and LLM-guided progressive generation.

Result: Extensive experiments show high-quality, controllable video concept transfer across diverse references, surpassing baselines in visual fidelity and editability.

Conclusion: UniTransfer effectively achieves precise video concept transfer through innovative decomposition strategies and progressive guidance, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: We propose a novel architecture UniTransfer, which introduces both spatial
and diffusion timestep decomposition in a progressive paradigm, achieving
precise and controllable video concept transfer. Specifically, in terms of
spatial decomposition, we decouple videos into three key components: the
foreground subject, the background, and the motion flow. Building upon this
decomposed formulation, we further introduce a dual-to-single-stream DiT-based
architecture for supporting fine-grained control over different components in
the videos. We also introduce a self-supervised pretraining strategy based on
random masking to enhance the decomposed representation learning from
large-scale unlabeled video data. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought reasoning
paradigm, we further revisit the denoising diffusion process and propose a
Chain-of-Prompt (CoP) mechanism to achieve the timestep decomposition. We
decompose the denoising process into three stages of different granularity and
leverage large language models (LLMs) for stage-specific instructions to guide
the generation progressively. We also curate an animal-centric video dataset
called OpenAnimal to facilitate the advancement and benchmarking of research in
video concept transfer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
achieves high-quality and controllable video concept transfer across diverse
reference images and scenes, surpassing existing baselines in both visual
fidelity and editability. Web Page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VTTS enhances MLLMs' reasoning via iterative perception during inference, mimicking human hierarchical attention by progressively refining focus on high-confidence regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods leverage LLM reasoning on static perception stages, limiting multimodal understanding. VTTS addresses this by enabling iterative perception to achieve human-level perception.

Method: Visual Test-Time Scaling (VTTS) uses Iterative Perception (ITP) mechanism with reinforcement learning and spatio-temporal supervision. Includes VTTS-80K dataset for iterative perception training.

Result: Videochat-R1.5 model achieved average 5%+ improvement over Qwen2.5VL baselines across 15+ benchmarks covering video conversation, reasoning, and spatio-temporal perception.

Conclusion: VTTS effectively enhances MLLM reasoning through iterative perception, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse multimodal tasks.

Abstract: Inducing reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is critical
for achieving human-level perception and understanding. Existing methods mainly
leverage LLM reasoning to analyze parsed visuals, often limited by static
perception stages. This paper introduces Visual Test-Time Scaling (VTTS), a
novel approach to enhance MLLMs' reasoning via iterative perception during
inference. VTTS mimics humans' hierarchical attention by progressively refining
focus on high-confidence spatio-temporal regions, guided by updated textual
predictions. Specifically, VTTS employs an Iterative Perception (ITP)
mechanism, incorporating reinforcement learning with spatio-temporal
supervision to optimize reasoning. To support this paradigm, we also present
VTTS-80K, a dataset tailored for iterative perception. These designs allows a
MLLM to enhance its performance by increasing its perceptual compute. Extensive
experiments validate VTTS's effectiveness and generalization across diverse
tasks and benchmarks. Our newly introduced Videochat-R1.5 model has achieved
remarkable improvements, with an average increase of over 5\%, compared to
robust baselines such as Qwen2.5VL-3B and -7B, across more than 15 benchmarks
that encompass video conversation, video reasoning, and spatio-temporal
perception.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mammo-CLIP Dissect is a concept-based explainability framework that uses a mammography-specific vision-language model to analyze what deep learning models learn in mammography, revealing how domain-specific training and fine-tuning affect concept learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding what DL models learn is crucial for safe AI deployment in clinical settings. While previous work focused on pixel-based methods, this paper addresses the gap in analyzing textual concepts that better reflect clinical reasoning.

Method: Leverages Mammo-CLIP (a mammography-specific vision-language model) as a "dissector" to label neurons with human-interpretable textual concepts and quantify their alignment with domain knowledge. Analyzes three key questions about concept learning differences between models.

Result: Models trained on mammography data capture more clinically relevant concepts and align better with radiologists' workflows. Fine-tuning enhances certain concept categories (benign calcifications) but reduces others (density features), showing a trade-off between specialization and generalization.

Conclusion: Mammo-CLIP Dissect provides insights into how CNNs capture mammography-specific knowledge, revealing how domain-specific training and task adaptation shape concept learning. The framework helps understand model behavior for safer clinical AI deployment.

Abstract: Understanding what deep learning (DL) models learn is essential for the safe
deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) in clinical settings. While previous
work has focused on pixel-based explainability methods, less attention has been
paid to the textual concepts learned by these models, which may better reflect
the reasoning used by clinicians. We introduce Mammo-CLIP Dissect, the first
concept-based explainability framework for systematically dissecting DL vision
models trained for mammography. Leveraging a mammography-specific
vision-language model (Mammo-CLIP) as a "dissector," our approach labels
neurons at specified layers with human-interpretable textual concepts and
quantifies their alignment to domain knowledge. Using Mammo-CLIP Dissect, we
investigate three key questions: (1) how concept learning differs between DL
vision models trained on general image datasets versus mammography-specific
datasets; (2) how fine-tuning for downstream mammography tasks affects concept
specialisation; and (3) which mammography-relevant concepts remain
underrepresented. We show that models trained on mammography data capture more
clinically relevant concepts and align more closely with radiologists'
workflows than models not trained on mammography data. Fine-tuning for
task-specific classification enhances the capture of certain concept categories
(e.g., benign calcifications) but can reduce coverage of others (e.g.,
density-related features), indicating a trade-off between specialisation and
generalisation. Our findings show that Mammo-CLIP Dissect provides insights
into how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) capture mammography-specific
knowledge. By comparing models across training data and fine-tuning regimes, we
reveal how domain-specific training and task-specific adaptation shape concept
learning. Code and concept set are available:

TL;DR: MOSS-ChatV is a reinforcement learning framework with DTW-based process reward that addresses process inconsistency in video reasoning by aligning reasoning traces with temporal dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs exhibit process inconsistency where intermediate reasoning drifts from video dynamics even with correct final answers, undermining interpretability and robustness.

Method: Introduces MOSS-ChatV using reinforcement learning with Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)-based process reward to align reasoning traces with temporally grounded references, and constructs MOSS-Video benchmark with annotated reasoning traces.

Result: Achieves 87.2% on MOSS-Video test, improves performance on MVBench and MMVU, and shows consistent gains across different architectures (Qwen2.5-VL, Phi-2) with more consistent reasoning traces.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses process inconsistency in video reasoning and demonstrates broad applicability across different model architectures.

Abstract: Video reasoning has emerged as a critical capability for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), requiring models to move beyond static perception
toward coherent understanding of temporal dynamics in complex scenes. Yet
existing MLLMs often exhibit process inconsistency, where intermediate
reasoning drifts from video dynamics even when the final answer is correct,
undermining interpretability and robustness. To address this issue, we
introduce MOSS-ChatV, a reinforcement learning framework with a Dynamic Time
Warping (DTW)-based process reward. This rule-based reward aligns reasoning
traces with temporally grounded references, enabling efficient process
supervision without auxiliary reward models. We further identify dynamic state
prediction as a key measure of video reasoning and construct MOSS-Video, a
benchmark with annotated reasoning traces, where the training split is used to
fine-tune MOSS-ChatV and the held-out split is reserved for evaluation.
MOSS-ChatV achieves 87.2\% on MOSS-Video (test) and improves performance on
general video benchmarks such as MVBench and MMVU. The framework consistently
yields gains across different architectures, including Qwen2.5-VL and Phi-2,
confirming its broad applicability. Evaluations with GPT-4o-as-judge further
show that MOSS-ChatV produces more consistent and stable reasoning traces.

TL;DR: A novel approach for video generation guided by camera trajectories that integrates both camera and object motions by converting them into pixel motion, using stable diffusion and image-to-video networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods learn camera and object motions separately, which causes confusion about relative motion between camera and objects, leading to inconsistent video generation.

Method: Proposes converting both camera and object motions into pixel motion, using stable diffusion to learn reference motion maps relative to camera trajectory, then feeding these maps with semantic object prior into image-to-video network.

Result: Extensive experiments show the model outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin in generating videos that accurately follow camera trajectories while maintaining consistent object motions.

Conclusion: The integrated approach successfully addresses the challenge of relative motion confusion and achieves superior performance in camera-trajectory-guided video generation.

Abstract: Generating videos guided by camera trajectories poses significant challenges
in achieving consistency and generalizability, particularly when both camera
and object motions are present. Existing approaches often attempt to learn
these motions separately, which may lead to confusion regarding the relative
motion between the camera and the objects. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel approach that integrates both camera and object motions by
converting them into the motion of corresponding pixels. Utilizing a stable
diffusion network, we effectively learn reference motion maps in relation to
the specified camera trajectory. These maps, along with an extracted semantic
object prior, are then fed into an image-to-video network to generate the
desired video that can accurately follow the designated camera trajectory while
maintaining consistent object motions. Extensive experiments verify that our
model outperforms SOTA methods by a large margin.

TL;DR: This paper analyzes conditions where discriminators are most disadvantaged in detecting synthetic images, focusing on data dimensionality and complexity. It shows that both very simple and highly complex datasets reduce detectability, while intermediate-complexity datasets are most favorable for detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid progress of image generative AI has blurred boundaries between synthetic and real images, creating an arms race between generators and discriminators. The research aims to understand when discriminators are most disadvantaged in this competition.

Method: The study analyzes two key factors: data dimensionality and data complexity. Using Kolmogorov complexity as a measure of intrinsic dataset structure, the researchers examine how different levels of complexity affect the detectability of synthetic images.

Result: Both very simple and highly complex datasets reduce the detectability of synthetic images. Generators can learn simple datasets almost perfectly, while extreme diversity masks imperfections. Intermediate-complexity datasets create the most favorable conditions for detection.

Conclusion: Intermediate-complexity datasets provide the best conditions for discriminators to detect synthetic images, as generators fail to fully capture the distribution and their errors remain visible, unlike in very simple or highly complex datasets.

Abstract: The rapid progress of image generative AI has blurred the boundary between
synthetic and real images, fueling an arms race between generators and
discriminators. This paper investigates the conditions under which
discriminators are most disadvantaged in this competition. We analyze two key
factors: data dimensionality and data complexity. While increased
dimensionality often strengthens the discriminators ability to detect subtle
inconsistencies, complexity introduces a more nuanced effect. Using Kolmogorov
complexity as a measure of intrinsic dataset structure, we show that both very
simple and highly complex datasets reduce the detectability of synthetic
images; generators can learn simple datasets almost perfectly, whereas extreme
diversity masks imperfections. In contrast, intermediate-complexity datasets
create the most favorable conditions for detection, as generators fail to fully

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a single model that can process images at multiple resolutions efficiently, reducing computational costs while maintaining competitive accuracy in zero-shot classification.

Method: Replaces standard patch embeddings with multi-level wavelet decomposition, uses key-value caching and causal cross-level attention for computation reuse, and implements confidence-based gating for adaptive early exits.

Result: Achieves competitive accuracy with significant computational savings through lightweight distillation from a frozen CLIP teacher.

Conclusion: WAVECLIP provides an effective solution for adaptive resolution inference in vision-language models, enabling dynamic compute-accuracy optimization with a single deployed model.

Abstract: We introduce WAVECLIP, a single unified model for adaptive resolution
inference in CLIP, enabled by wavelet-based tokenization. WAVECLIP replaces
standard patch embeddings with a multi-level wavelet decomposition, enabling
the model to process images coarse to fine while naturally supporting multiple
resolutions within the same model. At inference time, the model begins with low
resolution tokens and refines only when needed, using key-value caching and
causal cross-level attention to reuse computation, effectively introducing to
the model only new information when needed. We evaluate WAVECLIP in zero-shot
classification, demonstrating that a simple confidence-based gating mechanism
enables adaptive early exits. This allows users to dynamically choose a
compute-accuracy trade-off using a single deployed model. Our approach requires
only lightweight distillation from a frozen CLIP teacher and achieves
competitive accuracy with significant computational savings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Quantization of CLIP models can improve calibration for underconfident models and enhance OOD detection, with specific QAT methods achieving simultaneous gains in accuracy, calibration, and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the impact of quantization on CLIP models beyond accuracy, focusing on reliability metrics like calibration and OOD detection, which are crucial for efficient and reliable deployment.

Method: Large-scale evaluation of quantization on CLIP models, assessing in-distribution accuracy, calibration, and OOD robustness, including the use of quantization-aware training (QAT) methods.

Result: Quantization improves calibration for underconfident models but may degrade it for overconfident ones; OOD detection can still improve despite calibration issues. Specific QAT methods yield gains in accuracy, calibration, and robustness simultaneously.

Conclusion: Quantization offers benefits beyond efficiency, enabling more reliable and robust deployment of VLMs by addressing multi-objective challenges in accuracy, calibration, and OOD detection.

Abstract: The powerful zero-shot generalization capabilities of vision-language models
(VLMs) like CLIP have enabled new paradigms for safety-related tasks such as
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. However, additional aspects crucial for
the computationally efficient and reliable deployment of CLIP are still
overlooked. In particular, the impact of quantization on CLIP's performance
beyond accuracy remains underexplored. This work presents a large-scale
evaluation of quantization on CLIP models, assessing not only in-distribution
accuracy but a comprehensive suite of reliability metrics and revealing
counterintuitive results driven by pre-training source. We demonstrate that
quantization consistently improves calibration for typically underconfident
pre-trained models, while often degrading it for overconfident variants.
Intriguingly, this degradation in calibration does not preclude gains in other
reliability metrics; we find that OOD detection can still improve for these
same poorly calibrated models. Furthermore, we identify specific
quantization-aware training (QAT) methods that yield simultaneous gains in
zero-shot accuracy, calibration, and OOD robustness, challenging the view of a
strict efficiency-performance trade-off. These findings offer critical insights
for navigating the multi-objective problem of deploying efficient, reliable,
and robust VLMs by utilizing quantization beyond its conventional role.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VTU benchmarks use synthetic renderings lacking real-world complexity, and existing datasets offer fixed examples without access to underlying data for reformulation.

Method: Created TABLET dataset with 4M examples from 2M unique tables (88% preserving original visualizations), including paired image-HTML representations, metadata, and provenance information linking to source datasets.

Result: Fine-tuning vision-language models like Qwen2.5-VL-7B on TABLET improves performance on both seen and unseen VTU tasks while increasing robustness on real-world table visualizations.

Conclusion: TABLET establishes a foundation for robust training and extensible evaluation of future VTU models by preserving original visualizations and maintaining example traceability in a unified large-scale collection.

Abstract: While table understanding increasingly relies on pixel-only settings where
tables are processed as visual representations, current benchmarks
predominantly use synthetic renderings that lack the complexity and visual
diversity of real-world tables. Additionally, existing visual table
understanding (VTU) datasets offer fixed examples with single visualizations
and pre-defined instructions, providing no access to underlying serialized data
for reformulation. We introduce TABLET, a large-scale VTU dataset with 4
million examples across 20 tasks, grounded in 2 million unique tables where 88%
preserve original visualizations. Each example includes paired image-HTML
representations, comprehensive metadata, and provenance information linking
back to the source datasets. Fine-tuning vision-language models like
Qwen2.5-VL-7B on TABLET improves performance on seen and unseen VTU tasks while
increasing robustness on real-world table visualizations. By preserving
original visualizations and maintaining example traceability in a unified

### [69] [Learning Conformal Explainers for Image Classifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21209)
*Amr Alkhatib,Stephanie Lowry*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A conformal prediction-based approach for controlling explanation fidelity in feature attribution methods, identifying salient feature subsets that preserve model predictions without requiring ground-truth explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Feature attribution methods vary in robustness and may not faithfully reflect the underlying black-box model's reasoning, requiring better fidelity control in explanations.

Method: Proposes four conformity functions to quantify explanation fidelity, identifies salient feature subsets sufficient to preserve predictions regardless of excluded features, without needing ground-truth explanations for calibration.

Result: FastSHAP consistently outperforms competing methods in fidelity and informational efficiency (explanation region size), with super-pixel-based conformity measures proving more effective than pixel-wise ones across five explainers and six image datasets.

Conclusion: The conformal prediction approach successfully enables direct control over explanation fidelity, with FastSHAP emerging as the most effective method and super-pixel measures showing superior performance.

Abstract: Feature attribution methods are widely used for explaining image-based
predictions, as they provide feature-level insights that can be intuitively
visualized. However, such explanations often vary in their robustness and may
fail to faithfully reflect the reasoning of the underlying black-box model. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel conformal prediction-based
approach that enables users to directly control the fidelity of the generated
explanations. The method identifies a subset of salient features that is
sufficient to preserve the model's prediction, regardless of the information
carried by the excluded features, and without demanding access to ground-truth
explanations for calibration. Four conformity functions are proposed to
quantify the extent to which explanations conform to the model's predictions.
The approach is empirically evaluated using five explainers across six image
datasets. The empirical results demonstrate that FastSHAP consistently
outperforms the competing methods in terms of both fidelity and informational
efficiency, the latter measured by the size of the explanation regions.
Furthermore, the results reveal that conformity measures based on super-pixels
are more effective than their pixel-wise counterparts.

### [70] [Sigma: Semantically Informative Pre-training for Skeleton-based Sign Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21223)
*Muxin Pu,Mei Kuan Lim,Chun Yong Chong,Chen Change Loy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sigma is a unified skeleton-based sign language understanding framework that addresses semantic grounding, local-global balance, and cross-modal learning challenges through sign-aware early fusion, hierarchical alignment, and multi-task pre-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current skeleton-based SLU methods face three key limitations: weak semantic grounding (struggling to relate motion patterns to linguistic meaning), imbalance between local details and global context, and inefficient cross-modal learning for semantically aligned representations.

Method: Sigma proposes: 1) sign-aware early fusion for deep visual-textual interaction, 2) hierarchical alignment learning to maximize agreements across different feature levels, and 3) unified pre-training combining contrastive learning, text matching, and language modeling.

Result: Sigma achieves state-of-the-art results on isolated sign language recognition, continuous sign language recognition, and gloss-free sign language translation across multiple benchmarks spanning different sign and spoken languages.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the impact of semantically informative pre-training and the effectiveness of skeletal data as a stand-alone solution for SLU, showing robust performance across various sign language understanding tasks.

Abstract: Pre-training has proven effective for learning transferable features in sign
language understanding (SLU) tasks. Recently, skeleton-based methods have
gained increasing attention because they can robustly handle variations in
subjects and backgrounds without being affected by appearance or environmental
factors. Current SLU methods continue to face three key limitations: 1) weak
semantic grounding, as models often capture low-level motion patterns from
skeletal data but struggle to relate them to linguistic meaning; 2) imbalance
between local details and global context, with models either focusing too
narrowly on fine-grained cues or overlooking them for broader context; and 3)
inefficient cross-modal learning, as constructing semantically aligned
representations across modalities remains difficult. To address these, we
propose Sigma, a unified skeleton-based SLU framework featuring: 1) a
sign-aware early fusion mechanism that facilitates deep interaction between
visual and textual modalities, enriching visual features with linguistic
context; 2) a hierarchical alignment learning strategy that jointly maximises
agreements across different levels of paired features from different
modalities, effectively capturing both fine-grained details and high-level
semantic relationships; and 3) a unified pre-training framework that combines
contrastive learning, text matching and language modelling to promote semantic
consistency and generalisation. Sigma achieves new state-of-the-art results on
isolated sign language recognition, continuous sign language recognition, and
gloss-free sign language translation on multiple benchmarks spanning different
sign and spoken languages, demonstrating the impact of semantically informative
pre-training and the effectiveness of skeletal data as a stand-alone solution
for SLU.

*Seyed Amir Kasaei,Ali Aghayari,Arash Marioriyad,Niki Sepasian,MohammadAmin Fazli,Mahdieh Soleymani Baghshah,Mohammad Hossein Rohban*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a comprehensive study evaluating how well automated metrics for compositional text-image generation align with human judgments, finding that no single metric performs consistently across different types of compositional problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation in text-image generation relies heavily on automated metrics that are often adopted by convention rather than being validated against human judgment, making it critical to understand how well these metrics reflect human preferences.

Method: The authors conducted a broad study examining widely used metrics for compositional text-image evaluation, analyzing their behavior across diverse compositional challenges and comparing how different metric families align with human judgments.

Result: Results show that no single metric performs consistently across tasks - performance varies with the type of compositional problem. VQA-based metrics are not uniformly superior, while certain embedding-based metrics prove stronger in specific cases. Image-only metrics contribute little to compositional evaluation.

Conclusion: The findings underscore the importance of careful and transparent metric selection for trustworthy evaluation and their use as reward models in generation, highlighting that metric choice should be tailored to specific compositional challenges.

Abstract: Text-image generation has advanced rapidly, but assessing whether outputs
truly capture the objects, attributes, and relations described in prompts
remains a central challenge. Evaluation in this space relies heavily on
automated metrics, yet these are often adopted by convention or popularity
rather than validated against human judgment. Because evaluation and reported
progress in the field depend directly on these metrics, it is critical to
understand how well they reflect human preferences. To address this, we present
a broad study of widely used metrics for compositional text-image evaluation.
Our analysis goes beyond simple correlation, examining their behavior across
diverse compositional challenges and comparing how different metric families
align with human judgments. The results show that no single metric performs
consistently across tasks: performance varies with the type of compositional
problem. Notably, VQA-based metrics, though popular, are not uniformly
superior, while certain embedding-based metrics prove stronger in specific
cases. Image-only metrics, as expected, contribute little to compositional
evaluation, as they are designed for perceptual quality rather than alignment.
These findings underscore the importance of careful and transparent metric
selection, both for trustworthy evaluation and for their use as reward models
in generation. Project page is available at

*Shakib Khan,Fariba Dambandkhameneh,Nazim Shaikh,Yao Nie,Raghavan Venugopal,Xiao Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SlideMamba integrates Mamba architecture with Graph Neural Networks using entropy-based adaptive fusion for enhanced whole slide image analysis, achieving superior performance in predicting gene fusion/mutation status compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a generalizable deep learning framework that captures both local spatial relationships and long-range contextual dependencies in whole slide images for improved computational pathology analysis.

Method: Combines Mamba modules for long-range global dependencies and GNNs for fine-grained spatial interactions, with an entropy-based confidence weighting mechanism for adaptive fusion of complementary signals.

Result: Achieves PRAUC of 0.751 ± 0.05, outperforming MIL (0.491), Trans-MIL (0.39), Mamba-only (0.664), GNN-only (0.748), and GAT-Mamba (0.703), with competitive ROC AUC (0.738), sensitivity (0.662), and specificity (0.725).

Conclusion: The integrated architecture with entropy-based adaptive fusion demonstrates strong performance and promising potential for spatially-resolved predictive modeling in computational pathology.

Abstract: Advances in computational pathology increasingly rely on extracting
meaningful representations from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) to support various
clinical and biological tasks. In this study, we propose a generalizable deep
learning framework that integrates the Mamba architecture with Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) for enhanced WSI analysis. Our method is designed to capture
both local spatial relationships and long-range contextual dependencies,
offering a flexible architecture for digital pathology analysis. Mamba modules
excels in capturing long-range global dependencies, while GNNs emphasize
fine-grained short-range spatial interactions. To effectively combine these
complementary signals, we introduce an adaptive fusion strategy that uses an
entropy-based confidence weighting mechanism. This approach dynamically
balances contributions from both branches by assigning higher weight to the
branch with more confident (lower-entropy) predictions, depending on the
contextual importance of local versus global information for different
downstream tasks. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on a
representative task: predicting gene fusion and mutation status from WSIs. Our
framework, SlideMamba, achieves an area under the precision recall curve
(PRAUC) of 0.751 \pm 0.05, outperforming MIL (0.491 \pm 0.042), Trans-MIL (0.39
\pm 0.017), Mamba-only (0.664 \pm 0.063), GNN-only (0.748 \pm 0.091), and a
prior similar work GAT-Mamba (0.703 \pm 0.075). SlideMamba also achieves
competitive results across ROC AUC (0.738 \pm 0.055), sensitivity (0.662 \pm
0.083), and specificity (0.725 \pm 0.094). These results highlight the strength
of the integrated architecture, enhanced by the proposed entropy-based adaptive
fusion strategy, and suggest promising potential for application of
spatially-resolved predictive modeling tasks in computational pathology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hunyuan3D-Omni is a unified framework for fine-grained, controllable 3D asset generation that accepts multiple conditioning signals beyond just images/text, enabling precise control over geometry, topology, and pose.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most 3D generative models rely primarily on image or text conditioning and lack fine-grained cross-modal controls, which limits controllability and practical adoption in production workflows.

Method: Built on Hunyuan3D 2.1, the model accepts point clouds, voxels, bounding boxes, and skeletal pose priors as conditioning signals. It uses a single cross-modal architecture instead of separate heads, trained with progressive difficulty-aware sampling that biases toward harder signals while downweighting easier ones.

Result: Experiments show that additional controls improve generation accuracy, enable geometry-aware transformations, and increase robustness for production workflows.

Conclusion: The unified multi-modal framework enables fine-grained controllability in 3D asset generation, addressing limitations of existing methods and facilitating practical adoption in creative industries.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D-native generative models have accelerated asset
creation for games, film, and design. However, most methods still rely
primarily on image or text conditioning and lack fine-grained, cross-modal
controls, which limits controllability and practical adoption. To address this
gap, we present Hunyuan3D-Omni, a unified framework for fine-grained,
controllable 3D asset generation built on Hunyuan3D 2.1. In addition to images,
Hunyuan3D-Omni accepts point clouds, voxels, bounding boxes, and skeletal pose
priors as conditioning signals, enabling precise control over geometry,
topology, and pose. Instead of separate heads for each modality, our model
unifies all signals in a single cross-modal architecture. We train with a
progressive, difficulty-aware sampling strategy that selects one control
modality per example and biases sampling toward harder signals (e.g., skeletal
pose) while downweighting easier ones (e.g., point clouds), encouraging robust
multi-modal fusion and graceful handling of missing inputs. Experiments show
that these additional controls improve generation accuracy, enable
geometry-aware transformations, and increase robustness for production
workflows.

TL;DR: A framework using vision-language models to automatically generate semantic attention maps via natural language prompts, which helps CNNs make more reliable decisions by aligning their attention with human-like reasoning without manual annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNNs often exploit superficial correlations (cheating) rather than learning meaningful features, raising concerns about their decision-making reliability. Existing methods require expert annotations which are not scalable.

Method: Leverage vision-language models to automatically generate semantic attention maps using natural language prompts. Introduce an auxiliary loss that aligns CNN attention with these language-guided maps to promote more reliable decision-making.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ColoredMNIST and remains competitive with annotation-heavy baselines on DecoyMNIST. Shows improved generalization, reduced shortcut reliance, and attention maps that better reflect human intuition.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a scalable solution for improving CNN reliability by automatically generating semantic attention guidance, reducing dependency on manual annotations while achieving competitive performance.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) frequently "cheat" by exploiting
superficial correlations, raising concerns about whether they make predictions
for the right reasons. Inspired by cognitive science, which highlights the role
of attention in robust human perception, recent methods have sought to guide
model attention using concept-based supervision and explanation regularization.
However, these techniques depend on labor-intensive, expert-provided
annotations, limiting their scalability. We propose a scalable framework that
leverages vision-language models to automatically generate semantic attention
maps using natural language prompts. By introducing an auxiliary loss that
aligns CNN attention with these language-guided maps, our approach promotes
more reliable and cognitively plausible decision-making without manual
annotation. Experiments on challenging datasets, ColoredMNIST and DecoyMNIST,
show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on ColorMNIST and
remains competitive with annotation-heavy baselines on DecoyMNIST,
demonstrating improved generalization, reduced shortcut reliance, and model
attention that better reflects human intuition.

Result: Outperforms existing foundation models and task-specific approaches across disease classification, demographic prediction, anatomical localization, and cross-modal retrieval benchmarks.

Conclusion: Decipher-MR establishes a scalable and versatile foundation for MRI-based AI, facilitating efficient development across clinical and research domains.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a critical medical imaging modality in
clinical diagnosis and research, yet its complexity and heterogeneity pose
challenges for automated analysis, particularly in scalable and generalizable
machine learning applications. While foundation models have revolutionized
natural language and vision tasks, their application to MRI remains limited due
to data scarcity and narrow anatomical focus. In this work, we present
Decipher-MR, a 3D MRI-specific vision-language foundation model trained on a
large-scale dataset comprising 200,000 MRI series from over 22,000 studies
spanning diverse anatomical regions, sequences, and pathologies. Decipher-MR
integrates self-supervised vision learning with report-guided text supervision
to build robust, generalizable representations, enabling effective adaptation
across broad applications. To enable robust and diverse clinical tasks with
minimal computational overhead, Decipher-MR supports a modular design that
enables tuning of lightweight, task-specific decoders attached to a frozen
pretrained encoder. Following this setting, we evaluate Decipher-MR across
diverse benchmarks including disease classification, demographic prediction,
anatomical localization, and cross-modal retrieval, demonstrating consistent
performance gains over existing foundation models and task-specific approaches.

TL;DR: SQ-InstructBLIP improves vision-language reasoning by generating image-aware sub-questions and answers through a Questioner-Answerer-Reasoner architecture, outperforming previous methods on VQA tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based approaches struggle with multi-step reasoning in vision-language tasks due to inability to access fine-grained visual content and reliance on black-box models that are inaccessible and difficult to reproduce.

Method: Proposes SQ-InstructBLIP with three components sharing the same architecture: Questioner generates sub-questions, Answerer generates sub-answers, and Reasoner performs final reasoning using the generated sub-question information.

Result: Experiments show SQ-InstructBLIP performs more accurate reasoning than previous works by using generated sub-questions as additional information for VQA tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed iterative sub-question generation approach with image-aware components effectively improves multi-step reasoning in vision-language understanding tasks.

Abstract: The field of vision-language understanding has been actively researched in
recent years, thanks to the development of Large Language Models~(LLMs).
However, it still needs help with problems requiring multi-step reasoning, even
for very simple questions. Recent studies adopt LLMs to tackle this problem by
iteratively generating sub-questions and answers. However, there are
disadvantages such as 1) the fine-grained visual contents of images are not
available using LLMs that cannot read visual information, 2) internal
mechanisms are inaccessible and difficult to reproduce by using black-box LLMs.
To solve these problems, we propose the SQ (Self-Questioning)-InstructBLIP,
which improves inference performance by generating image-aware informative
sub-questions and sub-answers iteratively. The SQ-InstructBLIP, which consists
of a Questioner, Answerer, and Reasoner that share the same architecture.
Questioner and Answerer generate sub-questions and sub-answers to help infer
the main-question, and Reasoner performs reasoning on the main-question
considering the generated sub-question information. Our experiments show that
the proposed method SQ-InstructBLIP, which uses the generated sub-questions as
additional information when solving the VQA task, performs more accurate
reasoning than the previous works.

*Seyed Amir Kasaei,Mohammad Hossein Rohban*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new framework for defining and categorizing hallucination in text-to-image (T2I) models as bias-driven deviations, introducing a taxonomy with three categories: attribute, relation, and object hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of T2I models focus mainly on alignment (whether prompt-specified elements appear) but overlook what models generate beyond the prompt. Hallucination in T2I models has not been clearly framed compared to language and vision-language models.

Method: The authors argue for defining hallucination in T2I as bias-driven deviations and propose a taxonomy with three categories: attribute, relation, and object hallucinations.

Result: This framing introduces an upper bound for evaluation and surfaces hidden biases in T2I models.

Conclusion: The proposed taxonomy provides a foundation for richer assessment of T2I models by addressing the overlooked phenomenon of hallucination beyond simple prompt alignment.

Abstract: In language and vision-language models, hallucination is broadly understood
as content generated from a model's prior knowledge or biases rather than from
the given input. While this phenomenon has been studied in those domains, it
has not been clearly framed for text-to-image (T2I) generative models. Existing
evaluations mainly focus on alignment, checking whether prompt-specified
elements appear, but overlook what the model generates beyond the prompt. We
argue for defining hallucination in T2I as bias-driven deviations and propose a
taxonomy with three categories: attribute, relation, and object hallucinations.
This framing introduces an upper bound for evaluation and surfaces hidden
biases, providing a foundation for richer assessment of T2I models.

TL;DR: Proposes a Person Independence Universal Micro-action Recognition Framework using Distributionally Robust Optimization to handle inter-person variability in micro-action recognition, achieving better accuracy and robustness than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing micro-action recognition methods fail in real-world scenarios due to inter-person variability causing the same action to manifest differently, which hinders robust generalization.

Method: Two plug-and-play components: 1) Temporal-Frequency Alignment Module with dual-branch design (temporal branch uses Wasserstein-regularized alignment, frequency branch uses variance-guided perturbations) and consistency-driven fusion; 2) Group-Invariant Regularized Loss that partitions samples into pseudo-groups and up-weights boundary cases.

Result: Experiments on MA-52 dataset show the framework outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and robustness, achieving stable generalization under fine-grained conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses inter-person variability in micro-action recognition through person-agnostic representations and robust optimization principles.

Abstract: Micro-action Recognition is vital for psychological assessment and
human-computer interaction. However, existing methods often fail in real-world
scenarios because inter-person variability causes the same action to manifest
differently, hindering robust generalization. To address this, we propose the
Person Independence Universal Micro-action Recognition Framework, which
integrates Distributionally Robust Optimization principles to learn
person-agnostic representations. Our framework contains two plug-and-play
components operating at the feature and loss levels. At the feature level, the
Temporal-Frequency Alignment Module normalizes person-specific motion
characteristics with a dual-branch design: the temporal branch applies
Wasserstein-regularized alignment to stabilize dynamic trajectories, while the
frequency branch introduces variance-guided perturbations to enhance robustness
against person-specific spectral differences. A consistency-driven fusion
mechanism integrates both branches. At the loss level, the Group-Invariant
Regularized Loss partitions samples into pseudo-groups to simulate unseen
person-specific distributions. By up-weighting boundary cases and regularizing
subgroup variance, it forces the model to generalize beyond easy or frequent
samples, thus enhancing robustness to difficult variations. Experiments on the
large-scale MA-52 dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing
methods in both accuracy and robustness, achieving stable generalization under
fine-grained conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel approach for semantic matching that addresses geometric ambiguity and nearest-neighbor limitations by adapting VGGT's 3D geometric foundation model features through strategic fine-tuning and training strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semantic matching methods suffer from geometric ambiguity (failing to disambiguate symmetric structures using 2D features) and limitations of nearest-neighbor rules (ignoring cross-image invisibility and manifold preservation).

Method: The approach adapts VGGT's 3D geometric foundation model by: (i) reusing early feature stages, fine-tuning later ones, and adding a semantic head; (ii) implementing cycle-consistent training, synthetic data augmentation, and progressive training with aliasing artifact mitigation.

Result: Extensive experiments show the approach achieves superior geometry awareness, matching reliability, and manifold preservation, outperforming previous baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully bridges the gap between VGGT's original single-instance geometry matching and cross-instance semantic matching, demonstrating effective adaptation under data scarcity conditions.

Abstract: Semantic matching aims to establish pixel-level correspondences between
instances of the same category and represents a fundamental task in computer
vision. Existing approaches suffer from two limitations: (i) Geometric
Ambiguity: Their reliance on 2D foundation model features (e.g., Stable
Diffusion, DINO) often fails to disambiguate symmetric structures, requiring
extra fine-tuning yet lacking generalization; (ii) Nearest-Neighbor Rule: Their
pixel-wise matching ignores cross-image invisibility and neglects manifold
preservation. These challenges call for geometry-aware pixel descriptors and
holistic dense correspondence mechanisms. Inspired by recent advances in 3D
geometric foundation models, we turn to VGGT, which provides geometry-grounded
features and holistic dense matching capabilities well aligned with these
needs. However, directly transferring VGGT is challenging, as it was originally
designed for geometry matching within cross views of a single instance,
misaligned with cross-instance semantic matching, and further hindered by the
scarcity of dense semantic annotations. To address this, we propose an approach
that (i) retains VGGT's intrinsic strengths by reusing early feature stages,
fine-tuning later ones, and adding a semantic head for bidirectional
correspondences; and (ii) adapts VGGT to the semantic matching scenario under
data scarcity through cycle-consistent training strategy, synthetic data
augmentation, and progressive training recipe with aliasing artifact
mitigation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
superior geometry awareness, matching reliability, and manifold preservation,
outperforming previous baselines.

TL;DR: MedVSR is a specialized video super-resolution framework for medical videos that addresses unique challenges like camera shake, noise, and frame transitions through Cross State-Space Propagation for alignment and Inner State-Space Reconstruction for artifact reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution medical videos are crucial for accurate diagnosis but hard to acquire due to hardware limitations. Current VSR models struggle with medical video challenges like camera shake, noise, and abrupt frame transitions, leading to optical flow errors and artifacts that can mislead doctors.

Method: Proposes MedVSR with two key components: Cross State-Space Propagation (CSSP) for precise alignment by projecting distant frames as control matrices, and Inner State-Space Reconstruction (ISSR) for enhancing tissue structures through joint long-range spatial learning and large-kernel short-range aggregation.

Result: Experiments across four medical datasets (including endoscopy and cataract surgeries) show MedVSR significantly outperforms existing VSR models in both reconstruction performance and efficiency.

Conclusion: MedVSR provides an effective solution for medical video super-resolution, successfully addressing the unique challenges in clinical settings and demonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) medical videos are vital for accurate diagnosis, yet are
hard to acquire due to hardware limitations and physiological constraints.
Clinically, the collected low-resolution (LR) medical videos present unique
challenges for video super-resolution (VSR) models, including camera shake,
noise, and abrupt frame transitions, which result in significant optical flow
errors and alignment difficulties. Additionally, tissues and organs exhibit
continuous and nuanced structures, but current VSR models are prone to
introducing artifacts and distorted features that can mislead doctors. To this
end, we propose MedVSR, a tailored framework for medical VSR. It first employs
Cross State-Space Propagation (CSSP) to address the imprecise alignment by
projecting distant frames as control matrices within state-space models,
enabling the selective propagation of consistent and informative features to
neighboring frames for effective alignment. Moreover, we design an Inner
State-Space Reconstruction (ISSR) module that enhances tissue structures and
reduces artifacts with joint long-range spatial feature learning and
large-kernel short-range information aggregation. Experiments across four
datasets in diverse medical scenarios, including endoscopy and cataract
surgeries, show that MedVSR significantly outperforms existing VSR models in
reconstruction performance and efficiency. Code released at

TL;DR: This paper addresses limitations in multimodal reasoning models by proposing Variance-Aware Sampling (VAS) to stabilize RL fine-tuning, releasing large-scale curated datasets, and open-sourcing multimodal reasoning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large multimodal reasoning models face two major constraints: lack of open, high-quality long chain-of-thought data and instability of RL algorithms in post-training due to gradient vanishing when reward variance is low.

Method: Proposes Variance-Aware Sampling (VAS) guided by Variance Promotion Score (VPS) that combines outcome variance and trajectory diversity to stabilize policy optimization. Also releases ~1.6M long CoT data and ~15k RL QA pairs with reproducible training codebase.

Result: Experiments across mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate effectiveness of both curated data and VAS. Theoretically establishes that reward variance lower-bounds expected policy gradient magnitude.

Conclusion: The proposed VAS method effectively stabilizes RL fine-tuning, and the released large-scale resources provide standardized baselines for the multimodal reasoning community.

Abstract: Large multimodal reasoning models have achieved rapid progress, but their
advancement is constrained by two major limitations: the absence of open,
large-scale, high-quality long chain-of-thought (CoT) data, and the instability
of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in post-training. Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO), the standard framework for RL fine-tuning, is prone
to gradient vanishing when reward variance is low, which weakens optimization
signals and impairs convergence. This work makes three contributions: (1) We
propose Variance-Aware Sampling (VAS), a data selection strategy guided by
Variance Promotion Score (VPS) that combines outcome variance and trajectory
diversity to promote reward variance and stabilize policy optimization. (2) We
release large-scale, carefully curated resources containing ~1.6M long CoT
cold-start data and ~15k RL QA pairs, designed to ensure quality, difficulty,
and diversity, along with a fully reproducible end-to-end training codebase.
(3) We open-source a family of multimodal reasoning models in multiple scales,
establishing standardized baselines for the community. Experiments across
mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of both the
curated data and the proposed VAS. Comprehensive ablation studies and analyses

we theoretically establish that reward variance lower-bounds the expected
policy gradient magnitude, with VAS serving as a practical mechanism to realize
this guarantee. Our code, data, and checkpoints are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of sparse and expensive labeled data in ocean science by leveraging foundation models pre-trained on massive unlabeled datasets.

Method: Developed a foundation model using Prithvi-EO Vision Transformer architecture pre-trained to reconstruct Sentinel-3 OLCI data, then fine-tuned on two downstream tasks: chlorophyll concentration quantification and ocean primary production estimation.

Result: The model demonstrated utility for marine monitoring, effectively using small amounts of high-quality labeled data and capturing detailed spatial patterns of ocean color while matching point observations.

Conclusion: This new generation of geospatial AI models has potential to provide more robust, data-driven insights into ocean ecosystems and their role in global climate processes.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) Foundation models (FMs), pre-trained on massive
unlabelled datasets, have the potential to drastically change AI applications
in ocean science, where labelled data are often sparse and expensive to
collect. In this work, we describe a new foundation model using the Prithvi-EO
Vision Transformer architecture which has been pre-trained to reconstruct data
from the Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI). We evaluate the
model by fine-tuning on two downstream marine earth observation tasks. We first
assess model performance compared to current baseline models used to quantify
chlorophyll concentration. We then evaluate the FMs ability to refine remote
sensing-based estimates of ocean primary production. Our results demonstrate
the utility of self-trained FMs for marine monitoring, in particular for making
use of small amounts of high quality labelled data and in capturing detailed
spatial patterns of ocean colour whilst matching point observations. We
conclude that this new generation of geospatial AI models has the potential to
provide more robust, data-driven insights into ocean ecosystems and their role
in global climate processes.

TL;DR: SHINE is a training-free framework for high-fidelity image composition that leverages pretrained diffusion models to seamlessly insert objects into scenes while handling complex lighting and high-resolution inputs without requiring latent inversion or attention surgery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image composition models struggle with complex lighting conditions (shadows, reflections) and diverse high-resolution inputs. Current diffusion models have the necessary priors but lack proper frameworks to utilize them effectively without problematic techniques like latent inversion.

Method: SHINE introduces manifold-steered anchor loss using pretrained customization adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to guide latents for faithful subject representation while preserving background integrity. It also employs degradation-suppression guidance and adaptive background blending to eliminate low-quality outputs and visible seams.

Result: Experiments on the proposed ComplexCompo benchmark and DreamEditBench show state-of-the-art performance on standard metrics (DINOv2) and human-aligned scores (DreamSim, ImageReward, VisionReward).

Conclusion: SHINE provides an effective training-free framework for high-quality image composition that handles challenging lighting conditions and high-resolution inputs, outperforming existing methods while introducing a new rigorous benchmark for evaluation.

Abstract: Image composition aims to seamlessly insert a user-specified object into a
new scene, but existing models struggle with complex lighting (e.g., accurate
shadows, water reflections) and diverse, high-resolution inputs. Modern
text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX) already encode essential
physical and resolution priors, yet lack a framework to unleash them without
resorting to latent inversion, which often locks object poses into contextually
inappropriate orientations, or brittle attention surgery. We propose SHINE, a
training-free framework for Seamless, High-fidelity Insertion with Neutralized
Errors. SHINE introduces manifold-steered anchor loss, leveraging pretrained
customization adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to guide latents for faithful subject
representation while preserving background integrity. Degradation-suppression
guidance and adaptive background blending are proposed to further eliminate
low-quality outputs and visible seams. To address the lack of rigorous
benchmarks, we introduce ComplexCompo, featuring diverse resolutions and
challenging conditions such as low lighting, strong illumination, intricate
shadows, and reflective surfaces. Experiments on ComplexCompo and
DreamEditBench show state-of-the-art performance on standard metrics (e.g.,
DINOv2) and human-aligned scores (e.g., DreamSim, ImageReward, VisionReward).
Code and benchmark will be publicly available upon publication.

TL;DR: QuantVGGT is a novel quantization framework that addresses the unique challenges of compressing billion-scale Visual Geometry Grounded Transformers (VGGTs) for 3D reconstruction, achieving state-of-the-art results with significant memory and speed improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale transformers like VGGTs have prohibitive computational and memory costs that hinder real-world deployment. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) faces unique obstacles with VGGTs due to heavy-tailed activation distributions from data-independent special tokens and unstable calibration from multi-view 3D data.

Method: QuantVGGT introduces two key techniques: 1) Dual-Smoothed Fine-Grained Quantization using pre-global Hadamard rotation and post-local channel smoothing to handle heavy-tailed distributions, and 2) Noise-Filtered Diverse Sampling that filters outliers via deep-layer statistics and constructs frame-aware diverse calibration clusters.

Result: QuantVGGT achieves state-of-the-art results across benchmarks and bit-widths, with 4-bit quantization delivering 3.7× memory reduction and 2.5× acceleration while maintaining reconstruction accuracy above 98% of full-precision performance.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates vast advantages and practicality for resource-constrained scenarios, enabling efficient deployment of billion-scale 3D reconstruction models without significant accuracy loss.

Abstract: Learning-based 3D reconstruction models, represented by Visual Geometry
Grounded Transformers (VGGTs), have made remarkable progress with the use of
large-scale transformers. Their prohibitive computational and memory costs
severely hinder real-world deployment. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) has
become a common practice for compressing and accelerating models. However, we
empirically observe that PTQ faces unique obstacles when compressing
billion-scale VGGTs: the data-independent special tokens induce heavy-tailed
activation distributions, while the multi-view nature of 3D data makes
calibration sample selection highly unstable. This paper proposes the first
Quantization framework for VGGTs, namely QuantVGGT. This mainly relies on two
technical contributions: First, we introduce Dual-Smoothed Fine-Grained
Quantization, which integrates pre-global Hadamard rotation and post-local
channel smoothing to mitigate heavy-tailed distributions and inter-channel
variance robustly. Second, we design Noise-Filtered Diverse Sampling, which
filters outliers via deep-layer statistics and constructs frame-aware diverse
calibration clusters to ensure stable quantization ranges. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that QuantVGGT achieves the state-of-the-art results
across different benchmarks and bit-width, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art generic quantization method with a great margin. We highlight
that our 4-bit QuantVGGT can deliver a 3.7$\times$ memory reduction and
2.5$\times$ acceleration in real-hardware inference, while maintaining
reconstruction accuracy above 98\% of its full-precision counterpart. This
demonstrates the vast advantages and practicality of QuantVGGT in
resource-constrained scenarios. Our code is released in
https://github.com/wlfeng0509/QuantVGGT.

*Yu Yuan,Xijun Wang,Tharindu Wickremasinghe,Zeeshan Nadir,Bole Ma,Stanley H. Chan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NewtonGen integrates data-driven synthesis with learnable physical principles to address physical inconsistency in text-to-video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-video models produce unrealistic motions and lack precise parameter control due to learning motion distributions solely from appearance without understanding underlying dynamics.

Method: Proposes NewtonGen framework with trainable Neural Newtonian Dynamics (NND) that models Newtonian motions and injects latent dynamical constraints into video generation.

Result: Enables physically consistent video synthesis with precise parameter control by jointly leveraging data priors and dynamical guidance.

Conclusion: Integrating physical principles with data-driven approaches addresses fundamental limitations in current text-to-video generation models.

Abstract: A primary bottleneck in large-scale text-to-video generation today is
physical consistency and controllability. Despite recent advances,
state-of-the-art models often produce unrealistic motions, such as objects
falling upward, or abrupt changes in velocity and direction. Moreover, these
models lack precise parameter control, struggling to generate physically
consistent dynamics under different initial conditions. We argue that this
fundamental limitation stems from current models learning motion distributions
solely from appearance, while lacking an understanding of the underlying
dynamics. In this work, we propose NewtonGen, a framework that integrates
data-driven synthesis with learnable physical principles. At its core lies
trainable Neural Newtonian Dynamics (NND), which can model and predict a
variety of Newtonian motions, thereby injecting latent dynamical constraints
into the video generation process. By jointly leveraging data priors and
dynamical guidance, NewtonGen enables physically consistent video synthesis
with precise parameter control.
