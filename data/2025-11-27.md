### [1] [Are Neuro-Inspired Multi-Modal Vision-Language Models Resilient to Membership Inference Privacy Leakage?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20710)
*David Amebley,Sayanton Dibbo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a neuroscience-inspired topological regularization framework to enhance privacy resilience in multi-modal vision-language models against membership inference attacks, showing 24% reduction in attack success while maintaining model utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-modal models introduce new privacy attack vectors, and while neuro-inspired approaches have shown resilience in unimodal systems, their effectiveness against privacy attacks in multi-modal models remains unexplored.

Method: Proposed a topological regularization framework (tau) applied to three VLMs (BLIP, PaliGemma 2, ViT-GPT2) across three datasets (COCO, CC3M, NoCaps), comparing baseline models with neuro variants (tau > 0).

Result: NEURO VLMs showed 24% mean ROC-AUC reduction in MIA attack success on BLIP with COCO dataset while maintaining similar model utility (MPNet and ROUGE-2 metrics). Results were consistent across all models and datasets.

Conclusion: Neuro-inspired VLMs are more resilient against privacy attacks without significantly compromising model utility, contributing to understanding privacy risks in multi-modal models.

Abstract: In the age of agentic AI, the growing deployment of multi-modal models (MMs) has introduced new attack vectors that can leak sensitive training data in MMs, causing privacy leakage. This paper investigates a black-box privacy attack, i.e., membership inference attack (MIA) on multi-modal vision-language models (VLMs). State-of-the-art research analyzes privacy attacks primarily to unimodal AI-ML systems, while recent studies indicate MMs can also be vulnerable to privacy attacks. While researchers have demonstrated that biologically inspired neural network representations can improve unimodal model resilience against adversarial attacks, it remains unexplored whether neuro-inspired MMs are resilient against privacy attacks. In this work, we introduce a systematic neuroscience-inspired topological regularization (tau) framework to analyze MM VLMs resilience against image-text-based inference privacy attacks. We examine this phenomenon using three VLMs: BLIP, PaliGemma 2, and ViT-GPT2, across three benchmark datasets: COCO, CC3M, and NoCaps. Our experiments compare the resilience of baseline and neuro VLMs (with topological regularization), where the tau > 0 configuration defines the NEURO variant of VLM. Our results on the BLIP model using the COCO dataset illustrate that MIA attack success in NEURO VLMs drops by 24% mean ROC-AUC, while achieving similar model utility (similarities between generated and reference captions) in terms of MPNet and ROUGE-2 metrics. This shows neuro VLMs are comparatively more resilient against privacy attacks, while not significantly compromising model utility. Our extensive evaluation with PaliGemma 2 and ViT-GPT2 models, on two additional datasets: CC3M and NoCaps, further validates the consistency of the findings. This work contributes to the growing understanding of privacy risks in MMs and provides evidence on neuro VLMs privacy threat resilience.

*Inferix Team,Tianyu Feng,Yizeng Han,Jiahao He,Yuanyu He,Xi Lin,Teng Liu,Hanfeng Lu,Jiasheng Tang,Wei Wang,Zhiyuan Wang,Jichao Wu,Mingyang Yang,Yinghao Yu,Zeyu Zhang,Bohan Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Inferix is a next-generation inference engine designed for world models, featuring optimized semi-autoregressive decoding for coherent video generation, interactive streaming, and LV-Bench integration for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance world models as core simulators for AI applications by overcoming limitations of standard video diffusion and enabling immersive world synthesis through efficient, variable-length generation.

Method: Uses semi-autoregressive (block-diffusion) decoding that combines diffusion and autoregressive methods, with LLM-style KV Cache management for efficient generation. Features interactive video streaming and profiling.

Result: Enables generation of long, physically realistic, and interactive high-quality videos with improved coherence and stability compared to standard video diffusion models.

Conclusion: Inferix represents a specialized approach distinct from high-concurrency systems and classic video diffusion, aiming to foster community collaboration in advancing world model exploration.

Abstract: World models serve as core simulators for fields such as agentic AI, embodied AI, and gaming, capable of generating long, physically realistic, and interactive high-quality videos. Moreover, scaling these models could unlock emergent capabilities in visual perception, understanding, and reasoning, paving the way for a new paradigm that moves beyond current LLM-centric vision foundation models. A key breakthrough empowering them is the semi-autoregressive (block-diffusion) decoding paradigm, which merges the strengths of diffusion and autoregressive methods by generating video tokens in block-applying diffusion within each block while conditioning on previous ones, resulting in more coherent and stable video sequences. Crucially, it overcomes limitations of standard video diffusion by reintroducing LLM-style KV Cache management, enabling efficient, variable-length, and high-quality generation.
  Therefore, Inferix is specifically designed as a next-generation inference engine to enable immersive world synthesis through optimized semi-autoregressive decoding processes. This dedicated focus on world simulation distinctly sets it apart from systems engineered for high-concurrency scenarios (like vLLM or SGLang) and from classic video diffusion models (such as xDiTs). Inferix further enhances its offering with interactive video streaming and profiling, enabling real-time interaction and realistic simulation to accurately model world dynamics. Additionally, it supports efficient benchmarking through seamless integration of LV-Bench, a new fine-grained evaluation benchmark tailored for minute-long video generation scenarios. We hope the community will work together to advance Inferix and foster world model exploration.

*Kun Guo,Yun Shen,Xijun Wang,Chaoqun You,Yun Rui,Tony Q. S. Quek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LTED-Ada is a deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm that adaptively selects between local tracking and edge detection for video object recognition in resource-constrained devices, with federated learning enhancement for multi-device scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Resource-constrained devices like traffic cameras struggle with fast and accurate video object recognition. While edge computing enables offloading computation-intensive detection to servers, the challenge is deciding when to use edge detection versus local tracking.

Method: Formulated long-term optimization problems for single/multi-device scenarios, proposed LTED-Ada using deep reinforcement learning for adaptive selection between local tracking and edge detection, and enhanced with federated learning for multi-device collaborative policy training.

Result: Extensive hardware-in-the-loop experiments using Raspberry Pi 4B devices and PC edge server demonstrated the superiority of LTED-Ada in performance.

Conclusion: LTED-Ada provides an effective solution for adaptive video object recognition in edge computing environments, balancing accuracy, delay requirements, and frame rates through intelligent selection between local tracking and edge detection.

Abstract: Fast and accurate video object recognition, which relies on frame-by-frame video analytics, remains a challenge for resource-constrained devices such as traffic cameras. Recent advances in mobile edge computing have made it possible to offload computation-intensive object detection to edge servers equipped with high-accuracy neural networks, while lightweight and fast object tracking algorithms run locally on devices. This hybrid approach offers a promising solution but introduces a new challenge: deciding when to perform edge detection versus local tracking. To address this, we formulate two long-term optimization problems for both single-device and multi-device scenarios, taking into account the temporal correlation of consecutive frames and the dynamic conditions of mobile edge networks. Based on the formulation, we propose the LTED-Ada in single-device setting, a deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm that adaptively selects between local tracking and edge detection, according to the frame rate as well as recognition accuracy and delay requirement. In multi-device setting, we further enhance LTED-Ada using federated learning to enable collaborative policy training across devices, thereby improving its generalization to unseen frame rates and performance requirements. Finally, we conduct extensive hardware-in-the-loop experiments using multiple Raspberry Pi 4B devices and a personal computer as the edge server, demonstrating the superiority of LTED-Ada.

### [4] [DeeAD: Dynamic Early Exit of Vision-Language Action for Efficient Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20720)
*Haibo HU,Lianming Huang,Nan Guan,Chun Jason Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeeAD is a training-free early-exit framework that accelerates Vision-Language Action models for autonomous driving by terminating inference when trajectories align with lightweight planning priors, achieving up to 28% sparsity and 29% latency reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Action models suffer from significant inference latency due to deep transformer stacks, which hinders real-time autonomous driving applications.

Method: Uses action-guided early-exit by evaluating physical feasibility of intermediate trajectories against lightweight planning priors, with a multi-hop controller that skips redundant layers based on score change rates.

Result: Achieves up to 28% transformer-layer sparsity and 29% latency reduction on Bench2Drive benchmark while preserving planning quality and safety.

Conclusion: DeeAD effectively accelerates VLA planning without retraining, maintaining performance while significantly reducing computational overhead.

Abstract: Vision-Language Action (VLA) models unify perception, reasoning, and trajectory generation for autonomous driving, but suffer from significant inference latency due to deep transformer stacks. We present DeeAD, a training-free, action-guided early-exit framework that accelerates VLA planning by evaluating the physical feasibility of intermediate trajectories. Instead of relying on confidence scores, DeeAD terminates inference when predicted trajectories align with lightweight planning priors (e.g., Navigation or Low-precision Planning) within a tolerable deviation (<2m). To improve efficiency, we introduce a multi-hop controller that adaptively skips redundant layers based on the change rate of scores. DeeAD integrates into existing VLA models, such as ORION, without requiring retraining. Experiments on the Bench2Drive benchmark demonstrate up to 28% transformer-layer sparsity and 29% latency reduction, while preserving planning quality and safety.

### [5] [Foundry: Distilling 3D Foundation Models for the Edge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20721)
*Guillaume Letellier,Siddharth Srivastava,Frédéric Jurie,Gaurav Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FMD compresses large SSL foundation models into efficient proxies that retain general-purpose representational power, with Foundry implementing this for 3D point clouds using SuperTokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large foundation models are computationally expensive for edge devices, and existing compression methods sacrifice generality, creating a need for compression that preserves downstream-agnostic representational power.

Method: Foundry trains students to learn compressed SuperTokens that reconstruct teacher's token-level representations, capturing a compact basis of the latent space.

Result: Distilled models maintain strong transferability across diverse tasks (classification, part segmentation, few-shot) while using significantly fewer tokens and FLOPs.

Conclusion: FMD enables practical deployment of foundation models on resource-constrained hardware by compressing them into efficient proxies that retain general-purpose capabilities.

Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained with self-supervised learning (SSL) on large-scale datasets have become powerful general-purpose feature extractors. However, their immense size and computational cost make them prohibitive for deployment on edge devices such as robots and AR/VR headsets. Existing compression techniques like standard knowledge distillation create efficient 'specialist' models but sacrifice the crucial, downstream-agnostic generality that makes foundation models so valuable.  In this paper, we introduce Foundation Model Distillation (FMD), a new paradigm for compressing large SSL models into compact, efficient, and faithful proxies that retain their general-purpose representational power. We present Foundry, the first implementation of FMD for 3D point clouds. Our approach, Foundry, trains a student to learn a compressed set of SuperTokens that reconstruct the teacher's token-level representations, capturing a compact basis of its latent space. A single distilled model maintains strong transferability across diverse downstream tasks-classification, part segmentation, and few-shot scenarios-approaching full foundation-model performance while using significantly fewer tokens and FLOPs, making such models more practical for deployment on resourceconstrained hardware.

### [6] [DinoLizer: Learning from the Best for Generative Inpainting Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20722)
*Minh Thong Doi,Jan Butora,Vincent Itier,Jérémie Boulanger,Patrick Bas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DinoLizer is a DINOv2-based model that localizes manipulated regions in generative inpainting by using patch embeddings and a linear classification head, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 12% higher IoU than competitors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an effective method for detecting and localizing manipulated regions in generative inpainting, addressing the challenge of identifying semantically altered areas while ignoring non-semantic edits.

Method: Builds on DINOv2 pretrained on B-Free dataset, adds linear classification head on patch embeddings for manipulation prediction at 14×14 resolution, uses sliding-window strategy for larger images, and post-processes heatmaps into binary masks.

Result: Surpasses state-of-the-art local manipulation detectors across various inpainting datasets, achieves 12% higher IoU than next best model, remains robust to post-processing operations like resizing, noise addition, and JPEG compression.

Conclusion: DINOv2-based Vision Transformers demonstrate strong representational power for manipulation localization, with DinoLizer showing superiority over existing methods and confirming effectiveness through extensive ablation studies comparing DINOv2 and DINOv3.

Abstract: We introduce DinoLizer, a DINOv2-based model for localizing manipulated regions in generative inpainting. Our method builds on a DINOv2 model pretrained to detect synthetic images on the B-Free dataset. We add a linear classification head on top of the Vision Transformer's patch embeddings to predict manipulations at a $14\times 14$ patch resolution. The head is trained to focus on semantically altered regions, treating non-semantic edits as part of the original content. Because the ViT accepts only fixed-size inputs, we use a sliding-window strategy to aggregate predictions over larger images; the resulting heatmaps are post-processed to refine the estimated binary manipulation masks. Empirical results show that DinoLizer surpasses state-of-the-art local manipulation detectors on a range of inpainting datasets derived from different generative models. It remains robust to common post-processing operations such as resizing, noise addition, and JPEG (double) compression. On average, DinoLizer achieves a 12\% higher Intersection-over-Union (IoU) than the next best model, with even greater gains after post-processing. Our experiments with off-the-shelf DINOv2 demonstrate the strong representational power of Vision Transformers for this task. Finally, extensive ablation studies comparing DINOv2 and its successor, DINOv3, in deepfake localization confirm DinoLizer's superiority. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance of the paper.

### [7] [CANVAS: A Benchmark for Vision-Language Models on Tool-Based User Interface Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20737)
*Daeheon Jeong,Seoyeon Byun,Kihoon Son,Dae Hyun Kim,Juho Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CANVAS is a benchmark for evaluating vision language models' ability to perform tool-based UI design tasks through software tool invocation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: No existing benchmark evaluates tool-based design performance of VLMs, leaving their capacity for UI design collaboration unknown.

Method: Created CANVAS benchmark with 598 tool-based design tasks from 3.3K mobile UI designs across 30 categories, featuring design replication and modification tasks where VLMs update designs through context-based tool invocations.

Result: Leading models show more strategic tool invocations that improve design quality, and common error patterns were identified.

Conclusion: CANVAS enables evaluation of VLMs' tool-based UI design capabilities, revealing current performance and guiding future improvements in design collaboration.

Abstract: User interface (UI) design is an iterative process in which designers progressively refine their work with design software such as Figma or Sketch. Recent advances in vision language models (VLMs) with tool invocation suggest these models can operate design software to edit a UI design through iteration. Understanding and enhancing this capacity is important, as it highlights VLMs' potential to collaborate with designers within conventional software. However, as no existing benchmark evaluates tool-based design performance, the capacity remains unknown. To address this, we introduce CANVAS, a benchmark for VLMs on tool-based user interface design. Our benchmark contains 598 tool-based design tasks paired with ground-truth references sampled from 3.3K mobile UI designs across 30 function-based categories (e.g., onboarding, messaging). In each task, a VLM updates the design step-by-step through context-based tool invocations (e.g., create a rectangle as a button background), linked to design software. Specifically, CANVAS incorporates two task types: (i) design replication evaluates the ability to reproduce a whole UI screen; (ii) design modification evaluates the ability to modify a specific part of an existing screen. Results suggest that leading models exhibit more strategic tool invocations, improving design quality. Furthermore, we identify common error patterns models exhibit, guiding future work in enhancing tool-based design capabilities.

### [8] [Text-Guided Semantic Image Encoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20770)
*Raghuveer Thirukovalluru,Xiaochuang Han,Bhuwan Dhingra,Emily Dinan,Maha Elbayad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TIE is a text-guided semantic image encoder that generates image representations conditioned on input text queries, improving VLMs' performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard image encoders in VLMs process images agnostically without considering downstream tasks or text queries, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Proposed Text-Guided Semantic Image Encoder (TIE) that generates image representations conditioned on input text queries.

Result: TIE-based VLMs outperform conventional counterparts by +1.5 and +1.3 points on average across nine benchmarks, with gains up to 6 points on DocVQA and InfoVQA, while using only half the image tokens.

Conclusion: TIE effectively optimizes encoders to capture key visual features, improves interpretability and query-specific grounding, and enhances inference efficiency.

Abstract: Image encoders, a fundamental component of vision-language models (VLMs), are typically pretrained independently before being aligned with a language model. This standard paradigm results in encoders that process images agnostically, without regard to the specific downstream task or text query. To address this limitation, we propose the Text-Guided Semantic Image Encoder (TIE), which generates image representations conditioned on the input text query. VLMs equipped with TIE outperform their conventional counterparts by +1.5 and +1.3 points on average across nine image-to-text benchmarks at the 1B and 3B scales, respectively, with gains reaching up to 6 points on tasks such as DocVQA and InfoVQA. Moreover, TIE-based VLMs attain superior performance while utilizing only half as many image tiles (tokens), resulting in notably improved inference efficiency. TIE also generalizes well with generic queries, indicating that text-conditioned training effectively optimizes the encoder to capture key visual features. Qualitative analysis confirms that TIE consistently attends to query-relevant regions, enhancing both interpretability and query-specific grounding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SMARC is a unified model that reconstructs full RGB surfaces and classifies material categories from just a single 10% contiguous image patch, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods require dense or full-scene observations, limiting their effectiveness in constrained or partial view environments. There's a need for models that can understand material surfaces from minimal visual input.

Method: Combines a Partial Convolutional U-Net with a classification head, enabling both spatial inpainting and semantic understanding under extreme observation sparsity. Uses partial convolution for spatial reasoning with missing data.

Result: Achieves PSNR of 17.55 dB for surface reconstruction and 85.10% accuracy for material classification on the Touch and Go dataset, outperforming five baseline models including ViT, MAE, Swin Transformer, and DETR.

Conclusion: Partial convolution provides significant advantages for spatial reasoning under missing data, establishing a strong foundation for minimal-vision surface understanding in robotics, simulation, and material perception applications.

Abstract: Understanding material surfaces from sparse visual cues is critical for applications in robotics, simulation, and material perception. However, most existing methods rely on dense or full-scene observations, limiting their effectiveness in constrained or partial view environment. To address this challenge, we introduce SMARC, a unified model for Surface MAterial Reconstruction and Classification from minimal visual input. By giving only a single 10% contiguous patch of the image, SMARC recognizes and reconstructs the full RGB surface while simultaneously classifying the material category. Our architecture combines a Partial Convolutional U-Net with a classification head, enabling both spatial inpainting and semantic understanding under extreme observation sparsity. We compared SMARC against five models including convolutional autoencoders [17], Vision Transformer (ViT) [13], Masked Autoencoder (MAE) [5], Swin Transformer [9], and DETR [2] using Touch and Go dataset [16] of real-world surface textures. SMARC achieves state-of-the-art results with a PSNR of 17.55 dB and a material classification accuracy of 85.10%. Our findings highlight the advantages of partial convolution in spatial reasoning under missing data and establish a strong foundation for minimal-vision surface understanding.

### [10] [LongVT: Incentivizing "Thinking with Long Videos" via Native Tool Calling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20785)
*Zuhao Yang,Sudong Wang,Kaichen Zhang,Keming Wu,Sicong Leng,Yifan Zhang,Chengwei Qin,Shijian Lu,Xingxuan Li,Lidong Bing*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LongVT is an agentic framework that enables multimodal reasoning on long videos through interleaved tool use and chain-of-thought, addressing hallucination issues in existing LMMs by implementing global-to-local video analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large multimodal models struggle with hallucinations when processing long-form videos where evidence is sparse and temporally dispersed, requiring a more human-like approach to video comprehension.

Method: Uses LMMs' temporal grounding ability as a native video cropping tool to zoom in on specific clips, implementing a global-to-local reasoning loop with multimodal chain-of-tool-thought. Includes three-stage training with supervised fine-tuning and agentic reinforcement learning.

Result: Outperforms existing baselines across four challenging long-video understanding benchmarks. Developed VideoSIAH dataset with 247.9K training samples and 1,280 evaluation QA pairs.

Conclusion: LongVT provides an effective end-to-end framework for long video reasoning that reduces hallucinations through evidence-grounded, tool-integrated multimodal analysis.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown great potential for video reasoning with textual Chain-of-Thought. However, they remain vulnerable to hallucinations, especially when processing long-form videos where evidence is sparse and temporally dispersed. Inspired by how humans comprehend long videos - by first skimming globally and then examining relevant clips for details - we introduce LongVT, an end-to-end agentic framework that enables "Thinking with Long Videos" via interleaved Multimodal Chain-of-Tool-Thought. Specifically, we exploit LMMs' inherent temporal grounding ability as a native video cropping tool to zoom in on a specific video clip and resample finer-grained video frames. This global-to-local reasoning loop continues until answers are grounded in retrieved visual evidence. Given the scarcity of fine-grained question-answering (QA) data for the long video reasoning task, we curate and will release a data suite named VideoSIAH to facilitate both training and evaluation. Specifically, our training dataset consists of 247.9K samples for tool-integrated cold-start supervised fine-tuning, 1.6K samples for agentic reinforcement learning, and 15.4K samples for agentic reinforcement fine-tuning, respectively. Our evaluation benchmark consists of 1,280 QA pairs that are carefully curated through a semi-automatic data pipeline with human-in-the-loop validation. With a meticulously designed three-stage training strategy and extensive empirical validation, LongVT consistently outperforms existing strong baselines across four challenging long-video understanding and reasoning benchmarks. Our codes, data, and model checkpoints are publicly available at https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/LongVT .

### [11] [Revisiting KRISP: A Lightweight Reproduction and Analysis of Knowledge-Enhanced Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20795)
*Souradeep Dutta,Keshav Bulia,Neena S Nair*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Lightweight reproduction of KRISP model with fewer parameters, uncovering design flaws and enabling edge device deployment while preventing AI hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a more efficient version of KRISP that addresses computational demands and industrial-scale training requirements, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments.

Method: Systematic replication with reduced parameters, systematic ablation studies, evaluation on DAQUAR dataset, and proof-of-concept on synthetic VQA data while constraining outputs to external knowledge graph domain.

Result: Replicated model performs about 75% of original KRISP but reveals design flaws and real-world pitfalls not covered in original paper, while enabling edge device deployment.

Conclusion: Lightweight knowledge-enhanced VQA architectures can function effectively under resource constraints, prevent hallucinations, and enable offline visual reasoning on edge devices.

Abstract: Facebook AI Research introduced KRISP [4], which integrates structured external knowledge into pipelines for vision-language reasoning. Despite its effectiveness, the original model has been developed for industrial-scale training, is computationally demanding, and is tightly connected to a large backbone. In this work, we reexamine KRISP from a different angle and offer a lightweight reproduction with significantly fewer parameters. Even though our replicated model performs about 75 % of the original, the replication process uncovers a number of design flaws, real-world pitfalls, and implicit problems that were not fully covered in the original paper. We offer insights into the scalability and efficacy of knowledge-enhanced VQA architectures under resource constraints through systematic ablation studies, which include a proof-of-concept on synthetic VQA data and evaluation on the DAQUAR dataset. Our model, configured with a low parameter setup and constrained by the external Knowledge graph domain, prevents AI hallucinations and generates outputs solely within that domain. Minimal parameters allow us to function on edge devices like smartphones and AR-VR, further improving offline visual reasoning.

### [12] [Intriguing Properties of Dynamic Sampling Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20800)
*Dario Morle,Reid Zaffino*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper develops a unified theoretical framework called 'warping' that generalizes dynamic sampling methods in deep learning, analyzes their statistical properties, reveals forward-backward asymmetry in training, and provides conditions for stable training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify and provide theoretical analysis for various dynamic sampling mechanisms in deep learning architectures that have demonstrated utility but lack unified theoretical understanding.

Method: Developed a novel 'warping' operator that generalizes existing dynamic sampling methods, performed statistical analysis modeling inputs as IID variables and homogeneous random fields, and introduced gradient-based loss landscape visualization.

Result: Discovered unique asymmetry between forward and backward passes, showed dynamic sampling represents orthogonal operators to traditional convolutions, established conditions for stable training, and analyzed discretization effects.

Conclusion: The warping framework successfully unifies dynamic sampling methods, provides theoretical foundations for understanding their behavior, and establishes practical conditions for stable training of such architectures.

Abstract: Dynamic sampling mechanisms in deep learning architectures have demonstrated utility across many computer vision models, though the theoretical analysis of these structures has not yet been unified. In this paper we connect the various dynamic sampling methods by developing and analyzing a novel operator which generalizes existing methods, which we term "warping". Warping provides a minimal implementation of dynamic sampling which is amenable to analysis, and can be used to reconstruct existing architectures including deformable convolutions, active convolutional units, and spatial transformer networks. Using our formalism, we provide statistical analysis of the operator by modeling the inputs as both IID variables and homogeneous random fields. Extending this analysis, we discover a unique asymmetry between the forward and backward pass of the model training. We demonstrate that these mechanisms represent an entirely different class of orthogonal operators to the traditional translationally invariant operators defined by convolutions. With a combination of theoretical analysis and empirical investigation, we find the conditions necessary to ensure stable training of dynamic sampling networks. In addition, statistical analysis of discretization effects are studied. Finally, we introduce a novel loss landscape visualization which utilizes gradient update information directly, to better understand learning behavior.

### [13] [$Δ$-NeRF: Incremental Refinement of Neural Radiance Fields through Residual Control and Knowledge Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20804)
*Kriti Ghosh,Devjyoti Chakraborty,Lakshmish Ramaswamy,Suchendra M. Bhandarkar,In Kee Kim,Nancy O'Hare,Deepak Mishra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Δ-NeRF is a modular residual framework for incremental NeRF refinement that enables efficient updates without catastrophic forgetting, achieving comparable performance to joint training with 30-42% faster training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NeRF frameworks require complete retraining for new views, limiting applicability in sequential data scenarios like satellite terrain analysis where regions are repeatedly observed over time.

Method: Uses residual controller for per-layer corrections on frozen base NeRF, uncertainty-aware gating to prevent overcorrection, view selection to reduce training data by 47%, and knowledge distillation for model compression.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to joint training with 30-42% faster training time, up to 43.5% PSNR improvement over naive fine-tuning, and surpasses joint training on some metrics.

Conclusion: Δ-NeRF provides an effective solution for incremental NeRF refinement that overcomes catastrophic forgetting and enables efficient updates in sequential data scenarios.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis. However, most existing NeRF frameworks require complete retraining when new views are introduced incrementally, limiting their applicability in domains where data arrives sequentially. This limitation is particularly problematic in satellite-based terrain analysis, where regions are repeatedly observed over time. Incremental refinement of NeRFs remains underexplored, and naive approaches suffer from catastrophic forgetting when past data is unavailable. We propose $Δ$-NeRF, a unique modular residual framework for incremental NeRF refinement. $Δ$-NeRF introduces several novel techniques including: (1) a residual controller that injects per-layer corrections into a frozen base NeRF, enabling refinement without access to past data; (2) an uncertainty-aware gating mechanism that prevents overcorrection by adaptively combining base and refined predictions; and (3) a view selection strategy that reduces training data by up to 47\% while maintaining performance. Additionally, we employ knowledge distillation to compress the enhanced model into a compact student network (20\% of original size). Experiments on satellite imagery demonstrate that $Δ$-NeRF achieves performance comparable to joint training while reducing training time by 30-42\%. $Δ$-NeRF consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving an improvement of up to 43.5\% in PSNR over naive fine-tuning and surpassing joint training on some metrics.

*Ozgur Kara,Yujia Chen,Ming-Hsuan Yang,James M. Rehg,Wen-Sheng Chu,Du Tran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Split-then-Merge (StM) is a novel framework that enhances control in generative video composition by splitting unlabeled videos into foreground/background layers and self-composing them to learn compositional dynamics, addressing data scarcity without annotated datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the data scarcity problem in generative video composition and enhance control over video generation without relying on annotated datasets or handcrafted rules.

Method: Splits unlabeled videos into dynamic foreground and background layers, then self-composes them to learn compositional dynamics. Uses transformation-aware training with multi-layer fusion, augmentation for affordance-aware composition, and identity-preservation loss to maintain foreground fidelity.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative benchmarks and human/VLLM-based qualitative evaluations.

Conclusion: StM effectively learns complex compositional dynamics for realistic video generation through self-supervised learning on unlabeled video data, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: We present Split-then-Merge (StM), a novel framework designed to enhance control in generative video composition and address its data scarcity problem. Unlike conventional methods relying on annotated datasets or handcrafted rules, StM splits a large corpus of unlabeled videos into dynamic foreground and background layers, then self-composes them to learn how dynamic subjects interact with diverse scenes. This process enables the model to learn the complex compositional dynamics required for realistic video generation. StM introduces a novel transformation-aware training pipeline that utilizes a multi-layer fusion and augmentation to achieve affordance-aware composition, alongside an identity-preservation loss that maintains foreground fidelity during blending.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sphinx is a synthetic environment for visual perception and reasoning that procedurally generates puzzles with verifiable solutions, covering 25 cognitive tasks. State-of-the-art models achieve only 51.1% accuracy, while reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards significantly improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating visual perception and reasoning capabilities, targeting core cognitive primitives that current models struggle with, and enabling precise evaluation through verifiable ground-truth solutions.

Method: Procedurally generates puzzles using motifs, tiles, charts, icons, and geometric primitives, each paired with verifiable solutions. Evaluates models on 25 task types including symmetry detection, geometric transformations, spatial reasoning, chart interpretation, and sequence prediction.

Result: Recent large vision-language models achieve only 51.1% accuracy on Sphinx tasks, well below human performance. Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) substantially improves model accuracy on these tasks and yields gains on external visual reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: Sphinx provides a challenging benchmark for visual reasoning where current models significantly underperform humans. Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards shows promise for advancing multimodal reasoning capabilities across various cognitive tasks.

Abstract: We present Sphinx, a synthetic environment for visual perception and reasoning that targets core cognitive primitives. Sphinx procedurally generates puzzles using motifs, tiles, charts, icons, and geometric primitives, each paired with verifiable ground-truth solutions, enabling both precise evaluation and large-scale dataset construction. The benchmark covers 25 task types spanning symmetry detection, geometric transformations, spatial reasoning, chart interpretation, and sequence prediction. Evaluating recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) shows that even state-of-the-art GPT-5 attains only 51.1% accuracy, well below human performance. Finally, we demonstrate that reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) substantially improves model accuracy on these tasks and yields gains on external visual reasoning benchmarks, highlighting its promise for advancing multimodal reasoning.

### [16] [Training-Free Diffusion Priors for Text-to-Image Generation via Optimization-based Visual Inversion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20821)
*Samuele Dell'Erba,Andrew D. Bagdanov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OVI replaces expensive diffusion priors with optimization-based visual inversion, using text embedding similarity and novel constraints to generate images without training or data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional diffusion models rely on computationally expensive prior networks that require massive training datasets, which the authors aim to eliminate.

Method: Optimization-based Visual Inversion (OVI) initializes from random pseudo-tokens and optimizes latent representations using cosine similarity with text embeddings, plus Mahalanobis and Nearest-Neighbor constraints.

Result: OVI serves as viable prior alternative, with Nearest-Neighbor approach achieving comparable scores to state-of-the-art data-efficient priors while exposing flaws in current evaluation benchmarks.

Conclusion: OVI demonstrates that trained priors may not be necessary, offering a promising training-free alternative that merits further investigation.

Abstract: Diffusion models have established the state-of-the-art in text-to-image generation, but their performance often relies on a diffusion prior network to translate text embeddings into the visual manifold for easier decoding. These priors are computationally expensive and require extensive training on massive datasets. In this work, we challenge the necessity of a trained prior at all by employing Optimization-based Visual Inversion (OVI), a training-free and data-free alternative, to replace the need for a prior. OVI initializes a latent visual representation from random pseudo-tokens and iteratively optimizes it to maximize the cosine similarity with input textual prompt embedding. We further propose two novel constraints, a Mahalanobis-based and a Nearest-Neighbor loss, to regularize the OVI optimization process toward the distribution of realistic images. Our experiments, conducted on Kandinsky 2.2, show that OVI can serve as an alternative to traditional priors. More importantly, our analysis reveals a critical flaw in current evaluation benchmarks like T2I-CompBench++, where simply using the text embedding as a prior achieves surprisingly high scores, despite lower perceptual quality. Our constrained OVI methods improve visual fidelity over this baseline, with the Nearest-Neighbor approach proving particularly effective, achieving quantitative scores comparable to or higher than the state-of-the-art data-efficient prior, indicating that the idea merits further investigation. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance.

*Roman Naeem,David Hagerman,Jennifer Alvén,Fredrik Kahl*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RefTr is a 3D image-to-graph model for vascular tree centerline detection using recurrent refinement of confluent trajectories with a Producer-Refiner architecture based on Transformer decoder, achieving superior recall and comparable precision to SOTA with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate centerline detection with correct tree topology is critical for clinical applications like diagnosis and surgical planning, where missing small branches can lead to fatal mistakes due to incomplete assessments.

Method: Uses Producer-Refiner architecture with Transformer decoder: Producer proposes initial confluent trajectories, Refiner recurrently refines them to form centerline graph. Introduces efficient non-maximum suppression for spatial tree graphs to merge duplicate branches.

Result: Achieves superior recall and comparable precision to previous SOTA across multiple public datasets, with 2.4x reduction in decoder parameters and faster inference.

Conclusion: RefTr demonstrates potential as new state-of-the-art framework for vascular tree analysis in 3D medical imaging, offering better performance with improved efficiency.

Abstract: Tubular trees, such as blood vessels and lung airways, are essential for material transport within the human body. Accurately detecting their centerlines with correct tree topology is critical for clinical tasks such as diagnosis, treatment planning, and surgical navigation. In these applications, maintaining high recall is crucial, as missing small branches can result in fatal mistakes caused by incomplete assessments or undetected abnormalities. We present RefTr, a 3D image-to-graph model for centerline generation of vascular trees via recurrent refinement of confluent trajectories. RefTr uses a Producer-Refiner architecture based on a Transformer decoder, where the Producer proposes a set of initial confluent trajectories that are recurrently refined by the Refiner to produce final trajectories, which forms the centerline graph. The confluent trajectory representation enables refinement of complete trajectories while explicitly enforcing a valid tree topology. The recurrent refinement scheme improves precision and reuses the same Refiner block across multiple steps, yielding a 2.4x reduction in decoder parameters compared to previous SOTA. We also introduce an efficient non-maximum suppression algorithm for spatial tree graphs to merge duplicate branches and boost precision. Across multiple public centerline datasets, RefTr achieves superior recall and comparable precision to previous SOTA, while offering faster inference and substantially fewer parameters, demonstrating its potential as a new state-of-the-art framework for vascular tree analysis in 3D medical imaging.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First high-resolution stereo DSLR dataset with 18,000 images capturing real optical effects across 50 configurations, enabling analysis of depth estimation, DoF rendering, and 3D reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of large-scale, high-fidelity real stereo DSLR datasets limits real-world generalization and evaluation of models trained on synthetic data for depth estimation and optical effects.

Method: Captured 18,000 high-res (5472×3648px) stereo images across 9 scenes with systematic variation of focal length (28-70mm) and aperture (f/2.8-f/22), covering 50 optical configurations with dedicated calibration sets.

Result: Created comprehensive dataset featuring challenging visual elements like optical illusions, reflective surfaces, and lighting variations, enabling controlled analysis of geometric and optical effects.

Conclusion: Bridges realism gap between synthetic training and real camera optics, reveals challenges in current SOTA methods, and provides resources for reproducible research on real-world optical generalization.

Abstract: Reliable depth estimation under real optical conditions remains a core challenge for camera vision in systems such as autonomous robotics and augmented reality. Despite recent progress in depth estimation and depth-of-field rendering, research remains constrained by the lack of large-scale, high-fidelity, real stereo DSLR datasets, limiting real-world generalization and evaluation of models trained on synthetic data as shown extensively in literature. We present the first high-resolution (5472$\times$3648px) stereo DSLR dataset with 18000 images, systematically varying focal length and aperture across complex real scenes and capturing the optical realism and complexity of professional camera systems. For 9 scenes with varying scene complexity, lighting and background, images are captured with two identical camera assemblies at 10 focal lengths (28-70mm) and 5 apertures (f/2.8-f/22), spanning 50 optical configurations in 2000 images per scene. This full-range optics coverage enables controlled analysis of geometric and optical effects for monocular and stereo depth estimation, shallow depth-of-field rendering, deblurring, 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Each focal configuration has a dedicated calibration image set, supporting evaluation of classical and learning based methods for intrinsic and extrinsic calibration. The dataset features challenging visual elements such as multi-scale optical illusions, reflective surfaces, mirrors, transparent glass walls, fine-grained details, and natural / artificial ambient light variations. This work attempts to bridge the realism gap between synthetic training data and real camera optics, and demonstrates challenges with the current state-of-the-art monocular, stereo depth and depth-of-field methods. We release the dataset, calibration files, and evaluation code to support reproducible research on real-world optical generalization.

*Sree Bhattacharyya,Yaman Kumar Singla,Sudhir Yarram,Somesh Kumar Singh,Harini S,James Z. Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the first large-scale unsupervised dataset for visual memorability using tip-of-the-tongue queries from Reddit, containing 82,000+ videos with recall descriptions, enabling improved recall generation and ToT retrieval tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual memorability datasets are limited by expensive human annotations, restricting diversity and scalability. They only capture aggregate scores rather than nuanced memorability signals from natural recall descriptions.

Method: Leveraged tip-of-the-tongue retrieval queries from online platforms like Reddit to create an unsupervised dataset. Used contrastive training strategy for multimodal ToT retrieval and fine-tuned large vision-language models on the dataset.

Result: Models fine-tuned on the dataset outperform GPT-4o in generating open-ended memorability descriptions. Created the first model capable of multimodal ToT retrieval. The dataset provides rich signals for recall generation and ToT retrieval tasks.

Conclusion: The unsupervised dataset and models present a novel direction for visual content memorability research, facilitating progress by providing scalable, diverse data with rich memorability signals from natural recall descriptions.

Abstract: Visual content memorability has intrigued the scientific community for decades, with applications ranging widely, from understanding nuanced aspects of human memory to enhancing content design. A significant challenge in progressing the field lies in the expensive process of collecting memorability annotations from humans. This limits the diversity and scalability of datasets for modeling visual content memorability. Most existing datasets are limited to collecting aggregate memorability scores for visual content, not capturing the nuanced memorability signals present in natural, open-ended recall descriptions. In this work, we introduce the first large-scale unsupervised dataset designed explicitly for modeling visual memorability signals, containing over 82,000 videos, accompanied by descriptive recall data. We leverage tip-of-the-tongue (ToT) retrieval queries from online platforms such as Reddit. We demonstrate that our unsupervised dataset provides rich signals for two memorability-related tasks: recall generation and ToT retrieval. Large vision-language models fine-tuned on our dataset outperform state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o in generating open-ended memorability descriptions for visual content. We also employ a contrastive training strategy to create the first model capable of performing multimodal ToT retrieval. Our dataset and models present a novel direction, facilitating progress in visual content memorability research.

### [20] [Estimating Fog Parameters from a Sequence of Stereo Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20865)
*Yining Ding,João F. C. Mota,Andrew M. Wallace,Sen Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method for estimating fog parameters from stereo images using simultaneous optimization rather than sequential estimation, with a new dataset (SDIRF) for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous approaches estimate fog parameters sequentially, leading to error propagation. Real-world fog is often globally inhomogeneous, requiring methods that can handle local variations.

Method: Simultaneous estimation of all fog parameters by solving a novel optimization problem, assuming fog is only locally homogeneous. Can be integrated as an add-on module in existing visual SLAM/odometry systems.

Result: Created SDIRF dataset with 34k+ frames of real foggy scenes. Method outperforms prior approaches on both synthetic and real foggy data, producing more accurate estimates and better adaptation to real fog conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm effectively handles real-world inhomogeneous fog and can enhance visual perception systems in foggy conditions. Code and dataset are publicly available to advance research in this area.

Abstract: We propose a method which, given a sequence of stereo foggy images, estimates the parameters of a fog model and updates them dynamically. In contrast with previous approaches, which estimate the parameters sequentially and thus are prone to error propagation, our algorithm estimates all the parameters simultaneously by solving a novel optimisation problem. By assuming that fog is only locally homogeneous, our method effectively handles real-world fog, which is often globally inhomogeneous. The proposed algorithm can be easily used as an add-on module in existing visual Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) or odometry systems in the presence of fog. In order to assess our method, we also created a new dataset, the Stereo Driving In Real Fog (SDIRF), consisting of high-quality, consecutive stereo frames of real, foggy road scenes under a variety of visibility conditions, totalling over 40 minutes and 34k frames. As a first-of-its-kind, SDIRF contains the camera's photometric parameters calibrated in a lab environment, which is a prerequisite for correctly applying the atmospheric scattering model to foggy images. The dataset also includes the counterpart clear data of the same routes recorded in overcast weather, which is useful for companion work in image defogging and depth reconstruction. We conducted extensive experiments using both synthetic foggy data and real foggy sequences from SDIRF to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over prior methods. Our method not only produces the most accurate estimates on synthetic data, but also adapts better to real fog. We make our code and SDIRF publicly available\footnote{https://github.com/SenseRoboticsLab/estimating-fog-parameters} to the community with the aim of advancing the research on visual perception in fog.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: V^2-SAM adapts SAM2 for cross-view object correspondence using two complementary prompt generators (geometry-aware V^2-Anchor and appearance-guided V^2-Visual) with multi-expert design and cyclic consistency selection, achieving SOTA performance on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-view object correspondence faces challenges from drastic viewpoint and appearance variations, making existing segmentation models like SAM2 non-trivial to apply directly.

Method: Two complementary prompt generators: V^2-Anchor for geometry-aware coordinate-based prompting, and V^2-Visual for appearance-guided feature alignment. Uses multi-expert design with Post-hoc Cyclic Consistency Selector for adaptive expert selection.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art performance on Ego-Exo4D (ego-exo object correspondence), DAVIS-2017 (video object tracking), and HANDAL-X (robotic-ready cross-view correspondence).

Conclusion: V^2-SAM successfully adapts SAM2 for cross-view correspondence through unified framework with complementary geometry and appearance cues, demonstrating effectiveness across diverse applications.

Abstract: Cross-view object correspondence, exemplified by the representative task of ego-exo object correspondence, aims to establish consistent associations of the same object across different viewpoints (e.g., ego-centric and exo-centric). This task poses significant challenges due to drastic viewpoint and appearance variations, making existing segmentation models, such as SAM2, non-trivial to apply directly. To address this, we present V^2-SAM, a unified cross-view object correspondence framework that adapts SAM2 from single-view segmentation to cross-view correspondence through two complementary prompt generators. Specifically, the Cross-View Anchor Prompt Generator (V^2-Anchor), built upon DINOv3 features, establishes geometry-aware correspondences and, for the first time, unlocks coordinate-based prompting for SAM2 in cross-view scenarios, while the Cross-View Visual Prompt Generator (V^2-Visual) enhances appearance-guided cues via a novel visual prompt matcher that aligns ego-exo representations from both feature and structural perspectives. To effectively exploit the strengths of both prompts, we further adopt a multi-expert design and introduce a Post-hoc Cyclic Consistency Selector (PCCS) that adaptively selects the most reliable expert based on cyclic consistency. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of V^2-SAM, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on Ego-Exo4D (ego-exo object correspondence), DAVIS-2017 (video object tracking), and HANDAL-X (robotic-ready cross-view correspondence).

### [22] [Test-Time Alignment of Text-to-Image Diffusion Models via Null-Text Embedding Optimisation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20889)
*Taehoon Kim,Henry Gouk,Timothy Hospedales*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Null-TTA aligns diffusion models by optimizing the unconditional embedding in classifier-free guidance, preventing reward hacking while achieving state-of-the-art test-time alignment and maintaining cross-reward generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time alignment methods tend to either under-optimize or over-optimize (reward hack) the target reward function, exploiting non-semantic noise patterns rather than achieving meaningful semantic alignment.

Method: Optimize the unconditional embedding in classifier-free guidance rather than manipulating latent or noise variables, leveraging the structured semantic nature of the text embedding space to ensure alignment occurs on a semantically coherent manifold.

Result: Null-TTA achieves state-of-the-art target test-time alignment while maintaining strong cross-reward generalization, preventing reward hacking by avoiding exploitation of non-semantic noise patterns.

Conclusion: Semantic-space optimization through unconditional embedding manipulation establishes an effective and principled novel paradigm for test-time alignment in diffusion models.

Abstract: Test-time alignment (TTA) aims to adapt models to specific rewards during inference. However, existing methods tend to either under-optimise or over-optimise (reward hack) the target reward function. We propose Null-Text Test-Time Alignment (Null-TTA), which aligns diffusion models by optimising the unconditional embedding in classifier-free guidance, rather than manipulating latent or noise variables. Due to the structured semantic nature of the text embedding space, this ensures alignment occurs on a semantically coherent manifold and prevents reward hacking (exploiting non-semantic noise patterns to improve the reward). Since the unconditional embedding in classifier-free guidance serves as the anchor for the model's generative distribution, Null-TTA directly steers model's generative distribution towards the target reward rather than just adjusting the samples, even without updating model parameters. Thanks to these desirable properties, we show that Null-TTA achieves state-of-the-art target test-time alignment while maintaining strong cross-reward generalisation. This establishes semantic-space optimisation as an effective and principled novel paradigm for TTA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GaINeR is a geometry-aware implicit neural representation for 2D images that combines trainable Gaussian distributions with neural networks, enabling continuous representation, interpretable structure, and local editing capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional INRs lack explicit geometric structure and have limited capabilities for local editing or integration with physical simulation, restricting their use in dynamic or interactive settings.

Method: Proposes GaINeR framework that retrieves K nearest Gaussians for given image coordinates, aggregates distance-weighted embeddings, and predicts RGB values via neural network.

Result: Enables continuous image representation with interpretable geometric structure and flexible local editing capabilities.

Conclusion: GaINeR provides a foundation for physically aware and interactive image manipulation by combining geometric structure with neural representations.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have become an essential tool for modeling continuous 2D images, enabling high-fidelity reconstruction, super-resolution, and compression. Popular architectures such as SIREN, WIRE, and FINER demonstrate the potential of INR for capturing fine-grained image details. However, traditional INRs often lack explicit geometric structure and have limited capabilities for local editing or integration with physical simulation, restricting their applicability in dynamic or interactive settings. To address these limitations, we propose GaINeR: Geometry-Aware Implicit Network Representation, a novel framework for 2D images that combines trainable Gaussian distributions with a neural network-based INR. For a given image coordinate, the model retrieves the K nearest Gaussians, aggregates distance-weighted embeddings, and predicts the RGB value via a neural network. This design enables continuous image representation, interpretable geometric structure, and flexible local editing, providing a foundation for physically aware and interactive image manipulation. The official implementation of our method is publicly available at https://github.com/WJakubowska/GaINeR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning model successfully restores standard-dose MRI quality from low-dose (10-30%) contrast agent images, enabling accurate vestibular schwannoma detection and segmentation with significantly reduced contrast dose.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce contrast agent dose in MRI scans while maintaining diagnostic image quality, particularly for cerebellopontine angle cistern imaging in vestibular schwannoma patients.

Method: Multi-center retrospective study using T1 and T1ce MRI scans to simulate low-dose images, then training deep learning models to restore standard-dose quality from these low-dose simulations.

Result: DL restoration improved image quality metrics (SSIM from 0.639 to 0.993, PSNR from 21.6 to 41.4 dB) and segmentation performance (Dice from 0.673 to 0.734) at 10% input dose. Radiologist evaluation showed excellent image quality at 10-30% dose levels.

Conclusion: Deep learning enables reliable lesion detection and diagnostic characterization with only 10-30% of standard contrast agent dose, significantly reducing patient exposure while maintaining clinical utility.

Abstract: Objectives: To evaluate a deep learning (DL) model for reducing the agent dose of contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI (T1ce) of the cerebellopontine angle (CPA) cistern. Materials and methods: In this multi-center retrospective study, T1 and T1ce of vestibular schwannoma (VS) patients were used to simulate low-dose T1ce with varying reductions of contrast agent dose. DL models were trained to restore standard-dose T1ce from the low-dose simulation. The image quality and segmentation performance of the DL-restored T1ce were evaluated. A head and neck radiologist was asked to rate DL-restored images in multiple aspects, including image quality and diagnostic characterization. Results: 203 MRI studies from 72 VS patients (mean age, 58.51 \pm 14.73, 39 men) were evaluated. As the input dose increased, the structural similarity index measure of the restored T1ce increased from 0.639 \pm 0.113 to 0.993 \pm 0.009, and the peak signal-to-noise ratio increased from 21.6 \pm 3.73 dB to 41.4 \pm 4.84 dB. At 10% input dose, using DL-restored T1ce for segmentation improved the Dice from 0.673 to 0.734, the 95% Hausdorff distance from 2.38 mm to 2.07 mm, and the average surface distance from 1.00 mm to 0.59 mm. Both DL-restored T1ce from 10% and 30% input doses showed excellent images, with the latter being considered more informative. Conclusion: The DL model improved the image quality of low-dose MRI of the CPA cistern, which makes lesion detection and diagnostic characterization possible with 10% - 30% of the standard dose.

TL;DR: Smooth regularization using Gaussian Random Walk improves video recognition by enforcing temporal coherence in lightweight models, achieving 3.8-6.4% accuracy gains on Kinetics-600.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To instill strong temporal inductive bias in video recognition models, particularly benefiting lightweight architectures by better capturing natural temporal coherence in videos.

Method: Proposes smooth regularization technique that models changes in intermediate-layer embeddings of consecutive frames as Gaussian Random Walk, penalizing abrupt representational shifts and promoting low-acceleration solutions.

Result: Achieves 3.8-6.4% accuracy improvement on Kinetics-600. MoViNets improve state-of-the-art by 3.8-6.1% within FLOP constraints, while MobileNetV3 and MoViNets-Stream gain 4.9-6.4% over prior models with comparable memory footprints.

Conclusion: The smooth regularization technique effectively enhances temporal modeling in lightweight video recognition architectures, significantly improving performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: We propose a smooth regularization technique that instills a strong temporal inductive bias in video recognition models, particularly benefiting lightweight architectures. Our method encourages smoothness in the intermediate-layer embeddings of consecutive frames by modeling their changes as a Gaussian Random Walk (GRW). This penalizes abrupt representational shifts, thereby promoting low-acceleration solutions that better align with the natural temporal coherence inherent in videos. By leveraging this enforced smoothness, lightweight models can more effectively capture complex temporal dynamics. Applied to such models, our technique yields a 3.8% to 6.4% accuracy improvement on Kinetics-600. Notably, the MoViNets model family trained with our smooth regularization improves the current state of the art by 3.8% to 6.1% within their respective FLOP constraints, while MobileNetV3 and the MoViNets-Stream family achieve gains of 4.9% to 6.4% over prior state-of-the-art models with comparable memory footprints.

*Biagio La Rosa,Leilani H. Gilpin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework for open vocabulary compositional explanations of neurons in vision models using semantic segmentation masks instead of human-annotated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitation of existing compositional explanations that rely on human-annotated datasets, restricting their applicability to specific domains and predefined concepts.

Method: Three-step framework: 1) specify arbitrary concepts, 2) generate semantic segmentation masks using open vocabulary models, 3) derive compositional explanations from these masks.

Result: The framework enables probing neurons for arbitrary concepts and datasets, provides flexibility in explanations, and shows comparable performance to previous methods while expanding capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses the limitations of human-annotated compositional explanations by enabling open vocabulary analysis of neuron behavior across arbitrary concepts and datasets.

Abstract: Neurons are the fundamental building blocks of deep neural networks, and their interconnections allow AI to achieve unprecedented results. Motivated by the goal of understanding how neurons encode information, compositional explanations leverage logical relationships between concepts to express the spatial alignment between neuron activations and human knowledge. However, these explanations rely on human-annotated datasets, restricting their applicability to specific domains and predefined concepts. This paper addresses this limitation by introducing a framework for the vision domain that allows users to probe neurons for arbitrary concepts and datasets. Specifically, the framework leverages masks generated by open vocabulary semantic segmentation to compute open vocabulary compositional explanations. The proposed framework consists of three steps: specifying arbitrary concepts, generating semantic segmentation masks using open vocabulary models, and deriving compositional explanations from these masks. The paper compares the proposed framework with previous methods for computing compositional explanations both in terms of quantitative metrics and human interpretability, analyzes the differences in explanations when shifting from human-annotated data to model-annotated data, and showcases the additional capabilities provided by the framework in terms of flexibility of the explanations with respect to the tasks and properties of interest.

*Henry Marichal,Joaquin Blanco,Diego Passarella,Gregory Randall*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UruDendro4 dataset for tree-ring analysis, provides baseline performance using DeepCS-TRD method, and demonstrates improved generalization when training models with this dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual tree-ring measurement is time-consuming and imprecise, and there's scarcity of wood cross-section data for automated analysis.

Method: Created UruDendro4 dataset with 102 Pinus taeda L. samples annotated with annual growth rings from multiple stem heights. Used DeepCS-TRD method for automatic ring detection and conducted ablation experiments.

Result: DeepCS-TRD achieved mean Average Precision of 0.838, mean Average Recall of 0.782, and Adapted Rand Error of 0.084. Training with this dataset improved model generalization.

Conclusion: UruDendro4 enables volumetric modeling of annual growth and provides a valuable resource for developing automated tree-ring detection methods with improved performance.

Abstract: Tree-ring growth represents the annual wood increment for a tree, and quantifying it allows researchers to assess which silvicultural practices are best suited for each species. Manual measurement of this growth is time-consuming and often imprecise, as it is typically performed along 4 to 8 radial directions on a cross-sectional disc. In recent years, automated algorithms and datasets have emerged to enhance accuracy and automate the delineation of annual rings in cross-sectional images.
  To address the scarcity of wood cross-section data, we introduce the UruDendro4 dataset, a collection of 102 image samples of Pinus taeda L., each manually annotated with annual growth rings. Unlike existing public datasets, UruDendro4 includes samples extracted at multiple heights along the stem, allowing for the volumetric modeling of annual growth using manually delineated rings. This dataset (images and annotations) allows the development of volumetric models for annual wood estimation based on cross-sectional imagery.
  Additionally, we provide a performance baseline for automatic ring detection on this dataset using state-of-the-art methods. The highest performance was achieved by the DeepCS-TRD method, with a mean Average Precision of 0.838, a mean Average Recall of 0.782, and an Adapted Rand Error score of 0.084. A series of ablation experiments were conducted to empirically validate the final parameter configuration. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that training a learning model including this dataset improves the model's generalization in the tree-ring detection task.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BUSTR is a multitask vision-language framework that generates breast ultrasound reports without paired image-report data by using structured descriptors and radiomics features, improving both automatic metrics and clinical efficacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated radiology report generation for breast ultrasound is limited by lack of paired image-report datasets and hallucination risks from large language models.

Method: Constructs reports from structured descriptors (BI-RADS, pathology, histology) and radiomics features, uses multi-head Swin encoder with multitask loss, and aligns visual/textual tokens via dual-level objective combining token-level cross-entropy with cosine-similarity alignment loss.

Result: Consistently improves standard natural language generation metrics and clinical efficacy metrics across two BUS datasets (BrEaST and BUS-BRA), particularly for key targets like BI-RADS category and pathology.

Conclusion: Descriptor-aware vision model trained with combined token-level and alignment loss improves report metrics and clinical efficacy without requiring paired image-report data.

Abstract: Automated radiology report generation (RRG) for breast ultrasound (BUS) is limited by the lack of paired image-report datasets and the risk of hallucinations from large language models. We propose BUSTR, a multitask vision-language framework that generates BUS reports without requiring paired image-report supervision. BUSTR constructs reports from structured descriptors (e.g., BI-RADS, pathology, histology) and radiomics features, learns descriptor-aware visual representations with a multi-head Swin encoder trained using a multitask loss over dataset-specific descriptor sets, and aligns visual and textual tokens via a dual-level objective that combines token-level cross-entropy with a cosine-similarity alignment loss between input and output representations. We evaluate BUSTR on two public BUS datasets, BrEaST and BUS-BRA, which differ in size and available descriptors. Across both datasets, BUSTR consistently improves standard natural language generation metrics and clinical efficacy metrics, particularly for key targets such as BI-RADS category and pathology. Our results show that this descriptor-aware vision model, trained with a combined token-level and alignment loss, improves both automatic report metrics and clinical efficacy without requiring paired image-report data.

### [29] [Beyond Realism: Learning the Art of Expressive Composition with StickerNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20957)
*Haoming Lu,David Kocharian,Humphrey Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StickerNet introduces expressive image composition focusing on artistic/playful placements rather than realism, using real-world editing data from online platforms to predict placement parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional image composition focuses on realism, but modern content creation often aims for artistic, playful, or socially engaging compositions that don't preserve realism, reflecting actual user behavior on creative platforms.

Method: Two-stage framework: first determines composition type, then predicts placement parameters (opacity, mask, location, scale). Dataset built from 1.8M real editing actions from online platform, ensuring alignment with authentic user behavior.

Result: Outperforms common baselines and closely matches human placement behavior in user studies and quantitative evaluations, demonstrating effectiveness of learning from real-world editing patterns despite task ambiguity.

Conclusion: Introduces new direction in visual understanding emphasizing expressiveness and user intent over realism, showing value of grounding computer vision tasks in authentic user behavior from creative platforms.

Abstract: As a widely used operation in image editing workflows, image composition has traditionally been studied with a focus on achieving visual realism and semantic plausibility. However, in practical editing scenarios of the modern content creation landscape, many compositions are not intended to preserve realism. Instead, users of online platforms motivated by gaining community recognition often aim to create content that is more artistic, playful, or socially engaging. Taking inspiration from this observation, we define the expressive composition task, a new formulation of image composition that embraces stylistic diversity and looser placement logic, reflecting how users edit images on real-world creative platforms. To address this underexplored problem, we present StickerNet, a two-stage framework that first determines the composition type, then predicts placement parameters such as opacity, mask, location, and scale accordingly. Unlike prior work that constructs datasets by simulating object placements on real images, we directly build our dataset from 1.8 million editing actions collected on an anonymous online visual creation and editing platform, each reflecting user-community validated placement decisions. This grounding in authentic editing behavior ensures strong alignment between task definition and training supervision. User studies and quantitative evaluations show that StickerNet outperforms common baselines and closely matches human placement behavior, demonstrating the effectiveness of learning from real-world editing patterns despite the inherent ambiguity of the task. This work introduces a new direction in visual understanding that emphasizes expressiveness and user intent over realism.

*Md Adnan Arefeen,Biplob Debnath,Srimat Chakradhar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TrafficLens is a novel algorithm that accelerates multi-camera traffic video analysis by using sequential VLM processing with overlapping camera coverage and object-level similarity detection to reduce redundant computations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches using LLMs with RAG for traffic analysis require time-consuming video-to-text conversion via VLMs, causing delays in timely traffic insights and incident investigation.

Method: Uses sequential VLM processing across overlapping camera areas, iteratively applying VLMs with varying token limits and using previous outputs as prompts. Includes object-level similarity detector to bypass redundant VLM invocations.

Result: Experimental results show TrafficLens reduces video-to-text conversion time by up to 4× while maintaining information accuracy on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: TrafficLens provides an efficient solution for multi-camera traffic intersection analysis, significantly speeding up processing while preserving analytical quality.

Abstract: Traffic cameras are essential in urban areas, playing a crucial role in intelligent transportation systems. Multiple cameras at intersections enhance law enforcement capabilities, traffic management, and pedestrian safety. However, efficiently managing and analyzing multi-camera feeds poses challenges due to the vast amount of data. Analyzing such huge video data requires advanced analytical tools. While Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, equipped with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, excel in text-based tasks, integrating them into traffic video analysis demands converting video data into text using a Vision-Language Model (VLM), which is time-consuming and delays the timely utilization of traffic videos for generating insights and investigating incidents. To address these challenges, we propose TrafficLens, a tailored algorithm for multi-camera traffic intersections. TrafficLens employs a sequential approach, utilizing overlapping coverage areas of cameras. It iteratively applies VLMs with varying token limits, using previous outputs as prompts for subsequent cameras, enabling rapid generation of detailed textual descriptions while reducing processing time. Additionally, TrafficLens intelligently bypasses redundant VLM invocations through an object-level similarity detector. Experimental results with real-world datasets demonstrate that TrafficLens reduces video-to-text conversion time by up to $4\times$ while maintaining information accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Privacy-preserving federated learning framework combining Vision Transformers with homomorphic encryption for secure multi-institutional histopathology classification, achieving 30x communication reduction while preventing model inversion attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy regulations like HIPAA prohibit direct patient data sharing in healthcare, and conventional federated learning gradients remain vulnerable to reconstruction attacks that can expose sensitive medical information.

Method: Combines Vision Transformers (ViT) with homomorphic encryption (HE), using ViT CLS tokens as compact 768-dimensional feature representations that are encrypted using CKKS homomorphic encryption before transmission to the server.

Result: Encrypting CLS tokens achieves 30x communication reduction compared to gradient encryption. Framework prevents model inversion attacks (which achieve PSNR: 52.26 dB, SSIM: 0.999, NMI: 0.741 on gradients) while requiring only 326 KB encrypted data per round. Achieves 96.12% accuracy unencrypted and 90.02% encrypted.

Conclusion: The proposed CLS-protected HE approach provides strong privacy guarantees against reconstruction attacks while enabling encrypted inference directly on ciphertexts, making it suitable for privacy-preserving collaborative healthcare machine learning.

Abstract: Collaborative machine learning across healthcare institutions promises improved diagnostic accuracy by leveraging diverse datasets, yet privacy regulations such as HIPAA prohibit direct patient data sharing. While federated learning (FL) enables decentralized training without raw data exchange, recent studies show that model gradients in conventional FL remain vulnerable to reconstruction attacks, potentially exposing sensitive medical information. This paper presents a privacy-preserving federated learning framework combining Vision Transformers (ViT) with homomorphic encryption (HE) for secure multi-institutional histopathology classification. The approach leverages the ViT CLS token as a compact 768-dimensional feature representation for secure aggregation, encrypting these tokens using CKKS homomorphic encryption before transmission to the server. We demonstrate that encrypting CLS tokens achieves a 30-fold communication reduction compared to gradient encryption while maintaining strong privacy guarantees. Through evaluation on a three-client federated setup for lung cancer histopathology classification, we show that gradients are highly susceptible to model inversion attacks (PSNR: 52.26 dB, SSIM: 0.999, NMI: 0.741), enabling near-perfect image reconstruction. In contrast, the proposed CLS-protected HE approach prevents such attacks while enabling encrypted inference directly on ciphertexts, requiring only 326 KB of encrypted data transmission per aggregation round. The framework achieves 96.12 percent global classification accuracy in the unencrypted domain and 90.02 percent in the encrypted domain.

*Yingying Deng,Xiangyu He,Fan Tang,Weiming Dong,Xucheng Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an inversion-free style transfer framework using dual rectified flows that eliminates the need for computationally expensive inversion processes, enabling style transfer with only forward passes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing diffusion-based style transfer methods that rely on computationally intensive inversion processes, which compromise efficiency and introduce visual distortions when inversion is inaccurate.

Method: Uses dual rectified flows to predict content and style trajectories in parallel, then fuses them through dynamic midpoint interpolation that integrates velocities from both paths while adapting to the evolving stylized image. Includes attention injection for style integration guidance.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate generalization across diverse styles and content, providing robust fusion that avoids shortcomings of naive overlays while enhancing visual fidelity, content preservation, and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed inversion-free framework offers an effective and efficient pipeline for style transfer that eliminates computational bottlenecks of inversion-based methods while maintaining high-quality results.

Abstract: Style transfer, a pivotal task in image processing, synthesizes visually compelling images by seamlessly blending realistic content with artistic styles, enabling applications in photo editing and creative design. While mainstream training-free diffusion-based methods have greatly advanced style transfer in recent years, their reliance on computationally inversion processes compromises efficiency and introduces visual distortions when inversion is inaccurate. To address these limitations, we propose a novel \textit{inversion-free} style transfer framework based on dual rectified flows, which tackles the challenge of finding an unknown stylized distribution from two distinct inputs (content and style images), \textit{only with forward pass}. Our approach predicts content and style trajectories in parallel, then fuses them through a dynamic midpoint interpolation that integrates velocities from both paths while adapting to the evolving stylized image. By jointly modeling the content, style, and stylized distributions, our velocity field design achieves robust fusion and avoids the shortcomings of naive overlays. Attention injection further guides style integration, enhancing visual fidelity, content preservation, and computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate generalization across diverse styles and content, providing an effective and efficient pipeline for style transfer.

*Yu-Huan Wu,Zi-Xuan Zhu,Yan Wang,Liangli Zhen,Deng-Ping Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Ref-COD framework that distills references into class-prototype memory during training and synthesizes reference vectors at inference without needing actual reference images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Ref-COD systems require reference images at test time, which limits deployability, adds latency, and increases data-collection burden.

Method: Maintains EMA-updated prototypes per category, predicts mixture weights from queries to synthesize guidance vectors, and uses bidirectional attention alignment to bridge representation gaps between reference statistics and camouflaged query features.

Result: Achieves competitive or superior performance compared with state-of-the-art methods on the R2C7K benchmark.

Conclusion: Provides a simple, efficient approach to Ref-COD that eliminates the need for mandatory test-time references while maintaining strong performance.

Abstract: Referring Camouflaged Object Detection (Ref-COD) segments specified camouflaged objects in a scene by leveraging a small set of referring images. Though effective, current systems adopt a dual-branch design that requires reference images at test time, which limits deployability and adds latency and data-collection burden. We introduce a Ref-COD framework that distills references into a class-prototype memory during training and synthesizes a reference vector at inference via a query-conditioned mixture of prototypes. Concretely, we maintain an EMA-updated prototype per category and predict mixture weights from the query to produce a guidance vector without any test-time references. To bridge the representation gap between reference statistics and camouflaged query features, we propose a bidirectional attention alignment module that adapts both the query features and the class representation. Thus, our approach yields a simple, efficient path to Ref-COD without mandatory references. We evaluate the proposed method on the large-scale R2C7K benchmark. Extensive experiments demonstrate competitive or superior performance of the proposed method compared with recent state-of-the-arts. Code is available at https://github.com/yuhuan-wu/RefOnce.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WavePCNet is a physics-driven network that uses complex amplitude modeling and momentum memory to accurately localize and segment obscured objects from faint light patterns beyond the field of view, outperforming existing methods in challenging low signal-to-noise conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to capture coherent light propagation physics and converge to non-physical solutions under low signal-to-noise conditions, compromising observation stability and reliability for obscured object localization.

Method: Proposes WavePCNet with Tri-Phase Wavefront Complex-Propagation Reprojection for precise coherent propagation modeling, momentum memory mechanism for perturbation suppression, and High-frequency Cross-layer Compensation Enhancement for multi-scale frequency-selective pathways.

Result: Extensive experiments on four physically collected datasets show WavePCNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: WavePCNet successfully addresses the challenges of obscured object perception through physics-driven wavefront propagation modeling, demonstrating superior performance and reliability in complex environmental conditions.

Abstract: Accurately localizing and segmenting obscured objects from faint light patterns beyond the field of view is highly challenging due to multiple scattering and medium-induced perturbations. Most existing methods, based on real-valued modeling or local convolutional operations, are inadequate for capturing the underlying physics of coherent light propagation. Moreover, under low signal-to-noise conditions, these methods often converge to non-physical solutions, severely compromising the stability and reliability of the observation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel physics-driven Wavefront Propagating Compensation Network (WavePCNet) to simulate wavefront propagation and enhance the perception of obscured objects. This WavePCNet integrates the Tri-Phase Wavefront Complex-Propagation Reprojection (TriWCP) to incorporate complex amplitude transfer operators to precisely constrain coherent propagation behavior, along with a momentum memory mechanism to effectively suppress the accumulation of perturbations. Additionally, a High-frequency Cross-layer Compensation Enhancement is introduced to construct frequency-selective pathways with multi-scale receptive fields and dynamically model structural consistency across layers, further boosting the model's robustness and interpretability under complex environmental conditions. Extensive experiments conducted on four physically collected datasets demonstrate that WavePCNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across both accuracy and robustness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GuardTrace-VL is a vision-aware safety auditor that monitors multimodal reasoning models' full Question-Thinking-Answer pipeline to detect unsafe content in intermediate reasoning traces, achieving 93.1% F1 score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal safety guards only evaluate input questions and final answers, neglecting unsafe content that emerges during intermediate reasoning processes, creating deployment risks.

Method: Developed GuardTrace-VL with joint image-text analysis, constructed GuardTrace dataset via diverse prompting and human verification, and used three-stage progressive training with data refinement.

Result: Achieved 93.1% F1 score on unsafe reasoning detection, representing 13.5% improvement over previous multimodal safety defense methods.

Conclusion: GuardTrace-VL effectively detects unsafe content in multimodal reasoning traces and addresses the oversight in existing safety evaluation methods.

Abstract: Multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs) are increasingly deployed for vision-language tasks that produce explicit intermediate rationales. However, reasoning traces can contain unsafe content even when the final answer is non-harmful, creating deployment risks. Existing multimodal safety guards primarily evaluate only the input question and the final answer, neglecting the intermediate reasoning process. This oversight allows undetected harm, such as biased inferences or policy-violating use of visual context, to emerge during reasoning. We introduce GuardTrace-VL, a vision-aware safety auditor that monitors the full Question-Thinking-Answer (QTA) pipeline via joint image-text analysis, enabling detection of unsafe content as it emerges in the reasoning stage. To support training and evaluation, we construct the GuardTrace dataset, which is generated through diverse prompting strategies and refined via a MLRM- and human-based voting and verification pipeline. Furthermore, we propose a three-stage progressive training scheme combined with the data refinement process, enabling the model to learn nuanced and context-dependent safety preferences according to different risk levels. On our proposed test set covering both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, GuardTrace-VL model achieves an F1 score of 93.1% on unsafe reasoning detection tasks, representing a 13.5% improvement in F1 score compared to the previous strongest multimodal safety defense methods. The codes will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Layered image representation enables independent editing of elements for greater flexibility in content creation, but decomposing single images into layers remains challenging due to limited methods and data.

Method: Adapt a diffusion-based inpainting model for layer decomposition using lightweight finetuning, with a novel multi-modal context fusion module having linear attention complexity to preserve detail in latent space. Trained on synthetic dataset from open-source assets.

Result: The model achieves superior performance in object removal and occlusion recovery.

Conclusion: The approach unlocks new possibilities in downstream editing and creative applications by effectively decomposing images into layers.

Abstract: Images can be viewed as layered compositions, foreground objects over background, with potential occlusions. This layered representation enables independent editing of elements, offering greater flexibility for content creation. Despite the progress in large generative models, decomposing a single image into layers remains challenging due to limited methods and data. We observe a strong connection between layer decomposition and in/outpainting tasks, and propose adapting a diffusion-based inpainting model for layer decomposition using lightweight finetuning. To further preserve detail in the latent space, we introduce a novel multi-modal context fusion module with linear attention complexity. Our model is trained purely on a synthetic dataset constructed from open-source assets and achieves superior performance in object removal and occlusion recovery, unlocking new possibilities in downstream editing and creative applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing news image captioning methods struggle with incomplete information coverage, weak cross-modal alignment, and suboptimal visual-entity grounding, limiting their journalistic informativeness.

Method: MERGE constructs an entity-centric multimodal knowledge base (EMKB) integrating textual, visual, and structured knowledge. It uses multistage hypothesis-caption strategy for cross-modal alignment and dynamic retrieval guided by image content for visual-entity matching.

Result: Significant improvements on GoodNews (+6.84 CIDEr, +4.14 F1) and NYTimes800k (+1.16 CIDEr, +2.64 F1) datasets. Strong generalization on Visual News (+20.17 CIDEr, +6.22 F1), demonstrating robustness and domain adaptability.

Conclusion: MERGE effectively addresses key challenges in news image captioning through its multimodal entity-aware approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance and strong generalization capabilities across different datasets.

Abstract: News image captioning aims to produce journalistically informative descriptions by combining visual content with contextual cues from associated articles. Despite recent advances, existing methods struggle with three key challenges: (1) incomplete information coverage, (2) weak cross-modal alignment, and (3) suboptimal visual-entity grounding. To address these issues, we introduce MERGE, the first Multimodal Entity-aware Retrieval-augmented GEneration framework for news image captioning. MERGE constructs an entity-centric multimodal knowledge base (EMKB) that integrates textual, visual, and structured knowledge, enabling enriched background retrieval. It improves cross-modal alignment through a multistage hypothesis-caption strategy and enhances visual-entity matching via dynamic retrieval guided by image content. Extensive experiments on GoodNews and NYTimes800k show that MERGE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with CIDEr gains of +6.84 and +1.16 in caption quality, and F1-score improvements of +4.14 and +2.64 in named entity recognition. Notably, MERGE also generalizes well to the unseen Visual News dataset, achieving +20.17 in CIDEr and +6.22 in F1-score, demonstrating strong robustness and domain adaptability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MetaRank is a meta-learning framework that automatically selects the best Model Transferability Estimation (MTE) metric for transfer learning tasks by learning the relationship between dataset characteristics and metric performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MTE metric selection is ad hoc or based on average historical performance, but no single metric works optimally across all target datasets. The effectiveness of MTE metrics is highly task-dependent.

Method: Formulates metric selection as a learning-to-rank problem. Uses pretrained language models to encode textual descriptions of datasets and metrics into a shared semantic space. Trains a meta-predictor offline on diverse meta-tasks with listwise optimization to prioritize top-performing metrics.

Result: Extensive experiments across 11 pretrained models and 11 target datasets demonstrate strong effectiveness of MetaRank in selecting appropriate MTE metrics for new datasets.

Conclusion: MetaRank provides an efficient, task-aware approach for automatic MTE metric selection, overcoming the limitations of ad hoc or average-based selection methods in transfer learning.

Abstract: Selecting an appropriate pre-trained source model is a critical, yet computationally expensive, task in transfer learning. Model Transferability Estimation (MTE) methods address this by providing efficient proxy metrics to rank models without full fine-tuning. In practice, the choice of which MTE metric to use is often ad hoc or guided simply by a metric's average historical performance. However, we observe that the effectiveness of MTE metrics is highly task-dependent and no single metric is universally optimal across all target datasets. To address this gap, we introduce MetaRank, a meta-learning framework for automatic, task-aware MTE metric selection. We formulate metric selection as a learning-to-rank problem. Rather than relying on conventional meta-features, MetaRank encodes textual descriptions of both datasets and MTE metrics using a pretrained language model, embedding them into a shared semantic space. A meta-predictor is then trained offline on diverse meta-tasks to learn the intricate relationship between dataset characteristics and metric mechanisms, optimized with a listwise objective that prioritizes correctly ranking the top-performing metrics. During the subsequent online phase, MetaRank efficiently ranks the candidate MTE metrics for a new, unseen target dataset based on its textual description, enabling practitioners to select the most appropriate metric a priori. Extensive experiments across 11 pretrained models and 11 target datasets demonstrate the strong effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: Proposes a novel trustworthy multi-view classification framework using prototypes to represent neighbor structures, enabling efficient cross-view consensus discovery and dynamic alignment of intra- and inter-view relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TMVC methods have high computational costs due to dense neighbor relationships, cannot ensure consistency across views, and lack guarantees for learned neighbor structures in class space, undermining trustworthiness.

Method: Introduces prototypes to represent neighbor structures of each view, simplifies intra-view neighbor relation learning, and enables dynamic alignment of intra- and inter-view structures for cross-view consensus discovery.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple public multi-view datasets show competitive downstream performance and robustness compared to prevalent TMVC methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses limitations of existing TMVC approaches by providing more efficient and consistent discovery of cross-view consensus through prototype-based neighbor structure representation.

Abstract: Trustworthy multi-view classification (TMVC) addresses the challenge of achieving reliable decision-making in complex scenarios where multi-source information is heterogeneous, inconsistent, or even conflicting. Existing TMVC approaches predominantly rely on globally dense neighbor relationships to model intra-view dependencies, leading to high computational costs and an inability to directly ensure consistency across inter-view relationships. Furthermore, these methods typically aggregate evidence from different views through manually assigned weights, lacking guarantees that the learned multi-view neighbor structures are consistent within the class space, thus undermining the trustworthiness of classification outcomes. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel TMVC framework that introduces prototypes to represent the neighbor structures of each view. By simplifying the learning of intra-view neighbor relations and enabling dynamic alignment of intra- and inter-view structure, our approach facilitates more efficient and consistent discovery of cross-view consensus. Extensive experiments on multiple public multi-view datasets demonstrate that our method achieves competitive downstream performance and robustness compared to prevalent TMVC methods.

*Qirui Yang,Yang Yang,Ying Zeng,Xiaobin Hu,Bo Li,Huanjing Yue,Jingyu Yang,Peng-Tao Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CameraMaster is a unified camera-aware framework for image retouching that explicitly decouples camera directives and integrates parameter embeddings to achieve precise camera control while maintaining physical consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods either rely on ambiguous text prompts that hinder precise camera control or train separate heads that compromise scalability and multi-parameter composition, creating a need for a unified approach.

Method: CameraMaster decouples camera directives and integrates two information streams: directive representation and parameter embedding. It modulates camera directives with parameter embeddings, injects them via cross-attention, and uses conditioning signals for unified layer-wise modulation during denoising.

Result: CameraMaster produces monotonic and near-linear responses to parameter variations, supports seamless multi-parameter composition, and significantly outperforms existing methods on a 78K image-prompt dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses limitations of existing methods by providing precise camera parameter control while maintaining physical consistency and scalability in image retouching.

Abstract: Text-guided diffusion models have greatly advanced image editing and generation. However, achieving physically consistent image retouching with precise parameter control (e.g., exposure, white balance, zoom) remains challenging. Existing methods either rely solely on ambiguous and entangled text prompts, which hinders precise camera control, or train separate heads/weights for parameter adjustment, which compromises scalability, multi-parameter composition, and sensitivity to subtle variations. To address these limitations, we propose CameraMaster, a unified camera-aware framework for image retouching. The key idea is to explicitly decouple the camera directive and then coherently integrate two critical information streams: a directive representation that captures the photographer's intent, and a parameter embedding that encodes precise camera settings. CameraMaster first uses the camera parameter embedding to modulate both the camera directive and the content semantics. The modulated directive is then injected into the content features via cross-attention, yielding a strongly camera-sensitive semantic context. In addition, the directive and camera embeddings are injected as conditioning and gating signals into the time embedding, enabling unified, layer-wise modulation throughout the denoising process and enforcing tight semantic-parameter alignment. To train and evaluate CameraMaster, we construct a large-scale dataset of 78K image-prompt pairs annotated with camera parameters. Extensive experiments show that CameraMaster produces monotonic and near-linear responses to parameter variations, supports seamless multi-parameter composition, and significantly outperforms existing methods.

TL;DR: CaptionQA is a utility-based benchmark that evaluates image captions by measuring how well they support downstream tasks across 4 domains, revealing significant gaps between image and caption utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation practices miss whether captions can effectively stand-in for images in real downstream tasks, so there's a need for a utility-based benchmark.

Method: Built 33,027 densely annotated multiple-choice questions across 4 domains with fine-grained taxonomies, using an LLM to answer questions using captions alone to measure caption utility.

Result: Evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs shows substantial gaps between image and caption utility, with models nearly identical on traditional benchmarks differing by up to 32% in caption utility.

Conclusion: CaptionQA provides a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating caption utility in downstream tasks and reveals current captioning models' limitations in preserving image-level utility.

Abstract: Image captions serve as efficient surrogates for visual content in multimodal systems such as retrieval, recommendation, and multi-step agentic inference pipelines. Yet current evaluation practices miss a fundamental question: Can captions stand-in for images in real downstream tasks? We propose a utility-based benchmark, CaptionQA, to evaluate model-generated captions, where caption quality is measured by how well it supports downstream tasks. CaptionQA is an extensible domain-dependent benchmark covering 4 domains--Natural, Document, E-commerce, and Embodied AI--each with fine-grained taxonomies (25 top-level and 69 subcategories) that identify useful information for domain-specific tasks. CaptionQA builds 33,027 densely annotated multiple-choice questions (50.3 per image on average) that explicitly require visual information to answer, providing a comprehensive probe of caption utility. In our evaluation protocol, an LLM answers these questions using captions alone, directly measuring whether captions preserve image-level utility and are utilizable by a downstream LLM. Evaluating state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals substantial gaps between the image and its caption utility. Notably, models nearly identical on traditional image-QA benchmarks lower by up to 32% in caption utility. We release CaptionQA along with an open-source pipeline for extension to new domains.

Motivation: Existing music-to-dance generation methods have limited generation efficiency, which restricts their ability to support high-fidelity 3D rendering and real-world applications due to insufficient computational headroom.

Method: Combines MeanFlow with Physical Consistency Constraints for high-quality motion generation with few sampling steps, uses BiMamba-based backbone with Channel-Level Cross-Modal Fusion for efficient non-autoregressive generation, and supports interactive motion editing.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on AIST++ and FineDance datasets in both motion quality and generation efficiency (inference speed and memory utilization).

Conclusion: FlowerDance successfully addresses the efficiency limitations of existing methods while maintaining high motion quality, making it suitable for real-world applications requiring high-fidelity 3D rendering.

Abstract: Music-to-dance generation aims to translate auditory signals into expressive human motion, with broad applications in virtual reality, choreography, and digital entertainment. Despite promising progress, the limited generation efficiency of existing methods leaves insufficient computational headroom for high-fidelity 3D rendering, thereby constraining the expressiveness of 3D characters during real-world applications. Thus, we propose FlowerDance, which not only generates refined motion with physical plausibility and artistic expressiveness, but also achieves significant generation efficiency on inference speed and memory utilization . Specifically, FlowerDance combines MeanFlow with Physical Consistency Constraints, which enables high-quality motion generation with only a few sampling steps. Moreover, FlowerDance leverages a simple but efficient model architecture with BiMamba-based backbone and Channel-Level Cross-Modal Fusion, which generates dance with efficient non-autoregressive manner. Meanwhile, FlowerDance supports motion editing, enabling users to interactively refine dance sequences. Extensive experiments on AIST++ and FineDance show that FlowerDance achieves state-of-the-art results in both motion quality and generation efficiency. Code will be released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: LungNoduleAgent is a collaborative multi-agent system for lung CT scan analysis that improves nodule detection, description, and malignancy grading through three specialized modules working sequentially.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal LLMs struggle with accurate nodule morphology description and lack medical expertise integration, limiting their clinical reliability. Multi-agent systems offer potential for balancing generality and precision in medical applications.

Method: Three-module system: Nodule Spotter coordinates detection models to identify nodules; Radiologist integrates localized image description for CT reports; Doctor Agent System performs malignancy reasoning using images, reports, pathology knowledge base, and multi-agent framework.

Result: Outperforms mainstream vision-language models, agent systems, and expert models on two private datasets and public LIDC-IDRI dataset, demonstrating superior nodule diagnosis capabilities.

Conclusion: LungNoduleAgent shows the importance of region-level semantic alignment and multi-agent collaboration in nodule diagnosis, serving as a promising foundational tool for clinical lung nodule analysis.

Abstract: Diagnosing lung cancer typically involves physicians identifying lung nodules in Computed tomography (CT) scans and generating diagnostic reports based on their morphological features and medical expertise. Although advancements have been made in using multimodal large language models for analyzing lung CT scans, challenges remain in accurately describing nodule morphology and incorporating medical expertise. These limitations affect the reliability and effectiveness of these models in clinical settings. Collaborative multi-agent systems offer a promising strategy for achieving a balance between generality and precision in medical applications, yet their potential in pathology has not been thoroughly explored. To bridge these gaps, we introduce LungNoduleAgent, an innovative collaborative multi-agent system specifically designed for analyzing lung CT scans. LungNoduleAgent streamlines the diagnostic process into sequential components, improving precision in describing nodules and grading malignancy through three primary modules. The first module, the Nodule Spotter, coordinates clinical detection models to accurately identify nodules. The second module, the Radiologist, integrates localized image description techniques to produce comprehensive CT reports. Finally, the Doctor Agent System performs malignancy reasoning by using images and CT reports, supported by a pathology knowledge base and a multi-agent system framework. Extensive testing on two private datasets and the public LIDC-IDRI dataset indicates that LungNoduleAgent surpasses mainstream vision-language models, agent systems, and advanced expert models. These results highlight the importance of region-level semantic alignment and multi-agent collaboration in diagnosing nodules. LungNoduleAgent stands out as a promising foundational tool for supporting clinical analyses of lung nodules.

*Hakki Motorcu,Mujdat Cetin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework that combines generative models with explicit physical constraints for spatially varying image deblurring, achieving both physical accuracy and perceptual realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods either produce over-smoothed results with model-based approaches or hallucinate details with generative models. There's a need to bridge the gap between physical accuracy and perceptual quality.

Method: Models degradation as dense continuum of high-dimensional compressed kernels and conditions a ControlNet architecture to guide diffusion sampling with physical constraints.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art model-based and generative methods in challenging, severely blurred scenarios by effectively balancing physical accuracy and perceptual realism.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully reconciles model-based and generative paradigms by taming generative priors with dense physical constraints for superior deblurring performance.

Abstract: Spatially varying image deblurring remains a fundamentally ill-posed problem, especially when degradations arise from complex mixtures of motion and other forms of blur under significant noise. State-of-the-art learning-based approaches generally fall into two paradigms: model-based deep unrolling methods that enforce physical constraints by modeling the degradations, but often produce over-smoothed, artifact-laden textures, and generative models that achieve superior perceptual quality yet hallucinate details due to weak physical constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that uniquely reconciles these paradigms by taming a powerful generative prior with explicit, dense physical constraints. Rather than oversimplifying the degradation field, we model it as a dense continuum of high-dimensional compressed kernels, ensuring that minute variations in motion and other degradation patterns are captured. We leverage this rich descriptor field to condition a ControlNet architecture, strongly guiding the diffusion sampling process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively bridges the gap between physical accuracy and perceptual realism, outperforming state-of-the-art model-based methods as well as generative baselines in challenging, severely blurred scenarios.

TL;DR: MUSE is a unified framework for emotional image generation and editing that uses test-time scaling with an off-the-shelf emotion classifier, optimizing emotional tokens through gradient-based methods and multi-emotion loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Image Emotional Synthesis approaches artificially separate generation and editing tasks, creating inefficiencies and limiting applications where these tasks naturally intertwine, such as therapeutic interventions or storytelling.

Method: Uses test-time scaling strategy with off-the-shelf emotion classifier, gradient-based optimization of emotional tokens, semantic similarity for timing guidance, and multi-emotion loss to reduce interference from inherent emotions.

Result: MUSE performs favorably against all methods for both generation and editing, improving emotional accuracy and semantic diversity while maintaining optimal balance between content, text prompts, and emotional expression.

Conclusion: Establishes a new paradigm for emotion synthesis by unifying generation and editing tasks without requiring additional diffusion model updates or specialized emotional datasets.

Abstract: Images evoke emotions that profoundly influence perception, often prioritized over content. Current Image Emotional Synthesis (IES) approaches artificially separate generation and editing tasks, creating inefficiencies and limiting applications where these tasks naturally intertwine, such as therapeutic interventions or storytelling. In this work, we introduce MUSE, the first unified framework capable of both emotional generation and editing. By adopting a strategy conceptually aligned with Test-Time Scaling (TTS) that widely used in both LLM and diffusion model communities, it avoids the requirement for additional updating diffusion model and specialized emotional synthesis datasets. More specifically, MUSE addresses three key questions in emotional synthesis: (1) HOW to stably guide synthesis by leveraging an off-the-shelf emotion classifier with gradient-based optimization of emotional tokens; (2) WHEN to introduce emotional guidance by identifying the optimal timing using semantic similarity as a supervisory signal; and (3) WHICH emotion to guide synthesis through a multi-emotion loss that reduces interference from inherent and similar emotions. Experimental results show that MUSE performs favorably against all methods for both generation and editing, improving emotional accuracy and semantic diversity while maintaining an optimal balance between desired content, adherence to text prompts, and realistic emotional expression. It establishes a new paradigm for emotion synthesis.

TL;DR: T-NIG model uses Normal Inverse Gamma Distribution with time parameters to generate intermediate and future brain images for Alzheimer's Disease prediction, handling irregular time intervals while maintaining disease characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-term AD predictions face challenges in maintaining disease-related characteristics when dealing with irregular time intervals in sequential imaging data, as time-related distribution aspects reflect disease progression.

Method: T-NIG model employs brain images from two time points, uses coordinate neighborhoods for feature identification, incorporates time parameters into normal inverse gamma distribution, and utilizes uncertainty estimation to reduce epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties.

Result: T-NIG demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in both short-term and long-term prediction tasks, proficiently forecasting disease progression while maintaining disease-related characteristics even with irregular temporal data distribution.

Conclusion: The proposed T-NIG model effectively handles irregular time intervals in sequential brain imaging data for Alzheimer's Disease prediction, maintaining disease characteristics through temporal parameter estimation and uncertainty reduction.

Abstract: Image generation can provide physicians with an imaging diagnosis basis in the prediction of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Recent research has shown that long-term AD predictions by image generation often face difficulties maintaining disease-related characteristics when dealing with irregular time intervals in sequential data. Considering that the time-related aspects of the distribution can reflect changes in disease-related characteristics when images are distributed unevenly, this research proposes a model to estimate the temporal parameter within the Normal Inverse Gamma Distribution (T-NIG) to assist in generating images over the long term. The T-NIG model employs brain images from two different time points to create intermediate brain images, forecast future images, and predict the disease. T-NIG is designed by identifying features using coordinate neighborhoods. It incorporates a time parameter into the normal inverse gamma distribution to understand how features change in brain imaging sequences that have varying time intervals. Additionally, T-NIG utilizes uncertainty estimation to reduce both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties in the model, which arise from insufficient temporal data. In particular, the T-NIG model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in both short-term and long-term prediction tasks within the dataset. Experimental results indicate that T-NIG is proficient in forecasting disease progression while maintaining disease-related characteristics, even when faced with an irregular temporal data distribution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based editing models struggle with accurately interpreting complex user instructions involving compositional relationships, contextual cues, or referring expressions, leading to semantic drift and failed edits.

Method: Propose MIRA, a plug-and-play multimodal reasoning agent that performs editing through iterative perception-reasoning-action loops, using a 150K multimodal tool-use dataset (MIRA-Editing) and two-stage SFT + GRPO training pipeline.

Result: When paired with open-source image editing models, MIRA significantly improves both semantic consistency and perceptual quality, achieving performance comparable to or exceeding proprietary systems like GPT-Image and Nano-Banana.

Conclusion: MIRA effectively addresses the limitations of current diffusion-based editing models by simulating multi-turn human-model interaction processes, enabling more accurate interpretation of complex editing instructions.

Abstract: Instruction-guided image editing offers an intuitive way for users to edit images with natural language. However, diffusion-based editing models often struggle to accurately interpret complex user instructions, especially those involving compositional relationships, contextual cues, or referring expressions, leading to edits that drift semantically or fail to reflect the intended changes. We tackle this problem by proposing MIRA (Multimodal Iterative Reasoning Agent), a lightweight, plug-and-play multimodal reasoning agent that performs editing through an iterative perception-reasoning-action loop, effectively simulating multi-turn human-model interaction processes. Instead of issuing a single prompt or static plan, MIRA predicts atomic edit instructions step by step, using visual feedback to make its decisions. Our 150K multimodal tool-use dataset, MIRA-Editing, combined with a two-stage SFT + GRPO training pipeline, enables MIRA to perform reasoning and editing over complex editing instructions. When paired with open-source image editing models such as Flux.1-Kontext, Step1X-Edit, and Qwen-Image-Edit, MIRA significantly improves both semantic consistency and perceptual quality, achieving performance comparable to or exceeding proprietary systems such as GPT-Image and Nano-Banana.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel iris authentication pipeline using 3D-CNN to capture spatio-temporal features through curriculum learning with triplet and ArcFace loss for robust recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing iris authentication methods struggle with robustness to variations like rotation, scale, reflections, and blur, and fail to effectively leverage spatio-temporal structure of iris patterns.

Method: Splits iris images into sequences of sub-images, processes with 3D-CNN to capture spatial-temporal features, and trains with curriculum learning using triplet and ArcFace loss.

Result: The approach learns rich spatio-temporal representations that improve discriminability in deep metric space, handling challenges like rotation, scale, reflections, and blur.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a robust and generalizable solution for iris authentication by embedding temporal dependencies directly into feature space.

Abstract: Iris authentication algorithms have achieved impressive recognition performance, making them highly promising for real-world applications such as border control, citizen identification, and both criminal investigations and commercial systems. However, their robustness is still challenged by variations in rotation, scale, specular reflections, and defocus blur. In addition, most existing approaches rely on straightforward point-to-point comparisons, typically using cosine or L2 distance, without effectively leveraging the spatio-spatial-temporal structure of iris patterns. To address these limitations, we propose a novel and generalized matching pipeline that learns rich spatio-spatial-temporal representations of iris features. Our approach first splits each iris image along one dimension, generating a sequence of sub-images that serve as input to a 3D-CNN, enabling the network to capture both spatial and spatio-spatial-temporal cues. To further enhance the modeling of spatio-spatial-temporal feature dynamics, we train the model in curriculum manner. This design allows the network to embed temporal dependencies directly into the feature space, improving discriminability in the deep metric domain. The framework is trained end-to-end with triplet and ArcFace loss in a curriculum manner, enforcing highly discriminative embeddings despite challenges like rotation, scale, reflections, and blur. This design yields a robust and generalizable solution for iris authentication.Github code: https://github.com/GeetanjaliGTZ/CLRecogEye

TL;DR: Pygmalion Effect in Vision framework transforms reflective objects into clay-like forms to enable robust 3D reconstruction by suppressing specular reflections while preserving geometric consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reflection remains a major challenge in 3D reconstruction due to the entanglement of appearance and geometry under view-dependent reflections, making it difficult to separate surface properties from lighting effects.

Method: A dual-branch network with BRDF-based reflective branch and clay-guided branch that stabilizes geometry and refines surface normals, trained jointly using synthesized clay-like images as reflection-free supervision.

Result: Substantial improvement in normal accuracy and mesh completeness over existing reflection-handling methods on both synthetic and real datasets.

Conclusion: Seeing by unshining - translating radiance into neutrality - serves as a powerful inductive bias for reflective object geometry learning, enabling more robust 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: Understanding reflection remains a long-standing challenge in 3D reconstruction due to the entanglement of appearance and geometry under view-dependent reflections. In this work, we present the Pygmalion Effect in Vision, a novel framework that metaphorically "sculpts" reflective objects into clay-like forms through image-to-clay translation. Inspired by the myth of Pygmalion, our method learns to suppress specular cues while preserving intrinsic geometric consistency, enabling robust reconstruction from multi-view images containing complex reflections. Specifically, we introduce a dual-branch network in which a BRDF-based reflective branch is complemented by a clay-guided branch that stabilizes geometry and refines surface normals. The two branches are trained jointly using the synthesized clay-like images, which provide a neutral, reflection-free supervision signal that complements the reflective views. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate substantial improvement in normal accuracy and mesh completeness over existing reflection-handling methods. Beyond technical gains, our framework reveals that seeing by unshining, translating radiance into neutrality, can serve as a powerful inductive bias for reflective object geometry learning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radar sensors provide reliable perception in adverse conditions, but existing radar approaches are fragmented and task-specific, preventing transfer across tasks. Foundation models have transformed other domains but remain underexplored for radar sensing.

Result: Proposes localization-aware metrics that assess spatial accuracy beyond traditional detection measures. The model enables fine-grained spatial reasoning and unified scene-level representations.

Conclusion: RadarFM provides a foundation model approach for radar sensing that overcomes task-specific fragmentation and enables transfer learning across different radar perception tasks.

Abstract: Radar sensors provide reliable perception across adverse weather, lighting, and long-range conditions. Recent advances in foundation models have transformed visual and language understanding, yet their integration with radar sensing remains largely underexplored. Existing radar approaches are fragmented and task-specific; each downstream task employs distinct architectures and training objectives, preventing transfer across tasks. In this work, we introduce RadarFM: a radar foundation model that learns unified scene-level representations through structured spatial language supervision. We make two key contributions: (1) a structured caption framework that encodes vehicle distributions in native radar coordinates, and (2) a hash-aware contrastive learning objective that quantifies continuous scene similarity rather than binary matching, enabling fine-grained spatial reasoning. Leveraging the CARLA simulator, we generate large-scale, well-annotated radar datasets across diverse driving scenarios. We also propose localization-aware metrics that assess spatial accuracy beyond traditional detection measures.

TL;DR: EM-KD enhances Efficient Multimodal LLMs using knowledge distillation with vision token alignment and two distillation strategies to overcome unbalanced vision token issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing efficient MLLMs lose visual information through token compression, and prior knowledge distillation methods fail to address fundamental differences in fine-grained vision comprehension caused by unbalanced vision tokens between student and teacher models.

Method: Proposes EM-KD with Hungarian matching algorithm for vision token alignment, then applies two distillation strategies: Vision-Language Affinity Distillation (VLAD) using smooth L1 distance on affinity matrices, and Vision Semantic Distillation (VSD) using reverse KL divergence on vision logits.

Result: EM-KD trained models significantly outperform prior Efficient MLLMs on both accuracy and efficiency across diverse benchmarks, and achieve better performance than previous distillation methods even when equipped with the proposed vision token matching strategy.

Conclusion: EM-KD effectively addresses the vision token imbalance problem in efficient MLLMs through proper alignment and comprehensive distillation strategies, leading to superior performance in multimodal understanding tasks.

Abstract: Efficient Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) compress vision tokens to reduce resource consumption, but the loss of visual information can degrade comprehension capabilities. Although some priors introduce Knowledge Distillation to enhance student models, they overlook the fundamental differences in fine-grained vision comprehension caused by unbalanced vision tokens between the efficient student and vanilla teacher. In this paper, we propose EM-KD, a novel paradigm that enhances the Efficient MLLMs with Knowledge Distillation. To overcome the challenge of unbalanced vision tokens, we first calculate the Manhattan distance between the vision logits of teacher and student, and then align them in the spatial dimension with the Hungarian matching algorithm. After alignment, EM-KD introduces two distillation strategies: 1) Vision-Language Affinity Distillation (VLAD) and 2) Vision Semantic Distillation (VSD). Specifically, VLAD calculates the affinity matrix between text tokens and aligned vision tokens, and minimizes the smooth L1 distance of the student and the teacher affinity matrices. Considering the semantic richness of vision logits in the final layer, VSD employs the reverse KL divergence to measure the discrete probability distributions of the aligned vision logits over the vocabulary space. Comprehensive evaluation on diverse benchmarks demonstrates that EM-KD trained model outperforms prior Efficient MLLMs on both accuracy and efficiency with a large margin, validating its effectiveness. Compared with previous distillation methods, which are equipped with our proposed vision token matching strategy for fair comparison, EM-KD also achieves better performance.

Motivation: To address challenges in fusing geometry-based 3DGS and appearance-driven diffusion models, which often lead to over-restoration and geometric drift due to lack of pixel-wise, 3D-consistent editing criteria.

Method: Introduces Expected Information Gain (EIG) as a unified policy for coherent spatio-temporal synthesis, guiding diffusion as a spatial prior to refine high-uncertainty regions and distilling edits back into 3DGS through pixel-level weighting.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance on Waymo dataset across NTA-IoU, NTL-IoU, and FID metrics, maintaining FID of 107.47 even at 6 meters lane shift.

Conclusion: FaithFusion provides an effective plug-and-play system for controllable driving-scene reconstruction and 3D scene generation without requiring extra prior conditions or structural modifications.

Abstract: In controllable driving-scene reconstruction and 3D scene generation, maintaining geometric fidelity while synthesizing visually plausible appearance under large viewpoint shifts is crucial. However, effective fusion of geometry-based 3DGS and appearance-driven diffusion models faces inherent challenges, as the absence of pixel-wise, 3D-consistent editing criteria often leads to over-restoration and geometric drift. To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{FaithFusion}, a 3DGS-diffusion fusion framework driven by pixel-wise Expected Information Gain (EIG). EIG acts as a unified policy for coherent spatio-temporal synthesis: it guides diffusion as a spatial prior to refine high-uncertainty regions, while its pixel-level weighting distills the edits back into 3DGS. The resulting plug-and-play system is free from extra prior conditions and structural modifications.Extensive experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that our approach attains SOTA performance across NTA-IoU, NTL-IoU, and FID, maintaining an FID of 107.47 even at 6 meters lane shift.

TL;DR: DATGN is a novel method that uses temporal generative networks to predict Alzheimer's disease progression by generating future MRI images, addressing missing data issues and improving classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early prediction of Alzheimer's disease is crucial to slow its progression, and current methods rely on manual feature extraction from brain images. There's a need for automated approaches that can handle incomplete temporal MRI data.

Method: Deformation-Aware Temporal Generative Network (DATGN) first interpolates missing data in temporal MRI sequences, then uses a bidirectional temporal deformation-aware module to generate future MRI images that follow disease progression patterns.

Result: DATGN achieved competitive PSNR and MMSE metrics for image generation. When synthetic data was used with classification methods, accuracy improved significantly: 6.21% to 16% for AD vs. NC classification, and 7.34% to 21.25% for AD vs. MCI vs. NC classification.

Conclusion: DATGN successfully generates realistic MRI images that follow Alzheimer's disease atrophy patterns, enabling early disease prediction and significantly improving classification performance when used as synthetic training data.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD), a degenerative brain condition, can benefit from early prediction to slow its progression. As the disease progresses, patients typically undergo brain atrophy. Current prediction methods for Alzheimers disease largely involve analyzing morphological changes in brain images through manual feature extraction. This paper proposes a novel method, the Deformation-Aware Temporal Generative Network (DATGN), to automate the learning of morphological changes in brain images about disease progression for early prediction. Given the common occurrence of missing data in the temporal sequences of MRI images, DATGN initially interpolates incomplete sequences. Subsequently, a bidirectional temporal deformation-aware module guides the network in generating future MRI images that adhere to the disease's progression, facilitating early prediction of Alzheimer's disease. DATGN was tested for the generation of temporal sequences of future MRI images using the ADNI dataset, and the experimental results are competitive in terms of PSNR and MMSE image quality metrics. Furthermore, when DATGN-generated synthetic data was integrated into the SVM vs. CNN vs. 3DCNN-based classification methods, significant improvements were achieved from 6. 21\% to 16\% in AD vs. NC classification accuracy and from 7. 34\% to 21. 25\% in AD vs. MCI vs. NC classification accuracy. The qualitative visualization results indicate that DATGN produces MRI images consistent with the brain atrophy trend in Alzheimer's disease, enabling early disease prediction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EntPruner is an entropy-guided automatic progressive pruning framework for diffusion and flow models that reduces parameter redundancy while maintaining generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale vision generative models have significant parameter redundancy when transferred to downstream tasks, requiring efficient pruning methods that preserve output diversity and condition-fidelity.

Method: Uses entropy-guided pruning with Conditional Entropy Deviation (CED) metric to assess block importance, combined with zero-shot adaptive progressive pruning framework that dynamically determines when and how much to prune.

Result: Achieves up to 2.22× inference speedup while maintaining competitive generation quality on ImageNet and three downstream datasets with DiT and SiT models.

Conclusion: EntPruner effectively reduces parameter redundancy in generative models while preserving performance, demonstrating practical efficiency improvements for downstream applications.

Abstract: Large-scale vision generative models, including diffusion and flow models, have demonstrated remarkable performance in visual generation tasks. However, transferring these pre-trained models to downstream tasks often results in significant parameter redundancy. In this paper, we propose EntPruner, an entropy-guided automatic progressive pruning framework for diffusion and flow models. First, we introduce entropy-guided pruning, a block-level importance assessment strategy specifically designed for generative models. Unlike discriminative models, generative models require preserving the diversity and condition-fidelity of the output distribution. As the importance of each module can vary significantly across downstream tasks, EntPruner prioritizes pruning of less important blocks using data-dependent Conditional Entropy Deviation (CED) as a guiding metric. CED quantifies how much the distribution diverges from the learned conditional data distribution after removing a block. Second, we propose a zero-shot adaptive pruning framework to automatically determine when and how much to prune during training. This dynamic strategy avoids the pitfalls of one-shot pruning, mitigating mode collapse, and preserving model performance. Extensive experiments on DiT and SiT models demonstrate the effectiveness of EntPruner, achieving up to 2.22$\times$ inference speedup while maintaining competitive generation quality on ImageNet and three downstream datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CtrlVDiff is a unified diffusion model that handles both video understanding and controllable generation using multiple graphics-based modalities like depth, normals, segmentation, edges, and intrinsics (albedo, roughness, metallic). It addresses limitations of geometry-only approaches and enables precise video edits with temporal coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Geometry-only cues (depth, edges) are insufficient for physically meaningful video edits like relighting or material swaps, often causing temporal drift. Additional graphics-based modalities provide complementary constraints for better understanding and precise control during generation.

Method: Proposes CtrlVDiff with Hybrid Modality Control Strategy (HMCS) that routes and fuses features from multiple modalities. Built MMVideo dataset with hybrid real-and-synthetic data aligned across modalities and captions. Model accepts any subset of modalities and remains robust to missing inputs.

Result: Superior controllability and fidelity across understanding and generation benchmarks. Enables layer-wise edits (relighting, material adjustment, object insertion) with strong temporal coherence. Surpasses state-of-the-art baselines while remaining robust when some modalities are unavailable.

Conclusion: Enriching models with graphics-based modalities enables precise, predictable video control and understanding. The unified approach successfully handles both tasks while maintaining temporal consistency and robustness to missing inputs.

Abstract: We tackle the dual challenges of video understanding and controllable video generation within a unified diffusion framework. Our key insights are two-fold: geometry-only cues (e.g., depth, edges) are insufficient: they specify layout but under-constrain appearance, materials, and illumination, limiting physically meaningful edits such as relighting or material swaps and often causing temporal drift. Enriching the model with additional graphics-based modalities (intrinsics and semantics) provides complementary constraints that both disambiguate understanding and enable precise, predictable control during generation.
  However, building a single model that uses many heterogeneous cues introduces two core difficulties. Architecturally, the model must accept any subset of modalities, remain robust to missing inputs, and inject control signals without sacrificing temporal consistency. Data-wise, training demands large-scale, temporally aligned supervision that ties real videos to per-pixel multimodal annotations.
  We then propose CtrlVDiff, a unified diffusion model trained with a Hybrid Modality Control Strategy (HMCS) that routes and fuses features from depth, normals, segmentation, edges, and graphics-based intrinsics (albedo, roughness, metallic), and re-renders videos from any chosen subset with strong temporal coherence. To enable this, we build MMVideo, a hybrid real-and-synthetic dataset aligned across modalities and captions. Across understanding and generation benchmarks, CtrlVDiff delivers superior controllability and fidelity, enabling layer-wise edits (relighting, material adjustment, object insertion) and surpassing state-of-the-art baselines while remaining robust when some modalities are unavailable.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Fourier Kernel Estimator (FKE) that enables deep networks to learn blur processes at kernel-level rather than pixel-level, improving image deblurring performance by converting spatial convolution to Fourier multiplication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep networks only perform pixel-level restoration and fail to understand the essence of blur, which is fundamentally a convolution process with blur kernels. Learning at kernel-level can significantly improve deblurring performance.

Method: Uses Fourier Kernel Estimator with activation in Fourier space to convert spatial convolution to multiplication, jointly optimized with deblur model. Employs feature-based convolution instead of image-based, and uses decoupled multi-scale architecture with hierarchical sub-unets and reversible strategy for efficient feature extraction.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art motion deblurring results, shows potential for other kernel-related problems, and the kernel estimator learns physically meaningful kernels without additional supervision.

Conclusion: The proposed FKE enables kernel-level blur process learning, significantly improving deblurring performance while maintaining low complexity and requiring no extra supervision, demonstrating the importance of understanding blur at the kernel level.

Abstract: It is well-known that if a network aims to learn how to deblur, it should understand the blur process. Blurring is naturally caused by the convolution of the sharp image with the blur kernel. Thus, allowing the network to learn the blur process in the kernel-level can significantly improve the image deblurring performance. But, current deep networks are still at the pixel-level learning stage, either performing end-to-end pixel-level restoration or stage-wise pseudo kernel-level restoration, failing to enable the deblur model to understand the essence of the blur. To this end, we propose Fourier Kernel Estimator (FKE), which considers the activation operation in Fourier space and converts the convolution problem in the spatial domain to a multiplication problem in Fourier space. Our FKE, jointly optimized with the deblur model, enables the network to learn the kernel-level blur process with low complexity and without any additional supervision. Furthermore, we change the convolution object of the kernel from ``image" to network extracted ``feature", whose rich semantic and structural information is more suitable to blur process learning. With the convolution of the feature and the estimated kernel, our model can learn the essence of blur in kernel-level. To further improve the efficiency of feature extraction, we design a decoupled multi-scale architecture with multiple hierarchical sub-unets with a reversible strategy, which allows better multi-scale encoding and decoding in low training memory. Extensive experiments indicate that our method achieves state-of-the-art motion deblurring results and show potential for handling other kernel-related problems. Analysis also shows our kernel estimator is able to learn physically meaningful kernels. The code will be available at https://github.com/DeepMed-Lab-ECNU/Single-Image-Deblur.

TL;DR: Ent-Prog is an efficient training framework for human video generation using diffusion models that reduces training time and GPU memory consumption while maintaining performance through entropy-guided prioritized learning and adaptive progressive scheduling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human video generation with diffusion models faces challenges of high computational cost and substantial memory consumption when training on high-resolution, multi-frame data.

Method: Proposes Entropy-Guided Prioritized Progressive Learning (Ent-Prog) with two key components: Conditional Entropy Inflation (CEI) to assess component importance for prioritized training, and an adaptive progressive schedule that increases computational complexity based on convergence efficiency.

Result: Achieves up to 2.2× training speedup and 2.4× GPU memory reduction without compromising generative performance, validated across three datasets.

Conclusion: Ent-Prog provides an effective solution for efficient training of diffusion models in human video generation, significantly reducing computational requirements while maintaining model quality.

Abstract: Human video generation has advanced rapidly with the development of diffusion models, but the high computational cost and substantial memory consumption associated with training these models on high-resolution, multi-frame data pose significant challenges. In this paper, we propose Entropy-Guided Prioritized Progressive Learning (Ent-Prog), an efficient training framework tailored for diffusion models on human video generation. First, we introduce Conditional Entropy Inflation (CEI) to assess the importance of different model components on the target conditional generation task, enabling prioritized training of the most critical components. Second, we introduce an adaptive progressive schedule that adaptively increases computational complexity during training by measuring the convergence efficiency. Ent-Prog reduces both training time and GPU memory consumption while maintaining model performance. Extensive experiments across three datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of Ent-Prog, achieving up to 2.2$\times$ training speedup and 2.4$\times$ GPU memory reduction without compromising generative performance.

*Baoli Sun,Xinzhu Ma,Ning Wang,Zhihui Wang,Zhiyong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProxyFormer is a novel RVOS architecture that uses proxy queries to integrate visual and text semantics, enabling better cross-modality alignment and inter-frame dependency modeling for improved video object segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RVOS methods have two key limitations: (1) conditional queries lack inter-frame dependency modeling, making target tracking difficult amid frame variations, and (2) textual constraints are integrated too late, causing video features to potentially focus on non-referred objects.

Method: Proposes ProxyFormer with proxy queries that integrate visual and text semantics, progressively updated across video feature encoder stages. Uses decoupled cross-modality interactions in temporal and spatial dimensions to reduce computation, and implements Joint Semantic Consistency training for semantic alignment.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on four RVOS benchmarks demonstrate ProxyFormer's superiority over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: ProxyFormer effectively addresses limitations of previous approaches by enabling dynamic semantic evolution and inter-frame dependencies, leading to more accurate and coherent object tracking in referring video object segmentation.

Abstract: Referring video object segmentation (RVOS) is an emerging cross-modality task that aims to generate pixel-level maps of the target objects referred by given textual expressions. The main concept involves learning an accurate alignment of visual elements and language expressions within a semantic space. Recent approaches address cross-modality alignment through conditional queries, tracking the target object using a query-response based mechanism built upon transformer structure. However, they exhibit two limitations: (1) these conditional queries lack inter-frame dependency and variation modeling, making accurate target tracking challenging amid significant frame-to-frame variations; and (2) they integrate textual constraints belatedly, which may cause the video features potentially focus on the non-referred objects. Therefore, we propose a novel RVOS architecture called ProxyFormer, which introduces a set of proxy queries to integrate visual and text semantics and facilitate the flow of semantics between them. By progressively updating and propagating proxy queries across multiple stages of video feature encoder, ProxyFormer ensures that the video features are focused on the object of interest. This dynamic evolution also enables the establishment of inter-frame dependencies, enhancing the accuracy and coherence of object tracking. To mitigate high computational costs, we decouple cross-modality interactions into temporal and spatial dimensions. Additionally, we design a Joint Semantic Consistency (JSC) training strategy to align semantic consensus between the proxy queries and the combined video-text pairs. Comprehensive experiments on four widely used RVOS benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our ProxyFormer to the state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: TEAR is an automated red-teaming framework that uncovers safety risks in Text-to-Video models by exploiting temporal dynamics through temporal-aware test generation and two-stage optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety evaluation methods for static images and text are insufficient for capturing complex temporal dynamics in video generation, creating critical safety challenges in T2V models.

Method: TEAR uses a temporal-aware test generator with two-stage optimization (initial training and temporal-aware online preference learning) to create textually innocuous prompts that exploit temporal dynamics. A refine model cyclically improves prompt stealthiness and adversarial effectiveness.

Result: TEAR achieves over 80% attack success rate across open-source and commercial T2V systems, significantly outperforming prior best result of 57%.

Conclusion: TEAR effectively uncovers safety risks in T2V models by focusing on temporal dynamics, demonstrating the need for specialized safety evaluation methods for video generation systems.

Abstract: Text-to-Video (T2V) models are capable of synthesizing high-quality, temporally coherent dynamic video content, but the diverse generation also inherently introduces critical safety challenges. Existing safety evaluation methods,which focus on static image and text generation, are insufficient to capture the complex temporal dynamics in video generation. To address this, we propose a TEmporal-aware Automated Red-teaming framework, named TEAR, an automated framework designed to uncover safety risks specifically linked to the dynamic temporal sequencing of T2V models. TEAR employs a temporal-aware test generator optimized via a two-stage approach: initial generator training and temporal-aware online preference learning, to craft textually innocuous prompts that exploit temporal dynamics to elicit policy-violating video output. And a refine model is adopted to improve the prompt stealthiness and adversarial effectiveness cyclically. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of TEAR across open-source and commercial T2V systems with over 80% attack success rate, a significant boost from prior best result of 57%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLaVA-UHD v3 introduces Progressive Visual Compression (PVC) to enable efficient native-resolution visual encoding in MLLMs, achieving competitive performance while significantly reducing computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational inefficiency of global native-resolution visual encoding in MLLMs, which enhances capability but at high computational cost.

Method: Progressive Visual Compression (PVC) with two modules: refined patch embedding for flexible patch-size scaling, and windowed token compression hierarchically deployed across ViT layers to progressively aggregate local token representations.

Result: ViT-UHD achieves competitive performance with MoonViT while reducing TTFT by 2.4x; LLaVA-UHD v3 achieves competitive performance to Qwen2-VL while reducing TTFT by 1.9x.

Conclusion: PVC enables efficient native-resolution encoding while preserving generality, offering a promising approach for developing efficient MLLMs.

Abstract: Visual encoding followed by token condensing has become the standard architectural paradigm in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). Many recent MLLMs increasingly favor global native- resolution visual encoding over slice-based methods. To investigate this trend, we systematically compare their behavior on vision-language understanding and attention patterns, revealing that global encoding enhances overall capability but at the expense of greater computational overhead. To address this issue, we present LLaVA-UHD v3, an MLLM centered upon our proposed Progressive Visual Compression (PVC) method, which can be seamlessly integrated into standard Vision Transformer (ViT) to enable efficient native-resolution encoding. The PVC approach consists of two key modules: (i) refined patch embedding, which supports flexible patch-size scaling for fine-grained visual model- ing, (ii) windowed token compression, hierarchically deployed across ViT layers to progressively aggregate local token representations. Jointly modulated by these two modules, a widely pretrained ViT can be reconfigured into an efficient architecture while largely preserving generality. Evaluated across extensive benchmarks, the transformed ViT, termed ViT-UHD, demonstrates competitive performance with MoonViT while reducing TTFT (time-to-first-token) by 2.4x, when developed within an identical MLLM architecture. Building upon ViT-UHD, LLaVA-UHD v3 also achieves competitive performance to Qwen2-VL, while further reducing TTFT by 1.9x. We will release all code and checkpoints to support future research on efficient MLLMs.

### [61] [Progress by Pieces: Test-Time Scaling for Autoregressive Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21185)
*Joonhyung Park,Hyeongwon Jang,Joowon Kim,Eunho Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GridAR is a test-time scaling framework for visual autoregressive models that uses grid-partitioned progressive generation with early pruning and layout-specified prompt reformulation to improve image generation quality while reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current test-time scaling strategies like Best-of-N are suboptimal for visual AR models because they waste computation on erroneous trajectories and lack a blueprint of the entire canvas, limiting scaling benefits.

Method: GridAR employs grid-partitioned progressive generation where multiple partial candidates are generated, infeasible ones are pruned early, and viable ones become anchors for subsequent decoding. It also uses layout-specified prompt reformulation to infer feasible layouts from partial views.

Result: With N=4, GridAR outperforms Best-of-N (N=8) by 14.4% on T2I-CompBench++ while reducing cost by 25.6%. It also achieves comparable edit quality and 13.9% better semantic preservation on PIE-Bench compared to larger-N baselines.

Conclusion: GridAR effectively addresses the blueprint deficiency in visual AR models and demonstrates superior performance with reduced computational costs, making test-time scaling more efficient for text-to-image generation and image editing tasks.

Abstract: Recent visual autoregressive (AR) models have shown promising capabilities in text-to-image generation, operating in a manner similar to large language models. While test-time computation scaling has brought remarkable success in enabling reasoning-enhanced outputs for challenging natural language tasks, its adaptation to visual AR models remains unexplored and poses unique challenges. Naively applying test-time scaling strategies such as Best-of-N can be suboptimal: they consume full-length computation on erroneous generation trajectories, while the raster-scan decoding scheme lacks a blueprint of the entire canvas, limiting scaling benefits as only a few prompt-aligned candidates are generated. To address these, we introduce GridAR, a test-time scaling framework designed to elicit the best possible results from visual AR models. GridAR employs a grid-partitioned progressive generation scheme in which multiple partial candidates for the same position are generated within a canvas, infeasible ones are pruned early, and viable ones are fixed as anchors to guide subsequent decoding. Coupled with this, we present a layout-specified prompt reformulation strategy that inspects partial views to infer a feasible layout for satisfying the prompt. The reformulated prompt then guides subsequent image generation to mitigate the blueprint deficiency. Together, GridAR achieves higher-quality results under limited test-time scaling: with N=4, it even outperforms Best-of-N (N=8) by 14.4% on T2I-CompBench++ while reducing cost by 25.6%. It also generalizes to autoregressive image editing, showing comparable edit quality and a 13.9% gain in semantic preservation on PIE-Bench over larger-N baselines.

### [62] [AnchorOPT: Towards Optimizing Dynamic Anchors for Adaptive Prompt Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21188)
*Zheng Li,Yibing Song,Xin Zhang,Lei Luo,Xiang Li,Jian Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AnchorOPT is a dynamic anchor-based prompt learning framework that introduces learnable anchor tokens and adaptive positional relationships between anchors and soft tokens, achieving performance comparable to or exceeding methods with additional modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt learning methods use static textual tokens as anchors that lack cross-task and stage-adaptive flexibility, limiting their effectiveness across different tasks and training stages.

Method: AnchorOPT learns anchor tokens dynamically from task-specific data and optimizes positional relationships via a learnable position matrix conditioned on training stage and task context, with two-stage training: first learning anchors, then optimizing soft tokens and position matrix.

Result: Extensive experiments show AnchorOPT achieves performance comparable to or exceeding methods with additional learnable modules or regularization techniques, and integrates seamlessly as a plug-and-play module with consistent performance gains across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: AnchorOPT provides a flexible and effective prompt learning framework that dynamically adapts anchor values and positions, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities without requiring complex additional components.

Abstract: Existing prompt learning methods, which are built upon CLIP models, leverage textual tokens as anchors to guide the learnable soft tokens. This guidance improves CLIP generalizations. However, these anchors-static in both value and position-lack cross-task and stage-adaptive flexibility. To address this limitation, we propose AnchorOPT, a dynamic anchor-based prompt learning framework. Specifically, AnchorOPT introduces dynamism in two key dimensions: (i) anchor values eschew handcrafted explicit textual tokens (e.g., "shape", "color"), instead learning dynamically from task-specific data; and (ii) the positional relationship between anchor and soft tokens is no longer fixed but adaptively optimized via a learnable position matrix conditioned on the training stage and task context. Training occurs in two stages: we first learn the anchor tokens, then freeze and transfer them to the second stage for optimization of soft tokens and the position matrix. Extensive experiments demonstrate that using only a simple learnable anchor and position matrix achieves performance comparable to or exceeding some methods incorporating additional learnable modules or regularization techniques. As a plug-and-play module, AnchorOPT integrates seamlessly into existing frameworks, yielding consistent performance gains across diverse datasets.

Motivation: Effectively tokenizing 3D scenes into holistic scene tokens and leveraging them across diverse 3D understanding tasks remains challenging, despite recent advances in 3D vision-language models.

Method: Three-stage scene tokenization pipeline using Multi-Scale Normal Distributions Transform (NDT) representation with Multi-Scale NDT Decoder (MSDec) that constructs multi-scale NDT from point clouds and fuses cross-scale features to produce scene tokens.

Result: Achieves remarkable improvements in 3D Referring Segmentation, 3D Visual Question Answering, and 3D Dense Captioning tasks.

Conclusion: NDTokenizer3D provides a compact and unified design for a fine-grained, general-purpose 3D VLM that bridges language-level reasoning with 3D spatial understanding and supports human interactions.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D vision-language models (VLMs) highlight a strong potential for 3D scene understanding and reasoning. However, effectively tokenizing 3D scenes into holistic scene tokens, and leveraging these tokens across diverse 3D understanding tasks, remain highly challenging. We present NDTokenizer3D, a generalist 3D VLM that performs a wide range of 3D scene understanding tasks while naturally supporting human interactions, thereby bridging language-level reasoning with 3D spatial understanding. The core of our approach is a novel three-stage scene tokenization pipeline built upon a Multi-Scale Normal Distributions Transform (NDT) representation, paired with a Multi-Scale NDT Decoder (MSDec). Specifically, NDTokenizer3D first constructs a multi-scale NDT representation from raw high-resolution point clouds, preserving both global context and fine-grained geometric details. Next, the MSDec progressively fuses cross-scale NDT features, producing holistic scene tokens consumable by LLM endpoints. Beyond tokenization, MSDec is repurposed as a general interface for human-interactive prompting (points, boxes, masks) and segmentation-mask decoding, unifying diverse 3D scene understanding tasks within a single architecture. With this compact and unified design, NDTokenizer3D offers a fine-grained, general-purpose 3D VLM, achieving remarkable improvements in 3D Referring Segmentation, 3D Visual Question Answering, and 3D Dense Captioning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language-Action models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, but existing patches overfit to single models and fail in black-box settings. Universal and transferable attacks against VLA-driven robots remain underexplored.

Method: UPA-RFAS combines: (i) feature-space objective with ℓ₁ deviation prior and repulsive InfoNCE loss for transferable representation shifts, (ii) two-phase min-max procedure with inner loop for invisible perturbations and outer loop for universal patch optimization, (iii) VLA-specific losses including Patch Attention Dominance and Patch Semantic Misalignment.

Result: Experiments show UPA-RFAS consistently transfers across diverse VLA models, manipulation tasks, and physical executions, exposing a practical patch-based attack surface.

Conclusion: UPA-RFAS establishes a strong baseline for universal adversarial patches against VLA models, demonstrating effective cross-model transferability and highlighting the need for future defenses.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, yet universal and transferable attacks remain underexplored, as most existing patches overfit to a single model and fail in black-box settings. To address this gap, we present a systematic study of universal, transferable adversarial patches against VLA-driven robots under unknown architectures, finetuned variants, and sim-to-real shifts. We introduce UPA-RFAS (Universal Patch Attack via Robust Feature, Attention, and Semantics), a unified framework that learns a single physical patch in a shared feature space while promoting cross-model transfer. UPA-RFAS combines (i) a feature-space objective with an $\ell_1$ deviation prior and repulsive InfoNCE loss to induce transferable representation shifts, (ii) a robustness-augmented two-phase min-max procedure where an inner loop learns invisible sample-wise perturbations and an outer loop optimizes the universal patch against this hardened neighborhood, and (iii) two VLA-specific losses: Patch Attention Dominance to hijack text$\to$vision attention and Patch Semantic Misalignment to induce image-text mismatch without labels. Experiments across diverse VLA models, manipulation suites, and physical executions show that UPA-RFAS consistently transfers across models, tasks, and viewpoints, exposing a practical patch-based attack surface and establishing a strong baseline for future defenses.

TL;DR: DCBoost is a parameter-free plug-in that enhances deep clustering models by leveraging reliable local structural cues to improve global feature separation and clustering performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep clustering methods suffer from disparity between well-structured local features and poorly separated global features, leading to intertwined cluster boundaries.

Method: Uses adaptive k-nearest neighbors-based consistency filtering to identify high-confidence samples as anchors, then applies a discriminative loss to promote intra-class compactness and inter-class separability.

Result: Significantly improves clustering performance across various benchmarks, boosting state-of-the-art baselines by over 3% and amplifying silhouette coefficient by 7x.

Conclusion: DCBoost effectively bridges the gap between local and global feature structures in deep clustering, providing substantial performance improvements without additional parameters.

Abstract: Recent deep clustering models have produced impressive clustering performance. However, a common issue with existing methods is the disparity between global and local feature structures. While local structures typically show strong consistency and compactness within class samples, global features often present intertwined boundaries and poorly separated clusters. Motivated by this observation, we propose DCBoost, a parameter-free plug-in designed to enhance the global feature structures of current deep clustering models. By harnessing reliable local structural cues, our method aims to elevate clustering performance effectively. Specifically, we first identify high-confidence samples through adaptive $k$-nearest neighbors-based consistency filtering, aiming to select a sufficient number of samples with high label reliability to serve as trustworthy anchors for self-supervision. Subsequently, these samples are utilized to compute a discriminative loss, which promotes both intra-class compactness and inter-class separability, to guide network optimization. Extensive experiments across various benchmark datasets showcase that our DCBoost significantly improves the clustering performance of diverse existing deep clustering models. Notably, our method improves the performance of current state-of-the-art baselines (e.g., ProPos) by more than 3% and amplifies the silhouette coefficient by over $7\times$.

TL;DR: BotaCLIP is a lightweight multimodal framework that adapts pre-trained Earth Observation foundation models to inject botanical domain knowledge through contrastive learning with aerial imagery and ecological data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To adapt pre-trained foundation models for domain-specific tasks without expensive retraining, specifically for ecological applications where expert knowledge is valuable but data is scarce.

Method: Uses contrastive learning to align high-resolution aerial imagery with botanical relevés, with a regularization strategy to prevent catastrophic forgetting of pre-trained knowledge.

Result: BotaCLIP embeddings consistently outperformed DOFA and supervised baselines in plant presence prediction, butterfly occurrence modeling, and soil trophic group abundance estimation.

Conclusion: Domain-aware adaptation of foundation models can effectively inject expert knowledge into data-scarce settings, enabling efficient representation learning for ecological applications.

Abstract: Foundation models have demonstrated a remarkable ability to learn rich, transferable representations across diverse modalities such as images, text, and audio. In modern machine learning pipelines, these representations often replace raw data as the primary input for downstream tasks. In this paper, we address the challenge of adapting a pre-trained foundation model to inject domain-specific knowledge, without retraining from scratch or incurring significant computational costs. To this end, we introduce BotaCLIP, a lightweight multimodal contrastive framework that adapts a pre-trained Earth Observation foundation model (DOFA) by aligning high-resolution aerial imagery with botanical relevés. Unlike generic embeddings, BotaCLIP internalizes ecological structure through contrastive learning with a regularization strategy that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. Once trained, the resulting embeddings serve as transferable representations for downstream predictors. Motivated by real-world applications in biodiversity modeling, we evaluated BotaCLIP representations in three ecological tasks: plant presence prediction, butterfly occurrence modeling, and soil trophic group abundance estimation. The results showed consistent improvements over those derived from DOFA and supervised baselines. More broadly, this work illustrates how domain-aware adaptation of foundation models can inject expert knowledge into data-scarce settings, enabling frugal representation learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current recognition methods capture coarse-grained motion patterns but struggle with subtle local details in fine-grained action categories.

Method: Proposes Action-Region Tracking (ART) with region-specific semantic activation module, text-constrained queries from VLMs, action tracklets organization, and multi-level tracklet contrastive constraints.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on action recognition benchmarks demonstrate superiority over previous state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The ART framework effectively discovers and tracks distinctive local details through query-response mechanism, enabling better distinction of similar fine-grained actions.

Abstract: Fine-grained action recognition (FGAR) aims to identify subtle and distinctive differences among fine-grained action categories. However, current recognition methods often capture coarse-grained motion patterns but struggle to identify subtle details in local regions evolving over time. In this work, we introduce the Action-Region Tracking (ART) framework, a novel solution leveraging a query-response mechanism to discover and track the dynamics of distinctive local details, enabling effective distinction of similar actions. Specifically, we propose a region-specific semantic activation module that employs discriminative and text-constrained semantics as queries to capture the most action-related region responses in each video frame, facilitating interaction among spatial and temporal dimensions with corresponding video features. The captured region responses are organized into action tracklets, which characterize region-based action dynamics by linking related responses across video frames in a coherent sequence. The text-constrained queries encode nuanced semantic representations derived from textual descriptions of action labels extracted by language branches within Visual Language Models (VLMs). To optimize the action tracklets, we design a multi-level tracklet contrastive constraint among region responses at spatial and temporal levels, enabling effective discrimination within each frame and correlation between adjacent frames. Additionally, a task-specific fine-tuning mechanism refines textual semantics such that semantic representations encoded by VLMs are preserved while optimized for task preferences. Comprehensive experiments on widely used action recognition benchmarks demonstrate the superiority to previous state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: Comparative study of DDPM, CFM, and MeanFlow generative models showing CFM outperforms DDPM (FID 24.15 vs 402.98), while MeanFlow enables 50X faster single-step generation with FID 29.15. CFM extended to image inpainting achieves significant quality improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To compare different generative modeling paradigms and explore efficient alternatives to iterative sampling methods like DDPM, particularly focusing on faster inference and specialized applications like image inpainting.

Method: Implemented DDPM, CFM, and MeanFlow using unified TinyUNet architecture (<1.5M parameters) on CIFAR-10. Extended CFM to image inpainting with mask-guided sampling using four mask types (center, random bbox, irregular, half).

Result: CFM achieved FID 24.15 with 50 steps vs DDPM's FID 402.98. MeanFlow achieved FID 29.15 with single-step sampling (50X faster inference). Inpainting model improved PSNR from 4.95 to 8.57 dB (+73%) and SSIM from 0.289 to 0.418 (+45%).

Conclusion: CFM significantly outperforms DDPM in image generation quality, while MeanFlow provides efficient single-step generation. Inpainting-aware training substantially improves reconstruction quality across different mask types, demonstrating the effectiveness of specialized training for conditional generation tasks.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive comparative study of three generative modeling paradigms: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM), Conditional Flow Matching (CFM), and MeanFlow. While DDPM and CFM require iterative sampling, MeanFlow enables direct one-step generation by modeling the average velocity over time intervals. We implement all three methods using a unified TinyUNet architecture (<1.5M parameters) on CIFAR-10, demonstrating that CFM achieves an FID of 24.15 with 50 steps, significantly outperforming DDPM (FID 402.98). MeanFlow achieves FID 29.15 with single-step sampling -- a 50X reduction in inference time. We further extend CFM to image inpainting, implementing mask-guided sampling with four mask types (center, random bbox, irregular, half). Our fine-tuned inpainting model achieves substantial improvements: PSNR increases from 4.95 to 8.57 dB on center masks (+73%), and SSIM improves from 0.289 to 0.418 (+45%), demonstrating the effectiveness of inpainting-aware training.

*Shuhan Xia,Xuannan Liu,Xing Cui,Peipei Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: T3-Tracer is a hierarchical framework for detecting partial audio forgeries by analyzing audio at frame, segment, and audio levels using two complementary modules: FA-FAM for frame authenticity and SMDAM for segment-level forgery boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Partial audio forgery is difficult to detect because attackers modify only critical frames while maintaining overall authenticity. Existing methods lack hierarchical structure to capture both transient and sustained anomalies across different temporal levels.

Method: T3-Tracer uses two core modules: FA-FAM combines frame-level and audio-level features to detect intra-frame forgery cues, while SMDAM uses a dual-branch architecture with multi-scale temporal windows to identify forgery boundaries at segment level.

Result: Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in detecting partial audio forgeries.

Conclusion: The hierarchical multi-level approach effectively captures both transient and sustained anomalies, providing comprehensive detection of partial audio forgery traces.

Abstract: Recently, partial audio forgery has emerged as a new form of audio manipulation. Attackers selectively modify partial but semantically critical frames while preserving the overall perceptual authenticity, making such forgeries particularly difficult to detect. Existing methods focus on independently detecting whether a single frame is forged, lacking the hierarchical structure to capture both transient and sustained anomalies across different temporal levels. To address these limitations, We identify three key levels relevant to partial audio forgery detection and present T3-Tracer, the first framework that jointly analyzes audio at the frame, segment, and audio levels to comprehensively detect forgery traces. T3-Tracer consists of two complementary core modules: the Frame-Audio Feature Aggregation Module (FA-FAM) and the Segment-level Multi-Scale Discrepancy-Aware Module (SMDAM). FA-FAM is designed to detect the authenticity of each audio frame. It combines both frame-level and audio-level temporal information to detect intra-frame forgery cues and global semantic inconsistencies. To further refine and correct frame detection, we introduce SMDAM to detect forgery boundaries at the segment level. It adopts a dual-branch architecture that jointly models frame features and inter-frame differences across multi-scale temporal windows, effectively identifying abrupt anomalies that appeared on the forged boundaries. Extensive experiments conducted on three challenging datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance.

*Chen Ling,Henglin Shi,Hedvig Kjellström*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FIELDS improves 3D face reconstruction by combining 2D image consistency with direct 3D expression supervision and emotion recognition, preserving subtle emotional details from single images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D face reconstruction methods fail to capture subtle emotional details due to reliance on 2D supervision and lack of 3D ground truth, limiting emotional expressiveness in reconstructed faces.

Method: Extends self-supervised 2D image consistency with direct 3D expression parameter supervision from 4D facial scans and an auxiliary emotion recognition branch with intensity-aware emotion loss.

Result: Produces high-fidelity 3D reconstructions that preserve subtle emotional cues, significantly improving facial expression recognition performance while maintaining naturalness.

Conclusion: The dual-supervision strategy effectively bridges the 2D/3D domain gap and mitigates expression-intensity bias, enabling emotion-rich 3D face reconstruction from single images.

Abstract: Facial expressions convey the bulk of emotional information in human communication, yet existing 3D face reconstruction methods often miss subtle affective details due to reliance on 2D supervision and lack of 3D ground truth. We propose FIELDS (Face reconstruction with accurate Inference of Expression using Learning with Direct Supervision) to address these limitations by extending self-supervised 2D image consistency cues with direct 3D expression parameter supervision and an auxiliary emotion recognition branch. Our encoder is guided by authentic expression parameters from spontaneous 4D facial scans, while an intensity-aware emotion loss encourages the 3D expression parameters to capture genuine emotion content without exaggeration. This dual-supervision strategy bridges the 2D/3D domain gap and mitigates expression-intensity bias, yielding high-fidelity 3D reconstructions that preserve subtle emotional cues. From a single image, FIELDS produces emotion-rich face models with highly realistic expressions, significantly improving in-the-wild facial expression recognition performance without sacrificing naturalness.

TL;DR: Extends Learnable Polyphase Sampling (LPS) to complex-valued neural networks to achieve shift equivariance and invariance, with a new projection layer from complex to real space before Gumbel Softmax.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CNNs lack shift equivariance and invariance due to downsampling/upsampling operations. While data augmentation helps empirically, a systematic theoretical approach is needed to guarantee these properties.

Method: Extends LPS to complex-valued networks with a novel projection layer from C to R before Gumbel Softmax, maintaining theoretical guarantees for shift properties.

Result: Evaluated on computer vision tasks using polarimetric SAR images, showing improved performance for both invariance in classification and equivariance in reconstruction/segmentation.

Conclusion: Successfully extends LPS framework to complex-valued networks, providing theoretical guarantees for shift equivariance and invariance while demonstrating practical benefits on real-world vision tasks.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks have shown remarkable performance in recent years on various computer vision problems. However, the traditional convolutional neural network architecture lacks a critical property: shift equivariance and invariance, broken by downsampling and upsampling operations. Although data augmentation techniques can help the model learn the latter property empirically, a consistent and systematic way to achieve this goal is by designing downsampling and upsampling layers that theoretically guarantee these properties by construction. Adaptive Polyphase Sampling (APS) introduced the cornerstone for shift invariance, later extended to shift equivariance with Learnable Polyphase up/downsampling (LPS) applied to real-valued neural networks. In this paper, we extend the work on LPS to complex-valued neural networks both from a theoretical perspective and with a novel building block of a projection layer from $\mathbb{C}$ to $\mathbb{R}$ before the Gumbel Softmax. We finally evaluate this extension on several computer vision problems, specifically for either the invariance property in classification tasks or the equivariance property in both reconstruction and semantic segmentation problems, using polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AVFakeBench is a comprehensive audio-video forgery detection benchmark with 12K questions covering 7 forgery types and 4 annotation levels, designed to evaluate AV-LMMs and detection methods on diverse real-world forgery scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks are limited to DeepFake-based forgeries and single-granularity annotations, failing to capture the diversity and complexity of real-world audio-video forgery scenarios that extend beyond human-centric manipulations.

Method: Proposed a multi-stage hybrid forgery framework integrating proprietary models for task planning with expert generative models for precise manipulation. Created AVFakeBench with 12K curated audio-video questions across 7 forgery types and 4 annotation levels.

Result: Evaluated 11 Audio-Video Large Language Models and 2 detection methods, showing AV-LMMs' potential as emerging forgery detectors but revealing notable weaknesses in fine-grained perception and reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: AVFakeBench establishes a comprehensive multi-task evaluation framework for audio-video forgery detection, highlighting both the promise and limitations of current AV-LMMs in handling complex forgery scenarios.

Abstract: The threat of Audio-Video (AV) forgery is rapidly evolving beyond human-centric deepfakes to include more diverse manipulations across complex natural scenes. However, existing benchmarks are still confined to DeepFake-based forgeries and single-granularity annotations, thus failing to capture the diversity and complexity of real-world forgery scenarios. To address this, we introduce AVFakeBench, the first comprehensive audio-video forgery detection benchmark that spans rich forgery semantics across both human subject and general subject. AVFakeBench comprises 12K carefully curated audio-video questions, covering seven forgery types and four levels of annotations. To ensure high-quality and diverse forgeries, we propose a multi-stage hybrid forgery framework that integrates proprietary models for task planning with expert generative models for precise manipulation. The benchmark establishes a multi-task evaluation framework covering binary judgment, forgery types classification, forgery detail selection, and explanatory reasoning. We evaluate 11 Audio-Video Large Language Models (AV-LMMs) and 2 prevalent detection methods on AVFakeBench, demonstrating the potential of AV-LMMs as emerging forgery detectors while revealing their notable weaknesses in fine-grained perception and reasoning.

*Sizhuo Zhou,Xiaosong Jia,Fanrui Zhang,Junjie Li,Juyong Zhang,Yukang Feng,Jianwen Sun,Songbur Wong,Junqi You,Junchi Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LaGen is the first framework for autoregressive long-horizon LiDAR scene generation, enabling frame-by-frame generation from single-frame input with bounding box conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LiDAR generation methods only support single frame generation, while prediction approaches require multiple historical frames and lack interactivity, failing to support long-horizon interactive generation.

Method: LaGen uses a single-frame LiDAR input with bounding box conditions, includes scene decoupling estimation for object-level content, and noise modulation to reduce error accumulation during long-horizon generation.

Result: LaGen outperforms state-of-the-art LiDAR generation and prediction models, especially on later frames, demonstrating superior performance in long-horizon generation.

Conclusion: LaGen successfully addresses the limitations of existing methods by enabling interactive, frame-by-frame autoregressive generation of long-horizon LiDAR scenes with high fidelity.

Abstract: Generative world models for autonomous driving (AD) have become a trending topic. Unlike the widely studied image modality, in this work we explore generative world models for LiDAR data. Existing generation methods for LiDAR data only support single frame generation, while existing prediction approaches require multiple frames of historical input and can only deterministically predict multiple frames at once, lacking interactivity. Both paradigms fail to support long-horizon interactive generation. To this end, we introduce LaGen, which to the best of our knowledge is the first framework capable of frame-by-frame autoregressive generation of long-horizon LiDAR scenes. LaGen is able to take a single-frame LiDAR input as a starting point and effectively utilize bounding box information as conditions to generate high-fidelity 4D scene point clouds. In addition, we introduce a scene decoupling estimation module to enhance the model's interactive generation capability for object-level content, as well as a noise modulation module to mitigate error accumulation during long-horizon generation. We construct a protocol based on nuScenes for evaluating long-horizon LiDAR scene generation. Experimental results comprehensively demonstrate LaGen outperforms state-of-the-art LiDAR generation and prediction models, especially on the later frames.

*Juncheng Chen,Chao Xu,Yanjun Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MatchGS corrects 3DGS geometric inaccuracies to generate precise correspondence labels and align 2D-3D representations, enabling robust zero-shot image matching with up to 17.7% performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning-based image matching requires large-scale, diverse, and geometrically accurate training data. 3DGS enables photorealistic novel-view synthesis but has geometric inaccuracies and biased depth rendering that prevent robust correspondence labeling.

Method: Two-fold approach: (1) geometrically-faithful data generation pipeline that refines 3DGS geometry for precise correspondence labels, and (2) 2D-3D representation alignment strategy that infuses 3DGS' explicit 3D knowledge into 2D matchers to learn viewpoint-invariant 3D representations.

Result: Generated ground-truth correspondences reduce epipolar error by up to 40x compared to existing datasets, enable supervision under extreme viewpoint changes, and provide self-supervisory signals. State-of-the-art matchers trained on this data achieve up to 17.7% zero-shot performance gains on public benchmarks.

Conclusion: With proper geometric refinement, 3DGS can serve as a scalable, high-fidelity, and structurally-rich data source, paving the way for robust zero-shot image matchers.

Abstract: Learning-based image matching critically depends on large-scale, diverse, and geometrically accurate training data. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables photorealistic novel-view synthesis and thus is attractive for data generation. However, its geometric inaccuracies and biased depth rendering currently prevent robust correspondence labeling. To address this, we introduce MatchGS, the first framework designed to systematically correct and leverage 3DGS for robust, zero-shot image matching. Our approach is twofold: (1) a geometrically-faithful data generation pipeline that refines 3DGS geometry to produce highly precise correspondence labels, enabling the synthesis of a vast and diverse range of viewpoints without compromising rendering fidelity; and (2) a 2D-3D representation alignment strategy that infuses 3DGS' explicit 3D knowledge into the 2D matcher, guiding 2D semi-dense matchers to learn viewpoint-invariant 3D representations. Our generated ground-truth correspondences reduce the epipolar error by up to 40 times compared to existing datasets, enable supervision under extreme viewpoint changes, and provide self-supervisory signals through Gaussian attributes. Consequently, state-of-the-art matchers trained solely on our data achieve significant zero-shot performance gains on public benchmarks, with improvements of up to 17.7%. Our work demonstrates that with proper geometric refinement, 3DGS can serve as a scalable, high-fidelity, and structurally-rich data source, paving the way for a new generation of robust zero-shot image matchers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified model for multiple remote sensing tasks through multi-task learning, leveraging vision-language models' text-based interface and addressing challenges in RS data environment and ultra-high-resolution imagery.

Method: Proposes a data curation engine for vision-language conversations, unified dynamic-resolution strategy for diverse image scales, Zoom-in Chain mechanism for UHR images with LRS-VQA-Zoom dataset, and enhanced object detection capability with fair evaluation protocol.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks, outperforming existing RS VLMs and rivaling specialized expert models. All tools, models, and datasets are open-sourced.

Conclusion: RSCoVLM serves as an effective baseline that promotes progress toward general-purpose remote sensing models through its flexible architecture and comprehensive solutions for RS challenges.

Abstract: With Transformers achieving outstanding performance on individual remote sensing (RS) tasks, we are now approaching the realization of a unified model that excels across multiple tasks through multi-task learning (MTL). Compared to single-task approaches, MTL methods offer improved generalization, enhanced scalability, and greater practical applicability. Recently, vision language models (VLMs) have achieved promising results in RS image understanding, grounding, and ultra-high-resolution (UHR) image reasoning, respectively. Moreover, the unified text-based interface demonstrates significant potential for MTL. Hence, in this work, we present RSCoVLM, a simple yet flexible VLM baseline for RS MTL. Firstly, we create the data curation engine, including data acquisition, offline processing and integrating, as well as online loading and weighting. This data engine effectively addresses complex RS data enviroment and generates flexible vision-language conversations. Furthermore, we propose a unified dynamic-resolution strategy to address the diverse image scales inherent in RS imagery. For UHR images, we introduce the Zoom-in Chain mechanism together with its corresponding dataset, LRS-VQA-Zoom. The strategies are flexible and effectively mitigate the computational burdens. Additionally, we significantly enhance the model's object detection capability and propose a novel evaluation protocol that ensures fair comparison between VLMs and conventional detection models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RSCoVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks, outperforming existing RS VLMs and even rivaling specialized expert models. All the training and evaluating tools, model weights, and datasets have been fully open-sourced to support reproducibility. We expect that this baseline will promote further progress toward general-purpose RS models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PathMamba is a hybrid architecture combining Mamba's linear-time efficiency for modeling continuous road structures with Transformer's global reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art road segmentation with superior topological continuity while remaining computationally efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Vision Transformers provide good accuracy but have quadratic complexity that limits deployment on resource-constrained platforms, while road networks require modeling of long, continuous structures where State Space Models like Mamba excel.

Method: Hybrid architecture integrating Mamba blocks for tracing continuous road networks and preserving topological structure, combined with Transformer blocks for global context refinement.

Result: Sets new state-of-the-art on DeepGlobe Road Extraction and Massachusetts Roads datasets, significantly improves topological continuity (APLS metric) while remaining computationally competitive.

Conclusion: PathMamba demonstrates that combining Mamba's sequential modeling with Transformer's global reasoning yields topologically superior road segmentation without prohibitive scaling costs of pure attention-based models.

Abstract: Achieving both high accuracy and topological continuity in road segmentation from satellite imagery is a critical goal for applications ranging from urban planning to disaster response. State-of-the-art methods often rely on Vision Transformers, which excel at capturing global context, yet their quadratic complexity is a significant barrier to efficient deployment, particularly for on-board processing in resource-constrained platforms. In contrast, emerging State Space Models like Mamba offer linear-time efficiency and are inherently suited to modeling long, continuous structures. We posit that these architectures have complementary strengths. To this end, we introduce PathMamba, a novel hybrid architecture that integrates Mamba's sequential modeling with the Transformer's global reasoning. Our design strategically uses Mamba blocks to trace the continuous nature of road networks, preserving topological structure, while integrating Transformer blocks to refine features with global context. This approach yields topologically superior segmentation maps without the prohibitive scaling costs of pure attention-based models. Our experiments on the DeepGlobe Road Extraction and Massachusetts Roads datasets demonstrate that PathMamba sets a new state-of-the-art. Notably, it significantly improves topological continuity, as measured by the APLS metric, setting a new benchmark while remaining computationally competitive.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CaliTex introduces geometry-calibrated attention to solve cross-view inconsistency in 3D texture generation by aligning attention with 3D structure through part-aligned and condition-routed attention modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D texture generation systems suffer from cross-view inconsistency where textures appear convincing from one viewpoint but fail to align across others, caused by attention ambiguity in unstructured full attention.

Method: Introduces CaliTex framework with two modules: Part-Aligned Attention that enforces spatial alignment across semantically matched parts, and Condition-Routed Attention that routes appearance information through geometry-conditioned pathways. Uses a two-stage diffusion transformer.

Result: CaliTex produces seamless and view-consistent textures and outperforms both open-source and commercial baselines.

Conclusion: CaliTex makes geometric coherence an inherent behavior of the network rather than a byproduct of optimization, effectively addressing cross-view inconsistency in 3D texture generation.

Abstract: Despite major advances brought by diffusion-based models, current 3D texture generation systems remain hindered by cross-view inconsistency -- textures that appear convincing from one viewpoint often fail to align across others. We find that this issue arises from attention ambiguity, where unstructured full attention is applied indiscriminately across tokens and modalities, causing geometric confusion and unstable appearance-structure coupling. To address this, we introduce CaliTex, a framework of geometry-calibrated attention that explicitly aligns attention with 3D structure. It introduces two modules: Part-Aligned Attention that enforces spatial alignment across semantically matched parts, and Condition-Routed Attention which routes appearance information through geometry-conditioned pathways to maintain spatial fidelity. Coupled with a two-stage diffusion transformer, CaliTex makes geometric coherence an inherent behavior of the network rather than a byproduct of optimization. Empirically, CaliTex produces seamless and view-consistent textures and outperforms both open-source and commercial baselines.

### [78] [HTTM: Head-wise Temporal Token Merging for Faster VGGT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21317)
*Weitian Wang,Lukas Meiner,Rai Shubham,Cecilia De La Parra,Akash Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HTTM is a training-free 3D token merging method that accelerates VGGT by merging tokens at multi-head granularity, preserving feature uniqueness and achieving up to 7x speedup with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VGGT's joint inference of 3D attributes requires global attention layers that cause significant latency bottlenecks for large scenes with long-sequence inputs, limiting practical deployment.

Method: Head-wise temporal merging (HTTM) merges tokens in multi-head granularity instead of uniformly across attention heads, leveraging spatial locality and temporal correspondence at the head level to preserve feature uniqueness after head concatenation.

Result: HTTM achieves up to 7x acceleration in GPU-based inference with negligible performance drops compared to existing merging techniques that cause identical tokens and hinder representational ability.

Conclusion: HTTM effectively addresses the latency bottleneck in VGGT through training-free token merging that maintains model performance while significantly improving inference speed for large-scale 3D scene reconstruction.

Abstract: The Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) marks a significant leap forward in 3D scene reconstruction, as it is the first model that directly infers all key 3D attributes (camera poses, depths, and dense geometry) jointly in one pass. However, this joint inference mechanism requires global attention layers that perform all-to-all attention computation on tokens from all views. For reconstruction of large scenes with long-sequence inputs, this causes a significant latency bottleneck. In this paper, we propose head-wise temporal merging (HTTM), a training-free 3D token merging method for accelerating VGGT. Existing merging techniques merge tokens uniformly across different attention heads, resulting in identical tokens in the layers' output, which hinders the model's representational ability. HTTM tackles this problem by merging tokens in multi-head granularity, which preserves the uniqueness of feature tokens after head concatenation. Additionally, this enables HTTM to leverage the spatial locality and temporal correspondence observed at the head level to achieve higher merging ratios with lower merging costs compared to existing methods. Thus, HTTM achieves up to 7x acceleration with negligible performance drops in a GPU-based inference.

TL;DR: ConFu is a contrastive learning framework that jointly embeds individual modalities and their fused combinations into a unified representation space, capturing both pairwise and higher-order multimodal dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal methods either focus on pairwise alignment (missing higher-order interactions) or capture higher-order interactions but overlook pairwise relationships, limiting their effectiveness on single-modality tasks.

Method: Extends traditional pairwise contrastive objectives with an additional fused-modality contrastive term that aligns modality pairs with a third modality, enabling capture of higher-order dependencies while maintaining pairwise correspondence.

Result: Demonstrates competitive performance on retrieval and classification tasks across synthetic and real-world benchmarks, supporting unified one-to-one and two-to-one retrieval within a single framework.

Conclusion: ConFu successfully captures higher-order multimodal dependencies (like XOR relationships) that cannot be recovered through pairwise alignment alone, while preserving strong pairwise correspondence for single-modality tasks.

Abstract: Learning joint representations across multiple modalities remains a central challenge in multimodal machine learning. Prevailing approaches predominantly operate in pairwise settings, aligning two modalities at a time. While some recent methods aim to capture higher-order interactions among multiple modalities, they often overlook or insufficiently preserve pairwise relationships, limiting their effectiveness on single-modality tasks. In this work, we introduce Contrastive Fusion (ConFu), a framework that jointly embeds both individual modalities and their fused combinations into a unified representation space, where modalities and their fused counterparts are aligned. ConFu extends traditional pairwise contrastive objectives with an additional fused-modality contrastive term, encouraging the joint embedding of modality pairs with a third modality. This formulation enables ConFu to capture higher-order dependencies, such as XOR-like relationships, that cannot be recovered through pairwise alignment alone, while still maintaining strong pairwise correspondence. We evaluate ConFu on synthetic and real-world multimodal benchmarks, assessing its ability to exploit cross-modal complementarity, capture higher-order dependencies, and scale with increasing multimodal complexity. Across these settings, ConFu demonstrates competitive performance on retrieval and classification tasks, while supporting unified one-to-one and two-to-one retrieval within a single contrastive framework.

Motivation: Need for low-latency, low-power real-time monitoring of structural safety in transport infrastructure that preserves spatial feature grounding and supports transparent decision-making.

Method: Hybrid pipeline integrating SIFT for spatial feature encoding, latency-driven spike conversion layer, and LIF Spiking Neural Network for classification, tested on Auckland Harbour Bridge dataset with synthetic augmentation.

Result: 92.3% classification accuracy with 9.5ms per-frame inference time, 8.1% sparse spike activity, enabling real-time edge deployment on consumer-grade hardware.

Conclusion: SIFT-SNN provides efficient, interpretable structural monitoring with sub-10ms latency, though generalization to unseen field conditions needs validation.

Abstract: This paper presents the SIFT-SNN framework, a low-latency neuromorphic signal-processing pipeline for real-time detection of structural anomalies in transport infrastructure. The proposed approach integrates Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) for spatial feature encoding with a latency-driven spike conversion layer and a Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) Spiking Neural Network (SNN) for classification. The Auckland Harbour Bridge dataset is recorded under various weather and lighting conditions, comprising 6,000 labelled frames that include both real and synthetically augmented unsafe cases. The presented system achieves a classification accuracy of 92.3% (+- 0.8%) with a per-frame inference time of 9.5 ms. Achieved sub-10 millisecond latency, combined with sparse spike activity (8.1%), enables real-time, low-power edge deployment. Unlike conventional CNN-based approaches, the hybrid SIFT-SNN pipeline explicitly preserves spatial feature grounding, enhances interpretability, supports transparent decision-making, and operates efficiently on embedded hardware. Although synthetic augmentation improved robustness, generalisation to unseen field conditions remains to be validated. The SIFT-SNN framework is validated through a working prototype deployed on a consumer-grade system and framed as a generalisable case study in structural safety monitoring for movable concrete barriers, which, as a traffic flow-control infrastructure, is deployed in over 20 cities worldwide.

Extensive baseline experiments show that a single model trained on SurgMLLMBench achieves consistent performance across domains and generalizes effectively to unseen datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel multi-scale feature fusion approach for robust normal estimation in point clouds that addresses patch size selection issues through feature aggregation and compensation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with selecting appropriate neighborhood sizes for different point cloud data and geometries, leading to inaccurate normal estimation. The difficulty lies in determining optimal patch sizes for various data types.

Method: Proposes Patch Feature Fitting (PFF) using multi-scale feature fusion with two key modules: feature aggregation (progressively aggregates features from different scales while shrinking patch size) and feature compensation (ensures reusability of features from larger scales and reveals cross-scale associations).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets with fewer network parameters and reduced running time compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The multi-scale feature fusion strategy enables scale adaptation for varying local patches and delivers optimal feature descriptions for robust normal estimation in diverse point cloud data.

Abstract: Estimating the normal of a point requires constructing a local patch to provide center-surrounding context, but determining the appropriate neighborhood size is difficult when dealing with different data or geometries. Existing methods commonly employ various parameter-heavy strategies to extract a full feature description from the input patch. However, they still have difficulties in accurately and efficiently predicting normals for various point clouds. In this work, we present a new idea of feature extraction for robust normal estimation of point clouds. We use the fusion of multi-scale features from different neighborhood sizes to address the issue of selecting reasonable patch sizes for various data or geometries. We seek to model a patch feature fitting (PFF) based on multi-scale features to approximate the optimal geometric description for normal estimation and implement the approximation process via multi-scale feature aggregation and cross-scale feature compensation. The feature aggregation module progressively aggregates the patch features of different scales to the center of the patch and shrinks the patch size by removing points far from the center. It not only enables the network to precisely capture the structure characteristic in a wide range, but also describes highly detailed geometries. The feature compensation module ensures the reusability of features from earlier layers of large scales and reveals associated information in different patch sizes. Our approximation strategy based on aggregating the features of multiple scales enables the model to achieve scale adaptation of varying local patches and deliver the optimal feature description. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets with fewer network parameters and running time.

TL;DR: Endo-G²T: A geometry-guided and temporally aware training scheme for 4D Gaussian splatting that addresses view-dependent effects in endoscopic videos through monocular depth supervision, temporal modeling, and keyframe-constrained streaming.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Endoscopic videos suffer from strong view-dependent effects like specularities and occlusions, causing pure photometric supervision to misalign with geometry and trigger early geometric drift that becomes hard to correct during densification.

Method: Three main components: 1) Geo-guided prior distillation using confidence-gated monocular depth with scale-invariant losses, 2) Time-embedded Gaussian field with rotor-like rotation for temporal coherence, 3) Keyframe-constrained streaming with max-points budget for efficiency and stability.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on EndoNeRF and StereoMIS-P1 datasets among monocular reconstruction baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed Endo-G²T effectively anchors geometry early in 4D Gaussian splatting while maintaining temporal consistency and efficiency for dynamic endoscopic scene reconstruction.

Abstract: Endoscopic (endo) video exhibits strong view-dependent effects such as specularities, wet reflections, and occlusions. Pure photometric supervision misaligns with geometry and triggers early geometric drift, where erroneous shapes are reinforced during densification and become hard to correct. We ask how to anchor geometry early for 4D Gaussian splatting (4DGS) while maintaining temporal consistency and efficiency in dynamic endoscopic scenes. Thus, we present Endo-G$^{2}$T, a geometry-guided and temporally aware training scheme for time-embedded 4DGS. First, geo-guided prior distillation converts confidence-gated monocular depth into supervision with scale-invariant depth and depth-gradient losses, using a warm-up-to-cap schedule to inject priors softly and avoid early overfitting. Second, a time-embedded Gaussian field represents dynamics in XYZT with a rotor-like rotation parameterization, yielding temporally coherent geometry with lightweight regularization that favors smooth motion and crisp opacity boundaries. Third, keyframe-constrained streaming improves efficiency and long-horizon stability through keyframe-focused optimization under a max-points budget, while non-keyframes advance with lightweight updates. Across EndoNeRF and StereoMIS-P1 datasets, Endo-G$^{2}$T achieves state-of-the-art results among monocular reconstruction baselines.

TL;DR: STVG-o1 enables off-the-shelf multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to achieve state-of-the-art spatio-temporal video grounding performance through bounding-box chain-of-thought reasoning and multi-dimensional reinforcement fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs underperform on spatio-temporal video grounding (STVG) due to misaligned training objectives and weak fine-grained region-word alignment in standard visual encoders.

Method: Proposes a bounding-box chain-of-thought mechanism for explicit spatio-temporal reasoning and a multi-dimensional reinforcement reward function with format, consistency, temporal, spatial, and think rewards for geometry-aware supervision.

Result: Sets new SOTA on HCSTVG, outperforming best task-specific method by 7.3% m_tIoU on HCSTVG-v1, matches specialized models on VidSTG, and surpasses all existing MLLM-based approaches by large margins with strong open-vocabulary generalization.

Conclusion: Establishes MLLMs as viable and powerful backbones for precise spatio-temporal video grounding without architectural modifications.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal video grounding (STVG) requires localizing a target object in untrimmed videos both temporally and spatially from natural language descriptions. Despite their strong language understanding, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) underperform on STVG due to misaligned training objectives and weak fine-grained region-word alignment in standard visual encoders. To address this, we propose STVG-o1, the first framework that enables off-the-shelf MLLMs to achieve state-of-the-art STVG performance without any architectural modifications. Our method introduces a bounding-box chain-of-thought mechanism that explicitly reasons about spatio-temporal locations in an intermediate step before producing the final prediction. We further design a multi-dimensional reinforcement reward function consisting of format, consistency, temporal, spatial, and think rewards, which provides geometry-aware supervision through reinforcement fine-tuning. Evaluated on HCSTVG-v1/v2 and VidSTG, STVG-o1 sets new state-of-the-art results on HCSTVG, outperforming the best task-specific method by 7.3\% m\_tIoU on HCSTVG-v1, matching specialized models on VidSTG, and surpassing all existing MLLM-based approaches by large margins. It also demonstrates strong open-vocabulary generalization across datasets, establishing MLLMs as viable and powerful backbones for precise spatio-temporal grounding. Our code and models will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Monet enables multimodal LLMs to reason directly in latent visual space using continuous embeddings as visual thoughts, overcoming limitations of external tools through a three-stage SFT pipeline and VLPO reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for visual reasoning lack human-like abstract visual thinking due to limited flexibility from external tools, and face challenges with high computational costs and insufficient supervision in latent-vision alignment.

Method: Three-stage distillation-based supervised fine-tuning pipeline with VLPO (Visual-latent Policy Optimization) reinforcement learning, trained on Monet-SFT-125K dataset containing 125K text-image interleaved CoTs.

Result: Monet-7B shows consistent gains across real-world perception and reasoning benchmarks with strong out-of-distribution generalization on abstract visual reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enables latent visual reasoning in MLLMs, with empirical analysis providing insights for future developments in visual latent reasoning.

Abstract: "Thinking with images" has emerged as an effective paradigm for advancing visual reasoning, extending beyond text-only chains of thought by injecting visual evidence into intermediate reasoning steps. However, existing methods fall short of human-like abstract visual thinking, as their flexibility is fundamentally limited by external tools. In this work, we introduce Monet, a training framework that enables multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to reason directly within the latent visual space by generating continuous embeddings that function as intermediate visual thoughts. We identify two core challenges in training MLLMs for latent visual reasoning: high computational cost in latent-vision alignment and insufficient supervision over latent embeddings, and address them with a three-stage distillation-based supervised fine-tuning (SFT) pipeline. We further reveal a limitation of applying GRPO to latent reasoning: it primarily enhances text-based reasoning rather than latent reasoning. To overcome this, we propose VLPO (Visual-latent Policy Optimization), a reinforcement learning method that explicitly incorporates latent embeddings into policy gradient updates. To support SFT, we construct Monet-SFT-125K, a high-quality text-image interleaved CoT dataset containing 125K real-world, chart, OCR, and geometry CoTs. Our model, Monet-7B, shows consistent gains across real-world perception and reasoning benchmarks and exhibits strong out-of-distribution generalization on challenging abstract visual reasoning tasks. We also empirically analyze the role of each training component and discuss our early unsuccessful attempts, providing insights for future developments in visual latent reasoning.

*Jiyun Bae,Hyunjong Ok,Sangwoo Mo,Jaeho Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Visual distractors in VLMs cause inverse scaling (reduced accuracy without increased reasoning length), unlike textual distractors. A new dataset Idis systematically tests semantic, numerical, and spatial distractors, revealing insights through attribute tracking in reasoning traces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether visual distractors in vision-language models cause similar inverse scaling effects as observed with textual distractors in language models, where longer reasoning leads to worse performance.

Method: Created Idis dataset with systematic visual distractors across semantic, numerical, and spatial dimensions. Analyzed reasoning traces by tracking attribute counts and tested on established bias benchmarks like Waterbirds.

Result: Visual distractors cause inverse scaling but differ from textual ones: accuracy decreases without increasing reasoning length. Attribute tracking in reasoning traces reveals how distractors affect model performance. Trends extend to bias benchmarks.

Conclusion: Visual distractors fundamentally differ from textual ones in their scaling effects. Proposed simple prompting strategy can mitigate bias-driven predictions in reasoning models.

Abstract: How does irrelevant information (i.e., distractors) affect test-time scaling in vision-language models (VLMs)? Prior studies on language models have reported an inverse scaling effect, where textual distractors lead to longer but less effective reasoning. To investigate whether similar phenomena occur in multimodal settings, we introduce Idis (Images with distractors), a visual question-answering dataset that systematically varies distractors along semantic, numerical, and spatial dimensions. Our analyses reveal that visual distractors differ fundamentally from textual ones: although inverse scaling persists, adding visual distractors reduces accuracy without increasing reasoning length. We further show that tracking attribute counts within reasoning traces provides key insights into how distractors, reasoning length, and accuracy interact. Finally, we demonstrate that these trends extend to established visual bias benchmarks such as Waterbirds, and we propose a simple prompting strategy to mitigate bias-driven predictions in reasoning models.

*Mingue Park,Prin Phunyaphibarn,Phillip Y. Lee,Minhyuk Sung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiverseVAR enhances diversity in text-conditioned visual autoregressive models without retraining by combining text-embedding noise injection with scale-travel latent refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VAR models suffer from limited diversity, producing nearly identical images for simple prompts, which has been overlooked amid focus on image quality.

Method: Two-stage approach: (1) Inject noise into text embedding to increase diversity, (2) Use scale-travel latent refinement with multi-scale autoencoder to preserve image quality by resuming generation at intermediate stages.

Result: Combining text-embedding noise injection with scale-travel refinement significantly enhances diversity while minimizing quality degradation, achieving new Pareto frontier in diversity-quality trade-off.

Conclusion: DiverseVAR provides an effective test-time solution to improve VAR model diversity without computational overhead or retraining, addressing a critical limitation in current visual autoregressive models.

Abstract: We introduce DiverseVAR, a framework that enhances the diversity of text-conditioned visual autoregressive models (VAR) at test time without requiring retraining, fine-tuning, or substantial computational overhead. While VAR models have recently emerged as strong competitors to diffusion and flow models for image generation, they suffer from a critical limitation in diversity, often producing nearly identical images even for simple prompts. This issue has largely gone unnoticed amid the predominant focus on image quality. We address this limitation at test time in two stages. First, inspired by diversity enhancement techniques in diffusion models, we propose injecting noise into the text embedding. This introduces a trade-off between diversity and image quality: as diversity increases, the image quality sharply declines. To preserve quality, we propose scale-travel: a novel latent refinement technique inspired by time-travel strategies in diffusion models. Specifically, we use a multi-scale autoencoder to extract coarse-scale tokens that enable us to resume generation at intermediate stages. Extensive experiments show that combining text-embedding noise injection with our scale-travel refinement significantly enhances diversity while minimizing image-quality degradation, achieving a new Pareto frontier in the diversity-quality trade-off.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel remote sensing change captioning method that uses the SAM foundation model to extract region-level representations and incorporates knowledge graphs to enhance change description accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for remote sensing change captioning have weak region awareness and limited temporal alignment, which limits their ability to accurately describe changes between images captured at different times.

Method: The method combines CNN/Transformer for global features, SAM foundation model for semantic- and motion-level change regions, and a knowledge graph for object information. These heterogeneous sources are fused via cross-attention and processed by a Transformer decoder to generate natural language descriptions.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses region awareness and temporal alignment limitations in remote sensing change captioning by leveraging SAM foundation model and knowledge graphs, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Remote sensing change captioning is an emerging and popular research task that aims to describe, in natural language, the content of interest that has changed between two remote sensing images captured at different times. Existing methods typically employ CNNs/Transformers to extract visual representations from the given images or incorporate auxiliary tasks to enhance the final results, with weak region awareness and limited temporal alignment. To address these issues, this paper explores the use of the SAM (Segment Anything Model) foundation model to extract region-level representations and inject region-of-interest knowledge into the captioning framework. Specifically, we employ a CNN/Transformer model to extract global-level vision features, leverage the SAM foundation model to delineate semantic- and motion-level change regions, and utilize a specially constructed knowledge graph to provide information about objects of interest. These heterogeneous sources of information are then fused via cross-attention, and a Transformer decoder is used to generate the final natural language description of the observed changes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple widely used benchmark datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: E-M3RF is an equivariant multimodal 3D reassembly framework that combines geometric and color features using SE(3) flow matching to improve assembly accuracy, especially when geometry alone is ambiguous.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning-based 3D reassembly methods rely primarily on geometric features, struggling when geometry is insufficient or ambiguous (e.g., small, eroded, or symmetric fragments) and lacking physical constraints to prevent overlapping assemblies.

Method: Uses SE(3) flow matching to predict transformations for reassembly. Each fragment is represented by: 1) rotation-consistent geometric features from a rotation-equivariant encoder, and 2) color features encoded with a transformer. These multimodal features are then combined.

Result: On the RePAIR dataset, E-M3RF reduces rotation error by 23.1%, translation error by 13.2%, and Chamfer Distance by 18.4% compared to competing methods. Validated on four datasets including synthetic (Breaking Bad, Fantastic Breaks) and real-world cultural heritage (RePAIR, Presious) datasets.

Conclusion: E-M3RF effectively addresses limitations of geometry-only approaches by incorporating multimodal features and physical constraints, demonstrating significant improvements in 3D reassembly accuracy across diverse datasets.

Abstract: 3D reassembly is a fundamental geometric problem, and in recent years it has increasingly been challenged by deep learning methods rather than classical optimization. While learning approaches have shown promising results, most still rely primarily on geometric features to assemble a whole from its parts. As a result, methods struggle when geometry alone is insufficient or ambiguous, for example, for small, eroded, or symmetric fragments. Additionally, solutions do not impose physical constraints that explicitly prevent overlapping assemblies. To address these limitations, we introduce E-M3RF, an equivariant multimodal 3D reassembly framework that takes as input the point clouds, containing both point positions and colors of fractured fragments, and predicts the transformations required to reassemble them using SE(3) flow matching. Each fragment is represented by both geometric and color features: i) 3D point positions are encoded as rotationconsistent geometric features using a rotation-equivariant encoder, ii) the colors at each 3D point are encoded with a transformer. The two feature sets are then combined to form a multimodal representation. We experimented on four datasets: two synthetic datasets, Breaking Bad and Fantastic Breaks, and two real-world cultural heritage datasets, RePAIR and Presious, demonstrating that E-M3RF on the RePAIR dataset reduces rotation error by 23.1% and translation error by 13.2%, while Chamfer Distance decreases by 18.4% compared to competing methods.

Abstract: We present a novel unsupervised framework to unlock vast unlabeled human demonstration data from continuous industrial video streams for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model pre-training. Our method first trains a lightweight motion tokenizer to encode motion dynamics, then employs an unsupervised action segmenter leveraging a novel "Latent Action Energy" metric to discover and segment semantically coherent action primitives. The pipeline outputs both segmented video clips and their corresponding latent action sequences, providing structured data directly suitable for VLA pre-training. Evaluations on public benchmarks and a proprietary electric motor assembly dataset demonstrate effective segmentation of key tasks performed by humans at workstations. Further clustering and quantitative assessment via a Vision-Language Model confirm the semantic coherence of the discovered action primitives. To our knowledge, this is the first fully automated end-to-end system for extracting and organizing VLA pre-training data from unstructured industrial videos, offering a scalable solution for embodied AI integration in manufacturing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras produce spatially sparse but temporally dense data, and existing methods using event frames/voxels struggle with undersampling due to spatial sparsity.

Method: Uses hypergraphs to connect event tokens across different times and spatial locations, enabling contextual message passing for event completion. Can incorporate RGB tokens for multi-modal completion, then aggregates node information through self-attention.

Result: Extensive experiments on single- and multi-label event classification tasks fully validated the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Conclusion: The hypergraph-based approach successfully addresses spatial sparsity in event streams and enables effective multi-modal feature learning and fusion.

Abstract: Event cameras produce asynchronous event streams that are spatially sparse yet temporally dense. Mainstream event representation learning algorithms typically use event frames, voxels, or tensors as input. Although these approaches have achieved notable progress, they struggle to address the undersampling problem caused by spatial sparsity. In this paper, we propose a novel hypergraph-guided spatio-temporal event stream completion mechanism, which connects event tokens across different times and spatial locations via hypergraphs and leverages contextual information message passing to complete these sparse events. The proposed method can flexibly incorporate RGB tokens as nodes in the hypergraph within this completion framework, enabling multi-modal hypergraph-based information completion. Subsequently, we aggregate hypergraph node information across different time steps through self-attention, enabling effective learning and fusion of multi-modal features. Extensive experiments on both single- and multi-label event classification tasks fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

Conclusion: MobileI2V demonstrates the feasibility of real-time high-quality image-to-video synthesis on mobile devices through efficient architectural design and optimization strategies.

Abstract: Recently, video generation has witnessed rapid advancements, drawing increasing attention to image-to-video (I2V) synthesis on mobile devices. However, the substantial computational complexity and slow generation speed of diffusion models pose significant challenges for real-time, high-resolution video generation on resource-constrained mobile devices. In this work, we propose MobileI2V, a 270M lightweight diffusion model for real-time image-to-video generation on mobile devices. The core lies in: (1) We analyzed the performance of linear attention modules and softmax attention modules on mobile devices, and proposed a linear hybrid architecture denoiser that balances generation efficiency and quality. (2) We design a time-step distillation strategy that compresses the I2V sampling steps from more than 20 to only two without significant quality loss, resulting in a 10-fold increase in generation speed. (3) We apply mobile-specific attention optimizations that yield a 2-fold speed-up for attention operations during on-device inference. MobileI2V enables, for the first time, fast 720p image-to-video generation on mobile devices, with quality comparable to existing models. Under one-step conditions, the generation speed of each frame of 720p video is less than 100 ms. Our code is available at: https://github.com/hustvl/MobileI2V.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address catastrophic forgetting in Class Incremental Learning by directly optimizing model weights in parameter space while preserving knowledge from previous tasks.

Method: Uses two types of weight merging: inter-task (averaging weights from previous stages) and intra-task (combining parameters within current stage), plus bounded update technique to minimize cumulative updates and preserve previous knowledge.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on standard CIL benchmarks.

Conclusion: M&B effectively reduces catastrophic forgetting and can be seamlessly integrated into existing CIL methods without architectural changes or revised learning objectives.

Abstract: We present a novel training approach, named Merge-and-Bound (M&B) for Class Incremental Learning (CIL), which directly manipulates model weights in the parameter space for optimization. Our algorithm involves two types of weight merging: inter-task weight merging and intra-task weight merging. Inter-task weight merging unifies previous models by averaging the weights of models from all previous stages. On the other hand, intra-task weight merging facilitates the learning of current task by combining the model parameters within current stage. For reliable weight merging, we also propose a bounded update technique that aims to optimize the target model with minimal cumulative updates and preserve knowledge from previous tasks; this strategy reveals that it is possible to effectively obtain new models near old ones, reducing catastrophic forgetting. M&B is seamlessly integrated into existing CIL methods without modifying architecture components or revising learning objectives. We extensively evaluate our algorithm on standard CIL benchmarks and demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: The effectiveness of deepfake detection methods often depends less on their core design and more on implementation details such as data preprocessing, augmentation strategies, and optimization techniques. These factors make it difficult to fairly compare detectors and to understand which factors truly contribute to their performance. To address this, we systematically investigate how different design choices influence the accuracy and generalization capabilities of deepfake detection models, focusing on aspects related to training, inference, and incremental updates. By isolating the impact of individual factors, we aim to establish robust, architecture-agnostic best practices for the design and development of future deepfake detection systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework for automated ANA detection using multi-instance multi-label learning with three key components: instance sampler, probabilistic pseudo-label dispatcher, and self-paced weight learning, achieving state-of-the-art performance on medical datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual ANA testing for autoimmune disorders is slow, labor-intensive, and requires extensive training. The complexity arises from over 100 coexisting antibody types creating vast fluorescent pattern combinations, making automation challenging in real-world clinical settings.

Method: Proposed framework handles MIML tasks using unaltered microscope images without manual preprocessing. Uses three components: instance sampler (suppresses low-confidence instances), probabilistic pseudo-label dispatcher (adaptive label assignment), and self-paced weight learning rate coefficients (adjusts training based on empirical observations).

Result: Achieves up to +7.0% F1-Macro and +12.6% mAP gains over prior methods on ANA dataset. Ranks top-2 across all key metrics on public datasets, reducing Hamming loss by up to 18.2% and one-error by 26.9%. Sets new state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: The framework successfully overcomes limitations of traditional MIML methods, supports end-to-end optimization, and demonstrates superior performance for automated ANA detection in clinical settings, providing a practical solution for complex medical image analysis tasks.

Abstract: Antinuclear antibody (ANA) testing is a crucial method for diagnosing autoimmune disorders, including lupus, Sjögren's syndrome, and scleroderma. Despite its importance, manual ANA detection is slow, labor-intensive, and demands years of training. ANA detection is complicated by over 100 coexisting antibody types, resulting in vast fluorescent pattern combinations. Although machine learning and deep learning have enabled automation, ANA detection in real-world clinical settings presents unique challenges as it involves multi-instance, multi-label (MIML) learning. In this paper, a novel framework for ANA detection is proposed that handles the complexities of MIML tasks using unaltered microscope images without manual preprocessing. Inspired by human labeling logic, it identifies consistent ANA sub-regions and assigns aggregated labels accordingly. These steps are implemented using three task-specific components: an instance sampler, a probabilistic pseudo-label dispatcher, and self-paced weight learning rate coefficients. The instance sampler suppresses low-confidence instances by modeling pattern confidence, while the dispatcher adaptively assigns labels based on instance distinguishability. Self-paced learning adjusts training according to empirical label observations. Our framework overcomes limitations of traditional MIML methods and supports end-to-end optimization. Extensive experiments on one ANA dataset and three public medical MIML benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our framework. On the ANA dataset, our model achieves up to +7.0% F1-Macro and +12.6% mAP gains over the best prior method, setting new state-of-the-art results. It also ranks top-2 across all key metrics on public datasets, reducing Hamming loss and one-error by up to 18.2% and 26.9%, respectively.

*Pierre Adorni,Minh-Tan Pham,Stéphane May,Sébastien Lefèvre*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An Ensemble-of-Specialists framework for Remote Sensing Foundation Models that uses lightweight task-specific specialists instead of large monolithic models, offering efficiency, interpretability and extensibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current foundation model approaches require prohibitive computational resources and contradict sustainable AI principles due to immense carbon footprints, limiting accessibility to large institutions.

Method: Decomposes training into lightweight ConvNeXtV2 specialists that are task-specific, can be frozen and reused, and supports federated training, pruning, and continuous integration.

Result: Creates a modular framework that is efficient, interpretable, and extensible while being suitable for collaborative and resource-constrained settings.

Conclusion: Sets a new direction for building scalable and efficient Remote Sensing Foundation Models that address sustainability and accessibility concerns.

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models have shown great promise in domains such as natural language processing and computer vision, and similar efforts are now emerging in the Earth Observation community. These models aim to generalize across tasks with limited supervision, reducing the need for training separate models for each task. However, current strategies, which largely focus on scaling model size and dataset volume, require prohibitive computational and data resources, limiting accessibility to only a few large institutions. Moreover, this paradigm of ever-larger models stands in stark contrast with the principles of sustainable and environmentally responsible AI, as it leads to immense carbon footprints and resource inefficiency. In this work, we present a novel and efficient alternative: an Ensemble-of-Specialists framework for building Remote Sensing Foundation Models (RSFMs). Our method decomposes the training process into lightweight, task-specific ConvNeXtV2 specialists that can be frozen and reused. This modular approach offers strong advantages in efficiency, interpretability, and extensibility. Moreover, it naturally supports federated training, pruning, and continuous specialist integration, making it particularly well-suited for collaborative and resource-constrained settings. Our framework sets a new direction for building scalable and efficient RSFMs.

*Xin Hong,Kaifeng Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel method for generating sequential MRI images to predict Alzheimer's disease progression, using quantitative metrics and age-scaling factors to improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Timely identification of Alzheimer's disease is crucial for personalized treatment, but existing methods struggle with irregular time intervals in image sequences and accurately representing disease characteristics.

Method: The study introduces an innovative sequential image generation methodology guided by quantitative metrics, integrated with age-scaling factors to produce age-specific MRI images for predicting advanced disease stages.

Result: Ablation studies showed that quantitative metrics significantly improved MRI image synthesis accuracy, and age-scaled pixel loss enhanced iterative generation. The Structural Similarity Index reached 0.882 for long-term disease prognosis.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully generates realistic sequential MRI images for Alzheimer's disease prediction, with quantitative metrics and age-scaling factors proving crucial for maintaining disease progression features and improving synthesis accuracy.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease is a debilitating disorder marked by a decline in cognitive function. Timely identification of the disease is essential for the development of personalized treatment strategies that aim to mitigate its progression. The application of generated images for the prediction of Alzheimer's disease poses challenges, particularly in accurately representing the disease's characteristics when input sequences are captured at irregular time intervals. This study presents an innovative methodology for sequential image generation, guided by quantitative metrics, to maintain the essential features indicative of disease progression. Furthermore, an age-scaling factor is integrated into the process to produce age-specific MRI images, facilitating the prediction of advanced stages of the disease. The results obtained from the ablation study suggest that the inclusion of quantitative metrics significantly improves the accuracy of MRI image synthesis. Furthermore, the application of age-scaled pixel loss contributed to the enhanced iterative generation of MRI images. In terms of long-term disease prognosis, the Structural Similarity Index reached a peak value of 0.882, indicating a substantial degree of similarity in the synthesized images.

### [100] [Video Generation Models Are Good Latent Reward Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21541)
*Xiaoyue Mi,Wenqing Yu,Jiesong Lian,Shibo Jie,Ruizhe Zhong,Zijun Liu,Guozhen Zhang,Zixiang Zhou,Zhiyong Xu,Yuan Zhou,Qinglin Lu,Fan Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRFL introduces latent-space preference optimization for video generation, avoiding costly pixel-space processing by using pre-trained models as reward models in noisy latent space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video reward models require pixel-space inputs, leading to high memory usage, long training times, and late-stage optimization that misses early motion dynamics.

Method: Proposes Process Reward Feedback Learning (PRFL) that conducts preference optimization entirely in latent space using pre-trained video generation models as reward models, enabling full denoising chain optimization without VAE decoding.

Result: PRFL significantly improves alignment with human preferences while achieving substantial reductions in memory consumption and training time compared to RGB ReFL.

Conclusion: Video generation models are naturally suited for latent-space reward modeling, enabling efficient preference optimization throughout the entire denoising process.

Abstract: Reward feedback learning (ReFL) has proven effective for aligning image generation with human preferences. However, its extension to video generation faces significant challenges. Existing video reward models rely on vision-language models designed for pixel-space inputs, confining ReFL optimization to near-complete denoising steps after computationally expensive VAE decoding. This pixel-space approach incurs substantial memory overhead and increased training time, and its late-stage optimization lacks early-stage supervision, refining only visual quality rather than fundamental motion dynamics and structural coherence. In this work, we show that pre-trained video generation models are naturally suited for reward modeling in the noisy latent space, as they are explicitly designed to process noisy latent representations at arbitrary timesteps and inherently preserve temporal information through their sequential modeling capabilities. Accordingly, we propose Process Reward Feedback Learning~(PRFL), a framework that conducts preference optimization entirely in latent space, enabling efficient gradient backpropagation throughout the full denoising chain without VAE decoding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRFL significantly improves alignment with human preferences, while achieving substantial reductions in memory consumption and training time compared to RGB ReFL.

### [101] [UAVLight: A Benchmark for Illumination-Robust 3D Reconstruction in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21565)
*Kang Du,Xue Liao,Junpeng Xia,Chaozheng Guo,Yi Gu,Yirui Guan,Duotun Wang,ShengHuang,Zeyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UAVLight is a new benchmark for illumination-robust 3D reconstruction that captures scenes at multiple fixed times of day along repeatable flight paths to provide natural lighting variation under consistent geometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Illumination inconsistency from sunlight direction, cloud cover, and shadows breaks constant-lighting assumptions in multi-view 3D reconstruction, causing geometry drift and color issues. Existing datasets either lack meaningful illumination diversity or have confounding geometric/semantic changes.

Method: Captures scenes along repeatable, geo-referenced flight paths at multiple fixed times of day, producing natural lighting variation while maintaining consistent geometry, calibration, and viewpoints.

Result: Provides a controlled-yet-real benchmark with standardized evaluation protocols across lighting conditions for developing illumination-robust reconstruction methods.

Conclusion: UAVLight offers a reliable foundation for benchmarking reconstruction methods that are consistent, faithful, and relightable in real outdoor environments, addressing the critical illumination inconsistency problem in UAV-based reconstruction.

Abstract: Illumination inconsistency is a fundamental challenge in multi-view 3D reconstruction. Variations in sunlight direction, cloud cover, and shadows break the constant-lighting assumption underlying both classical multi-view stereo (MVS) and structure from motion (SfM) pipelines and recent neural rendering methods, leading to geometry drift, color inconsistency, and shadow imprinting. This issue is especially critical in UAV-based reconstruction, where long flight durations and outdoor environments make lighting changes unavoidable. However, existing datasets either restrict capture to short time windows, thus lacking meaningful illumination diversity, or span months and seasons, where geometric and semantic changes confound the isolated study of lighting robustness. We introduce UAVLight, a controlled-yet-real benchmark for illumination-robust 3D reconstruction. Each scene is captured along repeatable, geo-referenced flight paths at multiple fixed times of day, producing natural lighting variation under consistent geometry, calibration, and viewpoints. With standardized evaluation protocols across lighting conditions, UAVLight provides a reliable foundation for developing and benchmarking reconstruction methods that are consistent, faithful, and relightable in real outdoor environments.

*Xiang Gu,Liming Lu,Xu Zheng,Anan Du,Yongbin Zhou,Shuchao Pang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A teacher-student framework called MRPD that uses multimodal knowledge distillation to create robust 3D point cloud models against adversarial attacks, with no inference overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defense methods for 3D point cloud models suffer from high computational costs and poor generalization across different attack types, limiting their practical deployment in security-sensitive applications.

Method: Multimodal Robust Prompt Distillation (MRPD) uses three teacher models (vision model for depth projections, high-performance 3D model, and text encoder) to distill robust embeddings into a student point cloud model via lightweight prompts, guided by a confidence-gated mechanism.

Result: MRPD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods against various white-box and black-box attacks while achieving better performance on clean data, with no additional computational cost at inference.

Conclusion: The work presents a practical paradigm for building robust 3D vision systems by efficiently leveraging multimodal knowledge through distillation during training.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks pose a significant threat to learning-based 3D point cloud models, critically undermining their reliability in security-sensitive applications. Existing defense methods often suffer from (1) high computational overhead and (2) poor generalization ability across diverse attack types. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel yet efficient teacher-student framework, namely Multimodal Robust Prompt Distillation (MRPD) for distilling robust 3D point cloud model. It learns lightweight prompts by aligning student point cloud model's features with robust embeddings from three distinct teachers: a vision model processing depth projections, a high-performance 3D model, and a text encoder. To ensure a reliable knowledge transfer, this distillation is guided by a confidence-gated mechanism which dynamically balances the contribution of all input modalities. Notably, since the distillation is all during the training stage, there is no additional computational cost at inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MRPD substantially outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods against a wide range of white-box and black-box attacks, while even achieving better performance on clean data. Our work presents a new, practical paradigm for building robust 3D vision systems by efficiently harnessing multimodal knowledge.

*Chou Mo,Yehyun Suh,J. Ryan Martin,Daniel Moyer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework combining 2D/3D landmark registration with U-Net training improves landmark detection accuracy in pelvic fluoroscopy under variable patient positioning conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pelvic landmark detection methods assume fixed Antero-Posterior views, but real intra-operative imaging often has variable orientations due to patient positioning or imaging unit movement.

Method: Proposed framework incorporates 2D/3D landmark registration into U-Net training, comparing baseline U-Net, U-Net with Pose Estimation Loss, and fine-tuned U-Net with Pose Estimation Loss under variable pose conditions.

Result: The framework was evaluated under realistic intra-operative conditions with variable patient pose.

Conclusion: Incorporating pose estimation into landmark detection training addresses the limitation of fixed-view assumptions in pelvic fluoroscopy analysis.

Abstract: Automated landmark detection offers an efficient approach for medical professionals to understand patient anatomic structure and positioning using intra-operative imaging. While current detection methods for pelvic fluoroscopy demonstrate promising accuracy, most assume a fixed Antero-Posterior view of the pelvis. However, orientation often deviates from this standard view, either due to repositioning of the imaging unit or of the target structure itself. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that incorporates 2D/3D landmark registration into the training of a U-Net landmark prediction model. We analyze the performance difference by comparing landmark detection accuracy between the baseline U-Net, U-Net trained with Pose Estimation Loss, and U-Net fine-tuned with Pose Estimation Loss under realistic intra-operative conditions where patient pose is variable.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Harmony is a novel framework that addresses audio-visual synchronization challenges in joint diffusion models through cross-task synergy training, global-local decoupled interaction, and synchronization-enhanced CFG.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing open-source models struggle with robust audio-video alignment due to three fundamental challenges: correspondence drift in joint diffusion, inefficient global attention mechanisms, and intra-modal bias of conventional CFG that doesn't enhance cross-modal synchronization.

Method: Proposes three key components: (1) Cross-Task Synergy training using audio-driven video and video-driven audio generation tasks to mitigate drift, (2) Global-Local Decoupled Interaction Module for efficient temporal-style alignment, and (3) Synchronization-Enhanced CFG (SyncCFG) that explicitly amplifies alignment signals during inference.

Result: Extensive experiments show Harmony establishes new state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing methods in both generation fidelity and fine-grained audio-visual synchronization.

Conclusion: Harmony successfully overcomes fundamental challenges in joint diffusion processes for audio-visual synthesis, providing a robust framework that mechanistically enforces synchronization and achieves superior performance in both quality and alignment.

Abstract: The synthesis of synchronized audio-visual content is a key challenge in generative AI, with open-source models facing challenges in robust audio-video alignment. Our analysis reveals that this issue is rooted in three fundamental challenges of the joint diffusion process: (1) Correspondence Drift, where concurrently evolving noisy latents impede stable learning of alignment; (2) inefficient global attention mechanisms that fail to capture fine-grained temporal cues; and (3) the intra-modal bias of conventional Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), which enhances conditionality but not cross-modal synchronization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Harmony, a novel framework that mechanistically enforces audio-visual synchronization. We first propose a Cross-Task Synergy training paradigm to mitigate drift by leveraging strong supervisory signals from audio-driven video and video-driven audio generation tasks. Then, we design a Global-Local Decoupled Interaction Module for efficient and precise temporal-style alignment. Finally, we present a novel Synchronization-Enhanced CFG (SyncCFG) that explicitly isolates and amplifies the alignment signal during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Harmony establishes a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming existing methods in both generation fidelity and, critically, in achieving fine-grained audio-visual synchronization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Oral cancer is often diagnosed late due to visual similarity between benign, precancerous, and malignant lesions. Early computer-aided diagnosis systems could improve clinical outcomes.

Method: Combines stratified data splitting with advanced data augmentation and oversampling techniques to handle limited and imbalanced datasets for multiclass classification of oral lesions.

Result: Achieved 83.33% accuracy, 89.12% precision, and 77.31% recall, demonstrating superiority over existing state-of-the-art methods, with notable performance on minority classes.

Conclusion: The framework shows promise as a first step toward trustworthy computer-aided diagnostic systems for early oral cancer detection in clinical settings, effectively demonstrating the value of oversampling and augmentation strategies.

Abstract: Oral cancer is highly common across the globe and is mostly diagnosed during the later stages due to the close visual similarity to benign, precancerous, and malignant lesions in the oral cavity. Implementing computer aided diagnosis systems early on has the potential to greatly improve clinical outcomes. This research intends to use deep learning to build a multiclass classifier for sixteen different oral lesions. To overcome the challenges of limited and imbalanced datasets, the proposed technique combines stratified data splitting and advanced data augmentation and oversampling to perform the classification. The experimental results, which achieved 83.33 percent accuracy, 89.12 percent precision, and 77.31 percent recall, demonstrate the superiority of the suggested model over state of the art methods now in use. The suggested model effectively conveys the effectiveness of oversampling and augmentation strategies in situations where the minority class classification performance is noteworthy. As a first step toward trustworthy computer aided diagnostic systems for the early detection of oral cancer in clinical settings, the suggested framework shows promise.

*Haotian Xue,Qi Chen,Zhonghao Wang,Xun Huang,Eli Shechtman,Jinrong Xie,Yongxin Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoGAN is a motion-centric post-training framework that improves motion realism in video diffusion models by using an optical-flow discriminator and distribution-matching regularizer, achieving significant motion quality improvements without sacrificing visual fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video diffusion models achieve good frame-level fidelity but struggle with motion coherence and realism, producing jitter, ghosting, or implausible dynamics. The standard denoising MSE objective provides no direct supervision on temporal consistency.

Method: Built atop a 3-step distilled video diffusion model, MoGAN trains a DiT-based optical-flow discriminator to differentiate real from generated motion, combined with a distribution-matching regularizer to preserve visual fidelity.

Result: On VBench, MoGAN boosts motion score by +7.3% over the 50-step teacher and +13.3% over the 3-step DMD model. On VideoJAM-Bench, it improves motion score by +7.4% over the teacher and +8.8% over DMD. Human study shows preference for MoGAN's motion quality (52% vs. 38% for teacher; 56% vs. 29% for DMD).

Conclusion: MoGAN delivers significantly more realistic motion without sacrificing visual fidelity or efficiency, offering a practical path toward fast, high-quality video generation.

Abstract: Video diffusion models achieve strong frame-level fidelity but still struggle with motion coherence, dynamics and realism, often producing jitter, ghosting, or implausible dynamics. A key limitation is that the standard denoising MSE objective provides no direct supervision on temporal consistency, allowing models to achieve low loss while still generating poor motion. We propose MoGAN, a motion-centric post-training framework that improves motion realism without reward models or human preference data. Built atop a 3-step distilled video diffusion model, we train a DiT-based optical-flow discriminator to differentiate real from generated motion, combined with a distribution-matching regularizer to preserve visual fidelity. With experiments on Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B, MoGAN substantially improves motion quality across benchmarks. On VBench, MoGAN boosts motion score by +7.3% over the 50-step teacher and +13.3% over the 3-step DMD model. On VideoJAM-Bench, MoGAN improves motion score by +7.4% over the teacher and +8.8% over DMD, while maintaining comparable or even better aesthetic and image-quality scores. A human study further confirms that MoGAN is preferred for motion quality (52% vs. 38% for the teacher; 56% vs. 29% for DMD). Overall, MoGAN delivers significantly more realistic motion without sacrificing visual fidelity or efficiency, offering a practical path toward fast, high-quality video generation.

*M. Naseer Subhani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Self-prompting framework adapts SAM to remote sensing imagery using only point annotations, achieving better performance than pretrained SAM and other point-supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM performs poorly on remote sensing imagery due to domain shift and lack of dense annotations, requiring adaptation with minimal supervision.

Method: Refine-Requery-Reinforce loop: generate pseudo-masks from points, improve with self-constructed box prompts, and align embeddings across iterations to reduce bias.

Result: Consistently outperforms pretrained SAM and recent point-supervised methods on three RSI benchmarks (WHU, HRSID, NWPU VHR-10).

Conclusion: Self-prompting and semantic alignment provide efficient adaptation of foundation segmentation models for remote sensing using only point-level supervision.

Abstract: Interactive segmentation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) have demonstrated remarkable generalization on natural images, but perform suboptimally on remote sensing imagery (RSI) due to severe domain shift and the scarcity of dense annotations. To address this, we propose a self-prompting, point-supervised framework that adapts SAM to RSIs using only sparse point annotations. Our method employs a Refine-Requery-Reinforce loop, where coarse pseudo-masks are generated from initial points (Refine), improved with self-constructed box prompts (Requery), and embeddings are aligned across iterations to reduce confirmation bias (Reinforce). Without relying on full-mask supervision, our approach progressively enhances SAM's segmentation quality and domain robustness through self-guided prompt adaptation . We evaluate our proposed method on three RSI benchmark datasets, including WHU, HRSID, and NWPU VHR-10, showing that our method consistently surpasses pretrained SAM and recent point-supervised segmentation methods. Our results demonstrate that self-prompting and semantic alignment provide an efficient path towards scalable, point-level adaptation of foundation segmentation models for remote sensing applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GCNs for skeleton-based action recognition require large labeled datasets which are often scarce in practice, creating a need for more label-efficient approaches.

Method: 1) Novel adversarial acquisition function to select compact set of informative exemplars balancing representativeness, diversity, and uncertainty. 2) Bidirectional and stable GCN architectures for better mapping between ambient and latent spaces.

Result: Extensive evaluations on two challenging skeleton-based action recognition benchmarks show significant improvements over prior work.

Conclusion: The proposed label-efficient GCN model effectively addresses the data scarcity problem in skeleton-based action recognition through intelligent exemplar selection and enhanced network architectures.

Abstract: Despite the notable success of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) in skeleton-based action recognition, their performance often depends on large volumes of labeled data, which are frequently scarce in practical settings. To address this limitation, we propose a novel label-efficient GCN model. Our work makes two primary contributions. First, we develop a novel acquisition function that employs an adversarial strategy to identify a compact set of informative exemplars for labeling. This selection process balances representativeness, diversity, and uncertainty. Second, we introduce bidirectional and stable GCN architectures. These enhanced networks facilitate a more effective mapping between the ambient and latent data spaces, enabling a better understanding of the learned exemplar distribution. Extensive evaluations on two challenging skeleton-based action recognition benchmarks reveal significant improvements achieved by our label-efficient GCNs compared to prior work.

TL;DR: Qwen3-VL is a state-of-the-art vision-language model that supports 256K token interleaved contexts, with dense and MoE variants, achieving superior performance across multimodal benchmarks through enhanced architecture and improved text understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create the most capable vision-language model in the Qwen series that can handle complex multimodal tasks with superior performance across various benchmarks while supporting long-context comprehension and advanced reasoning.

Method: Enhanced interleaved-MRoPE for spatial-temporal modeling, DeepStack integration for multi-level ViT features, text-based time alignment for video, and offering both dense (2B-32B) and MoE (30B-235B) variants for different latency-quality trade-offs.

Result: Achieves superior performance across multimodal benchmarks including MMMU, MathVista, and MathVision, with stronger pure-text understanding, robust long-context comprehension, and advanced multimodal reasoning across single-image, multi-image, and video tasks.

Conclusion: Qwen3-VL serves as a foundational engine for image-grounded reasoning, agentic decision-making, and multimodal code intelligence in real-world workflows, delivering state-of-the-art performance under comparable token budgets and latency constraints.

Abstract: We introduce Qwen3-VL, the most capable vision-language model in the Qwen series to date, achieving superior performance across a broad range of multimodal benchmarks. It natively supports interleaved contexts of up to 256K tokens, seamlessly integrating text, images, and video. The model family includes both dense (2B/4B/8B/32B) and mixture-of-experts (30B-A3B/235B-A22B) variants to accommodate diverse latency-quality trade-offs. Qwen3-VL delivers three core pillars: (i) markedly stronger pure-text understanding, surpassing comparable text-only backbones in several cases; (ii) robust long-context comprehension with a native 256K-token window for both text and interleaved multimodal inputs, enabling faithful retention, retrieval, and cross-referencing across long documents and videos; and (iii) advanced multimodal reasoning across single-image, multi-image, and video tasks, demonstrating leading performance on comprehensive evaluations such as MMMU and visual-math benchmarks (e.g., MathVista and MathVision). Architecturally, we introduce three key upgrades: (i) an enhanced interleaved-MRoPE for stronger spatial-temporal modeling across images and video; (ii) DeepStack integration, which effectively leverages multi-level ViT features to tighten vision-language alignment; and (iii) text-based time alignment for video, evolving from T-RoPE to explicit textual timestamp alignment for more precise temporal grounding. Under comparable token budgets and latency constraints, Qwen3-VL achieves superior performance in both dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. We envision Qwen3-VL serving as a foundational engine for image-grounded reasoning, agentic decision-making, and multimodal code intelligence in real-world workflows.

Motivation: Address prediction errors in AI models on everyday devices where existing solutions lack efficient correction mechanisms, especially for resource-constrained environments.

Method: Combines server-side foundation model training with on-device prototype-based classification, using knowledge distillation for feature transfer and prototype updates for error correction instead of model retraining.

Result: Achieves over 50% error correction in one-shot scenarios on Food-101 and Flowers-102 datasets with minimal forgetting (<0.02%) and negligible computational overhead, validated through Android app demonstration.

Conclusion: The system provides practical and efficient AI error correction for resource-constrained devices through prototype-based few-shot learning, enabling real-world deployment with minimal computational requirements.

Abstract: The proliferation of AI models in everyday devices has highlighted a critical challenge: prediction errors that degrade user experience. While existing solutions focus on error detection, they rarely provide efficient correction mechanisms, especially for resource-constrained devices. We present a novel system enabling users to correct AI misclassifications through few-shot learning, requiring minimal computational resources and storage. Our approach combines server-side foundation model training with on-device prototype-based classification, enabling efficient error correction through prototype updates rather than model retraining. The system consists of two key components: (1) a server-side pipeline that leverages knowledge distillation to transfer robust feature representations from foundation models to device-compatible architectures, and (2) a device-side mechanism that enables ultra-efficient error correction through prototype adaptation. We demonstrate our system's effectiveness on both image classification and object detection tasks, achieving over 50% error correction in one-shot scenarios on Food-101 and Flowers-102 datasets while maintaining minimal forgetting (less than 0.02%) and negligible computational overhead. Our implementation, validated through an Android demonstration app, proves the system's practicality in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: CaFlow: A unified framework for long-term Action Quality Assessment that combines counterfactual de-confounding with bidirectional time-conditioned flow to improve robustness and temporal modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-term AQA is challenging due to extended temporal dynamics and contextual confounders. Existing methods rely on costly annotations or unidirectional temporal modeling, making them vulnerable to spurious correlations.

Method: Proposes CaFlow with two modules: Causal Counterfactual Regularization (CCR) for self-supervised disentanglement of causal/confounding features, and BiT-Flow for bidirectional temporal modeling with cycle-consistency constraints.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple long-term AQA benchmarks show state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: CaFlow effectively addresses long-term AQA challenges by integrating causal robustness and bidirectional temporal modeling, achieving superior performance on benchmarks.

Abstract: Action Quality Assessment (AQA) predicts fine-grained execution scores from action videos and is widely applied in sports, rehabilitation, and skill evaluation. Long-term AQA, as in figure skating or rhythmic gymnastics, is especially challenging since it requires modeling extended temporal dynamics while remaining robust to contextual confounders. Existing approaches either depend on costly annotations or rely on unidirectional temporal modeling, making them vulnerable to spurious correlations and unstable long-term representations. To this end, we propose CaFlow, a unified framework that integrates counterfactual de-confounding with bidirectional time-conditioned flow. The Causal Counterfactual Regularization (CCR) module disentangles causal and confounding features in a self-supervised manner and enforces causal robustness through counterfactual interventions, while the BiT-Flow module models forward and backward dynamics with a cycle-consistency constraint to produce smoother and more coherent representations. Extensive experiments on multiple long-term AQA benchmarks demonstrate that CaFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at https://github.com/Harrison21/CaFlow

TL;DR: Multi-Crit is a benchmark for evaluating multimodal models' ability to follow diverse, fine-grained evaluation criteria and produce reliable criterion-level judgments across open-ended generation and verifiable reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large multimodal models (LMMs) are increasingly used as judges in evaluation systems, but their capacity to follow diverse, fine-grained evaluation criteria remains underexplored, creating a need for systematic assessment.

Method: Developed Multi-Crit benchmark through rigorous data curation pipeline gathering challenging response pairs with multi-criterion human annotations, and introduced three novel metrics for assessing pluralistic adherence, criterion-switching flexibility, and preference conflict recognition.

Result: Analysis of 25 LMMs shows proprietary models struggle with consistent pluralistic adherence (especially in open-ended evaluation), open-source models lag further behind in flexible criterion following, and critic fine-tuning enhances visual grounding but doesn't generalize to pluralistic judgment.

Conclusion: Multi-Crit lays the foundation for building reliable and steerable multimodal AI evaluation by revealing current limitations and providing systematic assessment framework for criterion-level judgment capabilities.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) are increasingly adopted as judges in multimodal evaluation systems due to their strong instruction following and consistency with human preferences. However, their ability to follow diverse, fine-grained evaluation criteria remains underexplored. We develop Multi-Crit, a benchmark for evaluating multimodal judges on their capacity to follow pluralistic criteria and produce reliable criterion-level judgments. Covering both open-ended generation and verifiable reasoning tasks, Multi-Crit is built through a rigorous data curation pipeline that gathers challenging response pairs with multi-criterion human annotations. It further introduces three novel metrics for systematically assessing pluralistic adherence, criterion-switching flexibility, and the ability to recognize criterion-level preference conflicts. Comprehensive analysis of 25 LMMs reveals that 1) proprietary models still struggle to maintain consistent adherence to pluralistic criteria--especially in open-ended evaluation; 2) open-source models lag further behind in flexibly following diverse criteria; and 3) critic fine-tuning with holistic judgment signals enhances visual grounding but fails to generalize to pluralistic criterion-level judgment. Additional analyses on reasoning fine-tuning, test-time scaling, and boundary consistency between open-source and proprietary models further probe the limits of current multimodal judges. As a pioneering study, Multi-Crit lays the foundation for building reliable and steerable multimodal AI evaluation.

TL;DR: ADVLA is an efficient adversarial attack framework for Vision-Language-Action models that applies perturbations directly in feature space rather than pixel space, achieving high attack success with minimal visible changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial attack methods for VLA models require costly end-to-end training and generate noticeable perturbation patches, limiting their practical applicability.

Method: ADVLA applies adversarial perturbations on features projected from visual encoder to textual feature space, using attention guidance to make perturbations focused and sparse. It employs three strategies: enhancing sensitivity, enforcing sparsity, and concentrating perturbations.

Result: Under L∞=4/255 constraint, ADVLA with Top-K masking modifies <10% of patches while achieving ~100% attack success rate. Perturbations are concentrated on critical regions, nearly imperceptible, and take only ~0.06 seconds per iteration.

Conclusion: ADVLA effectively weakens VLA model action predictions under low-amplitude sparse conditions, avoiding high training costs and conspicuous perturbations of traditional attacks, demonstrating unique effectiveness for attacking VLA feature spaces.

Abstract: In recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in embodied intelligence have developed rapidly. However, existing adversarial attack methods require costly end-to-end training and often generate noticeable perturbation patches. To address these limitations, we propose ADVLA, a framework that directly applies adversarial perturbations on features projected from the visual encoder into the textual feature space. ADVLA efficiently disrupts downstream action predictions under low-amplitude constraints, and attention guidance allows the perturbations to be both focused and sparse. We introduce three strategies that enhance sensitivity, enforce sparsity, and concentrate perturbations. Experiments demonstrate that under an $L_{\infty}=4/255$ constraint, ADVLA combined with Top-K masking modifies less than 10% of the patches while achieving an attack success rate of nearly 100%. The perturbations are concentrated on critical regions, remain almost imperceptible in the overall image, and a single-step iteration takes only about 0.06 seconds, significantly outperforming conventional patch-based attacks. In summary, ADVLA effectively weakens downstream action predictions of VLA models under low-amplitude and locally sparse conditions, avoiding the high training costs and conspicuous perturbations of traditional patch attacks, and demonstrates unique effectiveness and practical value for attacking VLA feature spaces.

TL;DR: A hybrid deep learning model combining U-Net segmentation with DenseNet-VGG classification using multihead attention achieves 98% Dice coefficient for tumor segmentation and 99% accuracy for glioma classification in 3D MRI data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gliomas have high mortality rates, requiring early and accurate diagnosis for effective therapeutic intervention. Current methods need improvement in precise tumor demarcation and classification accuracy.

Method: Hybrid framework with U-Net segmentation for precise tumor demarcation in 3D MRI volumes, combined with DenseNet-VGG classification network featuring multihead attention and spatial-channel attention mechanisms. Preprocessing includes normalization, resampling, and data augmentation.

Result: Achieved 98% Dice coefficient for tumor segmentation and 99% classification accuracy, outperforming traditional CNN models and attention-free methods. Enhanced interpretability through attention mechanisms focusing on clinically relevant features.

Conclusion: The proposed framework shows great potential for timely and reliable glioma diagnosis and grading, enabling better patient treatment planning through improved accuracy and interpretability.

Abstract: Gliomas are brain tumor types that have a high mortality rate which means early and accurate diagnosis is important for therapeutic intervention for the tumors. To address this difficulty, the proposed research will develop a hybrid deep learning model which integrates U-Net based segmentation and a hybrid DenseNet-VGG classification network with multihead attention and spatial-channel attention capabilities. The segmentation model will precisely demarcate the tumors in a 3D volume of MRI data guided by spatial and contextual information. The classification network which combines a branch of both DenseNet and VGG, will incorporate the demarcated tumor on which features with attention mechanisms would be focused on clinically relevant features. High-dimensional 3D MRI data could successfully be utilized in the model through preprocessing steps which are normalization, resampling, and data augmentation. Through a variety of measures the framework is evaluated: measures of performance in segmentation are Dice coefficient and Mean Intersection over Union (IoU) and measures of performance in classification are accuracy precision, recall, and F1-score. The hybrid framework that has been proposed has demonstrated through physical testing that it has the capability of obtaining a Dice coefficient of 98% in tumor segmentation, and 99% on classification accuracy, outperforming traditional CNN models and attention-free methods. Utilizing multi-head attention mechanisms enhances notions of priority in aspects of the tumor that are clinically significant, and enhances interpretability and accuracy. The results suggest a great potential of the framework in facilitating the timely and reliable diagnosis and grading of glioma by clinicians is promising, allowing for better planning of patient treatment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Camera trajectories alone can reveal video content through contrastive learning, enabling cross-modal alignment with language and various downstream tasks without seeing pixels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether camera movement patterns alone can reveal video content, challenging the assumption that pixel-level visual information is necessary for video understanding.

Method: Proposed CamFormer - a contrastive learning framework that projects camera pose trajectories into joint embedding space aligned with natural language descriptions.

Result: Camera trajectories are surprisingly informative for uncovering video content, enabling tasks like cross-modal alignment, classification, and temporal analysis across different camera pose estimation methods.

Conclusion: Camera trajectory serves as a lightweight, robust, and versatile modality for video content perception, demonstrating that 'how you move' reveals 'what you are doing or observing'.

Abstract: Can one perceive a video's content without seeing its pixels, just from the camera trajectory-the path it carves through space? This paper is the first to systematically investigate this seemingly implausible question. Towards this end, we propose a contrastive learning framework to train CamFormer, a dedicated encoder that projects camera pose trajectories into a joint embedding space, aligning them with natural language. We find that, contrary to its apparent simplicity, the camera trajectory is a remarkably informative signal to uncover video content. In other words, "how you move" can indeed reveal "what you are doing" (egocentric) or "observing" (exocentric). We demonstrate the versatility of our learned CamFormer embeddings on a diverse suite of downstream tasks, ranging from cross-modal alignment to classification and temporal analysis. Importantly, our representations are robust across diverse camera pose estimation methods, including both high-fidelity multi-sensored and standard RGB-only estimators. Our findings establish camera trajectory as a lightweight, robust, and versatile modality for perceiving video content.

TL;DR: G²VLM is a geometry-grounded vision-language model that bridges 3D spatial reconstruction and spatial understanding by leveraging learned 3D visual geometry features to enhance spatial reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language Models lack robustness in spatial intelligence due to the absence of visual geometry learning processes capable of reconstructing 3D space from 2D images.

Method: G²VLM natively leverages learned 3D visual geometry features to directly predict 3D attributes and enhance spatial reasoning via in-context learning and interleaved reasoning. It trains on abundant multi-view image and video data while benefiting from 3D visual priors.

Result: G²VLM achieves comparable results to state-of-the-art feed-forward 3D reconstruction models and achieves better or competitive results across spatial understanding and reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: By unifying a semantically strong VLM with low-level 3D vision tasks, G²VLM serves as a strong baseline for the community and unlocks future applications like 3D scene editing.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) still lack robustness in spatial intelligence, demonstrating poor performance on spatial understanding and reasoning tasks. We attribute this gap to the absence of a visual geometry learning process capable of reconstructing 3D space from 2D images. We present G$^2$VLM, a geometry grounded vision-language model that bridges two fundamental aspects of spatial intelligence: spatial 3D reconstruction and spatial understanding. G$^2$VLM natively leverages learned 3D visual geometry features to directly predict 3D attributes and enhance spatial reasoning tasks via in-context learning and interleaved reasoning. Our unified design is highly scalable for spatial understanding: it trains on abundant multi-view image and video data, while simultaneously leveraging the benefits of 3D visual priors that are typically only derived from hard-to-collect annotations. Experimental results demonstrate G$^2$VLM is proficient in both tasks, achieving comparable results to state-of-the-art feed-forward 3D reconstruction models and achieving better or competitive results across spatial understanding and reasoning tasks. By unifying a semantically strong VLM with low-level 3D vision tasks, we hope G$^2$VLM can serve as a strong baseline for the community and unlock more future applications, such as 3D scene editing.

TL;DR: Canvas-to-Image is a unified framework that integrates multiple heterogeneous controls (text, subject references, spatial arrangements, pose constraints, layout annotations) into a single canvas interface for high-fidelity compositional image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern diffusion models struggle with high-fidelity compositional and multimodal control when users simultaneously specify multiple constraints like text prompts, subject references, spatial arrangements, pose constraints, and layout annotations.

Method: Encode diverse control signals into a single composite canvas image that the model can directly interpret, using Multi-Task Canvas Training strategy with curated multi-task datasets to jointly understand and integrate heterogeneous controls within a unified learning paradigm.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity preservation and control adherence across challenging benchmarks including multi-person composition, pose-controlled composition, layout-constrained generation, and multi-control generation.

Conclusion: Canvas-to-Image enables unified visual-spatial reasoning across multiple control modalities, generalizes well to multi-control scenarios, and achieves superior performance in compositional image generation compared to existing methods.

Abstract: While modern diffusion models excel at generating high-quality and diverse images, they still struggle with high-fidelity compositional and multimodal control, particularly when users simultaneously specify text prompts, subject references, spatial arrangements, pose constraints, and layout annotations. We introduce Canvas-to-Image, a unified framework that consolidates these heterogeneous controls into a single canvas interface, enabling users to generate images that faithfully reflect their intent. Our key idea is to encode diverse control signals into a single composite canvas image that the model can directly interpret for integrated visual-spatial reasoning. We further curate a suite of multi-task datasets and propose a Multi-Task Canvas Training strategy that optimizes the diffusion model to jointly understand and integrate heterogeneous controls into text-to-image generation within a unified learning paradigm. This joint training enables Canvas-to-Image to reason across multiple control modalities rather than relying on task-specific heuristics, and it generalizes well to multi-control scenarios during inference. Extensive experiments show that Canvas-to-Image significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity preservation and control adherence across challenging benchmarks, including multi-person composition, pose-controlled composition, layout-constrained generation, and multi-control generation.
