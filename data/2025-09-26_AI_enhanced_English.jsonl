This mainly relies on two\ntechnical contributions: First, we introduce Dual-Smoothed Fine-Grained\nQuantization, which integrates pre-global Hadamard rotation and post-local\nchannel smoothing to mitigate heavy-tailed distributions and inter-channel\nvariance robustly. Second, we design Noise-Filtered Diverse Sampling, which\nfilters outliers via deep-layer statistics and constructs frame-aware diverse\ncalibration clusters to ensure stable quantization ranges. Comprehensive\nexperiments demonstrate that QuantVGGT achieves the state-of-the-art results\nacross different benchmarks and bit-width, surpassing the previous\nstate-of-the-art generic quantization method with a great margin. We highlight\nthat our 4-bit QuantVGGT can deliver a 3.7$\\times$ memory reduction and\n2.5$\\times$ acceleration in real-hardware inference, while maintaining\nreconstruction accuracy above 98\\% of its full-precision counterpart. This\ndemonstrates the vast advantages and practicality of QuantVGGT in\nresource-constrained scenarios.

Despite recent advances,\nstate-of-the-art models often produce unrealistic motions, such as objects\nfalling upward, or abrupt changes in velocity and direction. Moreover, these\nmodels lack precise parameter control, struggling to generate physically\nconsistent dynamics under different initial conditions.
